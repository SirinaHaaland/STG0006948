  the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments  
 we 're obsessed with morality as social creatures  we need to know why people are doing what they 're doing  
 and i personally am obsessed with
  morality it was all due to this woman sister mary marastela also known as my mom 
 as an altar boy i breathed in a lot of incense  and i learned to say phrases in latin  
 but i also had time to think about whether my mother 's top down morality applied to everybody  
 i saw that people who were religious and non religious were equally obsessed with morality i thought
 maybe there 's some earthly basis for moral decisions  
 but i wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral  
 i want to know if there 's a chemistry of morality i want to know if there was a moral molecule  
 after ten years of experiments i found it
  would you like to see it i brought
  this little syringe contains the moral molecule it
 's called oxytocin  
 so oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in mammals in rodents  it was known to
  make mothers care for their offspring  and in some creatures allowed for toleration of burrowmates  
 but in humans it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women and is released by both sexes during sex  
 so i had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule  i did what most of us do i tried it on some colleagues
 one of them told me paul that is the world 's stupidist idea
  but i countered well men 's brains make this too there must be a reason why 
 but he was right  it was a stupid idea 
 but it was testably stupid in other words i thought i could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral 
 turns out it wasn 't so easy first of all oxytocin is a shy
  baseline levels are near zero without some stimulus to cause its release and when it 's produced it has a 
 and degrades rapidly at room temperature  so this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin have to grab it fast and keep it cold i think i can do that 
 now luckily oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood  so i could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery
  then i had to measure morality  so taking on morality with a capital m is a huge project  so i started smaller
 i studied one single virtue 
 trustworthiness  
 why 
 i had shown in the early 2000s that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous  
 so in these countries more economic transactions occur
 and more wealth is created alleviating poverty  so poor countries
  are by and large low trust countries  
 so if i understood the chemistry of trustworthiness  i might help alleviate poverty but i 'm also a skeptic  i don 't want to just ask people are you trustworthy 
 so instead i use the jerry maguire approach to research if you 're so virtuous show me the money  
 so what we do in my lab is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money  let me show you how we do that
 we recruit some people for an experiment 
 they all get $ ten if they agree to show up we give them lots of instruction and we never ever deceive them then we match them in pairs by computer and
 in that pair one person gets a message saying do you want to give up some of your $ ten you earned for being here
 and ship it to someone else in the lab the trick is you can 't see them you can 't talk to them  you only do it one time
  now whatever you give up gets tripled in the other person 's account you 're going to make them a lot wealthier  and they get a message by computer saying
 person one sent you this amount of money do you want to keep it all or do you want to send some amount back
 so think about this experiment for minute you 're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle and take four tubes of blood
  and now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger  so this was the birth of vampire economics make a decision and give me some blood  
 so in fact experimental economists had run this test around the world and for much higher stakes 
 and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust
  and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness  
 but in fact economists were flummoxed on why the second person would ever return any money they assumed money is good  why not keep it all 
 that 's not what we found we found ninety percent of the first decision makers sent money and of those who received money ninety five percent returned some of it  
 but why  well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received
  more their brain produced oxytocin and the more oxytocin on board  the more money they returned  
 so we have a biology of trustworthiness  but wait what 's wrong with this experiment 
 two things  one is that nothing in the body happens in isolation  so we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin
  have any effect but the second is
 that i still only had this indirect relationship between oxytocin and trustworthiness  i didn 't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness  
 so to make the experiment i knew i 'd have to go into the brain and manipulate oxytocin directly  
 i used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain and i found i could do it
 with a nasal inhaler  
 so along with colleagues in zurich  we put two hundred men on oxytocin or placebo had that same trust test with money and
 we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger
 all without altering mood or cognition  
 so oxytocin is the trust molecule  but is it the moral molecule 
 using the oxytocin inhaler  we ran
  more studies  we showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by eighty percent 
 we showed it increases donations to charity by fifty percent we
 've also investigated non pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin  these include massage  dancing
  my mom was happy about that last one 
 and whenever we raise oxytocin people willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers  
 but why do they do this what does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin 
 to investigate this question we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four  year old son and his son has terminal brain cancer
  after they watched the video we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin  
 the change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy 
 so it 's empathy that makes us connect to other people it 's empathy that makes us help other people it 's empathy
 that makes us moral now this idea is not new 
  the theory of moral sentiments in this book smith argued that we are moral creatures not because of a top down reason but for a bottom up reason 
 he said we 're social creatures so we share the emotions of others  
 so if i do something that hurts you i feel that pain  so i tend to avoid that if i do something that makes you happy i get to share
  so i tend to do those things  
 now this is the same adam smith who seventeen years later would write a little book called the wealth of nations the founding document of economics  
 but he was in fact a moral philosopher  
 and he was right on why we 're moral  i just found the molecule behind it  
 but knowing that molecule is valuable  because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off 
 in particular it tells us why we see immorality
 to investigate immorality let me bring you back now to one thousand nine hundred and eighty  
 i 'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of santa barbara california  
 you sit in a gas station all day you see lots of morality and immorality let me tell you 
 so one sunday afternoon a man walks into my cashier 's booth with this beautiful jewelry box  opens
  in the men 's room i just found this what do you think we should do with it i don 't know
 put it in the lost and found well this is very valuable  we have to find the owner for this i said yea 
 so we 're trying to decide what to do with this and the phone rings and a man says very excitedly 
 i was in your gas station a while ago and i bought this jewelry for my wife and i can 't find it
  an hour i 'll be there and i 'll give him a $ two hundred reward great so i tell the guy look  relax get yourself a fat reward life 's good he said i
 can 't do it i have this job interview in galena in fifteen minutes  and i need this job i 've got to go 
 again he asked me what do you think we should do i 'm in high school  i have no idea
  the jewelry you give me a hundred dollars and when the guy comes you see it  i was conned so
 this is a classic con called the pigeon drop  and i was the pigeon 
 so the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him it 's that he shows he trusts the victim now we know what
  the victim 's brain releases oxytocin and you 're opening up your wallet or purse giving away the money
 so who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems  
 we found testing thousands of individuals that five percent of the population don 't release oxytocin on stimulus  
 so if you trust them their brains don 't release oxytocin if there 's money on the table they keep it all  
 so there 's a technical word for these people in my lab we call them
 bastards
 these are not people you want to have a beer with they have many of the attributes of psychopaths
  now there are other ways the system can be inhibited one is through
 improper nurturing  so we 've studied sexually abused women  and about half those don 't release oxytocin on stimulus
  you need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly 
 also high stress
  inhibits oxytocin  so we all know this when we 're really stressed out we 're not acting our best there 's another way oxytocin is inhibited which is interesting
 through the action of testosterone  
 so we in experiments have administered testosterone to men and instead of sharing money they become selfish  
  high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish 
 now think about this it means within our own biology we have the yin and yang of morality  
 we have oxytocin that connects us to others makes us feel what they feel
 and we have testosterone and men have ten times the testosterone as women so men do this more than women we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally
 we don 't need god or government telling us what to do it 's all inside of us  
 so you may be wondering these are beautiful laboratory experiments do they really apply to real life yeah i 've been worrying about that too  
 so i 've gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives so last summer i attended a wedding in southern england  
 two hundred people in this beautiful victorian mansion  i didn 't know a single person
  and i drove up in my rented vauxhall  and i took out a centrifuge and dry ice and needles and tubes  and i took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows and
 guess what weddings cause a release of oxytocin  but they do so in a very particular way 
 who is the center of the wedding solar system the bride
  the biggest increase in oxytocin  who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride  her mother that 's right her mother was number two 
 then the groom 's father then the groom then the family then the friends arrayed around the bride like planets around the sun  
 so i think it tells us that we 've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple 
 connect us emotionally why
 because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species i
 also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn 't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers  
 so even though i have a fear of heights i recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at twelve thousand ft  
 i took my blood before and after  and i had a huge spike of oxytocin
 there are so many ways we can connect to people 
 for example through social media many people are tweeting right now  
 so we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double digit increase in oxytocin  
 so i ran this experiment recently for the korean broadcasting system  and they had the reporters and their producers participate  
  had one hundred and fifty percent spike in oxytocin  i mean astounding no one has this 
 so he was using social media in private  when i wrote my report to the koreans i said look  i don 't know what this guy was doing but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend 
 they checked he was interacting on his girlfriend 's facebook page 
 there you go that 's connection so there 's tons of ways that we can connect to other people and it seems to be universal two weeks ago
 just got back from papua new guinea where i went up to the highlands
 very isolated tribes of of
 subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia there are eight hundred different languages in the highlands 
 these are the most primitive people in the world  and they indeed also release oxytocin
 so oxytocin connects us to other people oxytocin makes us feel
  feel  and it 's so easy to cause people 's brains to release oxytocin  
 i know how to do it and my favorite way to do it is in fact the easiest let me show it to you
  so my penchant for hugging other people has earned me the nickname dr love  
 i 'm happy to share a little more love in the world it 's great  but here 's your prescription from dr love  eight hugs a day  
 we have found that people who release more oxytocin are happier and
  because they have better relationships of all types
 dr love says eight hugs a day  
 eight hugs a day you 'll be happier and the world will be a better place of course if you don 't like to touch people i can always shove this up your nose
