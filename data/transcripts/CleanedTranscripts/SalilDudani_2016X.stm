  one summer afternoon in two thousand and thirteen dc police detained questioned and searched a man who appeared suspicious and potentially dangerous 
 this wasn 't what i was wearing the day of the detention to be fair but i have a picture of that as well  i know it 's very frightening try to remain calm
 at this time i was interning at the public defender service in washington dc and i was visiting a police station for work  i was on my way out  and before i could make it to my car two police cars pulled up to block my exit and an officer approached me from behind  
 he told me to stop take my backpack off and put my hands on the police car parked next to us about a dozen officers then gathered near us
 all of them had handguns some had assault rifles they rifled through my backpack they patted me down they took pictures of me spread on the police car  and they laughed  
 and as all this was happening
 as i was on the police car trying to ignore the shaking in my legs trying to think clearly about what i should do something stuck out to me as odd when i look at myself
  but they weren 't including any of these details into their police radios as they described me they kept saying middle eastern male with a backpack  middle eastern male with a backpack 
 and this description carried on into their police reports  
 i never expected to be
  and the detention dragged on like this they sent dogs trained to smell explosives to sweep the area i 'd been in they called the federal government to see if i was on any watch lists they sent a couple of 
  detectives to cross examine me on why if i claimed i had nothing to hide  i wouldn 't consent to a search of my car
  and i could see they weren 't happy with me but i felt i had no way of knowing what they 'd want to do next at one point the officer who patted me down scanned the side of the police station to see where the security camera was to see how much of this was being recorded  
 and when he did that it really sank in how completely i was at their mercy  
 i think we 're all normalized from a young age to the idea of police officers and arrests and
  so it 's easy to forget how demeaning and coercive a thing it is to seize control over another person 's body i know it sounds like the point of my story is how badly treated 
  i was because of my race and yes i don 't think i would 've been detained if i were white but actually what i have in mind today is something else what i have in mind is how much worse things might 've been if i weren 't affluent 
 was never taken to a jail cell  
 i think if i were from one of washington dc 's poor communities of color and they thought i was endangering officers ' lives  things might 've ended differently and in fact in our system i think it 's better 
  to be an affluent person suspected of trying to blow up a police station than it is to be a poor person who 's suspected of much much less than
  i want to give you an example from my current work  right now i 'm working at a civil rights organization in dc called equal justice under law  let me start by
 asking you all a question how many of you have ever gotten a parking ticket in your life  raise your hand 
 yeah so have  i and when i had to pay it it felt annoying and it felt bad but i paid it and i moved on i 'm guessing most of you have paid your tickets
  you couldn 't afford the amount on the ticket
 and your family doesn 't have the money either what happens then well 
 one thing that 's not supposed to happen under the law is you 're not supposed to be arrested and jailed simply because you can 't afford to pay that 's illegal under federal law  but that 's what local governments across the country are doing to people who are poor 
 and so many of our lawsuits at equal justice under law
  one of our cases is against ferguson missouri  and i know when i say ferguson many of you will think of police violence but today i want to talk about a different aspect of the relationship between their police force and their citizens 
 ferguson was issuing an average of over two arrest warrants  per person per year mostly for unpaid debt to the courts 
 when i imagine what that would feel like if every time i left my house there was a chance a police
  officer would run my license plate see a warrant for unpaid debt seize my body they way the did in dc and then take me to a jail cell  
 i feel a little sick 
 i 've met many of the people in ferguson who have experienced this and i 've heard some of their stories 
 in ferguson 's jail in each small cell there 's a bunk bed and a toilet
  but they 'd pack four people into each cell so there 'd be two people on the bunks and two people on the floor  one with nowhere to go except right next to the filthy toilet which was never cleaned in fact the 
  whole cell was never cleaned so the floor and the walls were lined with blood and mucus 
  woman about medical attention she laughed and she said oh no no the only attention you get from the guards in there is sexual 
 so they 'd take the debtors to this place and they 'd say we 're not letting you leave until you make a payment on your debt 
 and if you could if you could call a family member who could somehow come up with some money then maybe you were out
  was enough money you were out  
 but if it wasn 't you 'd stay there for days or weeks and every day the guards would come down to the cells and haggle with the debtors about the price of release that day
 you 'd stay until at some point the jail would be booked to capacity and they 'd want to book someone new in and at that point they 'd think ok it 's unlikely this person can come up with the money it 's more 
  likely this new person will you 're out they 're in and the machine kept moving like that 
  nine years ago was arrested for panhandling in a walgreens he couldn 't afford his fines and his court fees from that case  
 when he was young he survived a house fire only because he jumped out of the third story window to escape but that fall left him with damage to his brain and several parts of this body including his leg so he can 't work  and he relies
  on social security payments to survive 
 when i met him in his apartment he had nothing of value there not even food in his fridge he 's chronically hungry he had nothing of value in his apartment except a small piece of cardboard on which he 'd written 
 the names of his children he cherished this a lot he was happy to show it to me but he can 't pay his fines and fees because he has nothing to give
 forty five days just imagine spending from right now until sometime in june in the place that i described to you a few moments ago  
 he told me about all the suicide attempts he 's seen in ferguson 's jail 
 about the time a man found a way to hang himself out of reach of the other inmates  so all they could do was yell and yell and yell 
 trying to get the guards ' attention so they could come down and cut him down
 and he told me that it took the guards over five minutes to respond  and when they came the man was unconscious  so they called the paramedics and the paramedics went to the cell  they said he 'll be ok so they just left him there on the floor  
 i heard many stories like this and they shouldn 't have surprised me because suicide is the single leading cause of death in our local jails 
 this is related to the lack of mental health care in our jails  i met a woman single
  mother of three making seven dollars an hour she relies on food stamps to feed herself and her children
 about a decade ago she got a couple of traffic tickets and a minor theft charge  and she can 't afford her fines and fees on those cases
 since then she 's been jailed about ten times on those cases but she has schizophrenia and bipolar
  and she needs medication every day 
 she doesn 't have access to those medications in ferguson 's jail because no one has access to their medications she told me about what it was like to spend two weeks in a cage 
 hallucinating people and shadows and hearing voices  begging for the medication that would make it all stop only to be ignored  
 and this isn 't anomalous either  thirty percent of women in our local jails have serious mental health needs just like hers  but only one in six receives any mental health care while
  in jail  
 and so  i heard all these stories about this grotesque dungeon that ferguson was operating for its debtors  and when it came time for me to actually see it and to go visit ferguson 
  's jail  i 'm not sure what i was expecting to see but i wasn 't expecting this it
  it reminded me that
 these illegal extortion schemes aren 't being run somewhere in the shadows they 're being run out in the open by our public officials they 're a matter of public policy  
 and this reminded me that poverty jailing in general even outside the debtors ' prison context plays a very visible and central role in our justice system  
 what i have in mind is our policy of bail in our system whether you 're detained or free  pending trial is not a matter of how dangerous you are or how much of a flight risk you pose
  's a matter of whether you can afford to post your bail amount  so bill cosby whose bail was set at a million dollars  immediately writes the check and doesn 't spend a second in a jail cell but sandra bland who died 
  in jail was only there because her family was unable to come up with five hundred dollars in fact there are half a million sandra blands across the country five hundred thousand people who are in jail right now only because they can 't afford their bail amount we
  places for criminals  but statistically that 's not the case three out of every five people in jail right now are there pretrial  they haven 't been convicted of any crime they haven 't pled guilty to any offense 
 right here in san francisco eighty five percent
 of the inmates in our jail in san francisco are pretrial detainees this means san francisco is spending something like eighty million dollars every year to fund pretrial
 detention
 many of these people who are in jail only because they can 't post bail
 are facing allegations so minor that the amount of time it would take for them to sit waiting for trial is longer than the sentence they would receive if convicted which means they 're guaranteed to get out faster if they just plead guilty 
  so now the choice is should i stay here in this horrible place 
 away from my family and my dependents  almost guaranteed to lose my job 
 and then fight the charges or should i just plead guilty to whatever the prosecutor wants and get out and at this point they 're pretrial detainees not criminals  but once they take that plea deal we 'll call them criminals even 
  though an affluent person would never have been in this situation because an affluent person would have simply been bailed out 
  in actuality i find
 talking about jailing much less depressing than the alternative because i think if we don 't talk about these issues and collectively change how we think about jailing at the end of all of our lives we 'll still have jails full of poor people who don 't belong there that really is depressing to me  
  to me is the thought that these stories can move us to think about jailing in different terms not in sterile policy terms like mass incarceration or sentencing of nonviolent offenders 
 but in human terms  when we put a human being in a cage for days or weeks or months or even years 
  under what conditions are we really willing to do that 
 and so if starting with a few hundred of us in this room we can commit to thinking about jailing in this different light then we can undo that normalization i was referring to earlier
 if i leave you with anything today i hope it 's with the thought that if we want anything to fundamentally change not just to reform our policies on bail and fines and fees but also to make sure 
  that whatever new policies replace those don 't punish the poor and the marginalized in their own new way if we want that kind of change then this shift in thinking is required of each of us  thank you
