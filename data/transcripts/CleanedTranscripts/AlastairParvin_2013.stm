  what we usually mean is a professional  
 someone who gets paid  
 and we tend to assume that it 's those professionals who are going to be the ones to help us solve the really big systemic design challenges that we face like climate change
  urbanization and social inequality 
 that 's our kind of working presumption  and i think it 's wrong  actually  
 in two thousand and eight i was just about to graduate from architecture school after several years  and go out and get a job  and
 this happened the economy ran out of jobs  and a couple of things struck me about this one don 't listen to career advisers
 and two actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture 
 which is that as a society we 've never needed design thinking more and yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed 
 it strikes me that we talk very deeply about design but actually there 's an economics behind architecture that we don 't talk about and i think we need to 
 and a good place to start is your own paycheck
  so as a bottom of the rung architecture graduate i might expect to earn about twenty four thousand pounds that 's about thirty six thousand thirty seven thousand dollars 
 now in terms of the whole world 's population that already puts me in the top one point nine five richest people  
 which raises the question of who is it i 'm working for 
 the uncomfortable fact is that actually almost everything that we call architecture
 today
 is actually the business of designing for about the richest one percent of the world 's population  and it always has been 
 the reason why we forgot that is because the times in history when architecture did the most to transform society were those times when 
 actually the one percent would build on behalf of the ninety nine percent for various different reasons whether that was through philanthropy in the
 the welfare state  and most recently of course  through this inflated real estate bubble 
 and all of those booms in their own various ways have now kicked the bucket  and we 're back in this situation
 where
 the smartest designers and architects in the world are only
  really able to work for one percent of the population 
 now it 's not just that that 's bad for democracy though i think it probably is it 's actually not a very clever business strategy actually 
 i think the challenge facing the next generation of architects is how are we going to turn our client from the one percent
 to the one hundred percent  
 and i want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas for how it might be done  
 the first is i think we need to question this idea that architecture is about making buildings
  actually a building is about the most expensive solution you can think of to almost any given problem  
 and fundamentally design should be much much more interested in solving problems and creating new conditions so here 's a story  the office was working with a school and they had an old victorian school building  
 and
 they said to the architects look our corridors are an absolute nightmare they 're far too small they get congested between classes there 's bullying
  't control them  so what we want you to do is re plan our entire building and we know it 's going to cost several million pounds but we 're reconciled to the fact 
 and the team thought about this and they went away and they said actually  don 't do that instead get rid of the school bell 
 and instead of having one school bell that goes off once have several smaller school bells that go off in different places and different times distribute the traffic through the corridors
  solves the same problem  but instead of spending several million pounds  you spend several hundred pounds  
 now it looks like you 're doing yourself out of a job but you 're not you 're actually making yourself more useful architects are actually really really good at this kind of resourceful strategic thinking
  and the problem is that like a lot of design professions we got fixated on the idea of providing a particular kind of consumer product  and i don 't think that needs to be the case anymore
  the second idea worth questioning is this 20th century thing
 that mass architecture is about big big buildings and big finance 
 actually we 've got ourselves locked into this industrial era mindset which says that
 the only people who can make cities are large organizations or corporations who build on our behalf procuring whole neighborhoods in single  monolithic projects and of course
  form follows finance  so what you end up with are single monolithic neighborhoods based on this kind of 
  model  and a lot of people can 't even afford them  
 but what if actually it 's possible now for cities to be made not just by the few with a lot but also by the many with a bit  
 and when they do they bring with them a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live
  and it raises really interesting questions about how will we plan cities how will finance development how will we sell design services what would it mean for democratic societies to offer their citizens a right to build 
 and in a way it should be kind of obvious right that
 in the 21st century maybe cities can be developed by citizens 
 and thirdly we need to remember that from a strictly economic point of view
 design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly
 mostly it 's done by amateurs  
 and that 's a good thing 
 most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy in what 's called the social economy or the core economy which is people doing it for themselves  
 and
 the problem is that up until now it was the monetary economy which had all the infrastructure and all the tools
  so the challenge we face is how are we going to build the tools the infrastructure and the institutions for architecture 's social economy  and that began with open source software  
 and over the last few years it 's been moving into the physical world with open source hardware which are freely shared blueprints that anyone can download and make for themselves  
 and that 's where 3d printing gets really really interesting right when suddenly you had
 a 3d printer that was open source the parts for which could be made on another 3d printer 
 or the same idea here which is for a cnc machine which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood 
 what these technologies are doing is radically lowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill  they 're challenging the idea that if you want something to be affordable it 's got to be
  distributing massively really complex manufacturing capabilities 
 we 're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere  and increasingly that means that the design team is everyone 
 that really is an industrial revolution and when we think that the major ideological conflicts that we inherited were all
 based around this question of who should control the means of production and these technologies are coming back with a solution  actually  maybe no one all of us  
 and we were fascinated by what that might mean for architecture 
 so about a year and a half ago  we started working on a project called wikihouse and wikihouse is an open source construction system 
 and the idea is to make it possible for anyone to go
  access a freely shared library of 3d models
 which they can download and adapt in at the moment sketchup because it 's free and it 's easy to use  and almost at the click of a switch
 they can generate a set of cutting files
 which allow them in effect to print out the parts from a house using a cnc machine and a standard sheet material like plywood  and
 the parts are all numbered  and basically what you end up with is a really big ikea kit
 and it goes together without any bolts  it uses wedge and peg connections  and even the mallets to make it can be provided on the cutting sheets as well  
 and a team of about two or three people working together can build this they don 't need any traditional construction skills 
 they don 't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that and they can build a small house of about this size
 in about a day 
 and what you end up with is just the basic 
  chassis of a house onto which you can then apply systems like windows and cladding and insulation and services based on what 's cheap and what 's available 
  our heads here so the house is not a finished product with the cnc machine you can make new parts for it over its life or even use it to make the house next door so we can begin to see the seed of a completely 
  citizen led urban development model potentially  and we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now
  some really interesting lessons here  one of them is that it 's always incredibly sociable people get confused between construction work and having fun
 but the principles of openness go right down into the really mundane physical details 
 like never designing a piece that can 't be lifted up or when you 're designing a piece make sure you either can 't put it in the wrong way round or if you do it doesn 't matter because it 's symmetrical 
 probably the principal which
 runs deepest with us
 is the
  principal set out by linus torvalds the open source pioneer  
 which was that idea of be lazy like a fox don 't reinvent the wheel every time take what already works and adapt it for your own needs  
 contrary to almost everything that you might get taught at an architecture school copying is good 
  which is appropriate  
 because actually this approach is not innovative it 's actually how we built buildings for hundreds of years before the industrial revolution in these sorts of community barn raisings the only difference between traditional vernacular architecture and open source architecture
 might be a web connection  but it 's a really really big difference 
 we shared the whole of wikihouse under a creative commons license and now what 's just beginning to happen is that groups around the world are beginning to take it and use it and hack it and tinker with it and it 's amazing there 's a
 cool group over in christchurch in new zealand looking at post earthquake development housing  and thanks to the ted
 city prize we 're working with an awesome group in one of rio 's favelas to set up a
 kind of community factory and and micro university these are very very small beginnings  and
 actually there 's more people in the last week who have got in touch and they 're not even on this map i hope next time you see it you
  we 're aware that wikihouse is a very very small answer 
 but it 's a small answer to a really really big question which is that globally right now the fastest growing cities
 are not skyscraper cities they 're self made cities
 in one form or another if
  these are the guys who are going to be making it you know like it or not welcome to the world 's biggest design team 
 so if we 're serious about problems like climate change urbanization and health  
 actually  our existing development models aren 't going to do it
  as i think robert neuwirth said there isn 't a bank or a corporation or a government or an ngo who 's going to be able to do it if we treat citizens only as consumers
  how extraordinary would it be though if collectively
 we were to develop solutions not just to the problem of structure that we 've been working on but to infrastructure problems like
  by everyone and they 're accessible by everyone a kind of
 wikipedia for stuff  
 and once something 's in the commons it will always be there how much would that change the rules  and i think the technology 's on our side
