  your general intelligence  but what 's your psy q how much do you know about what makes you tick and how good are you at predicting other people 's behavior or even your own  
 and how much of what you think you know about psychology is wrong  let 's find out by counting down the top ten myths of
  psychology 
 you 've probably heard it said that when it comes to their psychology it 's almost as if men are from mars and women are from venus  but how different are men and women really
 to find out let 's start by looking at something on which men and women really do differ and plotting some psychological gender differences on the same scale
 one thing men and women do really differ on is how far they can throw
  so if we look at the data for men here we see what is called a normal distribution curve a few men can throw a ball really far and a few men not far at all but most a kind of average distance and women share the 
  same distribution as well  but actually there 's quite a big difference in fact the average man can throw a ball further than about ninety eight percent of all women 
 and it 's true  but let 's have a look at the size of this difference it
 's tiny the lines are so close together they almost overlap in fact  the average woman is better than thirty three percent of all men and of course if that was fifty percent then the two genders would be exactly equal
 it 's worth bearing in mind that this difference and the next one i 'll show you are pretty much the biggest
 psychological gender differences ever discovered in psychology  so here 's the next one any psychologist will tell you that women are better with language and grammar than men so here 's performance on the standardized grammar 
  test there go the women there go the men again  yes women are better on average but the lines are so close that thirty three percent of men are better than the average woman  and again if it was fifty percent  that would represent complete
  case of mars and venus it 's more a case of if anything mars and snickers basically the same but
 one 's maybe slightly nuttier than the other 
 i won 't say which
 now we 've got you warmed up let 's psychoanalyze you using the famous rorschach inkblot test so you can probably see two i dunno two bears or two people or something but what do you think they 're doing put your hand up if you think they 're saying hello 
  that means you 're a friendly person  if you think they 're fighting you 're a bit more of a nasty aggressive person are you a lover or a fighter basically
 what about this one this isn 't really a voting one so on three everyone shout out what you see one two three 
 i heard hamster who said hamster that was very worrying a guy there said
  hamster   well you should see
 some kind of two legged animal here and then the mirror
 image of them there if you didn 't then this means that you
 have difficulty processing complex situations where there 's a lot going on  
 except of course  it doesn 't mean that at all rorschach inkblot tests have basically no validity when it comes to diagnosing people 's
  are not used by modern day psychologists 
 in fact one recent study found that when you do try to diagnose people 's personalities using rorschach inkblot tests schizophrenia was diagnosed in about one sixth of apparently perfectly normal participants  
 so if you didn 't do that well on this maybe you are not a very visual type of person  so let 's do another quick quiz to find out 
 when making a cake do you prefer to so hands up for each one again do you prefer to use a recipe book with pictures
  yeah a few people have a friend talk you through 
 or have a go making it up as you go along 
 quite a few people there okay so if you said a then this means that you are a visual learner and you learn best when information is presented in a visual style 
 if you said b it means you 're an auditory learner that you learn best when information
 presented to you in an auditory format  and if you said c it means that you 're a kinesthetic learner  that you learn best when you get stuck in and do things with your hands  except of course as you 've probably guessed 
 that it doesn 't because the whole thing is a complete myth learning styles are made up and are not supported by scientific evidence 
  it makes no difference at all to the amount of information that they retain  
 and if you think about it for just a second  it 's just obvious that this has to be true  it 's obvious that the best presentation format depends not on you but on what you 're trying to learn 
 could you learn to drive a car for example just by listening to someone telling you what to do with no kinesthetic experience 
  no  what you need to do is match the material to be learned to the presentation format not you
 i know many of you are a level students that will have recently gotten your gcse results  and if you didn 't quite get what you were hoping for then you can 't really blame your learning style  but one thing that you might want to think about blaming is your genes  
 so what this is all about is a recent study at university college london found that
  of the variation between different
 students and their gcse results was down to genetic factors that sounds like a very precise figure so how can we tell 
 well when we want to unpack the relative contributions of genes and the environment  what we can do is do a twin study so identical twins share one hundred percent of their environment and one hundred percent of their genes  
 whereas non identical twins share one hundred percent
  of their environment  but just like any brother and sister share only fifty percent of their genes  so by comparing how similar gcse results are in identical twins versus non identical twins 
 and doing some clever math we can an idea of how much variation and performance is due to the environment and how much is due to genes and it turns out that it 's about fifty eight percent
  this isn 't to undermine the hard work that you and your teachers here put in if you didn 't quite get the gcse results that you were hoping for then you can always try blaming your parents or at least their genes  
 one thing that you shouldn 't blame is being a 
 learner because again this is a myth  so the myth here is that the left brain is logical it 's good with equations like this and the right brain is more creative so the right brain is better at music but again this is a myth because
  nearly everything that you do involves nearly all parts of your brain talking together even just the most mundane thing like having a normal conversation  
 however  perhaps one reason why this myth has survived is that there is a slight grain of truth to it so a related version of the myth is that left handed people are more creative than right handed people which kind of makes sense because your brain
  controls the opposite hands so left handed people the right side of the brain is slightly more active than the left hand side of the brain and the idea is the right hand side is more creative  
 now it isn 't true per se that left handed people are more creative than right handed people  what is true that ambidextrous people or people who use both hands for different tasks are more creative thinkers than
 one handed people  because being ambidextrous involves having both sides of the brain talk to each other a lot which seems to be involved in
  flexible thinking  the myth of the creative  left hander arises from the fact that being ambidextrous is more common amongst
 so a grain of truth in the idea of the creative left hander but not much 
 a related myth that you 've probably heard of is that we only use ten percent of our brains  this is again a complete myth nearly everything that we do even the most mundane thing uses nearly all of our brains
  that said it is of course true that most of us don 't use our brainpower
 quite as well as we could  
 so what could we do to boost our brainpower maybe we could listen to a nice bit of mozart have you heard of the idea of the mozart effect  so the idea is that listening to mozart makes you smarter and improves your performance on i q 
  interesting about this myth is that although it 's basically a myth there is a grain of truth to it  
 so the original study found that participants who were played mozart music for a few minutes did better on a subsequent  i q test than participants who simply sat in silence  
 but a follow up study
 recruited some people who liked mozart music and then another group of people who were fans of the horror stories of stephen king 
 and they played the people the music or the stories the people who preferred mozart
  music to the stories got a bigger i q boost from the mozart than the stories  but the people who preferred the stories to the mozart music got a bigger   i q boost from listening to the stephen king stories than the mozart 
  music so the truth is that listening to something that you enjoy perks you up a bit and gives you a temporary i q boost on a narrow range of tasks there 's no suggestion that listening to mozart or indeed stephen king stories is going to make you any smarter
  the long run
 another version of the mozart myth is that listening to mozart can make you not only cleverer but healthier too 
 unfortunately this doesn 't seem to be true of someone who listened to the music of mozart almost every day mozart himself who suffered from gonorrhea  smallpox  arthritis and what most people think eventually killed him in the end 
 syphilis 
 this suggests that
  mozart should have bit more careful perhaps when choosing his sexual partners  but how do we choose a partner  so a myth that i have to say is
 sometimes spread a bit by sociologists is that our preferences in a romantic partner are a product of our culture that they 're very culturally specific  but in fact the data don 't back this up  
  a famous study surveyed people from [ thirty seven ] different cultures across the globe from americans to zulus
 on what they look for in a partner  
 and in every single culture across the globe men placed more value on physical attractiveness in a partner than did women  and in every single culture too women placed more importance than did men on ambition and high earning power 
 in every culture too men preferred women who were younger than themselves an average of i think it was two point six six years  and in every culture
  preferred men who were older than them  so an average of
 three point four two years which is why we 've got here everybody needs a sugar daddy 
 so moving on from trying to score with a partner to trying to score in basketball or football or whatever your sport is  the myth here is that sportsmen go through hot hand
 streaks americans call them or purple
  we sometimes say in england  where they just can 't miss like this guy here  
 but in fact what happens is that if you analyze the pattern of hits and misses statistically  it turns out that it 's nearly always at random your brain creates patterns from the randomness  if you toss a coin
  a streak of heads or tails is going to come out somewhere in the randomness  and because the brain likes to see patterns where there are none we look at these streaks and attribute meanings to them and say
  yeah he 's really on form today whereas actually you would get the same pattern if you were just getting hits and misses at random  
 so an exception to this however is penalty shootouts a recent study looking at penalty shootouts in football shows that players who represent countries with a very bad record in penalty shootouts like for example  england  
 tend to be quicker to take their shots than countries with a better
  and presumably as a result they 're more likely to miss  which raises the question
 of if there 's any way that we could improve people 's performance and one thing you might think about doing is punishing people for their misses and seeing if that improves them this
 idea the effect that punishment can improve performance is what participants thought they were testing in milgram 's famous learning and punishment experiment that you 've probably heard about if you 're a psychology student
  story goes that participants were prepared to give what they believed to be fatal electric shocks to a fellow participant when they got
 a question wrong just because someone in a white coat told them to 
 but this story is a myth for three reasons firstly and most crucially the lab coat wasn 't white it was in fact grey  
 secondly the participants were told before the study and reminded any time they
  although the shocks were painful they were not fatal and indeed caused no permanent damage whatsoever  
 and thirdly participants didn 't give the shocks just because someone in the coat told them to when they were interviewed after the study all the participants said that they firmly believed that the learning 
  and punishment study served a worthy scientific purpose which would have enduring gains for science as opposed to the momentary nonfatal
  i 've been talking for about twelve minutes now and you 've probably been sitting there listening to me analyzing my speech patterns and body language and trying to work out if you should take any notice of what i 'm saying  whether 
  i 'm telling the truth or whether i 'm lying  but if so you 've probably completely failed because although we all think we can catch a liar from their body language and speech patterns 
  at chance when it comes to detecting lies from body language and
 verbal patterns interestingly there is one exception tv appeals for missing relatives it 's quite easy to predict when the relatives are missing and when the appealers have in fact murdered 
  the relatives themselves  so hoax appealers are more likely to shake their heads to look away and to make errors in their
  are more likely to express hope that the person will return safely and to avoid brutal language  so for example they might say taken from us rather than killed 
 speaking of which it 's about time i killed this talk but before i do i just want to give you in thirty seconds the
 overarching myth of psychology  so the myth is that psychology is just a collection of interesting theories 
  all of which say something useful and all of which have something to offer what i hope to have shown you in the past few minutes is that this isn 't true  what we need to do is
 assess psychological theories by seeing what predictions they make  whether that is that listening to mozart makes you smarter that you
 learn better when information is presented in your preferred learning style or whatever it is all of these are testable empirical predictions and the only way we can make progress is to test these predictions against the data in tightly controlled experimental studies
  's only by doing so that we can hope to discover which of these theories are well supported and which  like all the ones i 've told you about today
