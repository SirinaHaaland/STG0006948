  little did i know that one year later we 'd be doing this show
  i made a beeline for you and told you what a huge fan i was ever since i was writing that pilot for fox and wendy and i wanted you to do the theme song and then the pilot didn 't go and i was so sad 
 but i kept remaining a fan of yours and then when i went through that big horrible breakup with carl and i couldn 't get off the couch  i listened to your song
 and i can 't believe you 're here and that i 'm meeting you here at ted  and also i can 't believe that we 're eating sushi in front of the fish tank which personally i think is really inappropriate 
 and little did i know that one year later we 'd be doing this show
  they asked us back
  oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine i mean i watch oprah mostly when i 'm home in spokane visiting my mother and to my mother oprah is a greater moral authority than
  the pope which is actually saying something because she 's a devout catholic anyway  i like oprah i like her 
  i like her weight issues i like how she 's transformed
 talk television  i like how she 's brought reading back to america but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was i call it
 the soon yi moment it is the moment when i cannot
  she did two entire shows promoting that movie the secret do you guys know about that movie the secret 
 it makes what the bleep do we know seem like a doctoral dissertation from harvard on quantum mechanics that 's how bad it is it makes 
 the davinci code seem like war and peace that movie is so
  promotes such awful pseudoscience and the basic idea is that there 's this law of attraction and your thoughts your thoughts have this vibrating energy that goes out into the universe and then you attract good things to happen to you 
 on a scientific basis it 's more than just power of positive thinking it has a horrible horrible dark side like if you get ill it 's because you 've just been thinking negative 
  thoughts yeah stuff like that was in the movie and she 's promoting it and all i 'm saying is that i really wish that
  and just explain to her that the law of attraction is in fact not a law so that 's what i have to say
