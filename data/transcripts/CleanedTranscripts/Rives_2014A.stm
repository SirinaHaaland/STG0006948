  most romantic thing to ever happen to me online
 started out the way most things do without me and not online on december ten one thousand eight hundred and ninety six the man on the medal alfred
  this charming lady wislawa szymborska won the nobel prize for literature  
 she 's a polish poet  
 she 's a big deal  obviously but back in ' ninety six i thought i had never heard of her and when i checked out her work  i found this sweet little poem four in the morning 
 the hour from night to day the hour from side to side the hour for those past thirty and it goes on  but as soon as i read this poem i fell for it hard  so hard i
  we must have met somewhere before 
 had i shared an elevator ride with this poem 
 did i flirt with this poem in a coffee shop somewhere i could not place it and it bugged me and then in the coming week or two i would just be watching an old movie and this would happen
  you can see what was going on right obviously the demigods of coincidence were just messing with me 
 some people get a number stuck in their head you may recognize a certain name or a tune some people get nothing but four in the morning was in me now  but mildly 
 like a groin injury
 i always assumed it would just go away on its own eventually  and i never talked about it with anybody but
 it did not  and i totally did in two thousand and seven i was invited to speak at ted for the second time and since i was still an authority on nothing i thought what if i made 
  a multimedia presentation on a topic so niche it is actually inconsequential or actually cockamamie so my talk had some of my
  four in the morning examples but it also had examples from my fellow ted speakers that year  i found four in the morning in a novel by isabel allende  i found a really great one in the autobiography of bill 
  clinton i found a couple in the work of matt groening although matt groening told me later that he could not make my talk because it was a morning session and i gather that he is not an early riser  however
  had matt been there he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory that was
  for me to assemble it was totally contrived just for that room just for that moment that 's how we did it in the pre ted com days it was fun 
 that was pretty much it when i got home though  the emails started coming in from people who had seen the talk live beginning with and this is still my favorite 
 here 's another one for your collection ' it 's the friends you can call up at four a m that matter
  itself was from another very sexy european type ted curator chris anderson 
 chris found this quote on a coffee cup or something and i 'm thinking this man is the typhoid mary of ideas worth spreading and i have infected him  i am contagious 
  which was confirmed less than a week later when a hallmark employee scanned and sent an actual greeting card with that same quotation as a
  bonus she hooked me up with a second one they make it says just knowing i can call you at four in the morning if i need to makes me not really need to which i love because together these are like hallmark 
 when you care enough to send the very best twice phrased slightly differently 
 i was not surprised at the tedster and new yorker magazine overlap
  because i 've lost control of my life rives and then there was the lone tedster who was disgruntled i had overlooked what he considers to be a classic
  anyway right ronnie not at
 four o 'clock in the morning rives 
 so that 's close encounters and the main character is all worked up because aliens momentously have chosen to show themselves to earthlings at four in the morning  which does make that a very solid example those were all really solid 
  examples they did not get me any closer to understanding why i thought i recognized this one particular poem  but they followed the pattern they played along
  four in the morning as this scapegoat hour when all these dramatic occurrences allegedly occur  
 maybe this was some kind of cliche that had never been taxonomized before  maybe i was on the trail of a new meme or something just when things
 were getting pretty interesting things got really interesting ted com launched later that year with a bunch of videos from past talks including mine  and i started receiving four in the morning 
 citations from what seemed like every time zone on the planet much of it was content i
  would have found on my own if i was looking for it and i was not 
 i don 't know anybody with juvenile diabetes i probably would have missed the booklet grilled cheese at four o 'clock in the morning 
 i do not subscribe to crochet today magazine  although it looks delightful 
 take note of those clock ends this is a college student 's suggestion for what a four in the morning gang sign should look like
 people sent me magazine ads they took photographs in grocery stores i got a ton of graphic novels and comics a lot of good quality work 
 too the sandman watchmen there 's a very cute example here from calvin and hobbes in fact the oldest citation anybody sent in was from a cartoon from the stone age take
  shows the spectrum i received so many songs tv shows movies like from dismal to famous i could give
  if i just stick to modern male movie stars i keep it to the length of about a commercial here 's your sampler
  somewhere along the line i realized i have a hobby i didn 't know i wanted and it is crowdsourced  
 but i was also thinking what you might be thinking which is really couldn 't you do this with any hour of the day first of all you are not getting clips like that about four in the afternoon
  i did a little research you know i was kind of interested if this is confirmation bias there is so much confirmation  i am biased literature probably shows it best there are a couple three in the mornings 
  in shakespeare there 's a five in the morning  there are seven four in the mornings and they 're all very dire in measure for measure it 's the call time for the executioner 
  jane eyre has got kind of a pivotal four in the morning as does emily bront 's wuthering heights lolita has as a creepy four in the morning 
 huckleberry finn has one in dialect  
 someone sent in h g wells ' the invisible man someone else sent in ralph ellison 's invisible man the great gatsby spends
  the last four in the morning of his life waiting for a lover who never shows and the most famous wake up in literature perhaps 
 the metamorphosis first paragraph the main character wakes up transformed into a giant cockroach but we already know  cockroach notwithstanding something is up with 
  this guy  why his alarm is set for four o 'clock in the morning  what kind of person would do that 
  so that 's lucy from the peanuts mommie dearest rocky first day of training nelson mandela first day in office and bart simpson which combined with a cockroach would give you one hell of a
  dinner party and gives me yet another category people waking up in my big old database just imagine that your friends and your family have heard that you collect say stuffed 
  polar bears  and they send them to you even if you don 't really at a certain point  you totally collect stuffed polar bears  
  and when i got to that point i embraced it i got my curator on i started fact checking downloading
  illegally  screen grabbing i started archiving my hobby had become a habit and my habit gave me possibly the world 's most eclectic netflix queue 
 at one point it went guys and dolls the musical last tango in paris diary of a wimpy kid porn star legend of ron jeremy why
  not only does it seem to make sense it also answers the question what do ron jeremy and simone de beauvoir have in common 
 simone de beauvoir begins her entire autobiography with the sentence i was born at four o 'clock in the morning which i had because someone else had
  emailed it to me and when they did i had another bump up in my entry for this because
 porn star ron jeremy and feminist simone de beauvoir are not just different people they are different people that have this thing connecting them and i did not know if that is trivia or 
 knowledge or inadvertent expertise but i did wonder is there maybe a cooler way to do this so
  i put the entire collection online as museum of four in the morning 
 you can click on that red refresh button it will take you at random to one of hundreds of snippets that are in the collection here is a knockout poem by billy collins called forgetfulness billy collins 
 no wonder you rise in the middle of the night
 to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war no wonder the moon in the window seems to
  drifted out of a love poem that you used to know
 by heart rives so the first hour of this project was satisfying a bollywood actor sang a line
 on a dvd in a cafe  half a globe away a teenager made an instagram video of it and sent it to me a stranger 
 less than a week later though i received
 a little bit of grace  i received
 a poignant
 tweet it was brief it just said reminds me of an ancient mix tape 
 the name was a pseudonym  actually or a pseudo pseudonym as soon as i saw the initials and the profile pic i knew immediately my whole body knew immediately who this was 
 and i knew immediately what mix tape
 she was talking about
 l d was my college romance this is in the early ' 90s i was an undegrad 
 she was a grad student in the library sciences department 
 not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off lets her hair down suddenly she 's smoking hot  she was already smoking hot  she was super dorky and we had a december may romance meaning we started dating in december and by may
 she had graduated and became my one that got away  but
 her mix tape did not get away i have kept this mix tape in a box
 with notes and postcards not just from l d from my life  but for decades it 's
 the kind of box where if i have a girlfriend i tend to hide it from her and if i had a wife i 'm sure i would share it with her but the story with this mix tape
 is there are seven songs per side but no song titles instead l d has used the u s library of congress classification system including page numbers to leave me clues 
 when i got this mix tape i put it in my cassette player 
 i took it to the campus library 
 her library  i found fourteen books on the shelves i remember bringing them all to my favorite corner table  and i read
 poems paired to songs like food to wine paired i can tell you like saddle shoes
 to a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress i did this again last october  
 i 'm sitting there i got new earbuds old walkman i realize this is just the kind of extravagance i
  a collection of seventy poems page thirty one is wislawa szymborska 's poem paired with paul simon 's peace like a river
