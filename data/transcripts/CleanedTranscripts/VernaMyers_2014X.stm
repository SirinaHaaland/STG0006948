  i was on a long road trip this summer  
 and i was having a wonderful time listening to the amazing isabel wilkerson 's the warmth of other suns 
 it documents
 six million black folks fleeing the south from
  nine hundred and fifteen to one thousand nine hundred and seventy looking for a respite from all the brutality and trying to get to a better opportunity up north and
 it was filled with stories of the resilience and the brilliance of african americans 
 and it was also really hard to hear all the stories of the horrors and the humility and all the humiliations
 it was especially hard to hear about the beatings and the burnings and the lynchings of black men 
 and i said you know this is a little deep i need a break  i 'm going to turn on the radio 
 i turned it on and there it was ferguson
  shot by a white police officer laid on the ground dead blood running
 for four hours while his grandmother and little children and his neighbors watched in horror and i thought 
 here it is again 
  this brutality against black men has been going on for centuries  i mean it 's the same story it 's just different different names it could have been amadou diallo  
 it could have been sean bell  it could have been oscar grant
  it could have been trayvon martin 
  this brutality is really something that 's part of our national psyche it 's part of our
 collective history  what are we going to do about it  you know that part of us that still
 crosses the street  locks the doors clutches the purses when we see young black men  
 that part  
 i mean
  know we 're not shooting people down in the street but i 'm saying that the same stereotypes and prejudices that fuel those kinds of tragic incidents
 are in us we 've been schooled in them as well  i believe that
 we can stop these types of incidents these fergusons from happening
 by looking within
 and being willing to change ourselves  so i have a call to action for you 
 there are three things that i want to offer us today to think about as ways to stop ferguson from happening again  
 three things that i think will help us reform our images of young black men  three things that
  i 'm hoping will not only protect them but will open the world
 so that they can thrive can you imagine that can
 you imagine our country embracing young black men  seeing them as part of our future  giving them that kind of openness that
 kind of grace we give to people we love 
 how much better would our lives be how much better would our country be let me just start with number one  
 we gotta get out of denial
 stop trying to be good people we need real people  you know i do a lot of diversity work and people will come up to me at the beginning of
  have a biased bone in our body 
 and i 'm like really because i do this work every day and i see all my biases i mean 
 not too long ago i was on a plane and i heard the voice of a  woman pilot coming over the  p a system and i was just  so excited so thrilled 
  we are rocking it we are now in the stratosphere  it was all good and then it started getting turbulent and bumpy  and i was like 
 i hope she can drive 
 i know right but it 's not even like i knew that was a bias until i was coming back on the other leg and there 's always a guy driving and it 's often turbulent and bumpy and i 've never questioned the confidence of the male driver the
  if you ask me explicitly i would say female pilot awesome 
 but it appears that when things get funky and a little troublesome a little risky  i lean on a bias that i didn 't even know that i had you
 know fast moving planes in the sky i want a guy that 's my default men are my default
  who is your default  
 who do you trust 
 who are you afraid of who do you implicitly feel connected to who do you run away from 
 i 'm going to tell you what we have learned the implicit association test which measures unconscious bias you can go online and take it five million people have
  taken it  turns out 
 our default is white  we like white people we prefer white what do i mean by that when people are shown
 images of black men and white men we are more quickly able to associate
 that picture with a positive word that white person with a positive word than we are when we are trying to
  associate positive with a black face  and vice versa when we see a black face  it is easier for us to connect
 black with negative
 than it is white with negative seventy percent
 of white people taking that test prefer white fifty percent of black people taking that test prefer white
  you see we were all outside when the contamination came down
 what do we do about the fact that our brain automatically associates  
 you know  one of the things that
 you probably are thinking about and you 're probably like you know what i 'm just going to double down on my color blindness
  recommit to that i 'm going to suggest to you no we 've gone about as far as we can go trying to make a difference trying to not see color the problem was never that we saw 
  color it was what we did when we saw the color  it 's a false ideal  
 that 's keeping them from thriving and sometimes it 's causing them
 an early death so in fact what the scientists are telling us is no way don
 't even think about color blindness  in fact what they 're suggesting is stare at awesome black people
  at them directly in their faces and memorize them because when we look at awesome folks who are black it helps to dissociate
 the association that happens automatically in our brain why do you think i 'm showing
  there were so many i had to cut them okay so here 's the thing  i 'm trying to reset your automatic associations about who black men are i 'm
 trying to remind you
 that young black men grow up to be amazing human beings who have changed our lives and
  so here 's the thing the other possibility in science and it 's only temporarily changing our automatic assumptions but
 one thing we know is that if you take a white person who is odious
 that you know  and stick it up next to a person of color a black person who is fabulous then that sometimes actually causes
  jeffrey dahmer and colin powell just stare at them  right 
 but these are the things so go looking for your bias  please please  just get out of denial and go looking for  disconfirming data that will prove that in fact your old 
  stereotypes are wrong okay so that 's number one number two  what i 'm going to say is move toward young black men instead of away from them  it 's not the hardest thing
  to do but it 's also
  one of these things where you have to be conscious and intentional about it you know i was in a wall street
 area one time  several years ago when i was with a colleague of mine and she 's really wonderful and she does diversity work with me and she 's a woman of color she 's korean  and we were outside it was late at night and we were sort of wondering where we were going we were lost and i saw this person across the street
  guy i was going toward him without even thinking about it and she was like oh that 's interesting 
 the guy across the street  he was a black guy i think
 black guys generally know where they 're going i don 't know why exactly i think that but that 's what i think  so
 she was
  other direction same need same guy same clothes same time same street  
 different reaction and she said i feel so bad i 'm a diversity consultant i did the black guy thing i 'm a woman of color 
 oh my god and i said you know what  please  we really need to relax about this i mean you 've got to realize i go way back with black
  i 've got a six  ' five black guy son  i was married to a black guy  my black guy thing is so wide and so deep that i can pretty much sort and figure out who that black guy is 
 and he was my black guy he said yes ladies i know where you 're going i 'll take you there 
 you know biases are the stories we make up about people before we know who they actually are
  but how are we going to know who they are
 when we 've been told to avoid and be afraid of them so i 'm going to tell you to walk toward your discomfort  
 and i 'm not asking you to take any crazy risks i 'm saying 
 just do an inventory  expand your social and professional circles who 's in your circle
  who 's missing how many authentic relationships
 do you have with young black people folks men  women  
 or any other major difference from who you are and how you roll so to speak 
  just look around your periphery there may be somebody at work in your classroom in your house of worship somewhere there 's some black young guy there  and you 're nice you say hi i 'm saying go deeper closer 
 further 
 and build the kinds of relationships the kinds of friendships that actually cause you to see the holistic person and to really go against the stereotypes 
 i know some of you are out there i know because i have some white friends in particular that will say
  have no idea how awkward i am like i don 't think this is going to work for me
 i 'm sure i 'm going to blow this okay  maybe but this thing is not about perfection it 's about connection  
 and you 're not going to get comfortable before you get uncomfortable  i mean you just have to do it and young black men what i 'm saying is if someone comes your way genuinely and
  authentically take the invitation 
 not everyone is out to get you go looking for those people who can see your humanity you know it 's the
 empathy and the compassion that comes out of having relationships with people who are different from you something really powerful and beautiful happens 
 you start to realize that they are you 
 that they are part of you
  that they are you in your family  
 and then we cease to be bystanders and we become actors we become advocates  and we become allies  
 so go away from your comfort into a bigger brighter thing  because that is
  how we will stop another ferguson from happening that 's how we create a community where everybody  especially young black men can thrive so this
 last thing is going to be harder and i know it but i 'm just going to put it out there anyway when we see something we have to have the courage to say something even to the people we love you
 know it 's holidays and it 's going to be a time when we 're sitting around the table and having a good
  time many of us anyways will be in holidays and
 you 've got to listen to the conversations around the table  you start to say things like 
 grandma 's 
 uncle joe is racist and you know we
 we love grandma and we love uncle joe we do we know they 're good people but what they 're saying is wrong  
 and we need to be able to say something because you know who else is at the table the
 children are at the table and we wonder why these biases don 't die and move from generation to
  because we 're not saying anything 
 we 've got to be willing to say grandma we don 't call people that anymore 
 uncle joe  it isn 't true that he deserved that  no one deserves that 
 and we 've got to be willing
 to not shelter our children from the ugliness of racism when black parents don 't have the luxury to do so
  especially those who have young black sons we 've got to take our lovely darlings our future and we 've got to tell them
 we have an amazing country
 with incredible ideals we have worked incredibly hard and we have made some progress but we are not
  we still have in us this old stuff about superiority and it is causing us to embed those further into our institutions and our society and generations 
 and it is making for despair
 and disparities and a devastating devaluing of young black men  
 we still struggle you have to tell them with seeing both
 the color
 and the character of young black men  
 but that you  
 and you expect them to be part of the forces of change in this society that will stand against injustice and is willing 
 above all other things to make a society where
 young black men can be seen for
 all of who they are 
 so many amazing black men  those who are
 the most amazing statesmen that have ever lived
  people who are powerful preachers 
 they are incredible scientists and artists and writers 
 they are dynamic comedians they are
 doting grandpas  caring sons
  strong fathers and they are young men with dreams of their own  thank you
