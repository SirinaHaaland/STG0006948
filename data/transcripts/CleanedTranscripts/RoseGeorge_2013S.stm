  harvard business school chose the best business model of that year it chose somali piracy 
 pretty much around the same time i discovered that there were
 five hundred and
  seafarers being held hostage
 on ships often anchored just off the somali coast in plain sight  
 and i learned these two facts and i thought  what 's going on in shipping 
 and i thought would that happen in any other industry would we see five hundred and forty four airline pilots held captive in their jumbo jets on a runway for months or a year
 would we see five hundred and forty four greyhound bus drivers it wouldn 't happen so i started to get intrigued  
 and i discovered another fact  which to me was more astonishing almost for the fact that i hadn 't known it before at the age
  perhaps the general public thinks of shipping as an old fashioned industry 
 something brought by sailboat with moby dicks and jack sparrows  
 but shipping isn 't that shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been 
 shipping brings us ninety percent of world trade 
 shipping has quadrupled in size since
  seventy we are more dependent on it now than ever  and yet for such an enormous industry
 there are a one hundred thousand working vessels on the sea
 it 's become pretty much invisible now that sounds absurd
 in singapore to say that because here shipping is so present that you stuck a ship on top of a hotel
 but elsewhere in the world 
 if you ask the general public what they know about shipping and how much trade is carried by sea you will get essentially a blank face 
 you will ask someone on the street if they 've heard of microsoft  i should think they 'll say yes  because they 'll know that they make software that goes on computers 
 and occasionally works
 but if you ask them if they 've heard of maersk  i doubt you 'd get the same response 
 even though maersk which is just one shipping company amongst many 
 has revenues pretty much on a par with microsoft [ $ sixty point two billion ]
 now why is this a few years ago the first sea lord of the british admiralty
  he is called the first sea lord although the chief of the army is not called a land lord
 he said that we and he meant in the industrialized nations in the west that we suffer from sea blindness 
 we are blind to the sea as a place of industry or of work  it 's just something we fly over a patch of blue on an airline map
  to see move along so
 i wanted to open my own eyes to my own sea blindness  so i ran away to sea 
 a couple of years ago i took a passage on the maersk kendal 
 a mid sized container ship carrying nearly seven thousand boxes  and i departed from felixstowe
  of england  and i ended up right here in singapore five weeks later  considerably less jet lagged than i am right now 
 and it was a revelation 
 we traveled through five seas two oceans nine ports  
 and i learned a lot about shipping and one of the first things that surprised me when i got on board kendal
 was
 where are all the people i have friends in the navy who tell me they sail with one thousand sailors at a time  but on kendal there were only twenty one crew 
 now that 's because shipping is very efficient 
  has made it very efficient ships have automation now they can operate with small
  but it also means that in the words of a port chaplain i once met the average seafarer you 're going to find on a container ship is either tired or exhausted 
 because the pace of modern shipping
 is quite punishing for what the shipping calls its human element a strange phrase which they don 't seem to realize sounds a little bit inhuman 
 so most seafarers now working on container ships often have less than two hours in port at a time
 they don 't have time to relax they 're at sea for months at a time and even when they 're on board they don 't have access to what a five year old would
 take for granted the internet and another thing that surprised me when i got on board kendal was
 who i was sitting next to not the queen i can 't imagine why they put me underneath her portrait
 but around that dining table in the officer
  's saloon i was sitting next to a burmese guy i was opposite a romanian a moldavian an indian on the next table was a chinese guy and in the crew room it was entirely filipinos so that was a normal working ship 
 now how is that possible  
 because the biggest dramatic change in shipping over the last sixty years when most of the general public stopped noticing it was something called an open registry
  a flag of convenience ships can now fly the flag of any nation that provides a flag registry 
 you can get a flag from the landlocked nation of bolivia or mongolia or north korea though that 's not very popular 
 so we have these very multinational  global
  mobile crews on ships  
 and that was a surprise to me  
 and when we got to pirate waters  down the bab el mandeb strait and into the indian ocean 
 the ship changed  
 and that was also shocking  because suddenly  i realized 
 as the captain said to me that i had been crazy to choose to go through pirate waters on a container ship we
 were no longer allowed on deck 
 there were double pirate watches
  time  there were those five hundred and forty four seafarers being held hostage and some of them were held hostage for years because of the nature of shipping and the flag of convenience  not all of them but some of them were  because
 for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners it can be easy to hide behind the anonymity offered by some flags
  what else does our sea blindness mask 
 well if you go out to sea on a ship or on a cruise ship and look up to the funnel you 'll see very black smoke  
 and that 's because shipping
 has very tight margins and they want cheap fuel so they use something called bunker fuel  which was described to me by someone in the tanker industry as the dregs of the
  or just one step up from asphalt  
 and shipping is the greenest method of transport in terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile it emits about a thousandth of aviation
 and about a tenth of trucking but
 it 's not benign because there 's so much of it 
 so shipping emissions are about three to four percent almost the same as aviation 's and if you put shipping emissions on a on a
  a list of the countries  ' carbon emissions it would come in about sixth somewhere near germany 
 it was calculated in two thousand and nine that the fifteen largest ships
 pollute in terms of particles and soot and noxious gases as much as all the cars in the world 
 and the good news is that people are now talking about sustainable shipping there are interesting initiatives going on but why has it taken so long when are we going to start
 talking and thinking about shipping miles as well as air miles
  i also traveled to cape cod to look at the plight of the north atlantic right whale because this to me was one of the most surprising things about
 my time at sea and what it made me think about we know about man 's impact on the ocean in terms of fishing and overfishing 
 but we don 't really know much about what 's happening underneath the water
  has a role to play here because shipping noise has
 contributed to damaging the acoustic habitats of ocean creatures light doesn 't penetrate beneath the surface of the water  
 so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins and even eight hundred species of fish
 communicate by sound  and a north atlantic right whale can transmit across hundreds of miles a humpback can
 transmit a sound across a whole ocean  but a supertanker can also be heard coming across a whole ocean 
 and because the noise that propellers make underwater is sometimes at the same frequency that whales use then it can damage their acoustic habitat  
 and they need this for breeding for finding feeding grounds for finding
  and the acoustic habitat of the north atlantic right whale has been reduced by up to ninety percent  but there are no laws governing acoustic pollution
 yet  and when i
 arrived in singapore  and i apologize for this but i didn 't want to get off my ship  
 i 'd really loved being on board kendal  i 'd been well treated by the
  had a garrulous and entertaining captain  and i would happily have signed up for another five weeks 
 something that the captain also said i was crazy to think about  
 but i wasn 't there for nine months at a time like the filipino seafarers who when i asked them to describe their job to me called it dollar for homesickness 
 they had good salaries  but theirs is still an isolating and difficult
  a dangerous and often difficult element  
 but when i get to this part i 'm in two minds because i want to salute those seafarers who bring us ninety percent of everything
 and get very little thanks or recognition for it 
 i want to salute the one hundred thousand ships that are at sea
 that are doing that work coming in and out every day  bringing us what we need  
 but i also want to see
 shipping and us the general public who know so
  about it to have a bit more scrutiny to be a bit more transparent to have ninety percent transparency  
 because i think we could all benefit
 from doing something very simple which is learning to see the sea  thank you
