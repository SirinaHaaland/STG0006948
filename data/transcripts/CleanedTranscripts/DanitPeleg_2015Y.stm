  in the past few months i 've been traveling for weeks at a time with only one suitcase of clothes one day i was invited to an important event and i wanted to wear something special and new for it  
 so i looked through my suitcase and i couldn 't find anything to wear  
 i was lucky to be at the technology
  conference on that day and i had access to 3d printers so i quickly designed a skirt on my computer and i loaded the file on the printer it just printed the pieces overnight 
 the next morning i just took all the pieces assembled them together in my hotel room  and this is actually the skirt that i 'm wearing right now
  senior collection at fashion design school i decided to try and 3d print an entire fashion collection from my home  
 the problem was that i barely knew anything about  3d printing  and i had only nine months to figure out how to print five fashionable looks 
 i always felt most creative when i worked from home  i loved experimenting with new materials and i always tried to develop new techniques to make the most unique
  textiles for my fashion projects  
 i loved going to old factories and weird stores in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials  and then bring them home to experiment on 
 as you can probably imagine my roommates didn 't like that at all 
 so i decided to move on to working with big machines ones that didn 't fit in my living room i love the exact and the custom
  work i can do with all kinds of fashion technologies like knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing 
 one summer break i came here to new york for an internship at a fashion house in chinatown we worked on two incredible dresses that were
 they were amazing like you can see here
  few issues with them they were made from hard plastics and that 's why they were very breakable 
 the models couldn 't sit in them and they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms 
 with 3d printing the designers had so much freedom to make the dresses look exactly like they wanted 
 but still they were very dependent on big and expensive industrial printers that were located in a lab far from their studio
  me a 3d printed necklace printed using a home printer i knew that these printers were much cheaper and much more accessible than the ones we used at my internship  
 so i looked at the necklace  and then i thought if i can print a necklace from home why not print my clothes from home too 
 i really liked the idea that i wouldn 't have to go to the market and pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell i could just design
  them and print them directly from home  i found a small 
 where i learned everything i know about 3d printing right away they literally gave me the key to the lab so i could experiment into the night  every night 
 the main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with so what is a filament
  filament is the material you feed the printer with and i spent a month or so experimenting with pla which is a hard and scratchy breakable material 
 the breakthrough came when i was introduced to filaflex which is a new kind of filament it 's strong  yet very flexible and with it i was able to print the first 
 garment the red jacket that had the word libert freedom in french embedded into it  i chose this word because i felt so empowered and free when i could just
  design a garment from my home and then print it by myself 
 and actually you can easily download this jacket and easily change the word to something else for example your name or your sweetheart 's name 
 laughter so the printer plates are small so i had to piece the garment together just like
  and i wanted to solve another challenge i wanted to print textiles that i would use just like regular fabrics that 's when i found an open source file from an architect who designed a pattern 
  that i love  and with it i was able to print a beautiful textile that i would use just like a regular fabric 
  and changed it played with it many kinds of versions out of it  
 and i needed to print another one thousand five hundred more hours to complete printing my collection  
 so i brought six printers to my home and just printed 
 and this is actually a really slow process but let 's remember the internet was significantly slower twenty years ago so 3d printing will also accelerate and in no time you 'll be able to print a t shirt in your home in just a couple of hours
  or even minutes so you guys you want to see what it looks like audience yeah danit peleg
 rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits  almost everything here she 's wearing 
 i printed from my home 
 even her shoes are printed
  think in the future materials will evolve and they will look and feel like fabrics we know today like cotton or silk 
 imagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements
  music was once a very physical thing you would have to go to the record shop and buy cds  but now you can just download the music digital music directly to your phone 
 fashion is also a very physical thing  and i wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital just like this skirt is 
 thank you so much
