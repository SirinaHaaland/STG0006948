  so i 've been thinking about the difference between the rsum virtues and the eulogy virtues the rsum virtues are the ones you put on your rsum which
 are the skills you bring to the marketplace the eulogy virtues are the ones that get mentioned in the eulogy which are deeper who are you in your depth
 what is the nature of your relationships are you bold loving dependable consistency 
 and most of us including me would say that the eulogy virtues are the more important of the virtues but
 at least in my case are they the ones that i think about the most and the answer is no so i 've been thinking about that problem and a thinker who has helped me think about it is a guy named joseph soloveitchik
  soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures  which he called adam i and adam ii 
 adam i is the worldly ambitious external side of our nature 
 he wants to build create create companies create innovation 
 adam ii is the humble side of our nature adam ii wants not only to do good but to be good to live in a way internally
 that honors god creation and our possibilities adam i wants to conquer the world
 ii wants to hear a calling and obey the world adam i savors accomplishment adam ii savors inner consistency and strength 
 adam i asks how things work adam ii asks why we 're here 
 adam i 's motto is success adam ii 's motto is love redemption and return 
 and soloveitchik argued that these two sides of our nature are at war with each other we live in perpetual
  between the external success and the internal value and the tricky thing i 'd say about these
 two sides of our nature is they work by different logics 
 the external logic is an economic logic  input leads to output  risk leads to reward 
 the internal side of our nature is a moral logic and often an inverse logic  you have to give to receive  you have to surrender to something outside
  yourself to gain strength within yourself  you have to conquer the desire to get what you want 
 in order to fulfill yourself you have to forget yourself  in order to find yourself you have to lose yourself  
 we happen to live in a society that favors adam i 
 and often neglects adam ii and the problem is that turns you into a shrewd animal
 who treats life as a game and you become a cold calculating creature
  slips into a sort of mediocrity
 where you realize there 's a difference between your desired self and your actual self you 're not earning the sort of eulogy you want  
 you hope someone will give to you you don 't have the depth of conviction  you don 't have an emotional sonorousness you don 't have commitment to tasks that would take more than a lifetime to commit
  i was reminded of a common response through history
 of how you build a solid adam ii how you build a depth of character 
 through history 
 people have gone back into their own pasts sometimes to a precious time in their life to their childhood 
 and often the mind gravitates in the past to a moment of shame  some sin committed  some act
  a lack of courage adam i is built by building on your strengths 
 adam ii is built by fighting your weaknesses  
 you go into yourself  you find the sin which you 've committed over and again through your life your signature sin
  and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin and out of that wrestling that suffering then a depth of character is constructed 
 and we 're often not taught to recognize the sin in ourselves in that we 're not taught in this culture how to
 wrestle with it how to confront it and how to combat it we live in a culture with an adam i mentality
 where we 're inarticulate about
  summed up the confrontation the fully lived adam i and adam ii life  this way 
 nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime therefore we must be saved by hope nothing which is true or beautiful or good
 makes complete sense in any immediate context of history  therefore we must be saved by faith  nothing
 we do however virtuous can be accomplished alone therefore we must be saved by love  
 no virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe
 as from our own standpoint therefore we must be saved by that final form of love  which is forgiveness thanks
