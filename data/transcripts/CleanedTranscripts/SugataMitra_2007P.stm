  a tough
 job to do you know when i looked at the
 profile of the audience here  with their connotations and design
  in all its forms and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks and so on 
 that i wanted to tell you i wanted to build an argument
 for primary education
 in a very specific context in order to do that in twenty minutes i have to bring out four ideas
 it 's like four pieces of a puzzle  and if i succeed in doing that  maybe
 you would go back with
 that you could build on and perhaps help me do my work  
 the first piece of the puzzle is remoteness
 and the quality of education now by remoteness  i mean
 two or three different kinds of things of course remoteness in its normal sense which means that
 as you go further and further away from an urban center
  you get to remoter areas what happens to education the second or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large
 metropolitan areas all over the world  
 you have pockets like slums or shantytowns or poorer areas which are socially and economically remote
 from the rest of the city so it 's us and them
  what happens to education in that context  so keep both of those ideas of remoteness  
 we made a guess  the guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers 
 if they do have  they cannot retain those teachers they do not have good enough infrastructure  and if they had some infrastructure they have
 difficulty maintaining
 but i wanted to check if this is true  so what i did last year was we
 hired a car looked up on google found a route into northern india from new delhi
 which you know which did not cross any big cities
  drove out about
 three hundred kilometers and wherever we found a school administered a set of standard tests  
 and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph  
 the graph was interesting  although you need to consider it carefully i mean this is a very small sample you
 should not generalize from it  
 but it was quite obvious  
 quite clear that for this particular route that i had taken
 the remoter the school was the worse its results seemed to be 
 that seemed a little damning  and i tried to correlate it with
 things like infrastructure  or with the availability of electricity and things like that 
 to my surprise  it did not correlate it did not correlate with the size of classrooms it did not correlate
 with the
 the quality of the infrastructure it did not correlate with the poverty levels  
 it did not correlate  
 but what happened was that when i administered a questionnaire to each of these schools with one single question for the teachers which was would you like to move
 to an urban metropolitan area sixty nine percent of them said yes and as you can see from that
  say yes
 just a little bit out of delhi and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of delhi
 because you know those are relatively better off areas and then from two hundred kilometers out of delhi the answer is consistently yes  
 i would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that i wish i was in some other school
  probably has
 a deep impact on
  to the results so it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration
 was a was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools as opposed to
 whether the children have enough to eat and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing  it appears that way 
 when you take education and technology then i find in the literature that you know things like websites collaborative environments you 've been listening to all that in the morning
 it 's always
 piloted first
 in the best schools  the best urban schools and according to me biases the result  
 the literature one part of it the scientific literature consistently blames et as
  the teachers always say well it 's fine  but it 's too expensive for what it does  because it 's being piloted in a school
 where the students are already getting let 's say eighty percent of whatever they could do 
 you put in this new super duper technology and now they get eighty three percent so the principal looks at it and says three percent for
 three hundred thousand dollars forget
  took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools  where the score was thirty percent and let 's say took that up to forty percent
 that will be a completely different thing so the the relative change that et educational technology would make would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top but
 we seem to be doing it the other way about  so i came to this conclusion that et should reach the underprivileged
  not the other way about and finally came the question of how do you tackle teacher perception whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology the teacher 's first reaction is 
 you cannot replace a teacher with a machine
 it 's impossible 
 i don 't know why it 's impossible but even for a moment if you did assume that it 's impossible i have a quotation from sir arthur  c clarke
  the science fiction writer whom i met
  he said something which completely solves this problem he said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine should be so you
 know it puts the teacher into a tough bind you have to think
 anyway  so i 'm proposing that an alternative primary education whatever alternative you want 
 is required where schools don 't exist where schools are not good enough where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough for
  reason if you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies then you don 't need an alternative education 
 so far i haven 't come across such an area except for one case  i won 't name the area but somewhere in the world people said we don 't have this problem because
 we we have perfect teachers and perfect schools 
  never heard that anywhere else  i 'm going to talk about children and 
 and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like 
 they 're called the 
 have to really rush through this they 're a set of experiments  the first one was done in new delhi in
 and ninety nine and what we did over there was
 pretty much simple  i had an office in those days which bordered a
 slum an urban slum so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum  
 they cut a hole inside that wall which is how it has got the name hole in the wall
 and put
 put a pretty powerful pc into that hole sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end
  touchpad similarly embedded into the wall put it on
 high speed internet put the internet explorer there put it on altavista com in those days and just left it there and this is what
 we saw  
 so that was my office in
  what he was doing was he was teaching her to browse  
  it sort of raised more questions than it answered is this real does the language matter because he 's not supposed to know english will the computer last or will they break it and steal it
 the last question is what everybody said but you know i mean they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office  can you show me how to do it and then somebody taught him 
 so i took the experiment out of delhi and repeated it  
 this time in a city called
  of india where i was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything 
 so it was a warm day  and
 the hole in the wall was on that
 decrepit old building this is the first
 kid who came there he later on turned out to be a 13 year old school dropout
 he came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad 
 very quickly he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen
 and later on he told me i have never seen a television where you can do something 
 so he figured that out it took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television 
 and then as he was doing that he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad you 'll see him do that
 did that and the internet explorer changed page 
 eight minutes later he looked from his hand to the screen and he was browsing he was going back and forth
  when that happened he started calling
 all the neighborhood children like children would come and see what 's happening over here
 and by the evening of that day  seventy children were all browsing  
 so eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there  
 so we we thought that this is what was happening that children in groups
  to use a computer and the internet 
 but under what circumstances at this time there was
 a the main question was about english people said you know you really ought to have this in
 in indian languages  so i said have what  shall i translate the internet into some indian language
  it has to be the other way about but let 's see how do the children tackle
 the english language i took the experiment out to northeastern india to a village called madantusi where
 for some reason there was no english teacher so the children had not learned english at all  
 and i built a similar hole in the wall one big difference in the villages as opposed to the urban slums there were more girls than boys
 who came to the
  urban slums  the girls tend to stay away  i left the computer there with lots of cds i didn 't have any internet
 and came back three months later  
 so when i came back there
  we 've picked it up from the cds so i said but how did you understand what 's going on over there so they said well you 've left this machine which talks only in english so we had
  that kind of thing not only to do with the computer but in their day to day conversations  
 so  madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to
  i got some funding
 to try this experiment out
 to see if these results are replicable if they happen everywhere else india is a good place to
 do such an experiment in because we have all the ethnic diversities all the you know the genetic diversity all the racial diversities  and also all the 
 so i could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world
  so i did this for almost five years  and
 this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of india this is the himalayas up in the north very cold i also had to check
 or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors  and i was using regular normal pcs  so i needed different climates for which india is also
  we have very cold very hot and so on this is the desert to the west 
 near the pakistan border and
 you see here a little clip of
 one of these villages the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the english alphabet 
 then to central india very warm moist
  fishing villages where humidity is a very big
 killer of electronics  so we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power so
 most of the solutions that came out used
 little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running i want to just cut this short
  we did this over and over again this sequence is also nice this is a small child a six year old telling his eldest sister what to do  
 and this happens very often with these computers that the younger children are found teaching the older ones 
 what did we find  
 we found that six to 13 year olds can self instruct in a connected environment irrespective of
 anything that we could measure  so if they have access to
  the computer they will teach themselves including intelligence i couldn 't find a single correlation with anything 
 but it had to be in groups and that may be of great  
 you know interest to this group because all of you are talking about groups  so here was the power of what a group of children can do if you lift
 the adult intervention just a quick idea of the measurements
  we took standard statistical techniques so i 'm going to not talk about that 
 but we got a clean learning curve almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school 
 i 'll leave it at that because  i mean  it sort of says it all doesn 't it 
 what could they learn to do  basic windows functions browsing painting  chatting and email  games and educational material music downloads
  video in short what all of us do and over three hundred children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months
 with one computer 
 so how do they do that if you calculated the actual time of access it would work out to minutes per day  so that 's not how it 's happening 
 what you have actually is there is one child operating the computer and surrounding him are usually three other children
 who are advising him on what they should do if you test them all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them 
 around these four are usually a group of about sixteen children 
 who are also advising usually wrongly about everything that 's going on on the computer 
 and all of them also will clear
 a test given on that subject so they are learning as much by watching
 as they learn by doing it seems counter intuitive to
 adult learning but remember eight year olds live in a society where most of the time they are told don 't do this you know 
 don 't touch the whiskey bottle  so what does the eight year old do he observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched  and if you tested
  he would answer every question correctly on that topic  so they seem to be able to acquire
 very quickly
 so what was the conclusion over the six years of work it
 was that primary education can happen on its own or parts of it can happen on its own 
 it does not have to be imposed from the top downwards  
 it
 could perhaps be a  
  so that was the second bit that i wanted to tell you that children can   self organize and attain an educational objective  
 the third piece was on values 
 and again to put it very briefly  i conducted a test over five hundred children spread across all over india 
 and asked them i gave gave them about sixty eight different
 questions and simply asked them their opinions we got all sorts of opinions yes no or i don 't know  i simply took
 those questions where i got fifty percent yeses and fifty percent noes
 so i was able to get a collection of sixteen such statements 
 these were areas where the children were clearly confused because half said yes and half said no a typical example being sometimes it is necessary to tell lies 
 they don 't have a way to determine
 which way to answer this question perhaps none of us
 so i leave you with this third question can technology alter the acquisition of values  
 finally self organizing systems about which again  i won 't say too much because you 've been hearing all about it
 natural systems are all self organizing galaxies molecules cells organisms societies except for the debate about an intelligent designer but at this point in
  time as far as science goes it 's self organization 
 but other examples are traffic jams  stock market society and disaster recovery  terrorism and insurgency  
 and you know about the internet based self organizing systems  so here are my four sentences then remoteness affects
  the quality of education educational technology
 should be introduced into remote areas first and other areas later  
 values are acquired  doctrine and dogma
 are imposed
 the two opposing mechanisms  and learning is most likely a self organizing system if you put all the four
  it gives according to me it gives us a goal a vision for educational technology an educational technology and pedagogy
 that is digital automatic fault tolerant minimally invasive connected and self organized 
 as educationists we have never asked for technology we keep borrowing it  
 powerpoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology but it was not meant for education it was meant for making boardroom presentations  we borrowed it  video conferencing  
 the personal computer itself  i think it 's time that the educationists made their own specs  and i have such a set of specs 
 this is
 a brief
 look at that and such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness values and violence  
 so i thought i 'd give it a name
 why don 't we call it
 and could this be a goal for educational technology in the future so i want to leave that as a thought with you thank
