  a crazy evangelical i 've always known that the age of design is upon us almost like a rapture
  if the day is sunny i think oh  the gods have had a good design day  or i go to a show and i see a beautiful piece by an artist particularly beautiful
  because he clearly looked to design to understand what he needed to do so i really do believe
 that design is the highest form of creative expression 
 that 's why i 'm talking to you today about the age of design and the age of design is the age in which design is still cute furniture is still posters 
 is still fast
  you see at moma today but in truth what i really would like to
 explain to the public and to the audiences of moma is that the most interesting chairs are the ones that are actually made by a robot like this beautiful chair by dirk vander kooij  where a robot deposits a 
  slur of recycled refrigerator parts as if he were a big
  and makes a chair out of it  or good design is digital fonts that we use all the time and that become part of our identity i want people to understand
 that design is so much more than cute chairs that it is first and foremost everything that is around us in our life  
 and it 's interesting how so much of what we 're talking about tonight is not simply design but interaction design and in
  interaction design is what i 've been trying to insert in the collection of the museum of modern art for a few years starting not very timidly but just
 pointedly with works for instance by martin wattenberg the way a machine plays chess with itself that you see here or lisa strausfeld and her partners the sugar interface for one laptop per child  toshio iwai 's
  maeda 's reactive books and also
 jonathan harris and sep kamvar 's i want you to want me these were some of the first acquisitions that really introduced the idea of interaction design to the public  but more recently 
  i 've been trying really to go even deeper into interaction design with examples that are emotionally really suggestive and that really explain interaction design at a level that is almost undeniable
  the wind map by wattenberg and fernanda vigas i don 't know if you 've ever seen it it 's really fantastic  it looks at the territory of the united states as if it were
 a wheat field that is procured by the winds and that is really giving you a pictorial image of what 's going on with the winds in the
  but also more recently  we started acquiring video games  and that 's where all hell broke loose in a really interesting way 
 laughter there are still people that believe that there 's a high and there 's a low and that 's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we 've had to the
 anointment of video games in the moma collection  
 we 've no first of all new york magazine always gets it i love them so we are in the right quadrant we are in the highbrow
 that 's daring that 's courageous and brilliant which is great timidly we 've been higher on the diagonal in other situations but it 's okay 
 it 's good it 's good  it 's good but here comes the art critic oh that was fantastic so the first was jonathan jones from the guardian 
 sorry moma video games are not art did i ever say they were art  i was talking about interaction design excuse me
  alongside picasso and van gogh they 're two floors away 
 will mean
 game over for any real understanding of art 
 i 'm bringing in the end of the world  you know  we were talking about the rapture  it 's coming and jonathan jones is making it happen so the same guardian
  are video games art  the debate that shouldn 't be last week guardian art critic blah blah suggested that games cannot qualify as art  
 but is he right and does it matter thank you does it matter you know it 's like once again there 's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art  or the 
  idea that is so diffuse that designers want to aspire to would like to be called artists no designers aspire to be really great designers thank you very much and that 's more than enough
  so my knight in shining armor john maeda without any prompt came out with this big declaration on why video games belong in the moma and that was 
  fantastic and i thought that was it  but then there was another wonderfully pretentious article that came out in the new republic so pretentious by liel leibovitz and it said moma has
  that misses the point excuse me  you 're missing the point  and here look 
 the above question is put bluntly are video games art  no video games aren 't art because they are quite thoroughly something else 
 code 
 oh so picasso is not art because it 's oil paint right  so it 's so fantastic to see how these feathers that were ruffled
  reactions were so vehement  and you know what the international cat video film festival didn 't have that much of a reaction 
 i think this was truly fantastic we were talking about dancing ponies but i was really jealous of the walker arts center for putting up this
 festival because it 's very very wonderful and there 's this flaubert quote
  i have always tried to live in an ivory tower but a tide of shit is beating at its walls 
 threatening to undermine it i consider myself the tide of shit you know we
 have to go through that 
  my colleagues that were trying to put together an abstract art show had all of these works stopped by the customs officers that decided they were not art  so it 's happened before  and it will happen in the future but right
  now i can tell you that i am so so proud to be able to call pac man part of the moma collection  and the same with for instance  
 tetris  original version the soviet one  and you know  the amount of work
 yeah alexey pajitnov was was working for the soviet government and that 's how he developed tetris  and alexey himself reconstructed the
  whole game and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube that makes it look 
  slightly bombed and it 's fantastic so behind these acquisitions is an enormous amount of work because we 're still the museum of modern art so even when we tackle popular culture we tackle it as a form of interaction design and as something that has to go into the
  to be researched so to get to
 choosing eric chahi 's wonderful another world amongst others we put together a panel of experts and we worked on this acquisition  and it 's mostly myself and kate carmody 
  and paul galloway  we worked on it for a year and a half so many people helped us designers of games
  we were not real gamers enough so we had to really talk to them 
 and so we decided of course to have sim city two thousand not the other sim city that one in particular so the criteria that we developed along the way were really strong 
 and were not only criteria of selection they were also criteria of exhibition and of
  that 's what makes this acquisition more than a little game or a little joke it 's truly a way to think of how to preserve and show artifacts that will more and more become 
  part of our lives in the future  we live today as you know very well not in the digital not in the physical but in the kind of minestrone that our mind makes of the two and that 's really where interaction
  bring people in and make them realize how interaction is part of their lives  so when i talk about it i don 't talk only about video games  which are in a way the purest form of interaction unadulterated 
 by any kind of function or finality  i also talk about the metrocard vending machine which i consider a masterpiece of interaction i mean that interface is beautiful it looks like a burly mta guy coming out of the tunnel you
  with your mitt you can actually paw the the metrocard  and i talk about how bad
 usually are so i let people understand that it 's up to them to know how to judge interaction so as to know when it 's good or when it 's bad  so when i show the sims  i 
  try to make people really feel what it meant to have an interaction with the sims not only the fun but also the
  that came with the tamagotchi
  you know  video games can be truly deep even when they 're completely mindless i 'm sure that all of you know katamari damacy  it 's about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can 
  in a finite amount of time and hopefully you 'll be able to make it into a planet i 've never made it into a planet but that 's it  
  first video games in which you could choose your own music so you would put into the 
  you would put your own cd and then the game would change alongside your music so really fantastic not to mention eve online eve online is an artificial 
  universe if you wish  but one of the diplomats that was killed in benghazi not ambassador stevens but one of his collaborators was a really big shot in eve online so here you have a diplomat in the real
  world that spends his time in eve online to kind of test maybe all of his ideas about diplomacy and about universe building 
 and to the point that the first announcement of the bombing was actually given on eve online and after his death several parts of the universe were named after him  and i was just recently at the
  talking about an experience that of course can seem weird to many but that is very educational of course there are games that are even more educational  
 dwarf fortress is like the holy grail of this kind of massive multiplayer online game and in fact the two adams brothers were in reykjavk and
 they were greeted by a standing ovation by all the eve online
 fans it was amazing to see and it 's a beautiful
  game  so you start seeing here that the aesthetics that are so important to a museum collection like moma 's are kept alive also by the selection of these games 
 and you know  valve you know  portal is an example of a video game in which you have a certain type of violence which also leads me to talk about
  that we had to discuss when we acquired the video games what to do with violence right we had to make decisions at moma interestingly  
 there 's a lot of violence depicted in the art part of the collection  but when i came to moma nineteen years ago and as an italian i said you know what we need a beretta and i was told no no guns in the design collection and i was like why 
 interestingly  i learned that it 's considered that in
  in the design collection what you see is what you get so when you see a gun it 's an instrument for killing in the design collection  if it 's in the art collection it might be a critique of the
  killing instrument so it 's very interesting but we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design so maybe one day we 'll be able to acquire also the guns but here in this particular case we decided you know with kate and paul that we would have no gratuitous
  we have portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces we have street fighter ii because martial arts are good 
 but we don 't have gta because maybe it 's my own reflection i 've never been able to do anything but crashing cars and shooting prostitutes and pimps so
 it was not very constructive
  and to this day i am ambivalent but
 when you have instead games like flow there 's no doubt it 's like  it 's about serenity and it 's about sublime it 's about experiencing what it means to be a sea creature 
 then we have a few also side scrollers classical ones so it 's quite a hefty collection  and right now we started
 with the first fourteen but we have several that are coming up and the reason why we haven 't acquired them yet is because you don 't acquire just the game you acquire the relationship with the company what we 
  want what we aspire to is the code it 's very hard to get of course  but that 's what would enable us to preserve the video games for a really long time and that 's what museums do they also preserve artifacts for posterity 
  companies are not very forthcoming in some cases 
 in absence of that we acquire the relationship with the company we 're going to stay with them forever they 're not going to get rid of us and one day we 'll get that code  
 but i want to explain to you the the criteria that we chose for interaction design aesthetics are really important and i 'm showing you core war here which is an early game that takes advantage aesthetically of the limitations
  of the processor so the kind of interferences that you see here that look like beautiful barriers in the game are actually a consequence of the processor 
  's limitedness which is fantastic so aesthetics is always important and so is space the spatial aspect of games you know i feel that the best video games are the ones that have really savvy architects that are behind
  and if they 're not architects bona fide trained in architecture they have that feeling but the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important time the way we experience time 
  in video games as in other forms of interaction design is really quite amazing it can be real time or it can be the time within the game as is in animal crossing where seasons follow each other at their own pace so time space
  and then most important behavior  
 the real core issue of interaction design is behavior  designers that deal with interaction design behaviors that go to influence the rest of our lives they 're not just limited to our interaction with the screen 
 in this case i 'm showing you marble madness which is a beautiful game in which the the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you so you have a sphere that 's moving in this landscape
  and the sphere the controller itself gives you a sense of the movement 
 in a way you can see how video games are the purest aspect of interaction design and are very useful to explain
 what interaction is 
 we don 't want to show the video games with the paraphernalia  no arcade nostalgia if anything we want to show the code and here you see ben fry 's distellamap of pac man of the pac man
  the way we acquired the games is very interesting and very unorthodox you see them here
 displayed alongside other examples of design  furniture and other parts but
 there 's no paraphernalia no nostalagia only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers the controllers are of course part of the experience so you cannot do away with it  but
 interestingly
  this choice was not condemned too vehemently by gamers i was afraid that they would kill us and instead they understood especially when i told them that i was trying to apply the same stratagem that philip johnson applied in 
 when he wanted to make people understand the importance of design and he took propeller blades and pieces of machinery and in the moma galleries he put them on white pedestals 
  against white walls as if they were brancusi sculptures he created this strange distance this shock
  that made people realize how gorgeous formally and also important functionally design pieces were 
 i would like to do the same with video games by getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts and everything else that we might remember from our childhood 
 i want people to understand that those are important forms of design and in a way the video games the fonts and everything
  else lead us to
 to make people understand a wider
 meaning for design one of my dream acquisitions which has been on hold for a few years but now will come back on the front burner is a seven hundred and forty seven i would 
  like to acquire it but without owning it  i don 't want it to be at moma and possessed by moma i
  to keep flying so it 's an acquisition where moma makes
 an arrangement with an airline and keeps the boeing seven hundred and forty seven flying  
 and the same with the @ sign that we acquired a few years ago it was the first example of an acquisition of something that is in the public domain and what i say to people it 's almost as if a butterfly were flying 
  by and we captured the shadow on the wall and just we 're showing the shadow so in a way we 're showing a manifestation of something that is truly important and that is part
  of our identity but that nobody can have and it 's too long to explain the acquisition but if you want to go on the moma blog there 's a long post where i explain why it 's such a great example of design  
 along the way i 've had to burn a few chairs you know i 've had to do away with a few concepts of design past but i see that people are coming along that the audiences paradoxically are much more
  responsive and much more understanding of this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are 
 design is truly everywhere and design is as important as anything and i 'm so glad that because of its diversity and because of its centrality to our lives many more 
  people are coming to it as a profession as a passion and as very simply part of their own culture  thank you very much
