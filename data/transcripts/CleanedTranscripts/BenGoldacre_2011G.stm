  i 'm a doctor but i kind of slipped sideways into research and now i 'm an epidemiologist  and nobody really knows what epidemiology is epidemiology is the science of how we know in the real world if something is good for you or bad for you and it 's best understood
 through example as the science of those crazy
  headlines  and these are just some of the examples these are from the daily mail every country in the world has a newspaper like this it has this bizarre ongoing philosophical project of dividing all the inanimate 
  objects in the world into the ones that either cause or prevent cancer here are some of the things they said cause cancer  divorce wi fi toiletries and coffee some things they say prevent cancer crusts red pepper licorice and coffee so you can see there are contradictions coffee both
  causes and prevents cancer as you start to read on you can see that maybe there 's some political valence behind some of this
 for women housework prevents breast cancer  but for men shopping could make you impotent so we know that we need to start unpicking the science behind this  and what i hope to show is that
 unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims isn 't a kind of nasty
  carping activity  it 's socially useful but it 's also an an extremely valuable
 explanatory tool because real science is about critically appraising the evidence for somebody else 's position that 's what happens in academic journals  it 's what happens
 at academic conferences the q & a session after a postdoc presents data is often a bloodbath  and nobody minds that we actively welcome it it 's like a consenting intellectual s & m activity
  so what i 'm going to show you is all of the main things all of the main features of my discipline evidence based medicine  and i will talk you through all of these and demonstrate how they 
  work  exclusively using examples of people getting stuff wrong we 'll start with the absolute weakest form of evidence known to man and that is authority in
 we don 't care how many letters you have after your name we want to know what your reasons are for believing something how do you know that something is good for us or bad for us 
 but we 're also unimpressed by authority because it 's so easy to contrive  this is somebody called dr gillian mckeith phd or to give her full medical title  gillian mckeith 
 again  
 every country has somebody like this she is our tv diet
  five series of prime time television giving out very lavish and and exotic health advice  she it
 turns out has a non accredited correspondence course phd from somewhere in america  she also boasts that she 's a certified professional member of the american association of nutritional consultants which sounds very glamorous you get a certificate this one belongs to my dead cat hettie she
 was a horrible cat you go to the website fill out the form give them $ sixty  it arrives in the post
  that 's not the only reason we think this person is an idiot she also
 says things like eat lots of dark green leaves they contain chlorophyll and really oxygenate your blood  and anybody who 's done school biology remembers that chlorophyll and chloroplasts only make oxygen in sunlight 
 and it 's quite dark in your bowels after you 've eaten spinach  next  we need proper science proper evidence so 
 red wine can help prevent breast cancer this is a headline from the daily telegraph in the uk a glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer so you find this paper and
  piece of science it 's a description of the changes in the behavior of one enzyme when you drip a chemical extracted from some red grape skin onto some cancer cells in a dish 
 on a bench in a laboratory somewhere and that 's a really useful thing to describe in a scientific paper  but on the question of your own personal risk of getting breast cancer if you drink red wine it tells you absolutely bugger all actually it turns out that your risk of breast cancer
 increases slightly with every amount of alcohol you drink  so what we want are studies in real human people and here 's another example  this is from 
 britain 's leading diet nutritionist in the daily mirror our second biggest selling newspaper an australian study in two thousand and one found that olive oil in combination with fruits vegetables and pulses offers measurable protection
  if you eat olive oil and vegetables you 'll have fewer wrinkles they helpfully tell you how to find the paper  and what you find is an observational study  obviously nobody has been able to go 
  back to one thousand nine hundred and thirty get all the people born in one maternity unit and half of them eat lots of fruit and veg and olive oil half of them eat mcdonald 's  and then we see how many wrinkles you 've got later you have 
  to take a snapshot of how people are now  and what you find is of course people who eat veg and olive oil have fewer wrinkles  but that 's because
  who eat fruit and veg and olive oil are freaks
 they 're not normal  they 're like you they come to events like this they 're posh they 're wealthy less likely to have outdoor jobs less likely to do manual labor  they 
  have better social support are less likely to smoke for a host of fascinating interlocking social political and cultural reasons they 're less likely to have wrinkles that doesn
  what you want to do is a trial people think they 're familiar with the idea of a trial trials are old the first one was in the bible daniel one twelve it 's straightforward take a bunch of people split them in half treat one group one way the other group the other way a while later you see what happened to each of them i
 'm going to tell you about about one trial  which is probably the most
 well reported trial in the uk news media over the past decade  this is the trial of fish oil pills the claim fish oil pills
  improve school performance and behavior in mainstream children  they said we did a trial all the previous ones were positive this one will be too that should ring alarm bells if you know the answer to your trial you shouldn 't be doing one either
 you 've rigged it by design or
 you 've got enough data so there 's no need to randomize people anymore  so this is what they were going to do in their trial  
 they were taking three thousand children  they were going to give them  these huge fish oil pills six of them a day
 and then a year later  measure their school exam performance and compare
 their performance against what they predicted their exam performance would have been if they hadn 't had the pills  
 now can anybody spot a flaw in this design 
 and no professors of clinical trial methodology are allowed to answer this question so there 's no control
  a technical term  the kids got the pills and their performance improved what else could it possibly be if it wasn 't the pills  
 they got older  we all develop over time and of course there 's the placebo effect one of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine it 's not just taking a pill and performance or pain 
 improving it 's about our beliefs and expectations the cultural meaning of a treatment and this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of
  that two sugar pills a day are a more effective treatment for gastric ulcers than one sugar pill two sugar pills a day beats one a day  that 's an outrageous and ridiculous finding but it 's true 
 we know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment
 than a sugar pill a dummy pill with no medicine in it not because the injection
  pills do anything physically to the body but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention so we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated which is why we do trials where we control
 against a placebo where one half of the people get the real treatment and the other half get placebo  but that 's not enough 
 what i 've just shown you are examples of the very simple and straightforward ways that journalists and food supplement pill peddlers and naturopaths can distort evidence for their own purposes
  what i find really fascinating
 is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices  but slightly more sophisticated versions of them 
 in order to distort the evidence they give to doctors and patients and which we use to make vitally important decisions so firstly  trials against placebo  everybody thinks a trial should be a comparison of your new drug against placebo but in a lot of situations that 's wrong
 good treatment currently available  so we don 't want to know that your alternative new treatment is better than nothing but that it 's better than the best available treatment we have and yet  repeatedly 
 you consistently see people doing trials still against placebo  and you can get licensed to bring your drug to market with only data showing that it 's better than nothing  which is useless for a doctor like me trying to
  but that 's not the only way you can rig your data you can also rig your data
 by making the thing you compare your new drug against really rubbish you can give the competing drug in too low a dose  so people aren 't properly treated 
 you can give the competing drug in too high a dose  so people get side effects  and this is exactly what happened with antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia  
 twenty years ago  a new generation of antipsychotic drugs were brought in the promise was they would have fewer side effects so people set about doing trials of the new drugs against the old drugs
 but they gave the old drugs in ridiculously high doses twenty milligrams a day of haloperidol  and it 's a foregone conclusion if you give a drug at that high a dose it will have more side effects and your new 
  drug will look better ten years ago history repeated itself when risperidone the first of the new generation antipsychotic drugs came off copyright so anybody could make copies  everybody wanted to show their drug was better than risperidone  so you see trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone
  at eight milligrams a day  again not an insane dose not an illegal dose  but very much at the high end of normal so you 're bound to make your new drug look better 
 and so it 's no surprise that overall industry funded trials are four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials 
 but
 and it 's a big but
 when you look at the methods used by industry funded trials that they 're actually better than independently sponsored trials 
 and yet they always manage to get the result that they want  so how does this work 
 how can we explain this strange phenomenon well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action it 's withheld
 from doctors and patients and this is the most important aspect of the whole story it 's at the top of the pyramid of evidence we need to have all of the data on a particular treatment to know whether or not it really 
  is effective there are two different ways you can spot whether some data has gone missing you can use statistics or you can use stories i prefer statistics so that 's what i 'll do first this is a funnel plot a funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting if small negative trials have
  have gone missing in action  this is a graph of all of the trials done on a particular treatment as you go up towards the top of the graph what you see is each dot is a trial as you go up those
 are bigger trials so they 've got less error they 're less likely to be randomly false positives or negatives  so they all cluster together the big trials are closer to the true answer  
  trials have gone missing in action you can see it on one of these graphs so you see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappeared  this is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias 
 in studies of publication bias  and i think that 's the funniest epidemiology joke you will
 have prescribed to patients and i 'm a very nerdy doctor i hope i go out of my way to try and read and understand all the literature i read the trials on this they were all positive all well conducted i found no flaw 
 unfortunately it turned out that many of these trials were withheld in fact
  percent of all of the trials that were done on this drug were withheld from doctors and patients  now if you think about it if i tossed a coin a hundred times
  and i 'm allowed to withhold from you the answers half the times  then i can convince you that i have a coin with two heads if we remove half of the data we 
  can never know what the true effect size of these medicines is  and this is not an isolated story  around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld but it goes way beyond that the nordic cochrane group were trying to get ahold of the data on that to bring it all together
  cochrane groups are an international nonprofit collaboration that produce systematic reviews of all of the data that has ever been shown and they need to have access to all of the trial data 
 but the companies
 withheld that data from them  so did the european medicines agency for three years this is a problem that is currently lacking a solution and to show how
 big it goes  this is a drug called tamiflu which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on  and they spend that money on the promise that this is a drug which will 
  reduce the rate of complications with flu  we already have the data showing it reduces the duration of your flu by a few hours  but i don 't care about that governments don 't care i 'm sorry if you have the flu 
 i know it 's horrible but we 're not going to spend billions of dollars trying to reduce the duration of your flu symptoms by half a day 
  on the understanding they 'll reduce the number of complications which means pneumonia and death the infectious diseases cochrane group  which are based in italy has been trying to get the full data in a usable form
 out of the drug companies so they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not and they 've not been able to get that information  
 this is undoubtedly the single
 biggest ethical problem
 facing medicine today  we cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information  
 so it 's a little bit difficult
 from there
 to spin in some kind of positive conclusion  but i would say this 
 i think that sunlight is the best disinfectant
 all of these things are happening in plain sight  
 and they 're all protected by a force field of of tediousness  
 and i think with all of the problems in science one of the best things that we can do is to lift up the lid  finger around at the mechanics and peer in 
 thank you very much
