  i am very very happy to be amidst some of the most the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they 're
 reflecting on my glasses i am very happy and honored to be amidst
  innovative and intelligent people  i have listened to the three previous speakers  and guess what happened 
 every single thing i planned to say they have said it here  and it looks and sounds like i have nothing else to say 
 but there is a saying in my culture
 that if a bud
 leaves a tree without saying something that bud is a young one so i will since i am not young
  am very old  
 i still will say something 
 we are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment  because another conference is taking place in berlin  it is the  g8 summit 
 the  g8 summit
 proposes that the solution to africa 's problems should be a massive increase in aid
  something akin to the marshall plan  
 unfortunately  i personally do not believe in the marshall plan one because the benefits of the marshall plan have been overstated 
 its largest recipients were germany and france 
 and it was only two point five percent of their gdp an average african country receives foreign aid to the tune
 of thirteen  fifteen percent of its gdp
  and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries  
 but i want to say that there are two things we need to connect  how the media covers africa in the west and the consequences of that 
 by displaying despair  helplessness and hopelessness  
 the media is telling the truth about africa  and nothing but the truth
  however the media is not telling us the whole truth  because despair  civil war  hunger and famine  
 although they 're part and parcel of our our african reality  they are not the only reality  and secondly they are the smallest reality 
 africa has fifty three nations  we have civil wars only
 in six countries  which means that the media are covering only six countries
 africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness
 that the western media largely presents to its audience but the effect of that presentation is it appeals to sympathy  it appeals to pity  it appeals
 to something called charity 
  as a consequence the western view of africa 's economic dilemma
 is framed wrongly the wrong framing is a product of thinking that africa
 is a place of despair what should we do with it 
 we should give food to the hungry  we should deliver medicines to those who are ill  we should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war  and in the process africa has been stripped of
  i want to say that it is important to recognize that africa has fundamental weaknesses  
 but equally  it has opportunities and a lot of potential  
 we need to reframe the challenge that is facing africa from a challenge of despair
 despair which is called
 poverty reduction to a challenge of hope  we frame it as a challenge of hope  and that is
  worth creation the challenge facing all those who are interested in africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty it should be a challenge of creating
 wealth  once we change those two things
 if you say the africans are poor and they need poverty reduction you have
 the international cartel of good intentions moving onto the continent with what medicines for the poor
 food relief for those who are hungry  and
 peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war  and in the process  
 none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms not the causes of africa 's
 fundamental problems 
 sending somebody to school and giving them medicines ladies and
  does not create wealth for them 
 wealth is a function of income and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well paying job 
 now once we begin to talk about wealth creation in africa our second challenge will be who are the wealth creating agents in any society  
 they are entrepreneurs  [ unclear ] told us they are always about four percent
 of the population but sixteen percent are imitators
  but they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship  so where should we be putting the money we need to put money
 where it can productively grow support private
 investment in africa  both domestic and foreign support research institutions  because knowledge is an important
  but what is the international aid community doing with africa today 
 they are throwing large sums of money for primary health for primary education for food relief  the entire continent has been turned into a place of despair in 
  need of charity ladies and gentlemen can any one of you tell me a neighbor a friend a relative that you know who became rich
  by holding the begging bowl and receiving alms does any one of you in the audience have that person does any one of you know a country that developed because
 of the generosity and kindness of another well
 since i 'm not seeing the hand it appears that what i 'm stating is true
  me tell you this 
 external actors can only present to you an opportunity 
 the ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity 
 africa has received many opportunities many of them we haven 't benefited much  
  we lack the internal institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations i 'll give you an example  
 under the cotonou agreement formerly known as the lome convention 
 african countries have been given an opportunity by europe to export goods duty free to the european union market 
 my own country uganda
  a quota to export fifty thousand metric tons
 of sugar to the european union market  we haven 't exported one kilogram yet  we import fifty thousand
 metric tons of sugar
 from brazil and
 and cuba secondly  under the beef protocol of that agreement african countries that produce beef have quotas
  to the european union market  
 none of those countries  including africa 's most successful nation botswana has ever met its quota so  i want to argue today
 that the
 the fundamental source of africa 's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because
 it has a poor institutional and policy
  all forms of intervention need support the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth the kinds of institutions that increase productivity  
 how do we begin to do that and why is aid the bad instrument 
 aid is the bad instrument and do you know why because all governments across the world need money to survive 
 money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order you have to pay the army and the police to show law and order and because many of our governments
 are quite dictatorial
  they need really to have the army clobber the opposition  the second thing you need to do
 is pay your political hangers on why should people support their government well because it gives them good paying jobs 
 or in many african countries  unofficial opportunities to profit from corruption  
 the fact is no government in the world with the exception of a few like that of idi amin can seek to depend entirely
 on force as an instrument of rule many countries in the [ unclear ] they need legitimacy to get legitimacy  governments often need
 to deliver things like primary education primary health  roads  build hospitals and clinics 
 if the government 's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people  such a government is driven by
  govern in a more enlightened fashion  it will sit with those who create wealth talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary
 for them to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from them  the problem with the african continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in africa  
 the productive
  margin in our governments ' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy  
 it lies with international donors  rather than sit with ugandan 
 rather than sit with ugandan entrepreneurs  ghanaian businessmen  
 south african
 enterprising leaders our governments find it more
  productive to talk to the imf and the world bank  
 i can tell you even if you have ten ph ds you can never beat bill gates in understanding
 the computer industry  why  because the knowledge
 that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand a business it requires that you listen to the people  the private sector actors in that industry 
 governments in africa
  have therefore been given an opportunity by the international community to avoid building productive arrangements with your own citizens  and therefore allowed
 to begin endless negotiations with the imf and the world bank  and then it is the imf and the world bank that tell them what its citizens need in the process we the african
  implementation process in our countries  we have limited input because he who pays the piper calls the tune the imf the world bank and the cartel of good intentions in the world
 has taken over our rights as citizens  and therefore what our governments are doing  because they depend on aid is to listen
 to international creditors rather than their own citizens  but i want to put a caveat on my argument  and that
  caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive some aid may have built a hospital
 fed a hungry village  it may have built a road and that road may have served a very good role  the mistake of the international aid industry
 is to pick these isolated incidents of success generalize them
 pour billions and trillions of dollars into them  and then spread them across the whole world ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village 
  the skills  the practices  the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed
  aid increases the resources available to governments  
 and that makes
 working in a government the most profitable thing you can have as a person in africa seeking a career  
 by increasing the political attractiveness of the state especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in africa aid tends to accentuate
 ethnic tensions as every
 now begins struggling
 to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie  ladies and gentlemen  
 the most enterprising people in africa
 cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business
  governments are not changing it why because
 they don 't need to talk to their own citizens  they talk to international donors  
 so  the most enterprising africans end up going to work for government  and that has increased the political tensions in our countries precisely because we depend on aid  
 i also want to say that it is important for us to note
 that over the last fifty years  africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community
 in the form
 of technical assistance and financial aid and all other forms of aid  
 between one thousand nine hundred and sixty and two thousand and three our continent received six hundred billion dollars of aid 
 and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in africa  where has all the aid gone  
 i want to use the example of my own country called uganda
  and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there 
  budget expected revenue two point five trillion shillings the expected foreign aid one point nine trillion uganda 's recurrent expenditure
 by recurrent what do i mean  hand to mouth is two point six trillion  why does the government of uganda budget
  spend one hundred and ten percent of its own revenue  it 's because there 's somebody there called
 foreign aid who contributes for it but this shows you that the government of uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue
 to invest in productive investments  but rather it devotes this revenue to
 paying structure of public expenditure public administration which is largely patronage
  takes six hundred and ninety billion  
 the military three hundred and eighty billion agriculture which employs eighteen percent of our poverty stricken citizens  takes only eighteen billion 
 trade and industry
 takes forty three billion  and let me show you what does public expenditure
  public administration expenditure in uganda constitute 
 there you go  seventy cabinet ministers  
 one hundred and fourteen presidential advisers  by the way who never see the president except on television 
 and when they see him physically  
 it is at public functions like this  and even there it is him who advises them
 we have eighty one units of local government  each local government is organized like the central government a bureaucracy a cabinet a parliament  and so many jobs for the political hangers on 
 there were fifty six and when our president wanted to amend the constitution and remove term limits  
 he had to create twenty five new
  government bodies all of which have directors and the cars and the final thing this is addressed to mr bono in his work he may help us on this
 a recent government of uganda study found that there are three thousand
  drive motor vehicles at the
 minister of health headquarters uganda has nine hundred and sixty one sub counties 
 each of them with a dispensary  none of which has an ambulance so the four wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers  
 the permanent secretaries  the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects 
 while the poor
 die without
 ambulances
  i want to say that before i came to speak here i was told
 that the principle of tedglobal is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt  
 it should be short enough to arouse interest  but long enough to cover the subject i hope i have achieved
