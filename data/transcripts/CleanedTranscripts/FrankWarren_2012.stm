  my name is frank
 and i collect secrets 
 it all started with a crazy idea in november of two thousand and four 
 i printed up three thousand self addressed postcards just like this they were blank on one side and on the other side i
  listed some simple instructions i asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they 'd never told anyone before 
 and i handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of washington d c not knowing what to expect  
 but soon the idea began spreading virally 
 people began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards i started receiving secrets in my home
  mailbox not just with postmarks from washington d c but from texas california vancouver new zealand iraq  
 soon my crazy idea didn 't seem so crazy
 is the most visited 
  blog in the world  and this is my postcard collection today 
 you can see my
  wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half million secrets 
 what i 'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection starting with this one 
 i found these stamps as
  and i have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to i never did have someone 
 secrets can take many forms  they can be shocking or silly or soulful  
 they can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we 'll never meet
  this one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard this one obviously was made out of half a starbucks cup with
 a stamp and my home address written on the other side 
 dear birthmother i have great parents  i 've found love
 i 'm happy 
 secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas of frailty and heroism  
 playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now 
 everyone who knew me before
  i used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people so sometimes i didn 't wear panties and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself 
 this next one takes a little explanation before i share it with you i
  love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students  
 and sometimes afterwards i 'll stick around and sign books and take photos with students  and this next postcard was made out of one of those photos  
 and i should also mention that just like today at that postsecret event i was using a wireless
  your mic wasn 't off during sound check  we all heard you pee 
 this was really embarrassing when it happened  until i realized
 it could have been worse
  inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note i didn 't use  i feel like the happiest person on earth 
 one of these men is the father of my son  he pays me a lot to keep it a secret
  that saturday when you wondered where i was well i was getting your ring it 's in my pocket right now 
 i had this postcard posted on the postsecret blog two years ago on valentine 's day it was the very bottom the last secret in the long column and
 it hadn 't been up for more than a couple hours before i received this exuberant
  from the guy who mailed me this postcard and he said frank i 've got to share with you
 this story that just played out in my life he said my knees are still shaking 
 he said for three years my girlfriend and i  we 've made it this sunday morning ritual to visit the postsecret blog together and read the secrets out loud  i read some to
  's really brought us closer together through the years  
 and so when i discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom i was beside myself and i tried to act calm not to give anything away 
  and just like every sunday we started reading the secrets out loud to each other 
  but she finally did she got to that bottom secret his proposal to her and he said she read it once
 and then she read it again and she turned to him and said 
 is that our cat 
 laughter and when she saw him he was down on one knee he had the ring out he popped the question she said yes it was a very
  happy ending so i emailed him back and i said please share with me an image something that i can share with the whole postsecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending 
 and he emailed me this picture 
 i found your camera at lollapalooza
  i finally got the pictures developed and i 'd love to give them to you 
 this picture never got returned back to the people who lost it 
 but this secret has impacted many lives starting with a student up in canada named matty 
 matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website a website called
  cameras that they 've found memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos and matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them
 on his website every week  
 and people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they 've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for 
 this one 's my favorite
 matty has found this ingenious way
 to leverage the kindness of strangers  and it might seem like a simple idea and it is but the impact it can have on people 's lives can be huge 
 matty shared with me
 an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture that 's me
  my husband and son 
 the other pictures are of my very ill grandmother  thank you for making your site 
 these pictures mean more to me than you know my son 's birth is on this camera he turns four tomorrow 
 every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it sometimes crossing oceans sometimes
 going through language barriers 
 this is the last postcard i have to share with you today when people i love leave voicemails on my phone
 i always save them in case they die tomorrow and i have no other way of hearing their voice ever again 
 when i posted this secret  dozens of people
  sent voicemail messages from their phones sometimes ones they 'd been keeping for years messages from family or friends
 who had died 
 they said that by preserving those voices and sharing them 
 it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive 
 one young girl
 posted the last message she ever heard from
  her grandmother 
 secrets can take many forms  they can be shocking or silly or soulful  
 they can connect us with our deepest humanity
 or with people we 'll never meet again
  have you ever sent yourself a postcard 
 have you ever sent in a secret to postsecret fw i have one of my own secrets in every book  i think in some ways the reason i started the project even though i didn 't know it at the time was because i was
 struggling with my own secrets and it was through crowd sourcing it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me that i could uncover
 parts of my past that were haunting me
 and has anyone ever discovered which secret was yours in the book has anyone in your life been able to tell fw sometimes i share that information
