  i make technologies to help them communicate 
 now many of the problems that children with autism face  they have a common source and
 that source is that they find it difficult to understand abstraction
  symbolism and because of this they have a lot of difficulty with language  let me tell you
 a little bit about why this is  you see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup all of us can see it all of us understand this
  these are two other pictures of soup but you can see that these are more abstract these are not quite as concrete and when you get to language
  see that it becomes a word
 whose look the way it looks and the way it sounds has absolutely nothing to do with what it started with or what it represents which is the bowl of soup
  so it 's essentially a completely abstract a completely arbitrary representation of something which is in the real world  and this is something that children with autism have an incredible amount
  now that 's why most of the people that work with children with autism speech therapists educators
 what they do is they try to help children with autism communicate not with words but with pictures so if a child with autism wanted to say i want soup 
 that child would pick three different pictures i want and soup and they would put these together and then the therapist or the parent would understand that this is what the kid wants to say  
 and this has been incredibly effective for the last thirty forty years
 people have been doing this
 in fact a few years back i developed an app for the ipad
 which does exactly this it 's called avaz and the way it works is that kids select different pictures these pictures are sequenced together to form sentences 
 and these sentences are spoken out so avaz is essentially converting pictures  it 's a translator it converts pictures into speech
 now this was very effective there are thousands of children using this
  the world  and i started thinking about
 what it does and what it doesn 't do and i realized something interesting avaz helps children with autism learn words 
 what it doesn 't help them do is to learn
 word patterns  let me explain this in a little more detail  take this sentence
  it 's not just the words here that convey the meaning  it 's also the way in which these words are arranged the way these words are modified and arranged  and that 's why a sentence like 
 i want soup tonight is different from a sentence like soup want i tonight which is completely meaningless
  and that 's the fact that you can modify words and you can arrange them to have different meanings to convey different ideas  
 now this is what we call grammar
  and grammar is incredibly powerful because grammar is this one component of language which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have
 and allows us to convey an infinite amount of information
  infinite amount of ideas  it 's the way in which you can put things together in order to convey anything you want to and so after 
 i worried for a very long time about how i could give grammar to children with autism  the solution came to me from a very interesting perspective  i happened to
 chance upon a child with autism conversing with
 with her mom  and this is what happened completely out of
  what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to tease out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions so 
 she asked eat what do you want to eat ice cream you want to eat  somebody else wants to eat you want to eat cream now you want to eat ice cream in the evening 
 and it struck me that maybe this is what i was looking for instead of arranging words in an order  in sequence as a sentence  
 you arrange them in this map where they 're all linked together
 not by placing them one one after the other but in questions in question answer
  and so if you do this then what you 're conveying is not a sentence in english but what you 're conveying is really
 a meaning the meaning of a sentence in english  now meaning is really the underbelly in some sense of language it 's what comes after thought but before language 
 and the idea was that this particular representation might convey meaning in its raw form 
 so i was very excited by this you know hopping around all over the place trying to figure out if i can convert all possible sentences that i hear
  this  and i found that this is not enough why is this not enough this is not enough because if you wanted to convey something like negation  you want to say i don 't want soup 
 then you can 't do that by asking a question you do that by changing the word want 
 again if you wanted to say i wanted soup yesterday you do that by converting the word want into
  it 's a past tense  so this is a flourish which i added to make the system complete  this is a map of words joined together as questions and answers 
 and with these filters applied on top of them in order to modify them to represent certain nuances  
 let me show you this with a different example  let 's take this sentence i told the carpenter i could not pay him it 's a fairly complicated sentence 
 the way that this particular system works you can start with any part of this sentence i 'm going to start with the word
 this happened in the past so i 'm going to make that told 
 now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to ask questions  so who told  i told i told whom i told the carpenter  
 now we start with a different part of the sentence we start with the word pay and we add the ability filter to it to make it can pay then we make it 
  and we can make it couldn 't pay by making it the past tense  so who couldn 't pay  i couldn 't pay  couldn 't pay whom  i couldn 't pay the carpenter
  and then you join these two together by asking this question what did i tell the carpenter 
 i told the carpenter i could not pay him  
 now think about this  this is 
 this is a representation
  and there are two or three interesting things about this first of all 
 i could have started anywhere
 i didn 't have to start with the word tell i could have started anywhere in the sentence and i could have made this entire thing 
 the second thing is if i wasn 't an english speaker if i was speaking in some other language  this map would actually hold true in any language  
 so long as the questions are standardized the map is actually independent of language
  so i call this freespeech and
 i was playing with this for many many months i was trying out so many different combinations of this 
 and then i noticed something very interesting about freespeech
 i was trying to convert language  convert sentences in english into sentences in freespeech and vice versa and back and forth  
 and i realized that this particular configuration this particular way of representing language  it allowed me to actually create very concise
  rules
 that go between freespeech on one side and english on the other  so i could actually write this set of rules that translates from this particular representation into english  and so i developed this thing i developed this thing called the freespeech engine which takes any 
  the input and gives out perfectly grammatical english text and by putting these two pieces together the representation and the engine
  was able to create
 an app a technology for children with autism that not only gives them words but also gives them grammar
  so i tried this out with kids with with autism and i found that there was an incredible amount of
 identification they 
  were able to create sentences in freespeech which were much more complicated but much more effective than equivalent sentences in
  english  and i started thinking about why that might be the case  
 and i had an idea and i want to talk to you about this idea next 
 in about one thousand 
 nine hundred and ninety seven about fifteen years back  there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language and they found something very interesting they found that when you learn a language as a as a
  you learn it with a certain part of your brain  and when you learn a language as an adult for example if i wanted to learn japanese right now
 a completely different part of my brain is used  now i don 't know why that 's the case but
 my guess is that that 's because when you learn a language as an adult you almost invariably learn it through
 your native language or through your first language  so what 's interesting about freespeech is that when you create a
  sentence or when you create language  a child with autism creates language with freespeech 
 they 're not using this support language they 're not using this bridge language  they 're directly constructing the sentence  
 and so this this gave me this idea is it possible to use freespeech not for children with autism
 but to teach language
  and so i tried a number of experiments  the first thing i did was i built
 a jigsaw puzzle in which these these questions and answers are coded in the form of of shapes in the form of colors  and you have people putting these together and trying to understand how this works  
  and i built an app out of it a game out of it in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement a sound reinforcement of visual structures  they 're able to learn language 
  this  this has a lot of potential a lot of promise and the government of india recently licensed this technology from us and they 're going to try it out with millions of different children
 trying to teach them english  
 and the dream  the hope  the vision really is that when they learn english this way they learn it with the same proficiency as their mother tongue
  let 's talk about speech  this is speech so speech is the primary mode of communication delivered between all of us  now what 's interesting about speech is that speech is 
  one dimensional because it 's sound it 's also one dimensional because our mouths are built that way our mouths are built to create one dimensional sound
  if you think about the brain the thoughts that we have in our heads
 are not one dimensional i mean we have these rich  complicated  multi dimensional ideas  
 now it seems to me that language is really the brain 's invention
 to convert this rich multi dimensional thought on one hand
 into speech on the other hand  now what 's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays and almost all of that is done in the language domain
  take google for example google trawls all these countless billions of websites all of which are in english  and when you want to use google you go into google search and you type in english  
 and it matches the english with the english  
 what if we could do this in freespeech instead 
 i have a suspicion that if we did this we 'd find that algorithms like searching like retrieval all of these things 
 are much simpler
 and also more effective  because they don 't process the data structure of speech  
 instead they 're processing the data structure of thought
  the data structure of thought that 's a provocative idea but let 's look at this in a little more detail  so this is the
  we have the free speech representation
 on one side 
 and we have the freespeech engine which generates english  now if you think about it freespeech i told you is completely language independent it doesn 't have any specific information in it which is about english  so everything that this system knows about english is actually encoded
 into the engine 
 that 's a pretty pretty interesting concept in itself  you 've encoded an entire human language into a software program
  but
 if you look at what 's inside the engine it 's actually not very complicated  it 's not very complicated code and what 's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really 
 and that gives this interesting idea  it might be very easy for us to actually create these engines
  and that gives another interesting idea for example supposing i was a writer say for a newspaper or for a magazine 
 i could create content in one language freespeech 
 and the person who 's consuming that content the person who 's who 's reading that that particular information
 could choose any engine  and they could read it in
  their own mother tongue  in their native language i mean
 this is an incredibly attractive idea especially for india  
 we have so many different languages there 's a song about india and there 's a description of of the country as
  language is beautiful  i think it 's the most beautiful of of human creations  i think it 's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented it entertains  it educates it enlightens  
 but what i like the most about language is that it empowers  i want to leave you with this this
 is a photograph of of my collaborators my earliest collaborators when i started working on language and autism and various other things
  the girl 's name is pavna and that 's her mother kalpana and pavna 's an entrepreneur  but her story is much more remarkable than mine because pavna is about
 twenty three she has quadriplegic cerebral palsy so ever since she was born she could neither move
 nor talk and everything that she 's accomplished so far  
  starting a company  collaborating with me to develop avaz all of these things she 's done with nothing more
 than moving her eyes
 daniel webster said this he said 
 if all of my possessions were taken from me with one exception  
 i would choose to keep the power of communication 
  that 's closest to my heart still remains
 the ability for this to empower children with disabilities to be able to communicate the power of communication to get back all the rest
