  twelve years ago i founded zipcar zipcar buys cars
 and parks them throughout dense metropolitan areas for people to use by the hour and by the day  instead of owning their own cars 
 each zipcar replaces
  fifteen personal cars and each driver drives about eighty percent less because they 're now paying the full cost all at once in real time  
 but what zipcar really did was make sharing the norm 
 now a decade later it 's really time to push the envelope a little bit  and so a couple years ago i moved to paris with my husband and
 youngest child
  buzzcar a year ago buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars to their friends and neighbors  
 instead of investing in a car we invest in a community 
 we bring the power of a corporation
 to individuals who add their cars to the network  some people call this 
  this does express the humanity of what 's going on and the personal relationships  
 but that is also like saying that it 's the same thing as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting that 's peer to peer 
 it 's like saying yard sales are the same thing as ebay  or
 craft fairs are the same thing as etsy
  but what 's really happening is that we 've got the power of a free and open internet and on top of that we 're putting a platform for participation 
 and the peers are now in partnership with the company  
 creating shared value on shared values  
 and each strengthening the other and doing what the other can 't do i call this peers inc 
 the incorporated
  the company is doing things that it does really well 
 what does it do really well it creates economies of scale  significant and  long term resource investment 
 the expertise of many different kinds of people and different kinds of minds  
 and for individuals consumers it 's bringing the standards rules and recourse that we really want as consumers and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise 
 and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation
 peers are giving and doing things that are incredibly expensive for companies to do 
 what do they bring they bring this fabulous diversity 
 expensive for companies 
 and what does that deliver it delivers localization and customization specialization 
 and all of this aspect about social networks and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there it
 's natural for me me and my friends i can connect to them
  easily  
 and it also delivers really fabulous innovation 
 and i 'll talk about that later  so we have the peers that are providing the services and the product and the company that 's doing the stuff that companies do 
 the two of these are delivering the best of both worlds some of my favorite examples in transportation
  have joined up  and a million rides are shared every day  it 's a phenomenal thing it 's the equivalent of two thousand five hundred tgv trains  
 and just think they didn 't have to lay a track or buy a car this is all happening with excess capacity 
 and it 's not just with transportation my love but of
  i met these founders just weeks after they had launched  and now in two years what would you do for five dollars  
 seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years what people would do for five dollars  
 and not just easy things that anyone can do this peers inc concept is in a very difficult and complex realm
  has four hundred thousand engineers who are delivering complex design and engineering services  
 when i talked to their ceo he had this great line he said we have a community that owns its own company 
 and then my all time favorite etsy  etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they 're selling it in a marketplace it just celebrated its seventh
  after seven years last year it delivered five hundred and thirty million dollars ' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects 
 i know you guys out there who are businesspeople are thinking oh my god i want to build one of those i see this incredible speed and scale you mean all i have to do is build a platform and all these people are going to put their stuff on top and i sit back and roll it in 
 building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do
 i think of the difference of
 google video versus youtube who would have thought that two young guys and a start up would beat out google video why  i actually have no idea why i didn 't talk to them  
  but i 'm thinking you know they probably had the share button a little bit brighter and to the right and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides that are always participating on these networks  
  peer platform now  and a peers inc company because i 've spent the last two years doing that in paris  
 so let me take you back how it 's so incredibly different building buzzcar than it was building zipcar because now every single thing we do has these two different bodies that i have to be thinking about the owners who are going to provide the cars
 and the drivers who are going to rent them every single decision i have to think about what
  is right for both sides there are many many examples and i 'll give you one that is not my favorite example insurance 
 it took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right 
 hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative they 'd never thought of it before
  too much money i just can 't even go there with lawyers  trying to figure out how this is different who 's responsible to whom  and the result was that we were able to provide owners
 protection for their own driving records and their own history the cars are completely insured during the rental  and it gives drivers what they need  and what do they need they need a low low
 deductible and 24 hour roadside assistance so
  this was a trick to get these two sides  so now i want to take you to the
 moment of
  when you 're an entrepreneur and you 've started a new company there 's the here 's all the stuff we do beforehand and then the service launches 
 what happens 
 so
 all those months of work they come into play last june one we launched it was an exciting moment
  all the owners are adding their cars it 's really exciting all the drivers are becoming members it 's excellent the reservations start coming in and here 
 owners who were getting text messages and emails that said hey  joe wants to rent your car for the weekend you can earn sixty euros  isn 't that great yes or no 
 no reply  like a huge proportion of them
 couldn 't be bothered after they had just started  they just signed up to reply
  thought duh robin this is the difference between industrial production and peer production industrial production  the whole point of industrial production is to provide a standardized exact service model
 that is consistent every single time and i 'm really thankful that my smartphone is made using industrial production and zipcar provides a very nice consistent service that works fabulously  but what does peer production do
 peer production
 is this completely different way of doing things and you have
 a big quality range  and so ebay  cleverly the first peer production peer inc company i 'd say  
 they figured out early on we need to have ratings and commentaries and all that yucky
 side stuff we can flag that and we can put it to the side and people who are buyers and consumers don 't have to deal with it  
 so going back 
 this is my look of excitement and joy  because all this stuff that i 'd also been hoping for actually really did happen  and what 's that that is the diversity of what 's going on 
 you have these different fabulous owners and their different cars
  they dress differently  and they look different and really i love these photos every time i look at them
  cool guys  excited guys  and here is selma who i love this driver and
 after a year we have one
  thousand cars that are parked across france and six thousand people who are members and eager to drive them 
 this would not be possible to do that in economic fashion for a traditional company  
 back to this spectrum so what 's happening is we had the yuck side but we actually had this real wow side 
 and i can tell you two great stories 
 a driver was telling me that they went to rent a car to go up the coast of france and the owner gave it to them  and said
  here 's where the cliffs are and here 's all the beaches and this is my best beach  and this is where the best fish restaurant is 
 and the peers also become  peers and owners create relationships  and so at the last minute
 people can a driver can say hey you know what i really need the car is it available and that person will say sure my wife 's at home go pick up the
  so you can have these really nice things that can 't happen  
 and it 's a kind of wow and i want to say wow type of thing that 's happening here because individuals if you 're a company  what happens is you might have ten people who are in charge of innovation or one hundred people who are in charge of innovation 
 what happens in peer  inc companies is that you have tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions of people who are creating experiments on this model and so out of all that influence and that effort
 you are having this this exceptional amount of
 of innovation that is coming out 
 so one of the reasons if we come back to why did i call it buzzcar i wanted to remind all of us about the power of the hive 
 and its incredible facility to create this platform that individuals want to
 want to participate and innovate on  and for me
  our future  and all of those problems that seem incredibly large  the scale is impossible the urgency is there peers  inc provides the speed and scale and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems 
 all we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation nontrivial
  so i continue to think
 that transportation is the center of the hard universe all problems come back to transportation for me  
 but there are all these other areas that are these profound big problems
 that i know that we can work on and people are working on them in many different sectors but there 's this really fabulous group of things with the power of this peers
