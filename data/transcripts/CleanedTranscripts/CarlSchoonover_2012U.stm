  drawing of the brain it
 's a diagram of the visual system  and some things look very familiar today  two eyes at the bottom  optic nerve flowing out from the back
  's a very large nose that doesn 't seem to be connected to anything in particular  
 and if we compare this to more recent representations of the visual system you 'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated over the intervening thousand years  and that 's because today we can see what 's inside of the brain rather than just looking at its overall shape  
 imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works
 and all you could see was a keyboard
  a mouse a screen 
 you really would be kind of out of luck you want to be able to open it up crack it open look at the wiring inside and up until a little more than a century ago  nobody was able to do that with 
  the brain nobody had had a glimpse of the brain 's wiring and that 's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it put it under even a very powerful microscope there 's nothing there it 's gray  formless there 's no structure it won 't tell you anything 
  new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring the computer was cracked open 
 so what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the golgi stain and it works in a very particular way instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue 
 it somehow only stains about one percent of them it clears the forest reveals the trees inside if everything had been labeled
 nothing would have been visible so somehow it shows what 's there  spanish neuroanatomist santiago ramon y cajal who 's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience applied this golgi stain which yields data which looks like this
  and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell the neuron and if you 're thinking of the brain as a computer this is the transistor  
 and very quickly cajal realized that neurons don 't operate
 alone but rather make connections with others that form circuits just like in a computer 
 today a century later when researchers want to visualize neurons they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them  and there 's several ways of doing this but one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein  
 now green fluorescent protein which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent
  is very useful because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell that cell will glow green
 or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein you get a cell to glow many different colors  and so coming back to the brain this is from a genetically engineered mouse called 
 brainbow and it 's so called of course because all of these neurons are are glowing different colors  
  of neurons molecules rather than the entire cell 
 and there 's several ways of doing this but one of the most popular ones involves using antibodies and you 're familiar of course with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system  but it 
  turns out that they 're so useful to the immune system because they can recognize specific molecules like for example the coat protein of a virus that 's invading the body  
 recognize specific molecules inside of the brain recognize specific substructures of the cell and identify them individually 
 and a lot of the images i 've been showing you here are very beautiful but they 're also very powerful they have great explanatory power this for example is an antibody staining against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain
  and you 've heard of serotonin of course in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety you 've heard of ssris which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases  and in order 
  to understand how serotonin works it 's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is and antibody stainings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question
  tissue were developed and
