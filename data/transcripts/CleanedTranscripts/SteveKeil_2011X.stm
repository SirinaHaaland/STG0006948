  i 'm here today
 to start a revolution  now before you get up in arms or you break into song or you pick a favorite color  i want to define what i mean
  i mean a drastic and far reaching change in the way we think and behave the way we think and the way we behave  
 now why steve  why do we need a revolution  we need a revolution because things aren 't working they
 're just not working  and that makes me really sad because i 'm sick and tired of things not working
  you know i 'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential i 'm sick and tired of us being last 
 and we are last place in so many things for example 
 social factors  we 're last place in europe in innovation 
 there we are right at the end right at the bottom last place as a culture that doesn 't value innovation we 're last place in health care and that 's important for a sense of
  there we are not just last in the e u we 're last in europe at the very bottom  
 and worst of all it
 just came out three weeks ago many of you have seen it the economist we 're the saddest place on earth  relative to gdp per capita
 the saddest place on earth 
 that 's social let 's look at education where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the oecd last in reading math and science
  lowest perception in the e u that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society 
 why as a result what happens  the lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses  
 and this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies we hire the most people  we create the most taxes  
 so if our engine 's broken  guess what last in europe gdp per capita 
 last
  so it 's no surprise guys that sixty two percent of bulgarians are not optimistic about the future  we 're unhappy we have bad education and we have the worst businesses
  and these are facts guys this isn 't story tale it 's not make believe it 's not it 's not a conspiracy i have got against bulgaria
  these are facts so i think it should be really really clear that our system is broken  the way we think the way we behave our operating system of behaving is broken we need a drastic change in the way 
  we think and behave to transform bulgaria for the better for ourselves for our friends for our family and for our future how did this happen let
 because we don 't value play  
 i said play all right in case some of you forgot what play is this is what play looks like babies play  
 kids play adults play we don 't value play in fact we devalue play 
 and we devalue it in three areas let 's go back to the same three areas social
  state over the individual and squashing inadvertently creativity  individual  self expression and innovation 
 and instead what do we value because it 's shown the way we apply generate and use knowledge
 is affected by our social and institutional context which told us what in communism to
  i can 't tell you how many times i 've been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground 
 heaven forbid they play in the dirt the kal or even worse lokvi  water that will kill them i have been told
 by babas and dyados that we shouldn 't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life 
 we have a serious meme running through it 's a social gene running through us it 's a serious gene it 's forty five years of it that 's created what i call the 
 baba factor 
 and here 's how it works step one woman says i want to have a baby iskam baby step two we get the baby
  woohoo  but then what happens in step three  i want to go back to work because i need to further my career or i just want to go have coffees i 'm going to give bebko to baba  
 but we need to remember that baba 's been infected by the serious meme for for forty five years 
 so what happens she passes that virus on to baby and it takes a really really really long time as the redwood trees
  that serious meme to get out of our operating system 
 what happens then it goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for one hundred years  that values rote learning memorization and standardization and devalues 
 questioning creativity
  it 's a crap system true story i went looking for a school for my kid  we went to this prestigious little school and they say
 they 're going to study math ten times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff  and we said well what about play and recess 
 and they said ha  there won 't be a single moment in the schedule 
 and we said he 's five what a crime
  what a crime and it 's a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we 're creating mindless robotic workers to put bolts in pre drilled holes but i 'm sorry 
 the problems of today are not the problems of the industrial revolution  we need adaptability the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative we don 't
  qualities of a bulgarian work autocratic
 do what i say because i 'm the chef i 'm the boss and i know better than you untrusting you 're obviously a criminal so i 'm going to install cameras 
 controlling
 you 're obviously an idiot so i 'm going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don 't step out of the box so they 're restrictive don 't use your mobile phone don 't use your laptop don 't search the internet
  don 't be on i m that 's somehow unprofessional and bad and at the end of the day it 's unfulfilling because you 're controlled you 're restricted you 're not valued
 and you 're not having any fun 
 in social in education and in our business don 't value play and that 's why we 're last because we don 't value play 
 and you can say that 's ridiculous steve  what a dumb idea it can 't be because of play
  we have the serious meme in us  well i 'm going to say no and i will prove it to you
 in the next part of the speech that play is the catalyst it is the revolution that we can use to transform bulgaria for the better 
 play  our brains
 are hardwired for play  evolution has selected over millions and billions of years for
 play in animals and in humans and you know what  evolution does a really really good job of deselecting traits that aren 't advantageous to us
 and selecting traits for competitive advantage nature isn 't stupid  and it selected for play  throughout the animal kingdom for example ants  
 ants play 
  when they 're playing they 're learning the social order and dynamics of things rats play  but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains
 and they learn tasks better skills 
 kittens play  we all know kittens play  but what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play
 are unable to interact socially they can still
  but they can 't be social 
 bears play  
 but what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer  it 's not the bears that learn how to fish better it 's the ones that play more 
 and a final really interesting study
 it 's been shown a correlation between play and brain size  the more you play the bigger the brains there are dolphins pretty big brains play a
  but who do you think
 with the biggest brains are the biggest players  
 yours truly humans 
 kids play we play of every nationality of every race of every color of every religion it 's a universal thing we play  
 and it 's not just kids it 's adults too really cool term neoteny
 the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults and who are the
  we play sports we do it for fun  or as olympians or as professionals we play musical instruments we dance we kiss we sing we just goof around  
 we 're designed by nature to play from birth to old age  we 're designed to do that
 continuously to play and play a lot and not stop playing  it
  a huge benefit 
 just like there 's benefits to animals there 's benefits to humans 
 for example  it 's been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala in the area where it controls emotions it 's been shown to promote pre frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening 
 as a result what happens we develop more emotional maturity if we play more  we develop better decision making ability if we
  the benefits to play it is a genetic
 birthright that we have like walking or speaking or seeing  
 and if we handicap ourselves with play  we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have  we hold ourselves back 
 little exercise just for a second close your eyes and
  try to imagine a world without play  imagine a world without theater without the arts without song without dancing
  without soccer without football without laughter  
 what does this world look like it
 's pretty bleak it 's pretty glum now imagine your workplace is it fun is it playful  or maybe the workplace of your friends here we
 're forward thinking is it fun is it playful  or is it crap is it autocratic  controlling restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling  
 we have this concept that the opposite
 of play is work  
 we even feel guilty if we 're seen playing at work oh my colleagues see me laughing i must not have enough work or oh i 've got to hide because my boss might see me
 's going to think i 'm not working hard 
 but i have news for you our thinking is backwards  
 the opposite of play is not work  the opposite of play is depression  
 it 's depression in fact play improves our work just like there 's benefits for
  humans and animals there 's benefits for play at work for example it stimulates creativity 
 it increases our openness to change 
 it improves our ability to learn it provides a sense of purpose and mastery two key motivational things that increase productivity  
 through play
 so before you start thinking of play as just not serious play doesn 't mean frivolous you know
 the professional athlete that loves skiing he 's serious about it but he loves it he 's having fun
  's in the groove he 's in the flow a doctor might be serious but laughter 's still a great medicine 
 our thinking is backwards  we shouldn 't be feeling guilty we should be celebrating play  
 quick example from the corporate world fedex easy motto people service profit if you treat your people
  sense of mastery and purpose what happens they give better service
 not worse but better and when customers call for service and they 're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled how do the customers feel 
 they feel great and what do great customers do great feeling customers they buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends which leads to more profit 
 people service profit play increases productivity not decreases and you 're going to say
  gee that can work for fedex out there in the united states but it can 't work in bulgaria  
 no way we 're different 
 it does work in bulgaria you guys two reasons one play is universal there 's nothing weird about bulgarians that we can 't play  besides the serious meme that we have to kick out two i 've tried it i
 've tried at sciant when i got there we had zero happy customers
  not one customer would refer us i asked them all 
 we had marginal profit i did  we had marginal profits and we had unhappy stakeholders 
 through some basic change change like improving transparency 
 change like promoting  self direction and collaboration encouraging collaboration not autocracy 
 the things like having a results focus i don 't care when you get in in the morning  i don 't care when you leave i care that your customer and your team is happy
 and you 're organized with that why do i care if you get in at nine o 'clock  
 basically promoting fun  through promoting fun and a great environment we were able to transform sciant and in just three short years sounds like a long time but change is slow
 every customer from zero to every customer referring us above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders
 one of the rankings for best employer for small business  independent analysis
 from anonymous employees on their surveys  it does  and it can work in bulgaria there 's nothing holding us back except our own
 mentality about play so some steps that we can take to finish up
 how to make this revolution through play  first of
  have to believe me if you don 't believe me
  well just go home and think about it some more or something 
 second of all if you don 't have the feeling of play in you you need to rediscover play whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy that you enjoyed only six months ago but now that you 've 
  got that promotion you can 't enjoy  because you feel like you have to be serious rediscover it i don 't
  to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution you guys have to and if you 're not feeling it your colleagues your employees aren 't going to feel it 
 you 've got to go back and say hey i 'm going to trust you weird concept i hired you i should trust you i 'm going to let you make decisions i 'm going to empower you and i
 'm going to delegate
  the lowest level rather than the top i 'm going to encourage constructive criticism 
 i 'm going to let you challenge authority because it 's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we 're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today 
 we 're not always right as leaders  we 're going to eradicate fear fear is the enemy of play and we 're going to do things
  eliminate restrictions you know what let them use their mobile phone for personal calls
 heaven forbid  let them be on the internet  let them be on instant messengers  let them take
 long lunches 
 lunch is like the recess for work  it 's when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain you meet your friends  you have a beer you have some food you talk
  you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn 't have had before  let them do it 
 give them some freedom and in general  let them play let them have fun at the workplace we spend so much of our lives at the workplace and it 's supposed to be what a miserable grind  so that twenty years from now we wake up and say is this it is
 that all there was unacceptable nepriemliv 
  so in summary  we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave  but we don 't need
 a workers ' revolution  we don 't need a workers ' revolution  what we need
 is a players  ' uprising  
 what we need is a players  ' uprising  what we need is a players ' uprising seriously we need to band together today is the start of the uprising but what you need to do
 is fan the flames of the revolution
  you need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked
 about reinvigorating our lives our schools and our work with play  
 about how play promotes a sense of promise and self fulfillment of how play promotes innovation and productivity and
  how play creates meaning 
 because we can 't do it alone we have to do it together and together if we do this and share these ideas on play  we can transform bulgaria for the better
