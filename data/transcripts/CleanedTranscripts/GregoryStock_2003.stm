  the future of life where the unraveling of our biology and bring up the lights a little bit i don 't have any slides i 'm just going to talk
 about where that 's likely to carry us  and you know  i
  all the visions of the first couple of sessions it almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk about the future it
 felt wrong to do that in some way  and yet i don 't really think it is because when it comes down to it
  it 's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain what
 people in the future are going to remember about this period i want to talk to you a little bit
 about why the visions of jeremy rivkins
 who would like to ban these sorts of technologies or of the bill joys who would like to relinquish them are actually
 to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us 
 i 'm focusing on biology  the biological sciences the reason i 'm doing that is because those are going to be the areas that are the most significant to us
 the reason for that is
  really very simple  it 's because we 're flesh and blood we 're biological creatures  and
 what we can do with our biology is going to shape our future
 and that of our children
 and that of their children whether we gain control over aging whether we learn to protect ourselves from alzheimer 's and heart disease and cancer 
 i think that shakespeare really put
  it very nicely  and i 'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did 
 he said and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe 
 and then from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale 
 life is short you know  and we need to think about planning a little
  all going to eventually even in the developed world going to have to lose everything that we love  when you 're beginning to rot a little bit  
 all of the videos crammed into your head all of the extensions that extend your various powers are going to being to seem a little secondary  
 and you know i 'm getting a little bit gray so is ray kurzweil
  so is eric drexler 
 this is where it 's really central to our lives  
 now i know there 's been a whole lot of hype about our power to control biology you just have to look at the human genome project  it wasn 't two years ago that everybody was talking about
 we 've found the holy grail of biology  we 're deciphering the code of codes we 're reading the book of life
 it 's a little bit reminiscent of one
  when neil armstrong walked on the moon and everybody was about to race out toward the stars  
 and we 've all seen two thousand and one a space odyssey you know it 's two thousand and three and there is no hal  
 and there is no odyssey to our own moon much less the moons of jupiter  and we 're still picking up pieces of the challenger 
 so it 's not surprising that some people would wonder whether maybe
 thirty or forty years from now we 'll look back at this instant in time and
  all of the sort of talk about the human genome project and what all this is going to mean to us well it will
 really mean precious little  and i just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case because when we talk about
 our genetics and our biology and modifying and
  altering and adjusting these things we 're talking about changing ourselves 
 and this is very critical stuff 
 if you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives you just have to go to any major city this is not the stomping ground of our pleistocene ancestors  what 's happening is we 're taking this technology it 's becoming more precise more potent
 and we 're turning it back upon ourselves before it 's all done we are going to alter ourselves every bit as much as we have changed
  the world around us  it 's going to happen a lot sooner than people imagine on the way there it 's going to
 completely revolutionize medicine and health care that 's obvious it 's going to change the way we have children  it 's going to change the way we manage and alter our emotions it 's going to probably change the human lifespan it will really make us question
 what it is to be a human being
 the larger context of this is that are two unprecedented
 revolutions that are going on today  the first of them is the obvious one the silicon revolution  
 which you all are very very familiar with it 's changing our lives in so many ways and it will continue to do that what the essence of
  is that we 're taking the sand at our feet the inert silicon at our feet  and we 're breathing a level of complexity into it that rivals that of life itself and may even surpass it
 as an outgrowth of that as a child of that revolution is the revolution in biology  
 the genomics revolution proteomics metabolomics all of these omics that sound so terrific on grants and on business
  what we 're doing is we are seizing control of our evolutionary future i mean we 're essentially using technology to just jam evolution into  fast forward it 's not at all clear where it 's going to take us  
 but in five to ten years we 're going to start see some very profound changes  the most immediate changes that we 'll see are things like in medicine 
 there is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine as we start to be able to identify
 all of the risk factors that we have as individuals  
 but who is going to pay for all this and how are we going to understand all this complex information that is going to be the it challenge of the next generation 
 is communicating all this information there 's pharmacogenomics the combination of pharmacology and
  tailoring drugs to our individual constitutions that
 juan talked about a little bit earlier that 's going to have amazing impacts and it 's going to be used for diet as well  and nutritional supplements and such  
 but it 's going to have a big impact because we 're going to have niche drugs and 
  we aren 't going to be able to support the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today  
  the approval process is going to fall apart actually  it 's too slow  it 's too risk averse and
 it is really not suited for the future that we 're moving into another thing is that we 're just going to have to deal with this knowledge it 's really wonderful when we hear 
 oh  ninety nine point nine percent of the letters in the code are the same we 're all identical to each other isn 't it
  and look around you and know that what we really care about
 is that little bit of difference we look the same to a visitor from another planet maybe  but not to each other
 because we compete with each other all time and we 're going to have to come to grips with the fact that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about and between subpopulations of humans as well 
 to deny that that 's the case is not a very good start on that 
 a generation or so away
 there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen 
 that 's when we 're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves now i don 't mean extra gills or something something we care about like aging what if we could
 unravel aging and understand it begin to retard the process or even reverse it it would change absolutely everything  and it 's obvious to anyone that if we can
  do this we absolutely will do this whatever the consequences are the second is
 modifying our emotions  
 i mean ritalin  viagra 
 things of that sort prozac you know this is just clumsy little baby steps what if you could take a little
 concoction of pharmaceuticals that would make you feel really contented
 just happy to be you 
 are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn 't have any overt side effects 
 probably not and if you don 't who are you going to be why do you do what you do  
 we 're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior it 's going to be very challenging to deal with
 the third area is reproduction  
 the idea that we 're going to chose our children 's genes as we begin to understand what genes
  say about who we are that 's the focus of my book redesigning humans where i talk about the kinds of choices we 'll make and the challenges it 's going to present to society  
 there are three obvious ways of doing this the first is cloning  it didn 't happen  
 it 's a total media circus  it will happen in five to ten years and when it does it 's not going to be that big a deal  the birth of a delayed identical twin is not
 going to shake western civilization  
 but there are more important things that are already occurring  embryo screening 
 you take a six to eight cell embryo you tease out one of the cells you run a genetic test on that cell and depending on the results of that test you either implant that embryo or you discard
  it 's already done to avoid rare diseases today  and pretty soon it 's going to be possible to avoid
 virtually all genetic diseases in that way
 as that becomes possible this is going to move from something that is used by those who have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization 
 to the wealthy who want to protect their children to just about everybody else and in that process that 's going to morph from being just for diseases to being for lesser vulnerabilities
  like risk of manic depression or something to picking
 personalities  temperaments traits these sorts of things
 of course there is going to be genetic engineering directly going in it 's a little bit further away but not that far away going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo 
  the way i suspect it will happen is using artificial chromosomes and extra chromosomes so we go from forty six to forty seven or forty eight and one that is not heritable
 because who would want to pass on to their children the archaic
 enhancement modules that they got twenty five years earlier from their parents  it 's a joke of course they wouldn 't want to do that
 they 'll want the new release those kinds of loose analogies with
  computers  and with programming are actually much deeper than that 
 they are really going to come to operate in this realm now not everything that can be done should be done  
 and it won 't be done  
 but when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world which is going to be the case with these technologies when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial which is already the case  and when they 're almost impossible
  to police it 's not a question of if this is going to happen  it 's when and where and how it 's going to happen
 humanity is going to go down this path  and it 's going to do so for two reasons  
 the first is that all these technologies are just a spin off of mainstream medical research that everybody wants to see happen  it is being funded very very
 in a big way  the second is
 that 's what we do  we try and use our technology to improve our lives in one way or another to imagine that we 're not going to use these technologies when they become available 
 is as much a denial of who we are as to imagine that we 'll use these technologies and not fret and worry about it a great deal  
 the lines are going to blur  and they already are between therapy and enhancement
  between treatment and prevention between need and desire  
 that 's really the the central one i believe people can try and ban these things they undoubtedly will they have but ultimately all this is going to do is just shift development 
 elsewhere  it 's going to drive these things from view  it 's going to reserve the technology for the wealthy because they are in the best position to circumvent any of these
  sorts of laws  and it 's going to deny us the information that we need to make wise decisions about how to use these technologies 
 so sure we need to debate these things  and i think it 's wonderful that we do  but we shouldn 't kid ourselves
 and think that we 're going to reach a consensus about these things that is simply not going to happen
  they touch us too deeply  and they depend too much upon history upon philosophy upon religion upon culture upon politics
 some people are going to see this as an abomination as the worst thing as just awful
 other people are going to say this is great this is the flowering of human endeavor
 the one thing though that is really dangerous about these sorts of technologies is that it
  's easy to become seduced by them  and to focus too much on all the high technology possibilities that exist 
 and to lose touch
 with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health 
 there are too many people that think that high technology medicine is going to keep them  save them from overeating 
 from eating a lot of fast foods from not getting any exercise it 's not going to happen
 in the midst of all this amazing technology and all these things that are occurring  it 's really interesting because there is sort of a counter revolution that is going on a resurgence of interest in
 remedies from the past in nutraceuticals in all of these sorts of things that some people in the pharmaceutical industry particularly like to brand as
  is driven by it as well
 because that is how we 're gathering all this information and linking it and integrating it together 
 there is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well and that 's where about half of our drugs come so we shouldn 't dismiss this because it 's an enormous opportunity to use
 these sorts of results or these random loose trials from the last thousand years about
  what has impacts on our health  and to use our advanced technologies to pull out what is beneficial from this sea of noise basically 
 in fact this isn 't just abstract i just formed a biotechnology company that is using this sort of an approach to develop therapeutics for alzheimer 's and other
 diseases of aging and we 're making some real progress so
 here we
  are it 's the beginning of a new millennium 
 if you look forward  
 i mean future humans far before the end of this millennium in a few hundred years they are going to look back at this moment 
 and from the beginning of today 's sessions you 'd think that they 're going to see this as this horrible difficult painful period that we struggled through  
 and i don 't think that 's what 's going to happen
 they 're going to do like everybody does they are going to forget about all that stuff  
 and they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time they are going to think about it as this glorious instant
 when we laid down the very foundations of their lives of their society of their future
 you know it 's a little bit like a birth where there is this bloody
  and
 then what comes out of it new life actually as was pointed out earlier  we forget about all the struggle there was in
 getting there
 so to me it 's clear that one of the foundations of that future is going to be the reworking of our biology 
  going to come gradually at first it 's going to pick up speed we 're going to make lots of errors that 's the way these things work 
 to me it 's an incredible privilege to be alive now and to be to be able to witness this thing it is something that is a unique instant in the history of all of life it
 will always be remembered  
 and what 's extraordinary is that we 're not just observing this we are the architects of this  i think that we should be proud of it
  so difficult and challenging is that we are also the objects of these changes it 's our health  it 's our lives  it 's our future it 's our children 
 and that is why they are so very troubling to so many people who would pull back in fear  i think that our choice
 in the choice of life is not whether we 're going to go down this path we are definitely
  it 's how we hold it
 in our hearts  it 's how we look at it  i think thucydides really spoke to us very clearly in four hundred and thirty b c 
 he put it nicely again i 'll use the words in the same order he did 
 the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision
  of what is before them  both glory and danger alike  and yet notwithstanding  they go out and they meet it
