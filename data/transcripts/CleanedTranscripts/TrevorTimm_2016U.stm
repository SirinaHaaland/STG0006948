  so this
 is james risen 
 you may know him as the pulitzer prize winning reporter for the new york times  
 long before anybody knew edward snowden 's name risen wrote a book in which he famously exposed
  was illegally wiretapping the phone calls of americans 
 but it 's another chapter in that book that may have an even more lasting impact in it he describes a catastrophic us intelligence operation
 in which the cia quite literally handed over blueprints of a nuclear bomb to iran if that sounds crazy go read it it 's an incredible story  
 but you know who didn 't like that chapter the us government for nearly a decade afterwards
  risen was the subject of a us government investigation in which prosecutors demanded that he testify against one of his alleged sources 
 and along the way he became the face for the us government 's recent pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists 
 you see under the first amendment the press has the right to publish secret information in the public
  but it 's impossible to exercise that right if the media can 't also gather that news and protect the identities of the brave men and women who get it to them  
 so when the government came knocking risen did what many brave reporters have done before him he refused
 and said he 'd rather go to jail 
 so from two thousand and seven to two thousand and fifteen risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison 
 that is until just days before the trial when a curious thing happened
 suddenly after years of claiming it was vital to their case the government dropped their demands to risen altogether 
 it turns out in the age of electronic surveillance  there are very few places reporters and sources can hide 
 and instead of trying and failing to have risen testify they could have his digital trail testify against him
  so completely in secret and without his consent prosecutors got risen 's phone records 
 they got his email records 
 his financial and banking information his credit reports even travel records with a list of flights he had taken 
 and it was among this information that they used to convict jeffrey sterling risen 's alleged source and cia whistleblower 
  this is only one case of many 
 president obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers 
 and instead his justice department has prosecuted more than all other administrations combined now 
 you can see how this could be a problem  especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret 
 since nine eleven  virtually every important story about national security has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist so we risk seeing the
  press unable to do their job that the first amendment is supposed to protect because of the government 's expanded ability to spy on everyone  
 but just as technology has allowed the government to circumvent reporters ' rights 
 the press can also use technology to protect their sources even better than before 
 and they can start from the moment they begin speaking with them  rather than on the witness stand after the fact
  software now exists that wasn 't available when risen was writing his book and is much more 
 than regular emails or phone calls 
 for example one such tool is securedrop 
 an open source whistleblower submission system that was originally created by the late internet luminary aaron swartz and is
  where i work freedom of the press foundation 
 instead of sending an email  you go to a news organization 's website like this one here on the washington post 
 from there you can upload a document or send information much like you would on any other contact form 
 it 'll then be encrypted and stored on a server that only the news organization has access to 
 so the government can no longer secretly demand the information and much of the information they would demand wouldn 't be available in the first
  place 
 securedrop though is really only a small part of the puzzle for protecting press freedom in the 21st century  
 unfortunately governments all over the world are constantly developing new spying techniques that put us all at risk 
 and it 's up to us going forward to make sure that it 's not just the tech savvy whistleblowers
  like edward snowden who have an avenue for exposing wrongdoing 
 it 's just as vital that we protect the next veteran 's health care whistleblower alerting us to overcrowded hospitals 
 or the next environmental worker
 sounding the alarm about flint 's dirty water or a wall street insider
 warning us of the next financial crisis 
 after all these tools weren 't just built to help the brave men and women who expose crimes  but are meant to protect all of our rights under the constitution
