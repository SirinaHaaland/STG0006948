  well we all know the world wide web has
 absolutely transformed publishing broadcasting commerce and social connectivity  but where did it all come from  
 and i 'll quote three people vannevar bush doug engelbart and
  vannevar bush vannevar bush was the u s government 's chief scientific adviser during the war and 
 he published an article in a magazine called atlantic monthly  and the article was called as we may think 
 and what vannevar bush was saying was the way we use information is broken
 we don 't work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth the brain works by association with one item in
  its thought it snaps instantly to the next item and the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process 
 and so he suggested a machine  and he called it the memex  and the memex would link information one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth  now this was 
 a computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking and
  anything about it so this was before the computer was invented  and he proposed this machine called the memex and he had a platform where you linked information to other information and then you could call it up at will  
 so spinning forward one of the guys who read this article was a guy called doug engelbart and he was a u s air force officer  and he was reading it in their library in the far east  
 and he was so inspired by this article
 kind of directed the rest of his life and by the mid 60s he was able to put this into action when he worked at the stanford research lab in california 
 he built a system the system was designed to augment human intelligence it was called 
 and in a premonition of today 's world of cloud computing and softwares of service 
 his system was called nls for on line system
  and this is doug engelbart he was giving a presentation at the fall joint computer conference in
 what he showed he sat on a stage like this  and he demonstrated this system he had his head mic like i 've got  and he works this system  
 and you can see he 's working between documents and graphics and so forth and he 's driving it all with this
 this platform here with a  five finger keyboard and the world 's first computer mouse which he specially designed in order to do this system  so this is where the
  mouse came from as well  so this is doug engelbart 
 the trouble with doug engelbart 's system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds so for a personal computer a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane it wasn 't really very practical  
 but spin on to the  80s when personal computers did arrive then there was room for this kind of system on personal
  and my company owl
 built a system called guide for the apple macintosh and we delivered the world 's first hypertext system  
 and this began to get a head of steam apple introduced a thing called hypercard and they made a bit of a fuss about it they had a 12 page supplement in the wall street journal the day it launched 
 the magazines started to cover it byte magazine and communications at the acm had special issues covering hypertext
 we developed a pc version of this product as well as the macintosh version 
 and our pc version became
  quite mature these are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s 
 you were able to deliver documents were able to do it over networks we developed a system such that it had a markup language
 based on html we called it hml hypertext markup language  and the system was capable of doing very very large documentation systems over computer
  system to a trade show in versailles near paris
 in late november one thousand nine hundred and ninety and i was approached by a nice young man called tim  berners lee who said are you ian ritchie and i said yeah 
 and he said i need to talk to you 
 and he told me about his proposed system called the world wide web  and i thought well that 's got a pretentious name especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office 
 but he was completely convinced that his world wide web would take over the world one day  and he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it because his
  system didn 't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything it was just just plain text  i thought well you know interesting but a
 guy from cern he 's not going to do this so we we didn 't do it 
 in the next couple of years the hypertext community didn 't recognize him either in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two his paper was rejected for the hypertext conference 
  there was a table at the conference in seattle and a guy called marc andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the world wide web and i saw it and i thought  yep that 's it  
 and the very next year in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four we had the conference here in edinburgh  and i had no opposition in having tim  berners lee as the keynote speaker  
 so that puts me in pretty illustrious company there was a guy called dick rowe who was at decca records and turned down the beatles  
 there was a guy called gary kildall who went flying his plane when
 ibm came looking for an operating system for the ibm pc
  pc  and he wasn 't there so they went back to see bill gates  and the twelve publishers who turned down j k rowling 's harry potter i guess 
 on the other hand there 's marc andreessen
 who wrote the world 's first browser for the world wide web  and according to fortune magazine he 's worth seven hundred million dollars  but is he happy
