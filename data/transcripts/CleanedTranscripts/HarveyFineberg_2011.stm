  how would you like to be better than you are suppose i said that with just a few changes in your genes you could get a better memory
 more precise more accurate and quicker  or maybe you 'd like to be more fit stronger
 with more stamina would you like to be more attractive and self confident 
 how about living longer with good health 
 or perhaps you 're one of those who 's always yearned for more creativity  which one would you like the most 
 which would you like if you could have just one
  people would choose creativity raise your hands let me see a few probably about as many as there are creative people here that 's very good 
 how many would opt for memory  
 quite a few more how about fitness a few less what about longevity ah 
 the majority that makes me feel very good as a doctor if you could have any
  one of these it would be a very different world is it just imaginary  or is it perhaps possible 
 evolution has been a perennial topic here at the ted conference  
 but i want to give you today one doctor 's take on the subject  
 the great
  who was also a communicant in the russian orthodox church  once wrote an essay that he titled nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution 
 now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid take out your personal communications device i give you permission
 and perhaps take another look at kathryn schultz 's book on
  being wrong  because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you 
 but
 if you do accept biological evolution  
 consider this is it just about the past  or is it about the future does it apply to others
  or does it apply to us this is another look at the tree of life 
 in this picture  i 've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions because if you look at the edges of the tree of life  every 
 existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms it has survived  it has demonstrated a fitness
  to its environment 
 the human part of this branch  way out on one end 
 is of course the one that we are most interested in 
 we branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago 
 in the interval there have been perhaps twenty or 
 different species of
  some have come and gone we have been here for about one hundred and thirty thousand years  it may seem like we 're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life  but actually for the most part  
 the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human
 insulin used to treat diabetics this is not like human insulin this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas  
 and speaking of bacteria  do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria
  than there are cells in the rest of our body  maybe ten times more i mean think of it when antonio damasio asks about your 
 do you think about the bacteria 
 our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria  it 's warm it 's dark it 's moist it 's very cozy and you 're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part it 's really like an easy street
 for bacteria with the occasional
 interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit but otherwise 
 you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life they help in the digestion of essential nutrients  and they protect you against certain diseases  
 but what will come in the future are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise
 as a species or are we destined to become something different
 something perhaps even better adapted to the environment now let 's take a step back in time
 to the big bang  fourteen billion years ago
 the earth the solar system about four and a half billion years
  three to four billion years ago on earth the first   multi celled organisms perhaps as much
 as eight hundred or a billion years ago and then the human species finally emerging in the last one hundred and thirty thousand 
  years in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe life on earth is like a brief measure  the animal kingdom like a single
  measure  and human life a small grace note  that was us  
 that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk so i hope you enjoyed it 
 now when i was
 a freshman in college i took my first biology class i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology  i became
 of the power of evolution and i realized something very fundamental in most of the existence of life in  single celled organisms each cell simply divides 
  and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells 
 and very importantly with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome  
 the rest of the body becomes expendable in fact 
 you could say
 that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same
  as sexual reproduction 
 now i have to confess when i was a college undergraduate i thought okay sex  death  sex death death for sex it seemed pretty reasonable at the time  
 but with each passing year  i 've come to have increasing doubts i 've come to understand the sentiments of george burns who was performing still in las vegas well into his 
 90s and one night there 's a knock at his hotel room door he answers the door  standing before him
 is a gorgeous scantily clad showgirl  she looks at him and says i 'm here for super sex that 's fine says george i 'll take the soup 
 i came to realize as a physician  
 that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of
 evolution not
  necessarily contradictory just different i was trying to preserve the body  i wanted to keep us healthy  i wanted to restore health from disease i wanted us to 
  live long and healthy lives evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation from an evolutionary point of view
  you and i are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea  i think we would all 
 understand the sentiment that woody allen expressed when he said i don 't want to achieve immortality through my work i want to achieve it through not dying
 it doesn 't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment 
 that is the sole test of survival and success at the bottom of the ocean
  that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce if fish were there sous vide cooked fish 
 nevertheless have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them  
 so
 what does this mean 
 as we look back at what has happened in evolution  and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and
  particularly as we look ahead to the next phase  i would say that there are a number of possibilities 
 the first
 is that
 we will not evolve we have reached a kind of equipoise and the reasoning behind that would be
  we have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population and secondly we as a species 
 have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it and by the way we
  immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can 't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for
  evolution to take place a
 second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind natural imposed by the forces of nature 
 and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly but they are inexorable  and as far as
  when we as a species do colonize distant planets there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way  
 but there 's a third possibility 
 an enticing intriguing and frightening possibility i call it 
 the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen
 by us as individuals in the choices
 that we will make 
 now how could this come about how could it be possible that we would do this  consider first the reality
 that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring they 're in some cultures choosing to have more males than
  it 's not necessarily good for the society but it 's what the individual and the family are choosing think also if it were possible
 ever
 for you to choose not simply to choose the sex of your child  but for you in your body
 to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or
  alzheimer 's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke  wouldn 't you
 want to make those changes in your genes  
 if we look ahead these kind of changes are going to be
 increasingly possible the human genome project started in
  years  it cost two point seven billion dollars 
 the year after it was finished in two thousand and four you could do the same job for twenty million dollars in three to four months 
 today you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about twenty thousand dollars and in the space of about a week 
 it won 't be very long
  before the reality will be the 
  human genome and it will be increasingly available for everyone 
 just a week ago 
 the national academy of engineering awarded its draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and
  to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way what frances arnold calls directed evolution 
 a couple of years ago the lasker prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka
 for his research in which he took an adult skin cell a fibroblast  
 and by manipulating just four genes he induced that cell to revert
 to a pluripotential stem cell a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body  
 these changes are coming the same technology
 that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves
  but induce immunity against other viruses  believe it or not there 's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant 
 can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco 
 these are all reality today  and [ in ] the future  will be evermore possible imagine then just
  you can change the cells in your body  
 but what if you could change the cells in your offspring what if you could change the sperm and the ova or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring 
 a better chance at a healthier life eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer who doesn 't want healthier children 
  and then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce
 the changes to prevent disease  will also enable us to adopt
 that better memory why not have the quick wit of a ken jennings especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the watson machine  
 why not have the quick twitch muscle
  that will enable you to run faster and longer  why not live longer 
 these will be irresistible  
 and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want we will have converted
  process that normally might require one hundred thousand years and we can compress it down to a thousand years and maybe even in the next one hundred years  
 these are choices that your grandchildren  
 or their grandchildren are going to have before them  will we use
  these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful that is kinder or will we selectively choose different attributes 
 that we want for some of us and not for others of us will we make a society that is
  develop
 the wisdom  
 and to inherit the wisdom that we 'll need to make these choices wisely for better or worse  and sooner than you may think 
 these choices will be up to us  thank you
