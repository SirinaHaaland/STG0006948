  i believe big institutions have unique potential to create change  and i believe that we as individuals have unique power
 to influence the direction that those institutions take now
  these beliefs did not come naturally to me because trusting big institutions not really part of my family legacy my mother escaped north korea
 when she was ten years old 
 to do so she had to elude every big institution in her life repressive governments 
 occupying armies and even armed border patrols  
 later when she decided she wanted to emigrate to the united states
  she had to defy an entire culture that said the girls
 would never be the best and brightest  
 only because her name happens to sound like a boy 's was she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam to come to the united states  
 because of her bravery and passion i 've had all the opportunities that she never did and that has made my story so different 
 instead of running away from big institutions i 've actually run toward them i 've had the chance over the course
  career to work for the wall street journal the white house
 and now one of the largest financial institutions in the world  where i lead sustainable investing 
 now these institutions are like tankers  and working inside of them i 've come to appreciate what large wakes they can leave  
 and i 've become convinced that the institution of the global capital markets
  the nearly two hundred and ninety trillion dollars of stocks and bonds in the world  
 that that may be one of our most powerful forces for positive social change at our disposal if we ask it to be now i
 know some of you are thinking  global capital markets positive social change not usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph 
 i think many people think of the capital markets kind of like an ocean  it 's
  uncaring force of nature
 that is not affected by our wishes or desires  
 so the best that our little savings accounts or retirement accounts can do is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles and hope that we don 't get inundated in the turbulent ones  but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts
 don 't affect the tides don 't change the shape or size or direction of the waves 
  but why is that because actually one third of this ocean of capital actually belongs to individuals like us  
 and most of the rest of the capital markets is controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority and their capital from us 
 as members participants beneficiaries shareholders or citizens  so if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets  
 why aren 't we able to make our voices heard 
 why can 't we make some waves
 so let me ask you a different question did any of you buy fair trade coffee the last time you were at a supermarket or at starbucks 
 ok do any of you go to the restaurant and order the sustainably farmed trout
 instead of the  miso glazed chilean sea bass that you really wish you could have do any of you drive hybrid cars or even
  do these things right one electric car doesn 't amount to much in a fleet of one point two billion combustion engine vehicles 
 one fish is just one fish in the sea and one cup of coffee
 doesn 't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world
  but we do these things because we believe they matter that our actions add up that our choices might influence others and
  what an impact we can have 
 so in my bag i have a coffee mug that i bought a couple of years ago it 's a reusable mug it has all these things printed on it 
 look at some of the things that are on it that it says 
 this one cup can be used again and again 
 this one cup may inspire others to use one too this one cup helps save the planet i had
 no idea this plastic cup was so powerful 
 so why do we think that our choice of a four dollar
  artisanal cup of coffee in a reusable mug matters  but what we do with four thousand dollars in our investment account for our ira doesn 't 
 why can 't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets that we care 
 that we care about fair labor standards that we care about sustainable production methods and about healthy communities 
 why aren 't we voting with our investment dollars but we would vote with our lattes
  so i think it has something to do with the myths  the fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness do you remember the grimm 's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot if
 you said to the pot boil little pot boil it would fill up with sweet porridge and if you said stop little pot stop it would stop 
 but if you got the words wrong it wouldn 't listen  and things could go terribly awry
  so i think when it comes to markets  we have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads we believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command make more money  
 only those words said exactly that way will make the pot fill up with gold 
 add in some extra words like protect the
  spell might not work put in the wrong words like promote social justice 
 and you might see your gold coins shrink or even vanish entirely according to this fable so we asked people what do you really think
 and we actually went out and polled a thousand individual investors  and we found something fascinating  
 overwhelmingly people wanted to add those extra words into the formula seventy one percent of people said
  yes they were interested in sustainable investing  
 which we define as taking the best in class investment process that you already have traditionally and adding in the extra information you get when you think about the environment and society and good governance seventy one percent wanted that
 seventy two percent said that they believe that companies who did that would actually do better
  so people really do believe that you can do well by doing good but here was the weird thing fifty four percent of the people still said if they put their money
 in those kinds of stocks they thought that they would make less money  
 so is it true do you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade grown coffee instead of drinking it 
 well you know the investors in companies like
  burt 's bees or ben & jerry 's wouldn 't say so right both of those started out as small socially conscious companies
 that ended up becoming so popular with consumers that the giants unilever and clorox bought them for hundreds of millions of dollars
 each  but here 's the important thing those corporations realized that if they wanted to protect the value of their investments they had to preserve that socially conscious
  if they didn 't keep adding in those extra words of environmentally friendly and socially conscious those brands wouldn 't make more money  
 but maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule right 
 the serious companies that fund our economy and that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round  
 they need to stick to making more money  
 so  harvard business school actually researched this and they found something fascinating if you had invested a dollar
 twenty years ago in a portfolio of
  companies that focused narrowly on making more money quarter by quarter  that one dollar
 would have grown to fourteen dollars and forty six cents that 's not bad until you consider that if instead you 'd invested that same dollar
 in a portfolio of companies that focused on growing their business and on the
  almost twice as much sweet porridge  now let 's be clear  they didn 't make that outperformance by giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen 
 they did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business like wasting less energy and water in their manufacturing processes like making sure the ceo contracts had the ceos incentivized for the
  results of the company and the communities they served  not just quarterly results 
 or building a first class culture that would have higher employee loyalty  retention and productivity  
 now harvard 's not alone  oxford also did a research study where they examined one hundred and twenty different studies looking at the effect of sustainability and economic results
  and they found time and time and time again
 that the companies that cared about these kinds of important things actually had better operational efficiency  lower cost of capital
 and better performance in their stock price  
 and then there 's al gore 
 so twenty years ago when i worked for al gore in the white house he was one of the early pioneers pleading with businesses and governments to pay attention to the challenges of climate change
  he opened an investment firm called generation  where he baked environmental sustainability and other things right into the core investment process  
 and at the time there was a good bit of skepticism about his views  
 ten years later  his track record is one more proof point that sustainable investing done right can be sound investing  
 far from making less sweet porridge because he added sustainability into the mix he actually significantly
  sustainable investing the good news is it doesn 't require a magic spell
 and it doesn 't require some investment secret 
 and it 's not just for the elite  it is not just about private equity for billionaires  
 it 's not just groovy sounding investments like clean technology or microfinance in emerging markets or
 artisanal bakeries in brooklyn  it 's about stocks
  and bonds and fortune five hundred companies it 's about mutual funds it 's about all the things we already see in the market today so here 's why i 'm convinced
 that we collectively have the power to make sustainable investing
 the new normal first 
 the proof points are coming out all the time that sustainable investing done right  preserving all the same good principles of
 investing the traditional sphere can pay  it makes sense
 the biggest obstacle standing in our way may actually just be in our heads 
 we just need to let go of that myth that if you add your values into your investment thinking that you get less sweet porridge  and once you get rid of the fable you can actually start appreciating those facts we 've been talking about 
 and third the future is already here sustainable investment today is a twenty trillion dollar market and it 's the
  segment of the investment industry in the united states  it has grown enormously as you can see it now represents one out of every six dollars
 under professional management in the united states  so what are we waiting for 
 for me it goes back to the inspiration that i received from my mother she knew that she wanted a life where she would have the freedom to make her own choices
 and to have her voice heard and
  write her own story she was passionate about that goal
 and she was clear that she would let no army  no obstacle no big institution stand in her way 
 she made it to the states  and she became a teacher an award winning author
 and a mother  and ended up sending her daughters to harvard and these days you can tell that she is amply comfortable holding court in the most
  powerful institutions in the world  it seems almost too prophetic that her name in korean means passionate clarity 
 passionate clarity 
 that 's what i think we need to drive change  passion about the change we want to see in the world  and clarity that we are able to help chart
  we have more opportunity today than ever before to make choices we have more power than ever before
 to make our voices heard  so
 change your perspective  vote with your small change  invest in the change you want to see in the world change the fables
 and change the markets  thank you
