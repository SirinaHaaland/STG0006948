  my favorite part of being a dad is the movies i get to watch
  i love sharing my favorite movies with my kids  and when my daughter was four we got to watch the wizard of oz together
  totally dominated her imagination for months her favorite character was glinda of course it gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand
  but you watch that movie enough times  and you start to realize how unusual it is now we
 live today and are raising our children in a kind of children
  the trend really caught on with interestingly  another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl
 by dressing up as the enemy 's guards do you know what i 'm talking about yeah 
 now 
 there 's a big difference between these two movies a couple of really big differences between the wizard of oz and all the movies we watch today one is there 's very little violence in
  wizard of oz the
 monkeys are rather aggressive as are the apple trees  but
 i think if the wizard of oz were made today  
 the wizard would say dorothy you are the savior of oz that the prophecy foretold  use your magic slippers to defeat the 
  armies of the wicked witch but that 's not how it happens  another thing that 's really
 unique about the wizard of oz to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters
 are female 
 now i started to notice this when i actually showed star wars to my daughter 
 which was years later and the situation was different at that point i also had a son  
 he was only three at the time he was not invited to
  the screening he was too young for that but he was the second child  and the level of supervision had plummeted so
 he wandered in  
 and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling
  i don 't think he understands what 's going on but
 he is sure soaking in it  
 and i wonder what he 's soaking in is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty 
 is he picking up on the fact that luke joins an army to overthrow the government 
 is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for aunt beru  and of course
  this princess who 's really cool  but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe which he does
 by the magic that he was born with  compare this to one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine with the wizard of oz how does dorothy win her movie  
 by making friends with everybody
 and being a leader that 's
  kind of the world i 'd rather raise my kids in
 oz  right  and not the world of dudes fighting  
 which is where we kind of have to be why is there so much force capital f force in the movies we have for our kids and so little yellow brick road 
 there is a lot of great writing about the impact
  movie has on girls and you should do that reading it 's very good  
 i haven 't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe  i know from my own experience that
 princess leia did not provide the adequate context that i could have used in navigating the adult world that
  i really expected the credits to start rolling
 because that 's the end of the movie right i finished my quest i got the girl  why are you still standing there
 i don 't know what i 'm supposed to do the movies are very very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward and there 's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys  it 's almost as though if you 're a
  boy you are a dopey animal and if you are a girl you should bring your warrior costume 
 there are plenty of exceptions and i i will defend the disney princesses in front of any you  but they do
 send a message to boys that they are not the boys are not really the target audience
  they are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy  
 but they are not necessarily showing boys how they 're supposed to defend against the patriarchy there 's no models for them  
 and we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids  
 and as three dimensional and delightful as hermione and katniss are these are still war movies 
  of course the most successful studio of all time
 continues to crank out classic after classic every single one of them about the journey of a boy  or 
  a man or two men who are friends or a man and his son  or
  this year when they finally came out with brave i recommend it to all of you it 's on demand now do
 you remember what the critics said when brave came out aw i can 't believe pixar made a princess movie it
 's very good don 't let that stop you
  now almost none of these movies pass the bechdel test i don 't know if you 've heard of this it has not yet caught on and caught fire
 but maybe today we will start a movement alison bechdel is a comic book artist and back in the mid ' 80s she
 recorded this conversation she 'd had with a friend
 about assessing the movies that they saw  and it 's very simple there 's just three questions you should ask
  is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines
 so try to meet that bar and do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie
  and is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like
  've seen it  and yet i very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love in fact this week i went to see a very high quality 
  argo right  oscar buzz doing great at the box office a consensus idea of what a quality hollywood film is it pretty much
  a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis 
 we 've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep  angst ridden conversations in this hideout  and
 the
 great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and
  you coming to bed honey that 's hollywood for you 
 so let 's let 's look at the numbers two thousand and eleven of the one hundred most popular movies how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists 
 eleven it 's not bad
 's not as many percent as the number of women we 've just elected to congress so that 's good but there is a number that is greater than this that 's going to bring
  this room down
 last year the new york times published a study that the government had done here 's what it said one out of five
 women in america
 say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life 
 now i don 't think that 's the fault of popular entertainment  i don 't think kids
  movies have anything to do with that i don 't even think that
 music videos or pornography are really directly related to that but something is going wrong  
 and when i hear that statistic one of the things i think of is
 that 's a lot of sexual assailants who are these guys what are they learning what are they failing to learn
  are they absorbing the story that a male hero 's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward which is a woman who has no friends and doesn 't speak 
 are we soaking up that story 
  as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter
 like all of you who are doing the same thing we find this world
 and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them we have tools at our disposal like girl power 
 and we hope that that will help  but i gotta wonder is girl power going to protect
  at the same time  actively or passively we are training our sons
 to maintain their boy power  i mean i think the netflix queue
 is one way that we can do something very important  and i 'm talking mainly to the dads here i think we have got to show our sons
 a new definition of manhood the definition of manhood is already
 turning upside down  you 've read about how the new economy is changing the
  roles of caregiver and wage earner they 're throwing it up in the air 
 so our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this some new relationship with each other and i think we really have to show them and model for them  
 how a real man
 is someone who trusts his
  and respects them  
 and wants to be on their team and stands up against the real bad guys  who are the men who want to abuse the women  
 and i think our job in the netflix queue is to look out for those movies
 that pass the bechdel test if we can find them  and to seek out the heroines who are there 
 who show real courage who bring people together  and to nudge our sons to identify
  with those heroines and to say i want to be on their team because they 're going to be on their team
  the wizard of oz
