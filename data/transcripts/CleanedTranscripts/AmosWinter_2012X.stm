  physical disability isn 't easy anywhere in the world but if you live in a country like the united states there 's certain
  available to you that do make life easier so if you 're in a building you can take an elevator
 if you 're crossing the street you have sidewalk cutouts and if you have to travel some distance farther than you can do under your own power there 's accessible vehicles and if you can 't afford one of those there 's accessible public transportation
 but in the developing world things are quite different
 there 's forty million people who need a wheelchair but don 't have one
 and the majority of these people live in rural areas where the only connections to community to employment to education
  are by traveling long distances on rough terrain often under their own power and the devices usually available to these people are not made for that context break down quickly and are hard to repair
 i started looking at wheelchairs in developing countries in two thousand and five when i spent the summer assessing the state of technology in tanzania and i talked to wheelchair users wheelchair manufacturers disability groups
  and what stood out to me is that there wasn 't a device available that was designed for rural areas that could go fast and efficiently on many types of terrain so being a mechanical 
  engineer being at mit and having lots of resources available to me i thought i 'd try to do something about it
 and you can shift to a low gear if you have to climb a hill or go through mud or sand and you get a lot of torque but a low speed and if you want to go faster say on pavement you can shift to a high gear 
 and you get less torque but higher speeds so the logical evolution here is to just make a wheelchair with mountain bike components which many people have done but these are two products available in the u s that would be difficult to transfer into developing countries
 because they 're much much too expensive and the context i 'm talking about is where you need to have a product that is less than two hundred dollars
 and this ideal product would also be able to go about five kilometers a day so you could get to your job get to school and do it on many many different types of terrain but when you get home or want 
  to go indoors at your work it 's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside and furthermore
 if you want it to last a long time out in rural areas it has to be repairable using the local tools materials and knowledge in those contexts
 so the real crux of the problem here is how do you make a system that 's a simple device but gives you a large mechanical advantage how do you make a mountain bike for your arms that doesn 't have the mountain bike cost and complexity
 so as is the case with simple
  solutions oftentimes the answer is right in front of your face and for us it was levers we use levers all the time in tools doorknobs bicycle parts
 and that moment of inspiration that key invention moment was when i was sitting in front of my design notebook and i started thinking about somebody grabbing a lever and if they grab near the end 
  of the lever they can get an effectively long lever and produce a lot of torque as they push back and forth
  gear and as they slide their hand down the lever
 they can push with a smaller effective lever length but push through a bigger angle every stroke which makes a faster rotational speed and gives you an effective high gear
 so what 's exciting about this system is that it 's really really mechanically simple and you could make it using technology that 's been around for hundreds of years
 so seeing this in practice this is the leveraged freedom chair that after a few years of
 we 're now going into production with and this is a full time wheelchair user he 's paralyzed in guatemala and you see he 's able to traverse pretty rough terrain
 again the key innovation of this technology is that when he wants to go fast he just grabs the levers near the pivots and goes through a big angle every stroke and as the going gets tougher he just slides his hands up the levers
 creates more torque and kind of bench presses his way out of trouble
  through the rough terrain now the big important point here
 is that the person
 is the complex machine in this system it 's the person that 's sliding his hands up and down the levers so the mechanism itself can be very simple and composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere 
  in the world because those bicycle parts are so ubiquitously available they 're super cheap they 're made by the gazillions in china and india and we can source them anywhere in the world build
  the chair anywhere and most importantly repair it even out in a village with a local bicycle mechanic who has local tools knowledge and parts available
 now when you want to use the lfc indoors
 all you have to do is pull the levers out of the drivetrain stow them in the frame
 and it converts into a normal wheelchair that you can use just like any other normal wheelchair and we sized it like a normal wheelchair so it 's narrow enough to fit
  through a standard doorway
 it 's low enough to fit under a table
 and it 's small and maneuverable enough to fit in a bathroom and this is important so the user can get up close to a toilet and be able to transfer off just like he could
  in a normal wheelchair
 now there 's three important points that i want to stress that
  think really hit home in this project
 the first is that this product works well because we were effectively able to combine rigorous engineering science and analysis with user centered design 
  focused on the social and usage and economic factors important to wheelchair users in the developing countries so i 'm an academic at mit and i 'm a mechanical engineer so i can do things like
  resistance it should impose look at the parts we have available and mix and match them to to figure out what sort of gear trains we can use and then look at the power and force you can get out of your upper body 
 to analyze how fast you should be able to go in this chair as you put your arms up and down the levers so as a wet behind the ears student excited
  brought that prototype to tanzania kenya and vietnam in two thousand and eight and found it was terrible
 because we didn 't get enough input from users so because we tested it with wheelchair users with wheelchair manufacturers we got that feedback from them not just articulating their problems
  but articulating their solutions and worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design which we brought back to east africa in nine that worked a lot better than a normal wheelchair on rough terrain but it still didn 't work well indoors because it was too big
 it was heavy it was hard to to move around so again with that user feedback we went back to the drawing board came up with a better design twenty pounds lighter as narrow as a regular wheelchair tested 
  that in a field trial in guatemala and that advanced the product to the point where we have now that it 's going into production
  trial in guatemala where we tested the lfc on village terrain
 and tested people 's biomechanical outputs their oxygen consumption how fast they go how much power they 're putting out both in their regular wheelchairs and using the lfc and we found that the lfc is 
  about eighty percent faster going on these terrains than a normal wheelchair it 's also about forty percent more efficient than a regular wheelchair and because of the mechanical advantage you get from the levers you can produce fifty
  percent higher torque and really muscle your way through the really really rough terrain
 now the second lesson that we learned in this is that the constraints on this design really push the innovation because we had to hit such a low price point because we had to make 
  a device that could travel on many many types of terrain but still be usable indoors and be simple enough to repair we ended up with a fundamentally new product a new product that is an
  innovation in a space that really hasn 't changed in a hundred years and these are all merits that are not just good in the developing world why not in countries like the u s too so we teamed up 
  with continuum a local product design firm here in boston to make the high end version the developed world version that we 'll probably sell primarily in the u s and europe but to higher income buyers
  project worked well because we engaged all the stakeholders that that buy into this project and are important to consider in bringing the technology from inception of an idea 
 through innovation validation commercialization and dissemination and that cycle has to start and end with end users these are the people that define the requirements of the technology and these are the people that have to give the thumbs up at the end and say yeah it actually
  works it meets our needs so people like me in the academic space we can do things like innovate and analyze and test create data and make bench level prototypes but how do you 
  get that bench level prototype to commercialization so we need gap fillers like continuum that can work on commercializing and we started a whole ngo to to bring our chair to market global research innovation technology and then we also teamed up with a big manufacturer in india pinnacle industries that 's
  tooled up now to make five hundred chairs a month and will make the first batch of two hundred next month which will be delivered in india
 and then finally to get this out to the people in scale we teamed up with the largest disability organization in the world jaipur foot
 now what 's powerful about this model
 is when you bring together all these stakeholders that represent each link in the chain from inception of an idea all the way to implementation in the
  field
 that 's where the magic happens that 's where you can take a guy like me an academic but analyze and test and create a new technology and quantitatively determine how much better the performance is
 you can connect with stakeholders like the manufacturers and talk with them face to face and leverage their local knowledge of manufacturing practices and their clients and combine that knowledge with our engineering knowledge to create something greater than either of us could have done alone
 and then you can also engage the end user in the design process and not just ask him what he needs but ask him how he thinks it can be achieved and this picture was taken 
  in india in our last field trial where we had a ninety percent adoption rate where people switched to using our leveraged freedom chair over their normal wheelchair
 but once he was injured he wasn 't able to transport himself from his house over a kilometer to his shop in his normal wheelchair the road was too rough
 but the day after he got an lfc he hopped in it rode that kilometer opened up his shop and soon after landed a contract to make school uniforms and started making money started providing for his family again
