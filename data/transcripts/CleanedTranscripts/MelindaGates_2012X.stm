  like to talk with you about something that should be
 a totally uncontroversial topic but unfortunately it 's become incredibly controversial 
  this year if you think about it over a billion couples will have sex with one another couples like this one
  and this one  and this one and yes  even this one 
 and my idea is this
 all these men and women should be free to decide whether they do or do not want to conceive a child  
 and they should be able to use
  one of these birth control methods
 to act on their decision 
 now i think you 'd have a hard time finding many people who disagree with this idea 
 over one billion people use birth control without any hesitation at all
  they want the power to plan their own lives
 and to raise healthier  better educated and more prosperous families 
 but for an idea that is so broadly accepted in private 
 birth control certainly generates a lot of opposition in public 
 some people think when we talk about contraception that it 's code for abortion  which it 's not some
  people let 's be honest they 're uncomfortable with the topic because it 's about sex 
 some people worry that the real goal of family planning is to control populations
 these are all side issues that have attached themselves to this core idea that men and women should be able to decide
 when they want to have a child  
 and as a result birth control has almost completely and totally disappeared from the global health agenda
 the victims of this paralysis are the people of sub saharan africa and south asia
  the proportion of people that use contraception is about sixty six percent  that 's about what you 'd expect  
 in el salvador very similar sixty six percent  thailand sixty four percent  
 but let 's compare that to other places like uttar pradesh 
 one of the largest states in india  in fact  if uttar pradesh was its own country it would be the fifth largest country
  in the world their contraception rate  twenty nine percent  
 nigeria  the most populous country in africa ten percent  
 chad two percent 
  let 's just take one country in africa
  their rate is about twelve percent  but why is it so low one reason is that the most popular contraceptives are rarely available 
 women in africa will tell you over and over again that what they prefer today is an injectable  they get it in their arm and they go about four times 
  a year they have to get it every three months to get their injection  the reason women like it so much in africa is they can hide it from their husbands
 who sometimes want a lot of children  the problem is every other time a woman goes into a clinic in senegal that injection is stocked out 
 it 's stocked out one hundred and fifty days out of the year  so can you imagine the situation she walks all this way to go get her injection she leaves her field  sometimes leaves her children
  there  and she doesn 't know when it 's going to be available again 
 this is the same story across the continent of africa today and so what we 've created as a world has become a 
  hundred thousand women [ per year ] who say they don 't want to be pregnant and they die in childbirth one hundred thousand women a year
  there are another six hundred thousand women [ per year ] who say they didn 't want to be pregnant in the first place and they give birth to a baby and her baby dies in that first month of life 
  i know everyone wants to save these mothers and these children  
 but somewhere along the way we got confused by our own conversation  and we
  stopped trying to save these lives  
 so if we 're going to make progress on this issue  
 we have to be really clear about what our agenda is we
 're not talking about abortion  we 're not talking about population control 
 what i 'm talking about is giving women the power to save their lives to save their
  's lives and to give their families the best possible future  
 now
  as a world there are lots of things we have to do in the global health community if we want to make the world better in the future things like fight diseases  so many children today die of diarrhea as you heard earlier and
  they kill literally millions of children a year  we also need to help small farmers farmers who plow who plow small plots of land in africa
 so that they can grow enough food to feed their children  and we have to make sure that children are educated around the world  
 but one of the simplest and most transformative things we can do is to give everybody access to birth control methods that almost all germans have access to and all
  americans at some point  they use these tools during their life  
 and i think as long as we 're really clear about what our agenda is there 's a global movement waiting to happen and ready to 
  get behind this totally uncontroversial idea 
  myself a practicing catholic my mom 's 
 was a jesuit priest my 
 was a dominican nun  she was a schoolteacher and a principal her entire life in fact she 's the one who taught me as a young girl how to read  
 i was very close to her and i went to catholic schools for my entire childhood until i left home to go
  university in my high school ursuline academy  the nuns made service
 and social justice a high priority in the school
 today in the [ gates ] foundation 's work  i believe i 'm applying the lessons that i learned in high school 
  in the tradition of catholic scholars  the nuns also taught us to question received teachings
  and one of the teachings that we girls and my peers questioned
 was is birth control really a sin 
 because i think one of the reasons we have this huge discomfort talking about contraception is this lingering concern that if we separate sex from
  reproduction we 're going to promote promiscuity  and i think that 's a reasonable question to be asked
 about contraception what is its impact on sexual morality 
 but like most women my decision about birth control had nothing to do with promiscuity  
 i had a plan for my future  i wanted to go to college i studied really hard in
  college  and i was proud to be one of the very few female computer science graduates at my university  
 i wanted to have a career  so i went on to business school and i became one of the youngest female executives at microsoft  
 i still remember though when i left my parents ' home to move across the country to start this new job at microsoft  they had sacrificed a lot
  lot to give me five years of higher education  but they said as i left home and i literally went down the front steps down the porch at home and they said 
 even though you 've had this great education  if you decide to get married and have kids right away that 's ok by us too 
  they wanted me to do the thing that would make me the very happiest 
 i was free to decide what that would be it was an amazing feeling 
 in fact  i did want to have kids
 but i wanted to have them when i was ready  and so now  bill and i have three and when our eldest
 daughter was born  
 we weren 't i would say exactly sure how to be great parents maybe some of you know that feeling  and so we waited a little while before we had our second child  
 and
 it 's no accident that we have three children that are spaced three years apart
 now as a mother what do i want the very most for my children  
 i want them to feel the way i did like they can do anything they want
  do in life 
 and so what has struck me as i 've travelled the last decade for the foundation around the world is that all women want that same thing 
 last year  i was in nairobi  in the slums  in one called korogocho which
  standing shoulder to shoulder and i spoke with this women 's group that 's pictured here and the women talked
 very openly about their family life in the slums what it was like 
 and they talked quite intimately about what they did for birth control
 marianne in the center of the screen in the red sweater she summed up that entire two hour conversation in a phrase that i will never forget  
 she said
  want to bring every good thing to this child
 before i have another 
 and i thought that 's it 
 that 's universal  we all want to bring every good thing to our children  
 but what 's not universal is our ability to provide every good thing 
 so many women suffer from domestic
  violence and they can 't even broach the subject of contraception  even inside their own marriage  
 there are many women who lack basic education  even many of the women who do have knowledge and do have power don 't have access to contraceptives for two hundred and fifty
  around the world have been deciding to have smaller families 
 this trend has been steady for a quarter of a millennium across cultures and across geographies 
 with the glaring exception of sub saharan africa and south asia  
 the french started bringing down their family size in the
  and over the next one hundred and fifty years this trend spread all across europe
 the surprising thing to me as i learned this history was that it spread not along
 socioeconomic lines but around cultural lines people who spoke the same language made that change as a group they made the same choice for their family whether they were rich
 or whether they were poor
  that trend toward smaller families spread was that this whole way was driven by an idea
 the idea that couples can exercise conscious control over how many children they have 
 this is a very powerful idea  
 it means that parents have the ability to affect the future 
 not just accept
  it as it is 
 in france  the average family size went down every decade for one hundred and fifty years in a row until it stabilized 
 it took so long back then because the contraceptives  weren 't that good in germany this transition started 
  and it took just fifty years for family size to stabilize in this country and
 in asia and latin america the transition started in the 1960s and it happened much faster because of modern contraception
 i think as we go through this history  it 's important to pause for a moment and to remember why this has become such a contentious issue  it 's because some family
  programs resorted to unfortunate incentives and coercive policies 
 for instance in the 1960s india adopted very specific numeric targets and they paid women to accept having an iud placed in their bodies 
 now  indian women were really
 smart in this situation when they went to get an iud inserted they got paid six rupees  and so what did they do 
 they waited a few hours or a few days and they went to another service provider and had the iud removed for one rupee 
 for decades in the united states
  women were sterilized without their consent  the procedure was so common it became known as the mississippi
  appendectomy
 a tragic chapter in my country 's history  
 and as recently as the 1990s in peru women from the andes region were given anesthesia and they were sterilized without their knowledge 
 the most startling thing about this is that these coercive policies weren 't even needed they were carried out in places where parents already
 wanted to lower their family size because in region after region again and again parents have wanted to have smaller families
 there 's no reason to believe that african women have innately different desires 
 given the option  they will have fewer children
  the question is will we invest in helping all women get what they want now  
 or are we going to condemn them to some
  struggle  as if this was still revolutionary france and the best method was coitus interruptus 
 empowering parents it doesn
  but here 's the thing
 our desire to bring every good thing to our children is a force for good throughout the world it 's what propels societies forward 
 in that same slum in nairobi  i met a young businesswoman  and she was making backpacks out of her home she and her young kids would go to the local jeans factory and collect scraps of denim she 'd create these backpacks and resell them
  and when i talked with her she had three children and i asked her about her family and she said she and her husband decided that they wanted to stop having children after their third one  and so when i asked 
  her why she simply said well because i couldn 't run my business if i had another child and she explained the income that she was getting out of her business afforded her to be able to give an education to all three of her children  she was incredibly
  optimistic about her family 's future
 this is the same mental calculus that hundreds of millions of men and women have gone through 
 and evidence proves that they have it exactly right 
 they are able to give their children more opportunities by exercising control over when they have them  
 in bangladesh
  bangladesh  there 's a district called matlab it 's where researchers have collected data on over one hundred and eighty thousand inhabitants since one thousand nine 
 in the global health community we like to say it 's one of the longest pieces of research that 's been running we have so many great health statistics
 in one of the studies what did they do half the villagers were chosen to get contraceptives they got education and access
  to contraception twenty years later following those villages what we learned is that they had a better quality of life than their neighbors  
 the families were healthier the women were less likely to die in childbirth their children were less likely to die in the first thirty days of life the children were better nourished
  the families were also wealthier  the adult women 's wages were higher households had more assets things like livestock or land or savings
 finally their sons and daughters had more schooling 
 so when you multiply these types of effects over millions of families the product can be 
  economic development people
  but it wasn 't really a miracle one of the leading causes of economic growth across that region was this cultural trend towards smaller families
 sweeping changes start at the individual family level the family making a decision about what 's best for their children
  when they make that change and that decision those become sweeping regional and national trends
  trends
 when families in sub saharan africa are given the opportunity to make those decisions for themselves  
 i think it will help spark a virtuous cycle of development in communities across the continent  
 we can help poor families build a better future  
 we can insist that all people have the opportunity to learn about contraceptives and have access to the full variety of methods  
 i think the goal here is really clear universal access to birth control that women want 
 and for that to happen  it means that both rich and poor governments alike must make contraception a total priority  we can do our part
  this room and globally by talking about the hundreds of millions of families that don 't have access to contraception today and what it would do to change their lives if they did have access
 i think if marianne and the members of her women 's group can talk about this openly and have this discussion out amongst themselves and in public
  need to start now  
 because like marianne  we all want to bring every good thing to our children  
 and where is the controversy in that
  thank you for your courage and everything else  so melinda in the last few years i 've heard
 a lot of smart people say something to the effect of we don 't need to worry about the population issue anymore
  family sizes are coming down naturally all over the
 the world we 're going to peak at nine or ten billion and that 's it 
 are they wrong melinda gates if you look at the statistics across africa they are wrong  and
 i think we need to look at it though from a different lens  we need to look at it from the ground upwards i think that 's one of the reasons we got ourselves in so much trouble on this issue of contraception 
 we looked at it from top down and said we want to have different population numbers over time
  about the planet yes we need to make the right choices but the choices have to be made at the family level and it 's only by giving people access and letting them choose what to do that you get those 
  sweeping changes that we have seen globally except for sub saharan africa and those places in south asia and afghanistan ca 
 some people on the right in america and in
 many conservative cultures around the world
 might say something like this it 's all very well to talk about saving lives and empowering women and so on but 
 sex is sacred  
 what you 're proposing is going to increase the likelihood that lots of sex happens outside marriage  and that is wrong
  and it 's sacred in germany  and it 's sacred in the united states and it 's sacred in france and so many places around the world
  and the fact that ninety eight percent of women in my country who are sexually experienced say they use birth control doesn 't make sex any less sacred it just means that they 're getting to make choices about their lives and i think
 in that choice we 're also honoring the sacredness of the family and the sacredness of the mother 's life
 and the childrens ' lives by saving their lives to me that 's incredibly sacred too ca 
 so what is your foundation doing to promote this issue and what could people here and people listening
 on the web what would you like them to do mg i would say this join the conversation we 've listed the website up
  join the conversation tell your story about how contraception has either changed your life or somebody 's life that you know
  and say that you 're for this we need a groundswell of people saying this makes sense we 've got to give all women access no matter where they live 
 and one of the things that we 're going to do is do a large event july july eleven in london with a whole host of countries a whole host of african nations to all say we 're putting this back on the global health agenda we 're going to commit resources to it
  to do planning from the bottom up with governments to make sure that women are educated so that if they want the tool they have it and that they have lots of options available either through their local healthcare worker or their local community rural clinic 
 ca melinda i 'm guessing that some of those nuns who taught you
 at school are going to see this ted talk
  cheering you on mg i know they 're going to see the ted talk because they know that i 'm doing it and i plan to send it to them 
 and you know the nuns who taught me were incredibly progressive i hope that they 'll be very proud of me for living out what they taught us about social justice and service i have come to feel
 incredibly passionate about this issue because of what i 've seen in the developing world
  topic has become very close to heart because you meet these women and they are so often voiceless  and yet they shouldn 't be they should have a voice they should have access 
 and so i hope they 'll feel that i 'm living out what i 've learned from them and from the decades of work that i 've already done at the foundation ca 
 so you and your team brought together today an
  i learned so many things i have so many follow up questions and i think a lot of this work is a journey you heard the discussion about the journey through energy or the journey through 
  social design or the journey in the coming and saying why aren 't there any women on this platform and i think for all of us who work on these development issues you learn by talking to other people you learn by
  doing you learn by trying and making mistakes and it 's the questions you ask sometimes it 's the questions you ask that helps lead to the answer the next person that can help you answer it so i have lots of questions for the panelists from today and i thought it was just an amazing day ca melinda
 thank you for inviting all of us on this journey with you
