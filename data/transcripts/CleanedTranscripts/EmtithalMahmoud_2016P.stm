  i was ten years old when i learned what the word genocide meant it
 was two thousand and three and my people were being brutally attacked because of their race hundreds
  a nation torn apart at the hands of its own government 
 my mother and father immediately began speaking out against the crisis i didn 't really understand it  except for the fact that it was destroying my parents 
 one day i walked in on my mother crying  and i asked her why
 we are burying so many people i don 't remember the words that she chose to describe genocide
 to her 10 year old daughter  but i remember the feeling 
 we felt completely alone as if no one could hear us as if we were essentially invisible 
 this is when i wrote my first poem about darfur 
 i wrote poetry to convince people to hear and see us and that 's how i learned the thing that changed
  me it 's easy to be seen  i mean look at me
 i 'm a young african woman with a scarf around my head  an american accent on my tongue and a story that makes even the most brutal of monday mornings seem inviting
  but it 's hard to convince people that they deserve to be seen 
 i learned this in my high school classroom one day when my teacher asked me to give a presentation about
  darfur  i was setting up the projector when a classmate of mine said why do you have to talk about this can 't you think about us and how it will make us feel 
 self didn 't know what to say to her or how to explain the pain that i felt in that moment and in every moment that we were forced not to talk about
  me back to the days and nights on the ground in darfur 
 where we were forced to remain silent where we didn 't speak over morning tea because the warplanes overhead would swallow any and all noise 
 back to the days when we were told not only that we don 't deserve to be heard
 but that we do not have a right to exist and this is where the magic happened
  classroom when all the students started taking their seats and i began to speak despite this renewed feeling that i didn 't deserve to be there 
 that i didn 't belong there or have a right to break the silence 
 as i talked 
 and my classmates listened 
 the fear ebbed away 
 my mind became
  and i felt safe 
 it was the sound of our grieving 
 the feel of their arms around me the steady walls that held us together  
 it felt nothing like a vacuum  
 i choose poetry because it 's so visceral 
 when someone is standing in front of you mind body and soul saying witness me it 's impossible not to become keenly aware of your own humanity 
 this changed everything for
  me it gave me courage  
 every day i experience the power of witness and because of that i am whole 
 and so now i ask will you witness me 
 they hand me the microphone as my shoulders sink under the weight of this stress the woman says
  the one millionth refugee just left south sudan can you comment 
 i feel my feet rock back and forth on the heels my mother bought begging the question do we stay  or is it safer to choose flight 
 my mind echoes the numbers 
 one million gone  
 two million displaced  
 four hundred thousand dead in darfur and this lump takes over my throat as if each of those bodies just found a grave right here in my esophagus 
  country all north and south and east and west so restless the nile couldn 't hold us together and you ask me to summarize 
 they talk about the numbers as if this isn 't still happening as if five hundred thousand didn 't just die in syria as if three thousand aren 't still making their final stand at the bottom of the mediterranean 
 as if there aren 't entire volumes full of fact sheets about our genocides
 and now they want me to write one fact 
 we never talked over breakfast because the warplanes would swallow our voices  fact my
 grandfather didn 't want to leave home so he died in a war zone fact a burning bush
 without god is just a fire  
 i measure the distance between what i know and what is safe to say on a microphone 
 do i talk about sorrow  displacement  
 do i mention the violence how it 's never as simple as what you see on tv how there are weeks  ' worth of fear before the camera is on 
 do i tell her
 about our bodies how they are sixty percent water but we still burn like driftwood making fuel of our sacrifice do i tell her the men died first
  forced to watch the slaughter that they came for our children scattering them across the continent until our homes sank that even castles sink at the bite of the bomb do
 i talk about the elderly our heroes  
 too weak to run too expensive to shoot how they would march them hands raised rifles at their backs into the fire how their walking sticks kept the flames alive
  feels too harsh
 for a bundle of wires and an audience to swallow 
 too relentless like the valley that filled with the putrid smoke of our deaths is it better in verse  
 can a stanza become a burial shroud 
 will it sting less if i say it softly if you don 't see me cry will you listen better will the pain leave when the microphone does why does every word feel as if i 'm saying my last
 thirty seconds for the sound bite  and now three minutes for the poem my tongue goes dry
 the same way we died becoming ash  having never been coal  
 i feel my left leg go numb  and i realize that i locked my knees bracing for impact  i never wear shoes
 i can 't run in thank you 
 so i wanted to leave on a positive note 
 because that 's the paradox that this life has been 
  the places where i learned to cry the most i also learned how to smile after so here goes 
 you have a big imagination
 or
 four hundred thousand ways to cry for zeinab  i am a sad girl
  but my face makes other plans  focusing energy on this smile so as not to waste it on pain the first thing they took was my sleep  
 eyes heavy but wide open thinking maybe i missed something 
 maybe the cavalry is still coming they didn 't come so i bought bigger pillows 
 my grandmother could cure anything by talking the life out of it and
  she said that i could make a thief in a silo laugh in the middle of our raging war war
 makes a broken marriage bed out of sorrow 
 you want nothing more than to disappear but your heart can 't salvage enough remnants to leave 
 but joy
 joy is the armor we carried across the borders of our broken homeland
  hasty mix of stories and faces that lasts long after the flavor is gone 
 a muscle memory that overcomes even the most bitter of times my memory is spotted with days of laughing until i cried or crying until i laughed laughter and tears
 are both involuntary
  to our capacity for expression so allow me to express that if i make you laugh it 's usually on purpose
  and if i make you cry i 'll still think you are beautiful 
 this is for my cousin zeinab  
 bedridden on a random afternoon  
 i hadn 't seen her since the last time we were in sudan together  and there i was at her hospital bedside
 in a
 400 year old building in france
 zeinab wanted to hear poems 
 suddenly  english arabic and french were not enough  
 every word i knew became empty noise  and zeinab said well get on with it 
 and i read her everything that i
  and we laughed  and we loved it and it was the most important stage that i 've ever stood on 
 surrounded by family by remnants of a people who were given as a dowry to a relentless war but still managed to make pearls of this life 
 by the ones who taught me to not only laugh  but to live in the face of death  
 who placed their hands across the sky  measuring the distance to the sun and saying
 i 'm gonna meet you there and for zeinab
 zeinab who taught me love in a place like france  zeinab  who wanted to he ar poems
 on her deathbed
 dilated fibromyalgia her heart muscles expanded
 until they couldn 't function  and she held me
  and she made me feel like gold  and i said zeinab  isn 't it strange that your only problem
 is that your heart was too big
