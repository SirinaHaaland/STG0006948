  i study
 the future of crime and terrorism  
 and frankly  i 'm afraid  i 'm afraid by what i see  i sincerely
  that we 've been promised but you see  i 've spent a career in law enforcement 
 and that 's informed my perspective on things i 've been a street police officer an undercover investigator a counter terrorism strategist  and i 've worked in more than seventy countries around the world  
 i 've had to see more than my fair share of violence
 and the darker underbelly of society and
  's informed my opinions 
 my work with criminals and terrorists has actually been highly educational they have taught me a lot  
 and i 'd like to be able to share some of these observations with you 
 today i 'm going to show you the flip side of all those technologies that we marvel at the ones
  that we love in the hands of the ted community these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world  
 but in the hands
 of suicide bombers the future can look quite different i started observing
 technology and how criminals were using it as a young patrol officer in those days this was the height of technology
  though you will all the drug dealers and gang members with whom i dealt had one of these long before any police officer i knew did 
 twenty years later criminals are still using mobile phones  
 but they 're also building their own mobile phone networks like this one  which has been deployed in all thirty one states of mexico by the narcos  
 they have a national encrypted radio communications system
 think about that think about the innovation that went into that think about the infrastructure to build it 
 and then think about this  why can 't i get a cell phone signal in san francisco 
 how is this possible it makes no sense 
 we consistently underestimate what criminals and terrorists can do
  technology has made our world increasingly open and for the most part that 's great but all of this openness may have unintended consequences  
 consider the two thousand and eight terrorist attack on mumbai  
 the men that carried that attack out were armed
 explosives and hand grenades  they threw these hand grenades at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes
  and waited to catch trains on their way home from work  
 but heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations guns and bombs are nothing new 
 what was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims
 and slaughter them they were armed with mobile phones
  they had blackberries  they had access to satellite imagery  they had satellite phones  and they even had night vision goggles  
 but perhaps their greatest innovation was this  
 we 've all seen pictures like this on television and in the news 
 this is an operations center and the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in pakistan where they monitored the bbc al jazeera
  jazeera  cnn and indian local stations they also monitored the internet and social media
 to monitor the progress of their attacks and how many people they had killed  
 they did all of this in real time 
 the innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over
  the police
 and over the government 
 what did they do with this  they used it to great effect 
 at one point during the 60 hour siege the terrorists were going room to room trying to find additional victims 
 they came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed and they
  are you and what are you doing here and the man replied i 'm just an innocent schoolteacher of course the terrorists knew
 that no indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the taj  
 they picked up his identification and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room 
 where the terrorist war room googled him and found a picture and called their operatives on the ground and said 
 your hostage is he heavyset
  is he bald in front  
 does he wear glasses 
 yes yes yes came the answers  
 the op center had found him and they had a match he was not a schoolteacher he was the second wealthiest businessman in india  
 and after discovering this information the terrorist war room
  all worry about our privacy settings on facebook 
 but the fact of the matter is our openness can be used against us 
 terrorists are doing this a search engine
 can determine who shall live and who shall die this is the world that we live in
 during the mumbai siege terrorists were so dependent on technology that several witnesses reported that as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand 
 they were checking their mobile phone messages in the very other hand 
 in the end  three hundred people were gravely wounded and over one hundred and
  women and children lost their lives that day  
 think about what happened  during this 60 hour siege on mumbai  ten
 men armed not just with weapons  but with technology were able to bring a city of twenty million people
 to a standstill  ten people brought twenty million people to a standstill  and this traveled around the world this
  this is what radicals can do with openness 
 this was done nearly four years ago  what could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have 
 what will they do tomorrow  
 the ability of one to affect many is scaling exponentially  and it 's scaling for good and it 's scaling for evil
 it 's not just about terrorism though there 's also been a big paradigm shift in crime  you see  
 you can now commit more crime as well in the old days it was a knife and a gun then criminals moved to robbing trains you could rob two hundred people on a train a great innovation 
 moving forward the internet allowed things to scale even more in fact many of you will remember the recent sony playstation hack
  in that incident over one hundred million people were robbed  
 think about that 
 when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob one hundred million 
 of course it 's not just about stealing things there are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit many of you will remember this super cute
  video from the last ted
  but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute  
 they don 't all have drumsticks some can be armed with hd cameras and do countersurveillance on protesters  
 or as in this little bit of movie magic  quadcopters can be loaded
 with firearms
 and automatic weapons
  are cute when they play music to you when they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you a little bit less so 
 of course  criminals and terrorists weren 't the first to give guns to robots we know where that started but they 're adapting quickly  recently the fbi arrested an al qaeda affiliate in the united states who was planning on using
  drone aircraft to fly c4 explosives into government buildings in the united states by the way these travel at over six hundred miles an hour  
 every time a new technology is being introduced criminals are there to exploit it we 've all seen 3d printers we know with them that you can print in many materials ranging from plastic to chocolate to metal and
  with great precision i actually was able to make this just the other day a very cute little ducky  
 but i wonder to myself for those people that strap
 bombs to their chests
 and blow themselves up how might they use
  if you can print in metal you can print one of these and in fact
 you can also print one of these too 
 the uk i know has some very strict firearms
  you needn 't bring the gun into the uk anymore  you just bring the 3d printer and print the gun while you 're here and of course the magazines for your bullets  
 but as these get bigger in the future  what other items will you be able to print the technologies are allowing bigger printers  
 as we move forward we 'll see new technologies also like the internet of things  every day we 're connecting more and more of our lives
  to the internet which means that the internet of things will soon be
 the internet of things to be hacked all of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies and that has a radical implication for our security  
 because more connections to more devices means more vulnerabilities 
 criminals understand this terrorists understand
  hackers understand this  if you control the code you control the world this is the future that awaits us 
 there has not yet been an operating system or a technology that hasn 't been hacked 
 that 's troubling since the human body itself
 is now becoming an information technology as we 've seen here we 're transforming ourselves into cyborgs  every year thousands
  thousands of cochlear implants diabetic pumps pacemakers and defibrillators are being implanted in people in the united states there are sixty thousand people who have a pacemaker that connects to the internet
  the defibrillators allow a physician at a distance to give a shock to a heart in case a patient needs it  
 but if you don 't need it and somebody else gives you the shock  it 's not a good thing 
 of course we 're going to go even deeper than the human body
  down to the cellular level these days up until this point all the technologies i 've been talking about have been silicon based ones and zeroes  
 but there 's another operating system out there 
 the original operating system dna 
 and to hackers dna is just another operating system waiting to be hacked  
 it 's a great challenge for them there are people already working on
  hacking the software of life and while most of them are doing this to great good and to help us all some won 't be 
 so how will criminals abuse this  well with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things for example i predict that we will move away from a 
 narcotics world
  why do you need the plants anymore you can just take the dna code from marijuana or poppies
 or coca leaves
 and cut and past that gene and put it into yeast and you can take those yeast and make them
 make the cocaine for you or the marijuana 
 or any other drug so how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting in fact we may have some really interesting bread and
  beer as we go into this next century
  the cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously  it was proceeding at moore 's law pace but then in two thousand and eight something changed the technologies got better 
 and now
 dna sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of moore 's law that has significant implications for us
  it took us thirty years to get from the introduction of the personal computer to the level of cybercrime we have today  
 but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly and knowing criminals and terrorists as i do we may get there a lot faster with biocrime in the future it
 will be easy for anybody to go ahead and print their own
  enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax weaponized flu we recently saw a case where some researchers made the 
 avian influenza virus more potent 
 it already has a seventy percent mortality rate if you get it but it 's hard to get engineers by moving around a small number of genetic changes were able to weaponize 
  it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch so that not thousands of people would die
  but tens of millions  you see you can
 go ahead and create new pandemics and the researchers who did this were so proud of their accomplishments they wanted to publish it openly so that everybody
 could see this and get access to this information  
 but it goes deeper than that dna researcher andrew hessel has pointed out quite rightly that if you can use cancer treatments modern cancer treatments to go after one
  one cell while leaving all the other cells around it intact then you can also go after any one person 's cell 
 personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons which means you can attack any one individual 
 including all the people in this picture 
 how will we protect them in the future  
 what to do
  what to do about all this that 's what i get asked all the time for those of you who follow me on twitter  i will be tweeting out the answer later on today laughter
 actually it 's a bit more complex than that and there are no magic bullets  
 i don 't have all the answers  but i know a few things in the wake of nine
  the best security minds
 put together all their innovation and this is what they created
 for security  if you 're expecting the people who built this to protect you from the coming robopocalypse
  while the threat is international 
 policing doesn 't scale globally at least it hasn 't and our current system of guns border guards  big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we 're moving 
 so how might we prepare for some of these specific threats like attacking a president or a prime minister this would be the natural government response to hide away all our government leaders in hermetically sealed bubbles
  but this is not going to work  the cost of doing a dna sequence is going to be trivial  anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future 
 so maybe there 's a more radical way that we can look at this  
 what happens if we were to take the president 's dna or a king or queen 's 
 and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that dna and do penetration testing against it as a
  of helping our leaders or what if we sent it out to a few thousand 
 or controversially and not without its risks  what happens if we just gave it to the whole public then we could all be engaged in helping 
 we 've already seen examples of this working well  the organized crime and corruption reporting project is staffed by journalists and citizens
  dictators and terrorists are doing with public funds around the world and in a more dramatic case we 've seen in mexico a country that has been racked by fifty thousand
 murders in the past six years 
 they 're killing so many people they can 't even afford to bury them all in anything but these unmarked graves like this one outside of ciudad juarez 
 what can we do about this the government has proven ineffective so in
  mexico citizens at great risk to themselves are fighting back to build an effective solution they 're crowd mapping the activities of the drug dealers  
 whether or not you realize it we are at the dawn of a technological arms race an arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill 
 the threat is serious and the time to prepare for
  it is now i can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are 
 my personal belief is that rather than having a small elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all we
 're much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can
  if we all do our part i think we 'll be in a much better space 
 the tools to change the world are in everybody 's hands how we use them is not just up to me  it 's up to all of us 
 this was a technology i would frequently deploy as a police officer 
 this technology has become outdated in our current world  it doesn 't scale it doesn 't work globally and it surely doesn 't work virtually
  we 've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism  they call for a shift
 to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement 
 so i invite you to join me after all public safety is too important to leave to the professionals  thank you
