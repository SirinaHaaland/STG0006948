  my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago  
 i was in the desert under the starry skies with the sufi singer mukhtiar ali 
 and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epic the mahabharata
  so back in the day when us indians wanted to travel we 'd jump into a chariot and we 'd zoom across the sky  now we do the same with airplanes 
 back then  when arjuna the great indian warrior prince when he was thirsty he 'd take out a bow he 'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out 
 now we do the same with drills and
  the conclusion that we came to
 was that magic had been replaced by machinery  
 and this made me really sad  
 i found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe i was terrified by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me without tweeting it to my friends  
 and it felt like technology should enable magic not kill it when i was a little girl my grandfather gave me his
 little silver pocket watch  and this piece of 50 year old technology became the most magical thing to me it became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination 
 so
 i felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming
  stopped us from being inspired  and so i jumped in i jumped into this world of technology to see how i could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it 
 i 've been illustrating books since i was sixteen  and so when i saw the ipad i saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world
 it can know how we 're holding it it it can know where we are it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch 
 storytelling
  is becoming more and more 
 but what are we doing with it so i 'm actually just going to
 go in and launch khoya  an interactive app for the ipad  so it says place your fingers upon each light
  a character in the book  at various points a little letter drops down to me and the ipad knows where you live because of gps which is actually addressed to me the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities
  now i 've been talking a lot about magic and i don 't mean wizards and dragons i mean the kind of childhood magic those ideas that we all harbored as children 
 this idea of fireflies in a jar
 some reason was always really exciting to me  and so over here you need to tilt your ipad take the fireflies out 
 and they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book 
 another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single
  and so over here 
 each book and each world becomes a little marble that i drag in  to this magical device within the device  
 and it opens up
 a map  
 all along all fantasy books have always had maps but these maps have been static this is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book it reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well
 enter in 
 another thing that 's actually really important to me is creating content that is indian
 and yet very contemporary 
 over here  these are the apsaras  so we 've all heard about fairies and we 've all heard about nymphs but how many people outside of india know about their indian counterparts the apsaras these poor apsaras have been trapped inside
  indra 's chambers for thousands of years in an old and musty book 
 and so we 're bringing them back in a contemporary story for children 
 and a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental
  of the environmental crisis
  i think a big problem has been in the last ten years is that children have been locked inside their rooms glued to their pcs they haven 't been able to get out but now with mobile technology we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology 
 one of the interactions in the book is that you 're sent off on this quest where you need to go outside take out your camera on the ipad and collect pictures of different natural
  when i was a child i had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells  and somehow kids don 't do that anymore so in bringing back this childhood ritual you need to go out and in one chapter take a picture of a flower
 and then tag it
  in another chapter you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that and what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online a child in london puts up a picture of a fox and says oh i saw a fox today
  child in india says i saw a monkey today and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you 've actually taken in the possibilities 
  of linking together magic the earth and technology  there are multiple possibilities in the next book we plan on having an interaction where you take your ipad out with the video on and through augmented reality you see this layer of animated pixies appear on a
  houseplant that 's outside your house  at one point your screen is filled up with leaves and so you need to make the sound of wind
 and blow them away and read the rest of the book 
 we 're moving we 're all moving here  to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology  and magic and technology can come come closer together we 're harnessing energy from the sun
 we 're bringing our children
  and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story
