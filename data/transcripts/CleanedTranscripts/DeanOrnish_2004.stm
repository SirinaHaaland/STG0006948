  is on natural wonders and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness i want to try to combine them all because to me healing is really the ultimate natural wonder
 your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing
  and much more quickly than people had once realized  if you simply stop doing whats causing the problem  
 and so  really so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet  
 i love doing this work because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didnt have before
  and it allows us to talk about things that not just
  but that
 happiness is not we 're talking about the pursuit of happiness but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions what
 aldous huxley called the perennial wisdom when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people 
 its really about our nature is to be happy our nature is to be peaceful our nature is to be healthy  
 and so its not something happiness is not something you get health is generally not something that you get  but rather all of these different practices
 you know the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns didnt
  develop these techniques to just manage stress or lower your blood pressure unclog your arteries even though it can do all those things 
 theyre powerful tools for transformation for quieting down our mind and bodies to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy to be peaceful to be joyful and
  to realize that its not something that you pursue and get but rather its something that you have already until you disturb it 
  with a teacher named swami satchidananda and people would say what are you a hindu hed say no im an undo and its really
 about identifying whats causing us to disturb our innate health and happiness  and then to allow that natural healing to occur to me thats the real natural wonder  
 so  within that larger context we can talk about diet  stress management which are really these spiritual practices moderate exercise smoking cessation
  cessation support groups and community which ill talk more about and some vitamins and supplements  
 and its not a diet you know when most people think about the diet i recommend they think its a really strict diet for reversing disease thats what it takes 
 but if youre just trying to be healthy you have a spectrum of choices and to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction  
 youre going to live longer youre going to feel better youre going to lose
  and in our studies what weve been able to do is to use very expensive high tech state of the art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low tech and low cost and in many ways ancient interventions can be 
 we first began by looking at heart disease and when i began doing this work twenty six or twenty seven years ago it was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse and what we found was that instead of getting worse and worse in many cases
  it could get better and better and much more quickly than people had once realized  
 this is a representative patient who at the time was seventy three totally needed to have a bypass decided to do this instead 
 we used quantitative arteriography showing the narrowing this is one of the arteries that feed the heart one of the main arteries and you can see the narrowing here a year later its not as clogged normally it goes the other direction 
 these minor changes in blockages caused a three hundred percent improvement in blood
  and using cardiac positron emission tomography or pet scans blue and black is no blood flow orange and white is maximal  huge differences can occur without drugs without surgery 
  clinically he literally couldnt walk across the street without getting severe chest pain  within a month like most people was pain free and within a year climbing more than one hundred floors a day on a stairmaster this is not unusual 
  and its part of what enables people to maintain these kinds of changes  because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life 
  they got worse and worse from one year to five years in the comparison group this is the natural history of heart disease but its really not natural because we found it could get better and better and much more quickly 
  than people had once thought  we also found that the more people change the better they got it wasnt a function of how old or how sick they were it was mainly how much they changed and the oldest patients improved as much as the young ones 
  programs the younger brother is eighty six the older ones ninety five they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were and the following year they sent me this one which i thought was kind of funny you just
 never know  
 and what we found was that ninety nine percent of the patients start to reverse the progression of their heart disease  
 now i thought you know if we just did good science that would change medical practice but that was a little naive its important but not enough because we doctors do what we get paid to do  and we get
  trained to do what we get paid to do  
 so if we change insurance then we change medical practice and medical education insurance will cover the bypass itll cover the angioplasty it wont until recently cover diet and lifestyle 
 so we began through our nonprofit institute 's training hospitals around the country  
 and we found that most people could avoid surgery and not only was it medically effective it was also cost effective and the insurance companies found that they began to save almost thirty thousand dollars per patient and medicare is
  now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where theyre paying for one thousand eight hundred people to go through the program on the sites that we train 
 the fortuneteller says i give smokers a discount because theres not as much to tell 
 i like this slide because its a chance to talk about
 what really motivates people to change and what doesnt and what doesnt work is fear of dying and thats whats normally used
 everybody who smokes knows its not good for you and still thirty percent of americans smoke
  eighty percent in some parts of the world  why do people do it well because it helps them get through the day and ill talk more about this but the real epidemic isnt just heart disease or obesity or smoking its loneliness and depression
 as one woman said ive got twenty friends in this package of cigarettes and theyre always there for me and nobody else is youre going to take away my twenty friends what are you going to give me or they eat when they get depressed or they use alcohol to numb the pain or they work too hard or watch too
  much tv there are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain but
 the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem and the pain is not the problem its the symptom
 and telling people theyre going to die is too scary to think about or theyre going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary  and so they dont want to think about it so they dont the most effective anti smoking ad was this one 
 youll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth and
  its not emphysema what was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago  viagra right  why 
 because a lot of guys need it its not like you say hey joe im having erectile dysfunction how about you and yet look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold 
 its not so much psychological its vascular and nicotine makes your arteries constrict  so does cocaine
 so does a high fat diet so does emotional stress so the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture
 are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired lethargic depressed and impotent  
 and thats not much fun  but when you change those behaviors your brain gets more blood you think more clearly you have more energy your heart gets more blood in ways ive shown you your sexual function improves  
 and these things occur within hours this is a study a high fat meal and within one or two hours
  is measurably less and youve all experienced this at thanksgiving when you eat a big fatty meal how do you feel you feel kind of sleepy afterwards on a low fat meal  the blood flow doesnt go down it even goes up
 many of you have kids and you know thats a big change in your lifestyle and so people are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle if theyre worth it and the paradox is that when you make big changes  you get big benefits and you feel so much better so quickly for many people those are
  choices worth making not to live longer  
 but to live better  i want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic because it really is a problem
 two thirds of adults are overweight or obese and diabetes in kids and 
  30 year olds has increased seventy percent in the last ten years its no joke its real 
 and just to show you this this is from the cdc  these are not election returns these are the percentage of people who are overweight and if you see from
  two thousand and two thousand and one mississippi more than twenty five percent of people are overweight  why is this well this is one way to lose weight that works very well  but it doesnt
  no mystery in how you lose weight  you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories now one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food which is why you can lose weight on any diet 
  if you eat less food or if you restrict entire categories of foods but the problem is you get hungry so its hard to keep it off 
  when you eat less fat you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food so you can eat the same amount of food  but youll be getting fewer calories because the food is less dense in calories  
 and its the volume of food that affects satiety rather than the type of food you know i dont like talking about the atkins diet but i get asked about it every day and so i just thought id spend a few minutes on that
 the myth that you hear about is americans have been told to eat less fat the percent of calories from fat is down americans are fatter than ever therefore
  americans are eating more fat than ever  and even more carbs and so the percentage is lower the actual amount is higher and so the goal is to reduce both dr atkins and i debated each other many times before he 
  died and we agreed that americans eat too many simple carbs the bad carbs and these are things like
 you get all these calories
  dont fill you up because youve removed the fiber and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down which is good but insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat 
 so the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages these are not health foods but to go from bad carbs to what are called good carbs and these are things like whole foods or unrefined carbs fruits vegetables whole wheat flour brown rice in their natural forms are rich in fiber
  and the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories and it slows the absorption so you dont get that rapid rise in blood sugar so and you get all the 
  substances its not just what you exclude from your diet  but also what you include thats protective just as all carbs are not bad for you all fats are not bad for you there are good fats and these are predominantly what are called the omega 3
  fatty acids you find these for example in fish oil  and the bad fats are things like trans fatty acids and processed food and saturated
  you dont remember anything else from this talk three grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack and sudden death by fifty to eighty percent three grams a day they come in one gram capsules 
 more than that just gives you extra fat you dont need it also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers like breast prostate and colon cancer 
 now the problem with the atkins diet  everybody knows people who have lost weight on it but you can lose weight on amphetamines you know and fen phen i mean there are lots of ways
  of losing weight that arent good for you you want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it 
 and the problem is that its based on this half truth which is that americans eat too many simple carbs so if you eat fewer simple carbs youre going to lose weight  youll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less 
  fat and youll enhance your health rather than harming it he says ive got some good news  while your cholesterol level has remained the same the research findings have changed 
  what happens to your heart when you go on an atkins diet  the red is good at the beginning and a year later this is from a study done in
 a peer reviewed journal called angiology theres more red after a year on a diet like i would recommend theres less red less blood flow after a year on an atkins type diet so  yes you can lose weight but your heart isnt happy
  now one of the studies funded by the atkins center found that seventy percent of the people were constipated sixty five percent had bad
  percent had headaches this is not a healthy way to eat and so you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you but when they get too close its going to be a problem 
 and more seriously there are case reports now of 16 year old girls who died after a few weeks on the atkins diet of bone disease kidney disease and so on 
  and thats how your body excretes waste is through your breath your bowels and your perspiration so when you go on these kinds of diet  they begin to smell bad 
  of the of the good fats  and then again its a spectrum when you move in this direction youre going to lose weight youre going to feel better and youre going to gain health  
 now there are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too whether its the deforestation of the amazon or making more protein available to the four billion people who live on a dollar a day  not to mention whatever ethical concerns people
  there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health now were about to publish the first study
 looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer and in collaboration with sloane kettering and with  ucsf
 we took ninety men who had biopsy proven prostate cancer and who had elected for reasons unrelated to the study not to have surgery we could randomly divide them into two groups and then we could have one group
 that is a non intervention control group to compare to which we cant do with say breast cancer because everyone gets treated what we
  was that after a year none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes needed treatment whereas six of the control group patients needed surgery or radiation 
 when we looked at their psa levels which is a marker for prostate cancer they got worse in the control group but they actually got better in the experimental group and these differences were highly significant 
 and then i wondered was there any relationship between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle whichever group they were in and the changes in
  enough we found a dose response relationship just like we found in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies  and in order for the psa to go down they had to make pretty big changes  i then wondered well maybe theyre just 
 changing their psa but its not really affecting the tumor growth so we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to ucla they added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture
  and it inhibited the growth seven times more in the experimental group than in the control group seventy versus nine percent  
 and finally i said i wonder if theres any relationship between how much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth whichever group they happened to be in and this really got me excited because again we found the same pattern the more people change the more it affected the growth of their tumors  
 and finally we did mri and mr spectroscopy scans on some of these patients and the tumor activity is shown in red in this patient and you can see clearly its better a year later  along with the psa going down
  so if its true for prostate cancer itll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well  and whether or not you have conventional treatment in addition if you make these changes it may help reduce the risk of recurrence 
 the last thing i want to talk about apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness is that
 study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely in part because
 as we talked about theyre more likely to smoke and overeat and drink too much and work too hard and so on  
 but also through mechanisms that we dont fully understand people who are lonely and depressed are many times three to five to ten times in some studies more likely to get sick and die prematurely and depression is treatable we need to do something about that 
 now on the other hand anything that promotes intimacy is
  it can be sexual intimacy i happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing 
 friendship  altruism compassion service all the perennial truths that we talked about that are part of all religion and all cultures once you stop trying to see the differences 
 these are the things in our own self interest because they free us from our suffering and from disease and its in a sense the most selfish thing that we can
  at one study this was done by david spiegel at stanford
 he took women with metastatic breast cancer randomly divided them into two groups one group of people just met for an hour and a half once a week in a support group it was a nurturing loving environment where they were encouraged 
  to let down their emotional defenses and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer with people who understood because they were going through it too they just met once a week for a year five years later those women lived twice as long and you can see 
  that the people and that was the only difference between the groups it was a randomized control study published in the lancet 
  have shown this as well  
 so these simple things that create intimacy are really healing and even the word healing it comes from the root to make whole the word yoga comes from the sanskrit meaning union to yoke to bring together
