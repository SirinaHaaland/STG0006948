  i 'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency
 what i mean by that is that it 's time for architecture to do things again not just represent things 
 this is a construction helmet that i received two years ago
 at the groundbreaking of the largest project i and my firm have ever been involved
 was thrilled to get it i was thrilled to be the only person standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet  i thought it represented the importance of the architect 
 i stayed thrilled until i got home threw the helmet onto my bed fell down onto my bed and realized inside there was an inscription 
  i think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architects today we are for decorative purposes only 
 now who do we have to blame we can only blame ourselves over the last fifty years
 the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more litigious  and we architects are cowards 
 so as we have faced liability we have stepped back and back and unfortunately where there is liability guess what there is
 power so eventually we have found ourselves in a totally marginalized position way over here 
 now what did we do we 're cowards  but we 're smart cowards  
 and so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture and we announced hey architecture it 's over here in this autonomous language we 're going to seed control of processes 
 and we were going to do
  something that was horrible for the profession we actually created an artificial schism between creation and execution  
 as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute and as if you could actually execute without knowing how to create 
 now something else happened  and that 's when we began to sell the world that architecture was created by individuals creating genius sketches  
  incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided  but we would merely write it off as
 merely execution  
 now i 'd argue that that is as absurd as stating that thirty minutes of copulation is the creative act  and nine months
  of child labor
 is merely execution 
 so what do we architects need to do we need to stitch back creation and execution  and we need to start authoring processes again
 instead of authoring objects now if we do this i believe we can go back fifty years and start reinjecting agency  social engineering back into architecture 
 now there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do like
  managing contracts learning how to write contracts  understanding procurement processes
  understanding the time value of money and cost estimation but i 'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process 
 into three very pedantic statements  the first is take core positions with your client i know it 's shocking right that architecture would actually
  the second position is actually take positions take joint positions with your client this is the moment in which you as the architect and your client can begin to inject vision and agency but it has to be done together  
 and then only after this is done are you allowed to do this begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions 
 and both owner and architect alike are empowered to critique those manifestations based on the positions that you 've taken
  believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this i 'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control 
 you do not know what the end result is but i promise you with enough brain power and enough passion and enough commitment 
 you will arrive at conclusions
 that will transcend convention  and will simply be something that you could not have initially
 or individually conceived of alright 
 now i 'm going to reduce all of this to a series of simple dumb sketches  
 this is the modus operandi that we have today  
 we roll  120 foot spartan  i e our vision up to our clients  ' gates of troy  
 and we don 't understand why they won 't let us in
  about instead of doing that we roll up to the gates something they want 
 now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor because of course we all know that inside of the trojan horse were a bunch of people with spears 
 so we can change the metaphor let 's call the trojan horse the vessel by which you get through the gate get through the constraints of a project 
 at which point you and your client have the ability to start considering what you 're going to put
  inside that vessel the agency  the vision 
 and if you do that you do that responsibly  i believe that instead of delivering spartans you can deliver maidens  
 and if i could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this if we are so good at our craft shouldn 't we be able to conceive
 of an architectural manifestation that
 slides seamlessly through the project 's and the client 's constraints 
 now with that in mind i 'm going to show a project that 's very dear to many people in this room well maybe not dear but certainly close to many people in this room  
 and that 's a project that is just about to open next week the new
 home for the dallas theater center the dee and charles wyly theatre now i 'm going to present it on the same terms issue position and architectural manifestation 
 now the first issue that we faced was that the dallas theater center had a notoriety that
  was beyond what you would expect of some place outside of the triumvirate of new york  chicago and seattle 
 and this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership  but it also had to do with something rather unusual and that was this horrible little building that they 'd been performing in 
 why was this horrible horrible little building so important to their
 renown and their innovation because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building
  when you 're on broadway  you cannot tear the proscenium down 
 this building  when an artistic director wanted to do a cherry orchard and wanted people and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage they brought a backhoe in and they simply dug the hole 
 well that 's exciting  and you can start to get the best artistic directors scenic designers and actors from around the country to come to perform here because you can do things you can 't do elsewhere 
  first position we took was hey  we as architects had better not show up and do a pristine building that doesn 't engender the same freedoms that this old dilapidated shed provided the company 
 the second issue is a nuance of the first  and that 's that the company and the building was multiform that meant that they were able to perform 
  as long as they had labor
 they were able to go between proscenium thrust flat floor arena traverse you name it all they needed was labor  
 well something happened  in fact something happened to all institutions around the world it started to become hard to raise operational costs operational budgets 
 so they stopped having inexpensive labor and eventually they had to freeze their organization into something called a bastardized
  the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided the ability to move between stage configurations had better be able to be done without relying on operational costs 
 alright affordably  
 the architectural manifestation
 was frankly just dumb 
 it was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house at first blush you think hey it 's crazy what could you possibly gain 
 we created what we like to call superfly
 now superfly the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower and you smear them across flytower and auditorium  
 suddenly the artistic director can move between different stage and audience configurations  
 and because that flytower has the ability to pick up all the pristine elements suddenly the rest of the environment can be provisional and you can drill cut nail screw paint and replace
  with a minimum of cost  
 but there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move that was unexpected  and that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium in a most unusual way  
 and that provided the artistic director suddenly the ability to define suspension of disbelief 
 so the building affords artistic directors the freedom to conceive of almost any kind of activity underneath this floating object  but also
 to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief
 such that in the last act of macbeth if he or she wants you to associate the parable that you 're seeing with dallas with your real life  
 he or she can do so 
 now in order to do this we and the clients had to do something fairly remarkable  in fact it really was the clients who had to do it 
 they had to make a decision based on the positions we took
 to redefine the budget being from two
  thirds capital a architecture and one third infrastructure 
 to actually the inverse two thirds infrastructure and one third capital a architecture 
 that 's a lot for a client to commit to before you actually see the fruition of the concept 
 but based on the positions they took the educated leap of faith to do so 
 and effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine 
 now that theater machine has ability to move
  between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time  
 but it also has the potential to not only provide multiform but multi processional sequences  
 meaning the artistic director doesn 't necessarily need to go through our lobby one of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters is they hate us architects because they say the first thing they have to do the first five minutes of
  any show is they have to get our architecture out of the mind of their patron  
 well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture so
 in fact there is the building there is what we call the draw you 're going down into our lobby 
 go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits whether you like them or not up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium
  but there is also the potential to allow people to move directly from the outside in this case suggesting kind of wagnerian entrance into the interior of the auditorium  
 and here is the fruition of that in actuality  these are the two large pivoting doors that allow people to move directly from the outside  in or from the inside out performers or audience alike  
 now imagine what that could be i have to say honestly this is not something yet the building can
  do because it takes too long but imagine the freedoms if you could take this further that in fact you could consider a wagnerian entry 
 a first act in thrust an intermission in greek 
 a second act in arena and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits 
 now that i would say is architecture performing it is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in favor of the hand of the artistic director
 go through the three basic configurations this is the flat floor configuration  
 you notice that there is no proscenium the balconies have been raised up there are no seats the floor in the auditorium is flat 
 the first configuration is easy to understand the balconies come down you see that the
 orchestra begins to have a rake that 's frontal towards the end stage and the seats come in the third configuration is a little harder to
  understand here you see
 that the balconies actually have to move out of the way in order to bring a thrust into the space  and some of the seats need to actually change their direction and change their rake to allow that to happen i 'll do it again so you can see it 
 there you see it 's the side balconies for the proscenium  
 and there it is in the thrust configuration 
  in order to do that again we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks and they told us one important thing you shall not beta test 
 meaning nothing that we do can we be the first ones to do it  but they were willing for us to apply technologies from other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building 
 and the solution in terms of the balconies was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift 
 now if you were to take a scoreboard and drop it on dirt and whiskey
  that would be bad  
 if you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the ice capades the next night  that would also be bad  
 and so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms and allowed the theater and our client to actually do this with confidence that they would be able to change over their configurations
  the second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house 
 in this case what we 're doing is we 're taking the orchestra floor  lifting it up spinning it  changing the rake 
 taking it back to flat floor  changing the rake again in essence  you can begin to define rakes and
 viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating
  here you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage to thrust configuration  
 the proscenium also as far as we know this is the first building in the world in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space  
 here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium  
 and ultimately up in the flytower  the
 scene sets that allow the transformations to occur
 as i said all that was
  in service of creating a flexible yet affordable configuration  
 but we got this other benefit and that was the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage dallas on the outside  
 here you see the building in its current state with blinds closed this is a trompe l 'oeil 
 actually this is not a curtain these are vinyl blinds that are integrated into the windows themselves again with failsafe mechanisms
 that can be lifted
  such that you can completely demystify if you chose  the operations of the theater going on behind rehearsals and so forth but you also have the ability
 to allow the audience to see dallas to perform with dallas as the backdrop of your performance  
 now if i 'll take you through this is an early concept sketch take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together  
 effectively you would have something like this  you would be
  allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber aida their elephants you can bring the elephants in 
 you would be able to expose the auditorium to dallas or vice versa dallas to the auditorium you
 'd be able to open portions in order to change the procession allow people to come in and out for an intermission or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance 
 as i said all the balconies can move but they can also be
  completely the proscenium can fly you can bring large objects into the chamber itself  
 but most convincingly when we had to confront the idea of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure 
 is something that is represented by this and again this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built  but at least suggests the ideas  
  this building has the ability in short order to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out  now if there is anyone here from american airlines  please consider doing your christmas party here laughter
 that allows the company to raise operational budgets without having to compete with other venues with much larger auditoriums 
 that 's an enormous benefit 
 so the theater company has the ability to do totally hermetic
 but can also do beckett
 with the skyline of dallas sitting behind it 
 here it is in a flat floor configuration  the theater has been going through its kind of paces 
 here it is in an end stage configuration it 's actually beautiful there was a rock band we stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked and you could see the guys
 doing this but you couldn 't hear them it was very unusual  
  here it is in a thrust configuration  
 and last but not least you see this already has the ability to create events in order to generate operational budgets to overcome the building in fact performing to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem 
 i 'm going to show you a brief
 time lapse as i said this can be done with only two people and with a minimum amount of time this is the first time that actually the changeover was done and so there is literally thousands of people because everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it  so in a way try to disregard all the thousands
  of ants running around and think of it being done with just a few people
  just a couple people are required
  in conclusion a few shots  this is the at & t performing arts center 's dee and charles wyly theater there it is at night  and last but not least
  t performing arts center  you can see the winspear opera house on the right and the dee and charles wyly theater on the left
