  to speak at the end of a conference like this 
 because everyone has spoken everything has been said  so i thought that what may be useful is to remind us
 of some of the things that have gone on
  here and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away  and take forward and work on  that 's
 what i 'd like to try and do we came here saying we want to talk about africa the next chapter but we are talking about africa the next chapter because
 we are looking at the old and the present chapter that we 're looking at and saying it 's not such a good thing the
  i showed you before and this picture of drought  death and disease is what we usually see 
 what we want to look at is africa the next chapter and that 's this 
 a healthy  smiling  beautiful african and i think it 's worth remembering what we 've heard through the conference right from the first day where i heard that all the important statistics have been
  given
 about where we are now about how the continent is doing much better 
 and the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on so i 'm not going to spend too much time just to show you refresh your memories that
 we are here for africa the next chapter because for the first time
 there really is a platform to build on  we really do have it going right that the continent is growing
 at rates that people had thought would not happen after decades of two percent we are now at five percent and it 's going to projected
 six and seven percent even and inflation has come down  external debt something that i can tell you a long story about
 because i personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent has come down dramatically  you know as you can see
 from almost fifty billion down to about
 twelve or thirteen billion now this is a huge achievement  you know we 've built up reserves why is that important it 's because it shows off our economies shows off our currencies and 
  gives a platform on which people can plan and build including businesses  we 've also seen some evidence that all this is is making a difference because
  flows have increased i want to remind you again i know you saw these statistics before from almost six billion we are now at about eighteen billion in two thousand and five remittances i just took one country nigeria
 skyrocketing
 skyrocketing is too dramatic but
 increasing dramatically  and in many other countries this is happening why is this important because it shows confidence people are now confident
  to bring if your people in the diaspora bring their money back it shows other people that look there is emerging confidence in your country and instead of an outflow you are now getting a net inflow 
 now why is all this important to have to go really fast it 's important that we build this platform that we have the president kikwete and others
  of our leaders who are saying look we must do something different because we are confronted with a challenge  sixty two percent of our population is below the age of twenty four 
 what does this mean 
 this means that we have to focus on how our youth are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives you have to focus on how to
 create jobs make sure they don 't fall into disease and that they get an education but most of all that they are productively engaged in life and that they are creating
  of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen  
 and to support this i just recently one of the things i 've done since leaving government is to start an opinion research organization in nigeria most of our countries don 't even have any opinion research people don 't have voice 
 there is no way you can know what people want one of the things we asked them recently was what 's their top issue like in every other
  country where this has been done jobs
 is the top issue  
 i want to leave this up here and come and come back to it  but before before i get to this slide i just wanted to run you through this and to say that for me  the next stage of building this platform
 that now enables us to move forward and we mustn 't make light of it
  ago we couldn 't even talk about  the next chapter  
 because we were in the old chapter we were going nowhere the economies were not growing we were having negative per capita growth  
 the microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward was not even there  
 so let 's not forget that it 's taken a lot to build this including all those things that we tried to do in nigeria that dele referred to
 creating our own program to solve problems  
 like fighting corruption building institutions  
 stabilizing the micro economy  so now we have this platform we can build on  and it brings us to
 the debate
 that has been going on here aid versus private sector aid versus trade
 and someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things is that it 's been a simplistic debate  
 and that 's not what the debate should be about that 's engaging in the wrong debate the issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors 
 the private sector and ordinary african people
 taking charge of their own lives
  how do we combine all this 
 to move our continent forward to do the things that need doing that i talked about getting young people employed 
 getting the creative juices flowing on this continent much of what you have seen here  so i 'm afraid we 've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate we need to bring it back
  is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want and
 i want to tell you something for me the issue about aid i don 't think that africans need to now go all the way over to the other side 
  and feel bad about aid  africa has been giving the other countries aid  
  at a debate we were at that
 he dreams one day when africa will be giving aid and i said mo you 're right 
 we have no but we 've already been doing it 
 the  u k and the u s could not have been built today without africa 's aid 
 it is all the resources that were taken from africa
  human that built these countries today  
 so when they try to give back we shouldn 't be on the defensive  
 the issue is not that the issue is how are we using
 what has been given back  how are we using it is it being directed effectively  
 i want to tell you a little story
 i don 't mind if we get aid but we use it well from 
  to ' seventy nigeria fought a war the nigeria biafra war  
 and in the middle of that war i was fourteen years old we spent much of our time with my mother cooking 
 for the army my father joined the army as a brigadier the biafran army we were on the biafran side
 and we were down to eating one meal a day running from place to place but wherever we could help we did at a certain point in time in 
 things were really bad we were down to almost
 nothing in terms of a meal a day people children were dying of kwashiorkor i 'm sure some of you who are not so young will remember those
  i was in the middle of it in the midst of all this my mother fell ill
 with a stomach ailment for two or three days  we thought she was going to die my father was not there he was in the army  so i was the oldest person
 in the house my sister fell very ill
 with malaria  she was three years old
 and i was fifteen  and she had
 such a high fever we tried everything it didn 't look like it was going to work work until we heard that ten kilometers away there was a doctor
 who was looking at people and giving them meds now i put my sister on my back burning
 and i walked ten kilometers with her strapped on my back it was really hot  i was very hungry  i was scared because
 i knew her life depended on my getting to this woman we heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people i walked ten kilometers putting one foot in front of the other i got there and i saw huge crowds 
 almost a thousand people were there trying to break down the door she was doing this in a church  how was i going to get in 
 i had to crawl in between the legs of these people with
 my sister strapped on my back find a way to a window  and while they were trying to break down the door
  i climbed in through the window  and jumped in this woman told me
 it was in the nick of time by the time we jumped jumped into that hall she was barely moving 
 she gave a shot of her chloroquine what i learned was the chloroquine then gave her some it must have been
  and some other therapies and put us in a corner in about two to three hours  she started to move  
 and then they toweled her down
 because she started sweating which was a good sign  
 and then my sister woke up and about five or six hours later  she said we could go home
 i strapped her on my back  i walked the ten kilometers back and it was the shortest walk i ever had i was so happy 
 that my sister
 was alive today she 's forty one years old a mother of three and she 's a physician saving other lives  
 why am i telling that i 'm telling you that because
 when it is you or your person involved you don 't care where whether it
  's aid
  you don 't care what it is
 you just want the person to be alive  and now let me become less sentimental and say that saving lives which some of the aid we get
 does on this continent when you save the life of anyone
 a teacher a mother they are contributing productively into the economy and as an economist 
 we can also look at that side of the story these are people who are productive agents in the economy  
 so if we save people from hiv aids if we save them from malaria  it means they can form the base
 of production for our economy and by the same token as someone said
  if we don 't and they die their children will become a burden on the economy  so even from an economic standpoint if we leave the social and the humanitarian  we need to save 
  lives now  so that 's one of the reasons from a personal experience that i say
  i will also tell you that i 'm one of those
 who doesn 't believe that this is the sole answer that 's why i said the debate has to get more sophisticated  
 you know  we have to use it well what has happened in europe do you all know
 that spain part of the eu got ten billion dollars in aid from the rest of the eu resources that were transferred to them
  the spanish
 ashamed of this  
 no  the eu transferred ten billion where did they use it have you been to southern spain lately 
 there are roads everywhere infrastructure everywhere  it is on the back of this
 that the whole of southern spain has developed into a services economy did you know that ireland got three billion dollars in aid
  ireland is one of the fastest growing economies in the european union today 
 for which many people even from other parts of the world are going there to find jobs what did they do with the three billion dollars in aid  
 they used it to build an information
 superhighway gain infrastructure that enables them to participate
  economy  they didn 't say no you know we 're not going to take this today the european union is busy transferring aid my frustration is if they can build infrastructure in spain which is roads  
 highways other things that they can build i say then why do they refuse to use the same aid to build the same infrastructure in our countries
  when we ask them and tell them what we need one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now now we talk about the world bank imf and accountability all that and the eu we also have
 private citizens now who have a lot of money some of them in this audience with private foundations  
 and one day these foundations have so much money they will overtake
 the official aid that is being given
 but i fear and i 'm very grateful to all of them for what they are trying to do on the continent but i 'm also worried  i wake up with
 a gnawing in my belly
 because i see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent  
 and they 're also going from country to country  
 and many times trying to find what to do but i 'm not
  really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way  
 and many of them are not really familiar with the continent they are just discovering  and many times i don 't see africans working with them 
 they are just going alone 
 and many times i get the impression that they are not really even interested
 in hearing from africans who might know  they want to visit
  us see what 's happening on the ground and make a decision  and now i 'm maybe being harsh but i worry because this money is so important 
 now who are they accountable to 
 are we on their boards when they make decisions about where to channel money are we there 
 will we make the same mistake that we made before have our presidents and our leaders everyone is talking about have they ever called these people together
 look your foundation and your foundation you have so much money we are grateful let 's sit down and really tell you where
 the money should be channeled and where this aid should go have we done that 
 the answer is no  
 and each one is making their own individual effort  and then ten years from now billions will again have gone into africa
  and we would still have the same problems this is what gives us the hopeless image our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money sit down 
 and we don 't do it because there are so many of of us we don 't coordinate  
 we 've not called the bill gates
  down let 's have a conference with you 
 as a continent here are our priorities 
 here is where we want you to channel this money each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best we 're not trying to stop them
 at all but to help them help us better 
 and what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this  ten years from now we will have the same story  
 and we will be repeating the same
  things so our problem right now is how can we leverage all this good will
 that is coming towards our way how can we get government to combine properly
 with these private foundations with the international
  and with our private sector  
 i firmly believe in that private sector thing too  but it cannot do it alone  so there might be a few ideas we could think of
 that could work they said this is about
 proliferating and sharing ideas 
 so why don 't we think of using some of this aid  well why don 't we first say to those helping us out don 't be shy about infrastructure 
 that health
 that you 're working on cannot
  be sustainable without infrastructure that education will work better
 if we 've got electricity and railroads and so on 
 that agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market don 't be shy of it  
 invest some of your resources in that
  we can see that
 this is one combination of private international multilateral money private sector
 and the african that we can put together
 as a partnership  
 so that aid can be a facilitator that is all aid can be aid cannot solve our problems i 'm firmly convinced about that but it can be catalytic
  and if we fail to use it as catalytic we would have failed one of the reasons why china is a bit popular with africans now
 one of the reasons
 is not only just that you know these people are stupid and china is coming to take resources it 's because
 there 's a little more leverage in terms of the chinese if you tell them we need a road here 
 they will help you build it
  shy away from infrastructure in fact the chinese minister of finance said to me when i asked him what are we doing wrong in nigeria  he said there are two things you need only 
 infrastructure infrastructure infrastructure and discipline  
 you are undisciplined 
 and i repeat it for the continent it 's the same we need
 so we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that now i realize i 'm not saying health and education no you can also provide that 
 as well  but i 'm saying it 's not either or let 's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership one idea  second thing for the private sector 
  why can 't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms to enable people to take risk and
 finally because they are both standing at my i 'm out of time 
 am i out of time ok so let me not forget my punchline one of the things
  said here about women i don 't need to repeat it  but there are people women creating jobs  and we know studies have shown that when you put resources in the hand of the woman in fact there 
  's an econometric study the world bank review done in two thousand  showing that transfers into the hands of women result in
  healthier children more for the household  more for the economy and all that  so i 'm saying that one of the takeaways from here i 'm not saying the men are not important obviously if you leave the husbands out what will
 they do they 'll come back home and get disgruntled  and it will result in difficulties we don 't want we don 't want men beating their wives because they
  the hands of women
  private sector and the african
