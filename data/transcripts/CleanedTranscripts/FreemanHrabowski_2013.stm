  be talking about the success of my campus the university of maryland baltimore county umbc 
 in educating students of all types  across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas 
 what makes our story especially
  important
 is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder students of color students 
 underrepresented in selected areas  and what makes the story especially unique is that we have learned how to help african american
  latino students students from low income backgrounds to become some of the best in the world in science and engineering  
 and so i begin with a story about my childhood we all are products of our childhood experiences
  it 's hard for me to believe that it 's been fifty years since i had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in birmingham alabama a kid who loved getting a
  a kid who loved math who loved to read 
 a kid who would say to the teacher when the teacher said here are ten problems to the class this little fat kid would say give us ten more 
 and the whole class would say shut up freeman 
 and there was a designated kicker every day  
 and so i was always asking this question well how could we get more kids to really love to learn 
 and amazingly one week in
  in church when i really didn 't want to be there and i was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems 
 i heard this man say this if we can get the children
 to participate in this peaceful demonstration here in birmingham 
 we can show america that even children know the difference between right and wrong and that children
  really do want to get the best possible education and i looked up and said who is that man and they said his name was dr martin luther king 
 and i said to my parents i 've got to go i want to go i want to be a part of this and they said absolutely not 
 and we had a rough go of it and at that time  quite frankly you really did not talk back to your parents and somehow i said you know you guys are hypocrites you make me go to this you make me listen
  the man wants me to go and now you say no 
 and they thought about it all night  and they came into my room the next morning they had not slept they had been literally crying and praying and thinking will we let our 
  12 year old participate in this march and probably have to go to jail and they decided to do it and when they came in to tell me i was at first elated  and then all of a sudden i began
  thinking about the dogs and the fire hoses and i got really scared i really did and one of the points i make to people all the time is that sometimes when people do things that are courageous it doesn 
  't really mean that they 're that courageous it simply means that they believe it 's important to do it  i wanted a better education  i did not want to have to have  hand me down books
  i wanted to know that the school i attended not only had good teachers but the resources we needed  and as a result of that experience in the middle of the week while i was there in jail dr king came and said with our parents what you children do this day
 will have an impact on children who have not been born 
 i recently realized that two thirds of americans today had not been
  and so for them when they hear about the children 's crusade in birmingham  in many ways  if they see it on tv  it 's like our looking at the one thousand eight hundred and sixty three lincoln movie  it 's history 
 and the real question is what lessons did we learn well amazingly  the most important for me was this that children can be empowered
 to take ownership of their education  they can be taught to be passionate about wanting to learn and to love the idea of asking
  questions  and so it is especially significant that the university i now lead the university of maryland baltimore county umbc was founded the very year i went to jail with dr king in one thousand nine hundred and sixty three 
 and what made that institutional founding especially important is that maryland is the south as you know and  quite frankly  it was the
  first university in our state founded at a time when students of all races could go there 
 and so we had black and white students and others who who began to attend  and it has been for fifty years an experiment  
 the experiment is this is it possible to have institutions in our country universities  where people from all backgrounds can come and learn and learn to work together and
  learn to become leaders and to support each other in that experience now what is especially important about that experience for me is this 
  we found that we could do a lot in the arts and humanities and social sciences and so we began to work on that for years in the ' 60s and we produced a number of people in law all the way to to the humanities we produced great artists beckett is our muse
  it 's great work  
 the problem that we faced was the same problem america continues to face that students in the sciences and engineering black students were not succeeding  but when i looked at the data what i found 
 was that quite frankly students in general  large numbers were not making it  
  first of all the group at the bottom african american students and then hispanic students and 
  robert and jane meyerhoff philanthropists said we 'd like to help robert meyerhoff said why is it that everything i see on tv about black boys  if it 's not about basketball is not positive  
 i 'd like to make a difference to do something that 's positive we married those ideas and we created this meyerhoff scholars program  and what is significant about the program is that we learned a number of things and the question is this how is it that now we lead
  the country in producing african americans who go on to complete ph d ' s in science and engineering and 
  that 's a big deal give me a hand for that that 's a big deal that 's a big deal it really is 
 you see most people don 't realize that it 's not just minorities who don 't do well in science
  you 're talking about americans if you don 't know it  while twenty percent of blacks and hispanics who begin with a major in science and engineering will actually graduate in science and engineering 
  only thirty two percent of whites who begin with majors in those areas actually succeed and graduate in those areas and only forty two percent of asian americans and so the real question is what is the challenge well a part of  it of
  but the other part has to do with the culture of science and engineering on our campuses  whether you know it or not large numbers of students with high sat 's and large numbers of a p credits who go to the most prestigious universities in our country begin in 
  and engineering and they end up changing their majors  and the number one reason we find quite frankly is they did not do well in first year science
  in fact we call first year science and engineering  typically around america weed out courses or barrier courses how many of you in this audience know somebody who started off in  pre med or engineering and changed their major within a year or two  it 's an american challenge half of you in the room i know  i know i
 know and what is interesting about that is that so many students are smart and can do it  we need to find ways of making it happen so what are the four things we did to help minority students that
  now are helping students in general number one high expectations  it takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students their grades the rigor of the course work 
 their test taking skills their attitude the fire in their belly the passion for the work to make it and so doing things to help students prepare to be in that position very important  but equally 
  important  it takes an understanding that it 's hard work that makes the difference i don 't care how smart you are or how smart you think you are smart simply means you 're ready to learn
  're excited about learning and you want to ask good questions i i rabi a nobel laureate said that when he was growing up in new york all of his friends ' parents would ask them what did 
  you learn in school at the end of a day and he said in contrast his jewish mother would say izzy did you ask a good question today 
  high expectations we began to find students we wanted to work with to see what could we do to help them not simply to survive in science and engineering  but to become the very best to excel 
 interestingly enough an example one young man who earned a c in the first course and wanted to go on to med school we said we need to have you retake the course  because you need a strong foundation if you 're going to move to the next level every foundation makes the difference
  in the next level he retook the course that young man went on to graduate from umbc to become the first black to get the m d ph d from the university of pennsylvania he now works at harvard nice story give him a hand for that too 
 secondly  it 's not about test scores only test scores are important but they 're not the most important thing one young woman had great grades but test scores were not as high  but she had a factor that was very important she never
 missed a day of school k 12
 there was fire in that belly  that young woman went on and she is today with an m d ph d from hopkins  she 's on the faculty  tenure track in psychiatry ph d in neuroscience 
 she and her adviser have a patent on a second use of viagra for diabetes patients big hand for her 
 and so high expectations very important  secondly the idea
  building community among the students you all know that so often in science and engineering we tend to think cutthroat students are not taught to work in groups and that 's what we work to do with 
  that group to get them to understand each other to build trust among them to support each other to learn how to ask good questions  but also to learn how to explain concepts with clarity  
  that sense of responsibility makes all the difference in the world so building community among those students very important third the idea of it takes researchers to produce researchers 
  whether you 're talking about artists producing artists or you 're talking about people getting into the social sciences  whatever the discipline and especially in science and engineering  as
  for example you need scientists to pull the students into the work and so our students are working in labs regularly  and one great example that you 'll appreciate during a snowstorm in baltimore 
 several years ago the guy on our campus with this howard hughes medical institute grant literally came back to work in his lab after several days and all these students had refused to leave the lab they had food they had packed
  they were in the lab working and they saw the work not as schoolwork but as their lives they knew they were working on aids research they were looking at this amazing protein design and what was interesting was
 each one of them focused on that work and he said it doesn 't get any better than that and then finally if you 've got the community and you 've got the high expectations and you 've got researchers producing researchers you have to have people who are willing
  as faculty to get involved with those students  even in the classroom i 'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying i 've got this young man in class a young black guy and he seems like he 's just 
  not excited about the work he 's not taking notes  we need to talk to him what was significant was that the faculty member was observing every student to understand who was really involved and 
  who was not and was saying let me see how i can work with them let me get the staff to help me out it was that connecting that young man today is actually a faculty member
  at duke  give him a big hand for that 
 and so the significance is that we have now developed this model that is helping us not only finally with evaluation assessing what works and what 
  we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses  and so we redesigned chemistry we redesigned physics but now we are looking at redesigning the humanities and social sciences  because so many students are bored in class
 do you know that many students k 12 and in universities don 't want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk they need to be engaged and so we have done if you look at our website at the chemistry discovery center 
 you 'll see people coming from all over the country to look at how we are redesigning courses having an emphasis on collaboration use of technology  using problems out of our
 biotech companies on our campus and not giving students the theories but having them struggle with those theories  and it 's working so well that throughout our university system in maryland  more and more courses 
 are being redesigned it 's called academic innovation and what does all of that mean  it means that now not just in science and engineering we now have programs in the arts in the humanities in the social sciences  in teacher education
  decline in the number of women majoring in computer science just since two thousand  
 and what i 'm saying is that what will make the difference will be building community among students  telling young women young minority students and students in general  you can do this work 
 and most important  giving them a chance to build that community with faculty pulling them into the work and our assessing what works and what does not work most important  if a student has
  a sense of self 
 it is amazing how the dreams and the values can make all the difference in the world when i was a 12 year old child in the jail in birmingham  i kept thinking i wonder what my future could be 
 i had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in birmingham to one day be president
  of a university that has students from one hundred and fifty countries  where students are not there just to survive  where they love learning  where they enjoy being the best  where they 
  will one day change the world  aristotle said excellence is never an accident it is the result of high intention  
 not chance  determines your destiny choice not chance  determines your destiny  dreams
 and values thank you all very much
