  when the crisis came  the serious limitations of existing economic and financial models immediately became apparent
  oversimplistic
 and overconfident economics helped create the crisis 
 now you 've probably all heard of similar criticism coming from people who are skeptical of capitalism  
 but this is different this is coming from the heart
 of finance  the first quote is from  jean claude trichet when he was governor of the european central bank  
 the second quote
  head of the uk financial services authority are these people implying
 that we don 't understand the economic systems that drive our modern societies 
 it gets worse we spend billions of dollars
 trying to understand the origins of the universe  while we still don 't understand the conditions
 for a stable society
 a functioning economy or peace 
 what 's happening here  
 how can this be possible do we really understand more about the fabric of reality than we do about the fabric which emerges from our human interactions  
 unfortunately the answer is yes  
 but there 's an intriguing solution which is coming from
 what is known as the science
  of complexity 
 to explain what this means and what this thing is please let me quickly take a couple of steps back 
 i ended up in physics by accident it was a random encounter when i was young  
 and since then i 've often wondered about the amazing success of physics
 in describing the
  we wake up in every day in a nutshell you can think of physics as follows  so you take a chunk of reality you want to understand
 and you translate it into mathematics you encode it into equations 
 then predictions can be made and tested 
 we 're actually really lucky that this works because no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads should actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe
 despite the success physics has its limits 
 as dirk helbing pointed out in the last quote we don 't really understand the complexity that relates to us that surrounds us 
 this paradox is what got me interested
 in complex systems  so these are systems which are made up of many interconnected or interacting parts  swarms of birds or fish
  ant colonies  ecosystems brains financial markets these are just a few examples  
 interestingly complex systems are very hard to
 map into mathematical equations  so the usual physics approach doesn 't really work
  what do we know about complex systems well  it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside
 is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction this means you can forget about the equations
 and just start to understand the system
 by looking at the interactions  so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions  and it gets even better because
 most complex systems have this amazing property called emergence  so this means that the system as a whole
 suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood
 or predicted by looking at the components of the system  so the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts  
 and all of this also means that you can forget about
 the individual parts of the system
  complex they are so if it 's a cell or a termite or a bird you just focus on the rules of interaction 
 as a result networks are ideal representations of complex systems 
 the nodes in the network
 are the system 's components and the links are given by the
  interactions  
 so what equations are for physics complex networks are for the study of complex systems  
 this approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems
 in physics biology  computer science the social sciences  but what about
  where are economic networks  this is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature  
 the study we published last year called 
 the network of global corporate control was the first extensive analysis of economic networks  
 the study went viral on the internet
 and it attracted a lot of attention from
  why did no one look at this before similar data has been around for quite some time what we looked at in detail was ownership networks  so
 here the nodes are companies people governments  foundations  etc  
 and the links represent the shareholding relations so shareholder a has x percent of the shares in
  company b and we also assign a value to the company given by the operating revenue  
 so ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations 
 in this little example you can see a few financial institutions
 with some of the many links highlighted  
  you may think that no one looked at this before because ownership networks are really really boring to study  well  
 as ownership is related to control as i shall explain later  looking at ownership networks actually can give you answers to questions like 
 who are the key players how are they organized are they isolated are they interconnected and what is the overall distribution of control 
 in other words
  who controls the world i think this is an interesting question  and it has implications for systemic risk  
 this is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall 
 a high degree of interconnectivity can be bad for stability  because then the stress can spread through the system
 like an epidemic
  scientists have sometimes criticized economists who believe ideas and concepts are more important than empirical data  
 because a foundational guideline in science is 
 let the data speak  ok  let 's do that 
 so we started with a database containing thirteen million ownership relations from two thousand and seven 
 this is a lot of data  and because we wanted to find out
  who rules the world 
 we decided to focus on transnational corporations 
 or tncs for short these are companies that operate in more than one country  and we found forty three thousand 
 in the next step we built the network around these companies so we took all the tncs ' shareholders  and the
  all the way upstream  and we did the same downstream and ended up with a network containing
 six hundred thousand nodes
 and one million links this is the tnc network which we analyzed  and it turns out to be structured as follows  so you have a periphery
 and a center which contains about  seventy five percent of all the players and
 in the center there 's this tiny but dominant core
 which is made up of highly interconnected
 companies 
 to give you a better picture 
 think about a metropolitan area so you have the suburbs and the periphery you have a center like a financial district 
 then the core will be something like the tallest high rise building in the center  
 and we already see signs of organization going on here
  percent of the tncs
 are in the core only but they make up ninety five percent
 of the total operating revenue of all tncs  
 ok so now we analyzed the structure  so how does this relate to the control  
 well 
 ownership gives voting rights to shareholders  this is the normal notion of control and there are different models which allow you to compute
 the control you get from ownership 
 if you have more than fifty percent of the shares in a company you get control  but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares 
 and the network really matters 
 about ten years ago mr tronchetti provera had ownership and control in a small company 
 which had ownership and control in a bigger company
  get the idea this ended up giving him control in telecom italia with a leverage of 
 so this means that with each euro he invested he was able to move twenty six euros
 of market value through the chain of ownership relations  now what we actually computed
 in our study was the control over the tncs
  this allowed us to assign a degree of influence to each shareholder  
 this is very much in the sense of max weber 's idea of potential power 
 which is the probability of imposing one 's own will despite the opposition of others 
 if you want to compute the flow in an ownership network this is what you have to
  do it 's actually not that hard to understand let me explain
 by giving you this analogy so think about water flowing in pipes  where the pipes have different thickness  
 so similarly the control is flowing in the ownership networks
 and is accumulating at the nodes  
 so what did we find after computing all this network control
  well it turns out that the seven hundred and thirty seven top shareholders
 have the potential to collectively control eighty percent of the tncs ' value 
 now remember we started out with six hundred thousand nodes so
 these seven hundred and thirty seven top players make up a bit more than zero point one percent they 're mostly mostly financial institutions
 in the us and the uk  and it gets even more extreme there are one hundred and forty six top players in the core 
 and they together have the potential to collectively control forty percent
 of the tncs ' value 
 what should you take home from all of this well  the high degree of control
  you saw is very extreme by any standard  
 the high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core
 could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy  
 and we could easily reproduce the tnc network with a few simple rules this means that its structure is probably the result of
 it 's an emergent property
 which depends on the rules of interaction in the system  
 so it 's probably not the result of a top down approach like a global conspiracy 
 our study is an impression of the moon 's surface  it 's not a street map so you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt  yet
 it gave us a tantalizing glimpse
 of a brave new world of finance we hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction  so
 the remaining unknown terrain will be charted in the future  and this is slowly starting we 're seeing the emergence of
  point of view  but this journey has only just begun  so we will have to wait before we see the first results  
 now there is still a big problem in my opinion 
 ideas relating to finance economics  politics society are very often tainted
 by people 's personal ideologies
  i really hope that this complexity perspective allows for some common common ground to be found 
 it would be really great if it has the power to help end the gridlock
 created by conflicting ideas which appears to be paralyzing our globalized
  so complex we need to move away from dogma  but this is just my own personal ideology  thank you
