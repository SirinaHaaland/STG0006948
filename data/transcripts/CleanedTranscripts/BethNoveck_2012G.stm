  so when the white house was built in the early  19th century it was an open house  neighbors came and went  under president adams a local dentist happened by he wanted to shake the president 's hand 
 the president dismissed the secretary of state whom he was conferring with and asked the dentist if he would remove a
  tooth  later 
 under president pierce he was known to have remarked
  a neighbor passed by and said i 'd love to see the beautiful house and pierce said to him why my dear sir of course you may come in this isn 't my house it is the people 's house 
 well when i got to the white house in the beginning of two thousand and nine at the start of the obama administration the white house
  house was anything but open 
 bomb blast curtains covered my windows we were running windows two thousand 
 social media were blocked at the firewall we didn 't have a blog let alone a dozen twitter accounts like we have today  
 i came in to become the head of open government  to take the values and the practices of transparency participation and collaboration and instill them into the way that we work to open up
  government to work with people 
 now one of the things that we know is that companies are very good at getting people to work together in teams and in networks to make very complex products like cars and computers 
 and the more complex the products are a society creates the more successful the society is over time  
 companies make goods  but governments they make public goods  they work
  on the cure for cancer and educating our children and making roads  but we don 't have institutions that are particularly good at this kind of complexity  we don 't have institutions that are good at bringing our talents to bear 
 at working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way 
 so when we wanted to create our open government policy what did we do we wanted naturally to ask public sector employees how we should open up government
 turns out that had never been done before 
 we wanted to ask members of the public to help us come up with a policy not after the fact  commenting on a rule after it 's written the way is typically the case  
 but in advance  
 there was no legal precedent no cultural precedent  no technical way of doing this in fact many people told us it was illegal 
 here 's the crux of the obstacle
  governments exist to channel the flow of two things  really values and expertise
 to and from government and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions  
 but the way that our institutions are designed in our rather 18th century centralized model is to channel the flow of values through voting  
 once every four
  once every two years at best once a year 
 this is a rather anemic and thin way in this era of social media for us to actually express our values today we have technology that lets us express ourselves a great deal perhaps a little too much 
 then in the  19th century we layer on the concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state to help us govern complex and large societies  
 but we 've centralized these
  we 've entrenched them  and we know that the smartest person always works for someone else we need to only look around this room to know that expertise and intelligence is widely 
  distributed in society and not limited simply to our institutions  
  and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels the flow of electricity 
 and a leaf is designed to channel the flow of nutrients to the tree  sometimes even having to route around an obstacle  but to get that nutrition flowing  
 the same can be said for our social systems for our systems of government where at the very least 
 flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding what the problem is what 's really broken
  the urgent need that we have that we all feel today  to redesign the flow of our institutions  
 we live in a cambrian era of big data of social networks and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions that are actually quite recent 
 think about it what other business do you know what other sector of the economy and especially one as big as the
  sector 
 that doesn 't seek to reinvent its business model on a regular basis  
 sure we invest plenty in innovation  we invest in broadband and science education and science grants  but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning the institutions that we have  
 now it 's very easy to
  of course about partisan politics and entrenched bureaucracy and we love to complain about government it 's a perennial pastime especially around election time  
 but the world is complex we soon will have ten billion people many of whom will lack basic resources 
 so complain as we might what actually can replace what we have today  what comes the day after the arab spring
  attractive alternative that obviously presents itself to us is that of networks right networks like facebook and twitter they 're lean they 're mean you 've got three thousand employees at facebook 
 governing nine hundred million inhabitants we might even call them citizens because they 've recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion 
  corporate privatizing communities are not bottom up democracies  they cannot replace government  
 friending someone on facebook is not complex enough to do the hard work of you and i collaborating with each other and doing the hard work of governance  
 but social media do teach us something  
 why is twitter so successful
  because it opens up its platform it opens up the api to allow hundreds of thousands of new applications to be built on top of it 
 so that we can read and process information in new and exciting ways  
 we need to think about how to open up the api of government 
 and the way that we 're going to do that the next great superpower is going to be the one who can successfully combine
 the hierarchy of institution because we have to
  maintain those public values we have to coordinate the flow
 but with the diversity and the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement of networks all of us working together to build these new innovations on top of our institutions to engage in the practice of governance  
 we have a precedent for this good old henry
  palpable model for handing power from government to citizens 
 today we have the opportunity  and we have the imperative to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions 
  thousands of new kinds of juries the citizen jury the carrotmob  the hackathon
  just beginning to invent the models by which we can cocreate the process of governance now
 we don 't fully have a picture of what this will look like yet  but we 're seeing pockets of evolution emerging all around us maybe not even evolution i 'd even start to call it a revolution
 in the way that we govern  some of it 's very high tech and some of it is extremely low tech such as the project that mkss is running in
  where they take the spending data of the state and paint it on one hundred thousand village walls  and then invite the villagers to come and comment who is on the government payroll who 's actually 
  died what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere and to work together through civic engagement to save real money and participate and have access to that budget  
  getting you and me to raise the money to build the goalposts and the park benches
 that will actually allow us to deliver better services in our communities  
 no one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in delivering services sometimes where none exist than ushahidi  
 created after the post election riots in kenya in two thousand and eight
  able to crowdsource and target the delivery of better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble whether it 's after the earthquakes in haiti or more recently in italy 
 and the red cross too is training volunteers and twitter is certifying them not simply to supplement existing government institutions  but in many cases to replace
  what we 're seeing lots of examples of obviously is the opening up of government data not enough examples of this yet  but we 're starting to see this practice
 of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data 
 there 's so many examples i could have picked and i selected this one of jon bon jovi  some of you may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen in new jersey where he caters to and serves the homeless and particularly homeless veterans 
 in february he approached the white house
  and said i would like to fund a prize to create scalable national applications apps that will help not only the homeless but those who deliver services [ to ] them to do so better 
 february two thousand and twelve to june of two thousand and twelve
  the finalists are announced in the competition can you imagine in the bureaucratic world of
  anything done in a four month period of time you can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time  let alone generate real palpable innovations that improve people 's lives  
 and i want to be clear to mention that this open government revolution is not about privatizing government  
 because in many cases what it can do when we have the will to do so is to deliver more progressive and better policy than the regulations and the legislative and
 by which we make policy today 
 in the state of texas they regulate five hundred and fifteen professions from 
  well driller to florist now you can carry a gun into a church in dallas  but do not make a flower arrangement without a license  because that will land you in jail  
 so what is texas doing 
  they 're asking you and me using online policy wikis to help not simply get rid of burdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship 
 but to replace those regulations with more innovative alternatives  sometimes using transparency in the creation of new iphone apps
 that will allows us both to protect consumers and the public and to encourage economic development 
 that is a nice sideline of open government it 's not only the benefits that we 've talked about with regard to development
 it 's the economic benefits and the job creation that 's coming from this open innovation work 
 sberbank  the largest and oldest bank in russia largely owned by the russian government has started practicing crowdsourcing  engaging its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations 
 last year they saved a
  thirty billion rubles from open innovation and they 're pushing radically the extension of crowdsourcing not only from banking but into the public sector  
 and we see lots of examples of these innovators using open government data not simply to make apps but then to make companies and to hire people to build them working with the government 
 so a lot of these innovations are local in san ramon california they published an iphone app
 in which they allow you or me to say we are certified
 cpr trained and then when someone has a heart attack a notification goes out so that you can rush over to the person over here and deliver cpr 
 the victim who receives bystander cpr is more than twice as likely to survive there is a hero in all of us is their slogan  
 but it 's not limited to the local  
 british columbia
  is publishing a catalogue of all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage with the state
 in the cocreation of governance  
 let me be very clear 
 and perhaps controversial that open government is not about transparent government  
 simply throwing data over the transom doesn 't change how government works it doesn 't get anybody to do anything with that data to change lives  to solve problems and it doesn 't change government
  what it does is it creates an adversarial relationship between civil society and government over the control and ownership of information 
 and transparency by itself is not reducing the flow of money into politics and arguably it 's not even producing accountability as well as it might
 if we took the next step of combining participation and collaboration with transparency to transform how we work we 're going to see this evolution really in
  two phases i think  the first phase of the open government revolution is delivering better information from the crowd into the center 
 starting in two thousand and five and this is how this open government work in the u s really got started 
 i was teaching a patent law class to my students and explaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy has the power to make a decision about which patent application
  becomes the next patent and therefore monopolizes for twenty years the rights over an entire field of inventive activity 
 well what did we do we said we can make a website we can make an expert network a social network that would connect the network to the institution to allow scientists and technologists to get 
  better information to the patent office to aid in making those decisions  we piloted the work in the
  japan and australia and now i 'm pleased to report that the united states patent office will be rolling out universal complete and total openness  so 
  that all patent applications will now be open for citizen participation beginning this year  
  first phase is in getting better information in the second phase is in getting decision making power out 
 participatory budgeting has long been practiced in porto alegre brazil they 're just starting it in the  49th ward in chicago russia is using wikis to get citizens writing
  law together as is lithuania when we start to see power over the core functions of government
  then we 're well on our way to an open government revolution 
 there are many things that we can do to get us there 
 obviously opening up the data is one  
 but the important thing is to create lots more create and curate lots more participatory opportunities  hackathons and mashathons and working with data to build apps is an intelligible
 way for people to engage and participate like the jury is but we 're going to need lots more things like it 
 and that 's why we need to start with our youngest people we 've heard talk here at ted about people biohacking and hacking their plants with arduino  and
 mozilla is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos 
 when we start by teaching young people that we live not in a passive society a
  but in a writable society  where we have the power to change our communities to change our institutions that 's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway towards this open government
 innovation towards this open government movement towards this open government revolution
  that we 've talked about
