  if you are a blind child in india you will very likely have to contend with
 at least two big pieces of bad news the first bad news
 is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none
  and that 's because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country
 are focused on adults and there are very very few hospitals that are actually equipped
 to treat children 
 in fact  if you were to be treated  
 you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials
 as this case from
  rajasthan illustrates 
 this is a three year old orphan girl who had cataracts  so her caretakers took her to the village medicine man  
 and instead of suggesting to the caretakers
 that the girl be taken to a hospital  the person decided to burn her abdomen with red hot iron bars
 to drive out the demons  the second piece of bad news
  will be delivered to you
 by neuroscientists who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age
 that even if you have your eye corrected the chances of your brain
 learning how to see are very very slim
 again slim or none  so when
 i heard these two things  it troubled me deeply  
 both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons 
 so let me first start with the with the personal reason it 'll sound corny  but it 's sincere 
 that 's my son darius as a new father 
 i have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are 
 what our obligations are towards them
 and how much love we can feel
 a child i would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment
 for darius  
 and for me to be told that there might be other  dariuses who are not getting treatment that 's just viscerally wrong  
 so that 's the personal reason scientific reason
 is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods that if the brain is
  older than four or five years of age  it loses its ability to learn that doesn 't sit well with me because i don 't think
 that idea has been tested adequately  
 the birth of the idea is from david hubel and torsten wiesel 's work two researchers who were at harvard and they got the nobel prize in
  their studies of visual physiology which are remarkably beautiful studies  but i believe some of their work has been extrapolated
 into the human domain prematurely so they did their work with kittens with different kinds of deprivation regiments 
 and those studies which date back to the ' 60s 
 are now being applied to human children 
 so i felt
 that i needed to do two things
  to children who are currently being deprived of treatment that 's the humanitarian mission and the scientific mission would be
 to test the limits of visual plasticity 
 and these two missions 
 as you can tell thread together perfectly one adds to the other in fact one would be impossible without the other  
  to implement
 these twin missions 
 a few years ago i launched project prakash prakash as many of you know is the sanskrit word for light 
 and the idea is that in bringing light into into the lives of children 
 we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience 
 and the logo
 even though it looks extremely irish  it 's actually derived from the indian
 symbol of diya an earthen lamp  
 the prakash  
 the overall effort has three components outreach to identify children in need of care 
 medical treatment  and in subsequent study and i want to show you a short video clip
 that illustrates the first two components
  because this is a school for the blind many children have permanent conditions that 's a case of microphthalmos
  which is malformed eyes  and that 's a permanent condition it
 cannot be treated that 's an extreme of
  micropthalmos called enophthalmos  but every so often we come across children who show some residual vision 
 and that is a very good sign
 that the condition might actually be treatable  so after that screening we bring the children to the hospital  that 's the hospital we 're working with in delhi  the schroff charity eye hospital
  it has a very well equipped pediatric ophthalmic center 
 which was made possible in part by a gift from the ronald mcdonald charity  so  eating burgers actually helps
 in to the eyes of this child you will see the cause of his blindness  
 the whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are congenital cataracts  
 so opacities of the lens in our eyes  the lens is clear  but in this child the lens has become opaque and therefore he can 't see the
  the child is given treatment you 'll see shots of the eye here 's the eye with the opaque lens the opaque lens extracted
 and an acrylic lens inserted and here 's the same child
 three weeks post operation with the right eye open
  even from that little clip you can begin to get the sense that recovery is possible  and we have now
 provided treatment to over two hundred children  and the story repeats itself  after treatment  
 the child gains significant functionality 
 in fact  the story holds true
  even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation we did a paper a few years ago about
 this woman that you see on the right srd and she got her sight late in life  
 and her vision is remarkable at this age  i should add a tragic postscript postscript to this
 she died
 two years ago in in a bus accident  so  hers is just a truly inspiring story unknown but inspiring story
  when we started finding these results as you might imagine it created quite a bit of stir
 in the scientific and the popular press  
 here 's an article in nature that profiled this work and another one in time 
 so we were fairly convinced we are convinced that recovery is feasible  despite extended visual deprivation 
 the next obvious question to ask 
 what is the process of
  recovery 
 so the way we study that is 
 let 's say we find a child who has light sensitivity  the child is provided treatment and i want to stress that the treatment is completely unconditional there is no quid pro quo
  we treat many more children then we actually work with every child who needs treatment is treated 
 after treatment about every week we run the child on a battery of simple
  visual tests
 in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line  
 and we try to do this for as long as possible this arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information
 about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up what might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones
  and we 've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies  but i want to highlight one particular one  
 and that is image parsing into objects  so any image of the kind that you see on the left be it a real image or a synthetic image 
 it 's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column regions of different colors different luminances 
 the brain
  has this complex task
 of putting together  integrating subsets of these regions into something that 's more meaningful into what we would consider to be objects as you see on the right  
 and nobody knows how this integration happens  and that 's the question we asked with project prakash  so  here
  what happens very soon after the onset of sight here
 's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago  
 and you see ethan myers a graduate student from mit  running the experiment with him
  his visual motor coordination is quite poor  but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he 's trying to trace out
 if you show him real world images if you show others like
  him real world images 
 they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over fragmented it 's made up of a collage a patchwork of regions of different colors and luminances  
 and that 's what 's indicated in the green outlines  when you ask them 
 even if you can 't name the objects just point to where the objects are these are the regions that they point to so the world is is this complex patchwork of regions even the shadow on the ball
 becomes its own object
  interestingly enough you give them a few months
  a very dramatic transformation has has come about and the question is what underlies this transformation  it 's a profound question 
 and what 's even more amazing is how simple the answer is the answer lies in motion
 and
 that 's what i want to show you in the next clip
  and we see this pattern over and over again  the one thing
 the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information 
 so the inference we are deriving from this and several such experiments is that dynamic
  information processing or motion processing  serves as the bedrock
 for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing it leads to
 visual integration and eventually to recognition this simple idea has far reaching implications  and let me just quickly mention two 
  drawing from the domain of engineering  
 and one from the clinic so from the perspective of engineering  we can ask  goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system 
 can we use this as a recipe
 for constructing machine based vision systems that can learn on their own that don 't need to be programmed by a human programmer  
 and that 's what we 're trying to do i 'm at mit at mit you need to apply
 whatever basic knowledge you gain so we are
  creating dylan  which is a computational system
 with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive 
 and autonomously discovering  what are the objects in this visual input  
 so  don 't worry about the internals of dylan here i 'm just going to talk about how we test dylan  the way we test dylan is by giving it
 inputs as i said of the same kind
 that a baby or a child in project prakash would get 
 but for for a long time we couldn 't quite figure out wow can we get these kinds of video inputs 
 so i thought  
 could we have darius serve as our babycam carrier  and that way get the inputs that we feed into dylan 
 so that 's what we
  did 
 i had to have long conversations with my wife
 in fact pam if you 're watching this please forgive me  
  we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby 's visual acuity as some of you might know  babyies are born
 pretty much legally blind their acuity our acuity is twenty twenty  babies ' acuity is like twenty  eight hundred so they are
 looking at the world in a very very blurry fashion here 's what a baby cam
  to go with this 
 what 's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input  the baby very
  able to discover meaning in such input  
 but then two or three days afterward  
 babies begin to pay attention to their mother 's or their father 's face how does that happen we want dylan to be able to do that and using this mantra of motion 
 dylan actually can do that  so  given that kind of video input 
 with just about six or seven minutes worth of video dylan can begin to extract
 patterns that include faces
  so  it 's an important demonstration of the power of motion 
 the clinical implication  it comes from the domain of autism visual integration has been associated with autism by several researchers when we saw that we asked  could the impairment in visual integration
 be the manifestation of something underneath of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism because if that hypothesis were to be true
  it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what 's causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype what you 're going to see
 are video clips of two children one neurotypical one with autism playing pong  
 so while the child is playing pong we are tracking where they 're looking in red are the eye
  movement traces this is the neurotypical child and what you see
 is that the child is able to make cues of the dynamic information to predict where the ball is going to go even before the ball gets to a place  
 the child is already looking there 
 contrast this
 with a child with autism playing the same game instead of anticipating the child always follows where the ball has been 
 the efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be
  compromised in autism  so we are pursuing this
 line of of work and hopefully we 'll have more results to report soon
 looking ahead if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we 've treated so far 
 this is the magnitude of the problem the red dots
 are the children we have not treated so there are many many more children who need to be treated  and in
  order to to expand the scope of the project we are planning on launching
 the prakash center for children which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital a school for the children we are treating
 and also a cutting edge research facility  
 the prakash center will integrate health care  education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts 
 so to summarize prakash in its
  years of existence  it 's had an impact in multiple areas  
 ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism  
 the development of autonomous machine vision systems education of the undergraduate and graduate students and most importantly
 in the alleviation of childhood blindness  and for my students and i it 's been just a phenomenal
 experience because we have gotten to do interesting research  while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with thank you very much
