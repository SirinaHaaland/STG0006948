  i guess the story
 actually has to start maybe back in the the 1960s when i was
 seven or eight years old  watching jacques cousteau documentaries on the living room floor with my mask and flippers on  
 then after every episode i had to go up to the bathtub and swim around
  bathtub and look at the drain because that 's all there was to look at and
 by the time i turned sixteen i pursued a career in marine science in
 exploration and diving and lived in underwater habitats like this one off the florida keys for thirty days total  brian skerry took this shot thanks brian 
 and i 've dived
  around the world and this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world  operated by the japanese government 
 and sylvia earle and i were on an expedition in this submarine twenty years ago in japan and on my dive i went down eighteen thousand feet 
 to an area that i thought would be
 pristine wilderness area on the sea floor  but when i got there i found lots of plastic garbage and
  and it was really a turning point in my life where i started to realize that i couldn 't just go have fun doing science and exploration  i needed to put it into a context i needed to head towards conservation goals  
 so i began to work with
 national geographic society and others and led expeditions
 to antarctica i led three diving expeditions to antarctica  ten years ago was a seminal trip  where we explored that big iceberg b 15 the largest iceberg in history that broke off
  the ross ice shelf  
 and we developed techniques to dive inside and under the iceberg 
 such as heating pads on our kidneys with a battery that we dragged around so that 
 as the blood flowed through our kidneys it would get a little boost of warmth before going back into our bodies  
 but after three trips to antarctica i decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water  and that same year ten years ago i headed north to
  the phoenix islands and i 'm going to tell you that story here
 in a moment but before i do i just want you to ponder this graph for a moment 
 you may have seen this in other forms but the top line is the amount of protected area on land  globally  
 and it 's about twelve percent and you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the 
  kind of a nice trajectory right now and that 's probably because that 's when everybody got aware of the environment and
 earth day and and all the stuff that happened in the ' 60s with the hippies and everything really did i think have an affect on global awareness  
 but the ocean protected area is basically flat line
 until right about now it appears to be ticking up and i do believe that we are at the hockey stick point
 of the protected area in the ocean i think we would have gotten there a lot earlier if we could see what happens in the ocean like
  we can see what happens on land  but unfortunately the ocean is opaque  and we can 't see what 's going on and therefore we 're way behind
 on protection but scuba diving submersibles and all the work that we 're setting about to do here
 will help rectify that so where are the phoenix islands  they were the world
  area up until last week
 when the chagos archipelago was declared it 's in the mid pacific it 's about five days from anywhere if you want to get to the phoenix islands
  it 's five days from fiji it 's five days from hawaii it 's five days from samoa  it 's out in the middle of the pacific right around the equator 
 i had never heard of the islands ten years ago nor the country kiribati that owns them till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in fiji said greg would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands they 've never been
  dived and i said yeah  but tell me where they are and the country that owns them so
 that 's when i first learned of the islands and had no idea what i was getting into but i was in for the adventure let me
 give you a little peek here of the phoenix islands protected area 
 it 's a very  deep water part of our planet  the average depths are about twelve thousand ft there 's lots of seamounts in the phoenix islands which are specifically
  part of the protected area seamounts are
 important for biodiversity there 's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land it 's an interesting fact and the phoenix islands is very rich in those seamounts  
 so it 's a deep think about it in a big three dimensional space very deep three dimensional space with
 herds of tuna 
  all kinds of deep sea marine life like we 've seen here before that 's the vessel that
 we took up there for these studies early on  
 and that 's what the islands look like you can see in the background they 're very low to the water  and they 're all uninhabited except one island has about thirty five caretakers on it 
 and they 've been uninhabited
 for most of time because even in the ancient days these islands were too far away from the bright lights of fiji and hawaii and and tahiti for those ancient polynesian mariners that
  were traversing the pacific so widely 
 but we got up there and i had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity to get to a place that had never been dived and just get to an island and go okay where are we going to dive  
 let 's try there 
 and then falling into the water  both my personal and my professional life changed suddenly i saw a world
  that i had never seen before in the ocean
 schools of fish that were so dense they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface 
 coral reefs that were continuous and solid and colorful large fish everywhere  manta rays 
 it was an ecosystem parrotfish spawning this is about five thousand longnose parrotfish spawning at the entrance to one of the phoenix islands  
 you can see the fish are balled up and then there 's a little cloudy area there where they 're exchanging
 the eggs and sperm for
  reproduction
 events that the ocean is supposed to do  but struggles to do in many places now because of human activity 
 the phoenix islands and and all the equatorial parts of our planet are very important for tuna fisheries especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here 
 phoenix islands is a major tuna location and sharks we had
  one hundred and fifty sharks at once which is an indication of a very very healthy very strong system  so i
 thought the scenes of never ending wilderness would would go on forever but they did finally come to an end  and we
 explored the surface of the islands as well very important bird nesting site some of the most important bird nesting sites in the pacific in the world  and
 we finished our trip  and that 's the
 the area again you can see the islands there are eight islands that pop out of the water
 the peaks that don 't come out of the water are the seamounts remember a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface  
 and what 's the context of the phoenix islands  where do these exist well they exist in the republic of kiribati
  and kiribati is located in the central pacific
 in three island groups in the west we have the gilbert islands 
 in the center we have the phoenix islands which is the subject that i 'm talking about and then over to the east we have the line islands  it 's the largest atoll nation in the world  
 and they have
 about one hundred and ten thousand people
 spread out over thirty three islands  they control three point four million cubic
  that 's between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet  
 and when i was first going up there i barely knew the name of this country ten years ago and people would ask me
 why are you going to this place called kiribati and it reminded me of that old joke where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed and the reporter yells hey  willy why do you rob banks 
 and he says cause that 's where all the money is 
 and i would tell people why do
  because that 's where all the ocean is they basically are one nation that controls most of the equatorial waters of the central pacific ocean 
 they 're also a country
 that is in dire danger 
 sea levels are rising  and kiribati along with forty two other nations in the world will be under water within fifty to one hundred years due to climate change
 and the associated 
  rise from thermal expansion and the melting of freshwater into the ocean the islands rise only
 one to two meters above the surface  some of the islands have already gone under water  and these nations are faced with a real problem we as a world
 are faced with a problem what do we do with displaced fellow
 earthlings who no longer have a home on the planet  
 the president of the maldives conducted a mock cabinet meeting underwater recently
  highlight the dire straits of these countries so it 's something we need to focus on  
 but back to the phoenix islands which is the subject of this talk 
 after i got back i said okay  
 this is amazing what we found i 'd like to go back and share it with the government of kiribati who are over in tarawa the westernmost group  
  started contacting them because they had actually given me a permit to do this
 and i said i want to come up and tell you what we found and for some reason they didn 't want me to come or it was hard to find a time and a place and it took a while but finally they said okay you can come but
 if you come you have to buy lunch for everybody who comes to the seminar so i said okay i 'm happy to buy lunch just get whatever anybody wants so
 david obura a coral reef biologist and i went to tarawa  and we presented for two hours on the amazing findings of the phoenix islands and the country never
 never knew this they never had any data from this area they 'd never had any information from the phoenix islands  after the talk the minister of fisheries
 walked up to me and he said greg  do you realize that you are the first scientist who has ever
 come back and told us what they did he said we often issue these permits to do research in our waters but
 usually we get a note two or three years later  or a
  the first one who 's ever come back and told us what you did and we really appreciate that and we 're buying you lunch today  and are you free for dinner 
 and i was free for dinner  and i went out to dinner with the minister of fisheries in kiribati  and over the course of dinner i learned
 that kiribati gains most of its revenue it 's a very poor country
 but it gains what revenue is has by selling access to foreign nations to take fish out of its waters because kiribati
 does not have the capacity to take the fish itself and the deal that they strike
 is the extracting country gives kiribati five percent of the landed value 
 so if the united states removes a million dollars ' worth of
 lobsters from a reef kiribati gets fifty thousand dollars  and you know it didn 't seem like a very good deal to me  so i asked the minister over
  over dinner i said would you consider a situation where you would still get paid
 we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is but you leave fish and the  and the sharks and the
 shrimp in the water he stopped and he said yes we would like to do that
 to deal with our overfishing problem  and i think we would call it a reverse fishing license he coined the term reverse fishing license so i said
  license ' so we walked away from this dinner really not knowing where to go at that point i went back to the states and started looking around to see if i could find
 examples where
 reverse fishing licenses had been issued and it turned out there were none there were no oceanic
 deals where countries were compensated for not fishing it had occurred on land in rainforests of
  south america and africa where
 landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down and conservation international had struck some of those deals so i went to conservation international and brought them in as a partner
 and and went through the process of
 valuing the fishery resource deciding how much kiribati should be
  what the range of the fishes were brought in a whole bunch of other partners the government of australia the
 government of new zealand the world bank the oak foundation and national geographic have been big funders of this as well  
 and we basically founded the park on the idea of an endowment
 that would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees to this to this very poor country to keep the area intact  
 halfway through this process i met the president of kiribati  president anote tong he 's a really
 important leader a
 forward thinking man and he told me two things when i approached him he said greg  there 's two things i 'd like you to do 
 one is remember i 'm a politician so you 've got to go out and work with my ministers and convince the people of kiribati that this is a good idea 
 secondly i 'd like you to create principles that will transcend my own presidency  
 i don 't want to do something like this if it 's going to go away after i 'm voted out of office 
 so we had very strong leadership very good vision
  and a lot of science a lot of lawyers involved many many steps were taken
 to pull this off  
 and it was primarily because kiribati realized that this was in their own self interest to do this they realized that this was a common cause that they had found
 with the conservation community then
 in two thousand and two when this was all going full swing a  coral bleaching event happened in the phoenix
  islands  here 's this resource that we 're looking to save and
 it turns out it 's the hottest heating event that we can find on record the ocean heated up as it does sometimes and the hot spot
 formed and stalled right over the phoenix islands for six months it was over thirty two degrees celsius for six months
 and it basically killed sixty percent of the coral so
  suddenly we had this area that we were protecting but now it it appeared to be dead at least in the coral areas of course the deep sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine but the coral which everybody likes to look at was in trouble 
 well  the good news is
 it 's recovered
 and recovering fast faster than any reef we 've seen this picture was just taken by brian skerry a few months ago when we returned to the phoenix islands
 and discovered that because it is a protected area and has
  healthy fish populations that
 keep the algae grazed down and keep the rest of the reef healthy the coral is booming is just booming back
 it 's almost like if a person has multiple diseases  
 it 's hard to get well you might die but if you only have one disease to deal with you can get better  and that 's the story
  's the only threat the only influence that the reef had to deal with there was no fishing there was no pollution there was no coastal development 
 and the reef is on a full bore recovery 
 now i remember that dinner i had with the minister of fisheries ten years ago when we first brought this up and i got quite animated during the dinner and said well i think that the
 conservation community might embrace this idea minister he paused and put his hands together and said yes greg  but the devil will be in the details
  and it certainly was the last ten years have been detail after detail ranging from
 creating legislation to
 multiple research expeditions to communication plans 
 as i said  teams of lawyers  mous creating the phoenix islands trust board and we are now in the process
  of raising the full endowment kiribati has frozen
 extracting activities at its current state
 while we raise the endowment we just had our first pipa trust board meeting three weeks ago  so it 's a fully functional  up and running entity
 that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country and the pipa trust board holds that license and pays the country
 for this so it 's a very solid very well thought out very well grounded
  that was very important with this work from the bottom up to to secure this 
 so the conditions for success here are listed you can read them yourselves but i would say the most important one in my mind
 was working within the market forces of the situation  and that insured that we could move this forward and it would have
 both the self interest of kiribati
  as well as the self interest of the world and i 'll leave you with one final slide 
 that is how do we scale this up how do we realize sylvia 's dream where eventually do we take this here 's the pacific
 with
 large mpas and
 large conservation zones on it and as you can see we have a patchwork
 across this ocean i 've just described to you the one story behind that rectangular area in the middle the phoenix islands  but every other
 green patch on that has its own story and what we need to do now is look at the whole pacific ocean in its entirety
 and make a network of mpas across the pacific so that we have our world 's largest ocean protected and
