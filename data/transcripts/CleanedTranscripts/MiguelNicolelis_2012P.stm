  the kind of neuroscience that i do and my colleagues do
 is almost like the weatherman we are always chasing storms we want to see and measure storms brainstorms
  and we all talk about brainstorms in our daily lives  
 but we rarely see or listen to one so i always like to start these talks by actually introducing you to one of them actually the first time we recorded
 more than one neuron a hundred brain cells simultaneously we could measure the electrical sparks of a hundred cells in the same animal this
 is the first image we got the first ten seconds
 of this recording so we got a little snippet
 of a thought
  we could see it in front of us 
 i always tell the students that we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer  
 because we are dealing with a system that is only comparable in terms of number of cells
 to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe and here we are out of billions of neurons just recording ten years
  a hundred we are doing a thousand now and we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature 
 because if you don 't know yet  everything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these storms 
 comes from these storms that roll over the hills and valleys of our brains
 and define our memories  our beliefs our feelings our plans for the future  everything that we ever do  everything that
  every human has ever done do or will do requires
 the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms and the sound of a brainstorm if you 've never heard one 
 is somewhat like this you can put
 it louder if you can my son calls this making
  this is a brain this is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing  your brain will sound like this
 my brain  any brain and what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time is to actually listen to these symphonies
  brain symphonies and try to extract from them the messages they carry 
 in particular 
 about twelve years ago we created a preparation that we named brain machine interfaces and you have a scheme here that describes how it works 
 the idea is let 's have some sensors that listen to these storms this electrical firing  
 and see if you can in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal
  let 's see if we can read these signals  extract the motor messages that are embedded in it translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain
 in real time  
 and see if we can measure how well we can translate that message when we compare to the way the body does that and if we can actually
  provide feedback sensory signals that go back from this robotic mechanical computational actuator that is now under the control of the brain  
 back to the brain how the brain deals with that of receiving messages from
 an artificial piece of machinery  
 and that 's exactly what we did ten years ago we started with a superstar monkey called aurora that became one of the superstars of this field
 and aurora liked to play video games  as you can see here she likes to use a joystick like any one of us any of our kids to play this game and as a good primate 
 she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer so even before a target appears that she 's supposed to cross with the cursor that she 's controlling with this joystick aurora is trying to find the target no matter where it is
  and if she 's doing that because every time she crosses that target with the little cursor she gets a drop of brazilian orange juice  
 and i can tell you any monkey will do anything for you if you get a little drop of brazilian orange juice  
 actually any primate will do that think about that 
 well while aurora was playing this game as you saw and doing a thousand trials a day and getting
  three hundred and fifty milliliters of orange juice  we are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head and sending them to a robotic arm that was learning to reproduce the movements that aurora was 
  making because the idea was to actually turn on this brain machine interface and have aurora play the game just by thinking 
  would move the cursor and cross the target and to our shock that 's exactly what aurora did she played the game
 without moving her body  so every trajectory that you see of the cursor now this is the exact first moment she got that that 's the exact first moment
 a brain intention was liberated from
  of a body of a primate and could act outside 
 in that outside world 
 just by controlling an artificial device  
 and aurora kept playing the game  kept finding the little target and getting the orange juice that she wanted to get that she craved for 
 well she did that
 because she at that time had acquired a
  the robotic arm that you see moving here thirty days later  after the first video that i showed to you is under the control of aurora 's brain
 and is moving the cursor to get to the target and aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm but she has not lost
 the ability to use her biological arms to do what she pleases she can scratch her back she can scratch one of us  she
 can play another game by all purposes and means aurora 's brain has incorporated that artificial device as an extension of her body  
 the model of the self that aurora had in her mind has been expanded
 to get one more arm  well we did that ten years ago  just fast forward ten years just last year we realized that you don
  to have a robotic device you can just build a computational body an avatar a monkey avatar and you can actually use it for
 our monkeys to either interact with them or you can train them to assume in a virtual world the first person perspective of that avatar and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar 's arms or
  what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these avatars and explore objects that appear in the virtual world and these objects 
  are visually identical  but when the avatar crosses the surface of these objects 
  the avatar is touching  and in just four weeks the brain learns to process this new sensation
 and acquires a new sensory pathway
 like a new sense and you truly liberate the brain now because you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar
  the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain without the interference of the skin  
 so what you see here is this is the design of the task  you 're going to see an animal basically touching these three targets and he has to select one because only one carries
 the reward the orange juice that they want to get  and he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm an arm that doesn 't
  and that 's exactly what they do this is a complete liberation of the brain from the physical constraints of the body and the motor
 in a perceptual task the animal is controlling the avatar
 to touch the targets 
 and he 's sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain and the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward
  the legends that you see in the movie don 't appear for the monkey and by the way
  so
 they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position and yet they can find them
 by tactile discrimination and they can press it and select it 
 so when we look at the brains of these animals on the top panel you see the alignment of one hundred and twenty five cells showing what happens with the brain activity the electrical storms of this sample of neurons in
  the brain when the animal is using a joystick  and that 's a picture that every neurophysiologist knows the basic alignment shows that these
 cells are coding for all possible directions  the bottom picture
 is what happens when the body stops moving and the animal starts controlling either a robotic device or a computational avatar 
 as fast as we can reset our
  computers the brain activity shifts to start representing
 this new tool as if this too was a part of that primate 's body 
 the brain is assimilating that too as fast as we can measure  
 so that suggests to us that our sense of self does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies but it ends at the
  last layer of electrons of the tools that we 're commanding with our brains our violins our cars our bicycles our soccer balls our clothing they all become assimilated by this voracious 
 amazing dynamic system called the brain  
 how far can we take it 
 well in an experiment that we ran a few years ago we took this to the limit we had an animal running on a treadmill at
  duke university on the east coast of the united states producing the brainstorms necessary to move 
 and we had a robotic device a humanoid robot in kyoto japan at atr laboratories
 that was dreaming its entire life to be controlled by a brain 
 a human brain  or a primate brain what happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the
  monkey was transmitted to japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to duke  so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her 
 so she could be rewarded not by what her body was doing but for every correct step of the robot on the other side of the planet controlled by her brain activity
  funny thing that round trip around the globe
 took twenty milliseconds less than it takes for that brainstorm to leave its head the head of the monkey and reach its own muscle 
 the monkey was moving a robot that was six times bigger  across the planet
  this is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously this is cb1 fulfilling its dream
 in japan
 under the control of the brain activity of a primate  so where are we taking all this what are we going to do with all this research  besides studying
 the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears  well the idea is to take all this knowledge
  and technology and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world  millions of people have lost the ability to translate these 
  brainstorms into action into movement although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements they cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord 
  create a bypass is to use these brain machine interfaces to read these signals larger scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again 
 bypass the lesion using computational microengineering
 and send it to a new body a whole body
 called an exoskeleton 
  a whole robotic suit that will become the new body of these patients  and you can see an image
 produced by this consortium this is a nonprofit consortium called the walk again project that is putting together scientists from europe from here in the united 
  states and in brazil together to work to actually get this new body built
 same plastic mechanisms that allow aurora and other monkeys to use these tools
 through a  brain machine interface and that allows us to incorporate the tools that we produce and use in our daily life 
 this same mechanism  we hope will allow these patients not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make
 and translate them into movements of this new body but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls
 so i was told about ten years ago that this would never happen that this was close to impossible  
 and i can only tell you that as a scientist i grew up in southern brazil in the mid ' 60s watching a few crazy guys telling [ us ] that they would go to the moon  
 and i was five years old and i never understood why nasa didn 't hire captain kirk and spock to do the job
 after all they were very proficient
 but just seeing that as a kid made me believe  as my grandmother used to tell me that impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true 
 so they told me that it 's impossible to make someone walk i think i 'm going to follow my grandmother 's advice  thank you
