  i feel so fortunate that my first job was working at the museum of modern art on a retrospective of painter elizabeth murray 
 i learned so much from her after the curator robert storr selected all the paintings from her lifetime body of work
 i loved looking at the paintings from the
 there were some motifs and
 elements that would come up again later in her life  
 i remember asking her what she thought of those early works if you didn 't know they were hers you might not have been able to guess 
 she told me that a few didn 't quite meet her own mark for what she wanted them to be one of the
  works in fact so didn 't meet her mark she had set it out in the trash in her studio  and her neighbor had taken it because she saw its value 
 in that moment my view of success and creativity changed  
 i realized that success is a moment  but what we 're always celebrating
  but this is the thing what gets us to convert success into mastery 
 this is a question i 've long asked myself i think it comes when we start to value the gift
 of a near win i started to understand this when i went on one cold may day to watch a set of varsity
  all women as fate would have it at the northern tip of manhattan at columbia 's baker athletics complex  
 i wanted to see what 's called archer 's paradox 
 the idea that in order to actually hit your target  you have to aim at something slightly skew from it 
 i stood and watched as the coach drove up these women in this gray van and they
  this kind of relaxed focus one held a half eaten ice cream cone in one hand and arrows in the left with yellow fletching and
 they passed me and smiled but they sized me up as they made their way to the turf and spoke to each other not with words but with numbers  degrees i thought positions for how they might plan to hit their target  
 i stood behind one archer as her coach stood in between us to maybe assess who might need support and
 watched her and i didn
  understand how even one was going to hit the ten ring 
 the ten ring from the standard  75 yard distance it looks as small as a matchstick tip held out at arm 's length  
 and this is while holding fifty pounds of draw weight on each shot 
 she first hit a seven i remember and then a nine
  the next arrow didn 't even hit the target  
 and i saw that gave her more tenacity and she went after it again and again for three hours this went on 
 at the end of the practice one of the archers was so taxed that she lied out on the ground just
 her head looking up at the sky  trying to find what t s eliot might call that still point of the turning world  
 it 's so rare in american culture
  there 's so little that 's vocational about it anymore to look at what doggedness looks like with this level of exactitude 
 what it means to align your body posture for three hours in order to hit a target  
 pursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity  
 but i stayed because i realized i was witnessing what 's so rare to glimpse that difference between success and mastery
 so success is hitting that ten ring  but mastery is knowing that it means nothing if you can 't do it again and again 
 mastery is not just the same as excellence though  
 it 's not the same as success which i see as an event a moment in time  and a label that the world confers upon you 
 mastery is not a commitment to a goal
  but to a constant pursuit 
 what gets us to do this what get us to forward thrust more is to value the near win 
 how many times have we designated something a classic a masterpiece even while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished  
 riddled with difficulties and flaws in other words a near win
  elizabeth murray surprised me with her admission about her earlier paintings 
 painter paul czanne so often thought his works were incomplete that he would deliberately leave them aside with the intention of picking them back up again  
 but at the end of his life the result was that he had only signed ten percent of his paintings 
  by honor de balzac and he felt the protagonist was the painter himself 
 franz kafka saw incompletion when others would find only works to praise 
 so much so that he wanted all of his diaries manuscripts letters and even sketches burned upon his death 
 his friend refused to honor the request  and because of that
  grant that i desire more than i can accomplish michelangelo implored as if to that old testament god on the sistine chapel and he himself was that adam with his finger outstretched and not
  quite touching that god 's hand 
 mastery is in the reaching not the arriving  
 it 's in constantly wanting to close that gap between where you are and where you want to be  
 mastery is about sacrificing for your craft
 and not for the sake of crafting your career how many
  inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon 
 we see it even in the life of the indomitable arctic explorer ben saunders who tells me that his triumphs are not merely the result of a grand achievement  
 but of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins  
 we thrive when
 stay at our own leading edge  
 it 's a wisdom understood by duke ellington who said that his favorite song out of his repertoire was always the next one 
 always the one he had yet to compose  
 part of the reason that the near win is inbuilt to mastery is because the greater our proficiency the more clearly we might see that we don 't know all that we thought
  the paris review got it out of james baldwin when they asked him what do you think increases with knowledge and he said 
 you learn how little you know 
 success motivates us but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest 
 one of the most vivid examples of this comes when we look at the difference between olympic silver medalists and bronze medalists after a competition
  gilovich and his team from cornell studied this difference and found that the frustration silver medalists feel
 compared to bronze who are typically a bit more happy to have just not received fourth place and not medaled at all 
 gives silver medalists a focus on  follow up competition  
 we see it even in the gambling industry that once picked up on this phenomenon of the near win
 and created these
 that had a higher than average rate of near wins
 and so compelled people to buy more tickets that they were called  heart stoppers and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses in britain in the 
 the reason the near win has a propulsion is because it changes our view of the landscape
 and puts our goals which we tend to put at a distance  into more proximate
  to where we stand 
 if i ask you to envision what a great day looks like next week you might describe it in more general terms  
 but if i ask you to describe a great day at ted tomorrow you might describe it with granular practical clarity  
 and this is what a near win does it gets us to focus on what right now we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights
  it 's jackie  joyner kersee who in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four missed taking the gold in the heptathlon by one third of a second  
 and her husband predicted that would give her the tenacity she needed in follow up competition  
 in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight she won the gold in the heptathlon and set a record of seven  thousand two hundred and ninety one points 
 a score that no athlete has come very close to since
  we thrive not when we 've done it all but when we still have more to do 
 i stand here thinking and wondering about all the different ways that we might even manufacture a near win in this room how your lives might play this out because i think on some gut level we we do know this
  we know that we thrive when we stay at our own leading edge and it 's why the deliberate incomplete is inbuilt into creation myths 
 in navajo culture some craftsmen and women would deliberately put an imperfection in textiles and ceramics it
 's what 's called a spirit line a deliberate flaw in the pattern to give the weaver or maker a way out  
 but also a reason to continue making work  
 masters are not experts
  because they take a subject to its conceptual end they 're masters because they realize that there isn 't one 
 now it occurred to me as i thought about this why the archery coach told me at the end of that practice out of earshot of his archers 
 that he and his colleagues never feel they can do enough
 for their team never feel there are enough visualization techniques and posture drills
 to help them overcome those constant near wins  
 it didn 't sound like a complaint exactly  
 but just a way to let me know a kind of tender admission to remind me that he knew he was giving himself over to a voracious unfinished path that always required more 
 we build out of the unfinished idea even if that idea is our
  former self 
 this is the dynamic of mastery  
 coming close to what you thought you wanted can help you attain more than you ever dreamed you could  
 it 's what i have to imagine elizabeth murray was thinking when i saw her smiling at those early paintings one day in the galleries 
 even if we created utopias
  believe we would still have the incomplete  
 completion is a goal but we hope it is never the end  thank you
