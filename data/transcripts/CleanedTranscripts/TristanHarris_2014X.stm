  what does it mean to spend our time well  
 i spend a lot of my time thinking about how to spend my
  probably too much i probably obsess over it my friends think i do but i feel like i kind of have to 
 because these days it feels like little bits of my time kind of slip away from me 
 and when that happens it feels like parts of my life
 are slipping away 
 specifically it feels like little bits of my time get slipped away to various things like this like technology i check things i
 'll give you an example
  if this email shows up how many of you have gotten an email like this right  i 've been tagged in a photo  
 when this appears  i can 't help but click on it right now right  because like what if it 's a bad photo  so i have to click it right now  
 but
 i 'm not just going to
  i 'm actually going to do is spend the next twenty minutes but
 the worst part is that i know this is what 's going to happen and even knowing that that 's what 's going to happen
 doesn 't stop me from doing it again the next time
  or i find myself in a situation like this  
 where i check my email and i pull down to refresh  but the thing is that
 pull down to refresh again
 why am i doing this  this doesn 't make any sense  but
 i 'll give you a hint why this is happening 
 what do you think makes more money in the united states
  game parks and baseball combined 
 slot machines 
 how can slot machines make all this money
 when we play with such small amounts of money we play with coins how is this possible 
  the thing is my phone
 is a slot machine  
 every time i check my phone i 'm playing the slot machine to see  what am i going to get  
 what am i going to get every time i check my email i 'm playing the slot machine saying what am i going to get every time i scroll a news feed  
 i 'm playing the slot machine to
  what am i going to get next  
 and the thing is that again knowing exactly how this works and i 'm a designer i know exactly how the psychology of this works i know exactly what 's going on
 but it doesn 't leave me with any choice  i still just get sucked into it 
 so what are we going to do because it leaves us with this all or nothing relationship with technology right  
  and you 're connected and distracted all the time or you 're off  but then you 're wondering am i missing something important 
 in other words you 're either distracted
 or you have fear of missing out right  
 so we need to restore choice we want to have a
  with technology that gives us back choice
 about how we spend time with it and we 're going to need help
 from designers because knowing this stuff doesn 't help we 're going to need design help so what would that look like  
 so let 's take an example that we all face 
 chat text messaging  so let 's say there 's two people nancy 's on the left and she 's working on a document and john 's on the right
  suddenly remembers i need to ask nancy for that document before i forget
 so when he sends her that message  it blows away her attention 
 that 's what we 're doing all the time bulldozing each other 's attention left and right  
 and there 's serious cost to this  because every time we interrupt each other 
 it takes us about
 twenty three minutes on average to refocus our attention  we actually cycle through two different projects before we come back to the original thing we were doing 
 this is gloria mark 's research combined with
 microsoft research that showed this and her research also shows that it actually trains bad
  this is crazy so how do we fix this  
 because nancy and john are in this all or nothing relationship nancy might want to disconnect but then she 'd be worried  what if i 'm missing something important 
 design
  let 's say you have nancy again on the left john on the right  and john remembers i need to send nancy that document except this time nancy can mark that she 's focused let 's say she drags a slider and says i want to be focused for thirty minutes so bam she 's focused  
 now when john wants to message her 
 he can get the thought off of his mind because he has a need he has this thought and he needs to dump it out before he forgets  
 except this time it holds the
  messages
 so that nancy can still focus  but john can get the thought off of his mind  
 but this only works if one last thing is true  which is that nancy needs to know
 that if something is truly important john can still interrupt but
 instead of having constant accidental or mindless interruptions
 we 're now only creating conscious interruptions  
 so we 're doing two things here we 're creating a new choice for both nancy and john but there 's a second subtle thing we 're doing here too 
 and it 's that we 're changing the question we 're answering  instead of the goal of chat
  let 's design it so it 's easy to send a message that 's the goal of chat it should be really easy to send a message to someone
 we change the goal to something deeper and a human value which is let 's create the highest possible quality communication in a relationship
 between two people  so we upgraded the goal 
 now do designers actually care about this do we want to have conversations about what
  deeper human goals are well i 'll tell you one story  a little over a year ago i got to
 help organize a meeting between some of technology 's leading designers
 and thich nhat hanh thich nhat hanh is an international spokesperson for mindfulness
  and it was the most amazing meeting you have to imagine picture a room on one side of the room you have
 a bunch of tech geeks on the other side of the room you have a bunch of
 long brown robes shaved heads  buddhist monks  
 and the questions were about the deepest human values like what does the future of technology look like when you 're designing for the deepest questions and the deepest human
  and our conversation centered on
 listening more deeply to what those values might be 
 he joked in our conversation that what if instead of a spell check  
 you had a compassion check  meaning you might highlight a word that might be accidentally
 abrasive perceived as abrasive by someone else  so
 does this kind of conversation happen in the real world not just in these design meetings  well the answer is yes
  one of my favorites is couchsurfing if you didn 't know couchsurfing is a website that matches people who are looking for a place to stay
 with a free couch from someone who 's trying to offer it 
 so great service what would their design goal be  what are you designing for if you work at couchsurfing  
 well you would think it 's to match guests with hosts
 that 's a pretty good goal but that would kind of be like our goal with messaging before where we 're just trying to deliver a message  so what 's the deeper human goal 
 well they set their goal as the need to create lasting positive experiences and relationships between people who 've never met before 
 and the most amazing thing about this was in two thousand and seven they introduced a way
  to measure this  which is incredible i 'll tell you how it works for every design goal you have have you have to have a corresponding measurement to know how you 're doing
 a way of measuring success  so what they do is let 's say you take two people
 who meet up  and they they take the number of days those two people spent
  and then they estimate how many hours were in those days
 how many hours did those two people spend together  
 and then after they spend that time together they ask both of them how positive was your experience did you have a good experience with this person that you met  
 and they subtract from those positive hours
 the amount of time people spent on the website  because that 's a cost to people 's lives  why should we value that as success
  and what you were left with is something they
 refer to as net orchestrated conviviality 
 or really just a net good times created the net hours that would have never existed had couchsurfing not existed 
 can you imagine how inspiring it would be to come to work every day and measure
  actual net new contribution of hours in people 's lives that are positive that would have never existed if you didn 't do what you were about to do at work today 
 can you imagine
 a whole world that worked this way  can you imagine a social network
 that let 's say you care about cooking  and it measured its success in terms of cooking nights organized and the cooking articles that you were glad you read  and subtracted from that
  the articles you weren 't glad you read or the time you spent scrolling that you didn 't like 
 imagine a professional social network that instead of measuring its success in terms of connections created or messages sent  instead 
  measured its success in terms of the job offers that people got that they were excited to get
  and subtracted the amount of time people spent
 on the website or imagine
 dating services 
 like maybe tinder or something  where instead of measuring the number of swipes left and right people did  which is how they measure success today instead measured the deep 
  romantic fulfilling connections people created  
  but can you imagine a whole world that worked this way that was helping you spend your time well  
 now to do this you also need a new system because you 're probably thinking today 's internet economy today 's economy in general is measured in time spent the more users you have 
 the more usage you have the more time people spend that 's how we measure
  but we 've solved this problem before 
 we solved it with organic when we said we need to value things a different way  we said this is a different kind of food  
 so we can 't compare it just based on price this is a different category of food  we solved it with leed certification  
 where we said this is a different kind of building
 that stood for different values of environmental sustainability  what if
  we had something like that for technology  what if we had something
 whose entire purpose and goal was to help create net new positive contributions to human life  
 and what if we could value it a different way  so it would actually
  imagine you gave this different premium shelf space on app stores  imagine you had web browsers that helped route you to these kinds of design products  
 can you imagine how exciting it would be to live and create that world 
 we can create this world today  
 company leaders all you have to do only you can prioritize a new metric  which is your metric for net
  positive contribution to human life  and have an honest conversation about that maybe you 're not doing so well to start with but let 's start that conversation 
 designers you can redefine
 success you can redefine design arguably you have more power than many people in your in your organization to
 create the choices that all of us live by maybe like in medicine where we have a hippocratic oath to recognize the responsibility and and this higher
 value that we have to treat patients what if designers had something like that in terms of this new kind of design 
 and users for all of us we can demand technology that works this way  now it may seem
  mcdonald 's didn 't have salads until the consumer demand was there  
 walmart didn 't have organic food until the consumer demand was there we have to demand
 this new kind of technology  and we can do that 
 and doing that would amount to shifting from a world that 's driven and run entirely on time
  to world that 's driven by time well spent  
 i want to live in this world and i want this conversation to happen let 's start that conversation now
