  as a particle physicist  i study the elementary particles and how they interact on the most fundamental level 
 for most of my research career i 've been using accelerators such as the electron accelerator at stanford university just up the road
  to study things on the smallest scale  
 but more recently  i 've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale  because as i 'll explain to you the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected
  so i 'm going to tell you about our twenty first century view of the universe  
 what it 's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are at least some of the big questions 
 so 
  we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe and by ordinary matter  i mean you me the planets the stars the galaxies the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe  
 almost a quarter or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe is stuff that 's invisible 
 by invisible i mean it doesn 't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum  it doesn 't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum it doesn 't reflect it doesn 't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum which is what we
  use to detect things it doesn 't interact at all so how do we know it 's there we know it 's there by its gravitational effects in fact this dark matter dominates the gravitational 
  effects in the universe on a large scale and i 'll be telling you about the evidence for that what about the rest of the pie 
  matter in these galaxies especially in a spiral galaxy like this most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy  
 this huge mass of all these stars
 keeps
 stars in circular orbits in the galaxy  so we have these stars going around in circles like this as you can imagine even if you know physics
  this should be intuitive ok that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here 
  ok  so what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside 
  when those measurements are made instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant as a function of distance 
 if it 's constant that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see 
 in fact this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded
 in a cloud of this invisible dark matter and this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves
  and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy  so we see the galaxy and fixate on that but it 's actually a cloud of dark matter that 's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy  
 galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space they tend to cluster and this is an example of a very actually famous cluster the coma cluster and there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster
  fuzzy elliptical things here so these galaxy clusters we take a snapshot now  we take a snapshot in a decade it 'll look identical but these galaxies are actually moving at extremely 
  high speeds they 're moving around in in this gravitational potential well of this cluster ok so all of these galaxies are moving we can measure the speeds
  of these galaxies their orbital velocities and figure out how much mass is in this cluster and again what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be 
  accounted for by the galaxies that we see or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum we see that there 's a lot of gas in this cluster as well  but that cannot account for the mass either in fact 
 there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter
 it would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly i 'm just putting this big blue blob on there ok to try to remind you that it 's there 
 can we see it more visually yes we can and so let me lead you through how we can do this so here 's an observer it could be an eye it could be a telescope and suppose there 's a galaxy out here in the universe how do we see
  a ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters
 the telescope or your eye  now how do we deduce where the galaxy is well we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye  right  we say the ray of light came this way the galaxy must be there  ok  
 now  suppose i put in the middle a cluster of galaxies and don 't forget the dark matter ok  now  if we consider a different ray of light one
  going off like this we now need to take into account what einstein predicted when he developed general relativity  and that was that the gravitational field due to mass 
 will deflect not only the trajectory of particles but will
 deflect light itself so this light ray will not continue in a straight line  but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye  
 where will this observer see
  the galaxy  you can respond 
 up right  we extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer 's eye from that galaxy  
 yes  great i see people going down like this  so a ray of light could go down be bent up into the observer 's eye  and the observer sees a ray of light here 
 now take into account the fact that we live in a
 ok a three dimensional space are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye  
 yes  the rays would lie on a i 'd
 like to see yeah on a a cone so there 's a whole ray of light rays of light on a cone that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer 's eye  if there is a cone of light coming into
  what do i see 
 a circle a ring it 's called an einstein ring  einstein predicted that  ok  now it will only be a perfect ring if the source  
 the deflector and the eyeball in this case are all in a perfectly straight line 
 if they 're slightly skewed we 'll see a different image now you can do an experiment tonight over the reception ok 
 to figure out what that image will look
  because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect we call this gravitational lensing  
 and so this is your instrument  ok 
 but ignore
 the top part it 's the base that i want you to concentrate  
 ok  so actually at home whenever we break a wineglass i save the bottom  take it over to the machine shop we shave it off and i have a little gravitational lens ok so it 's got the right shape to produce the lensing
 and so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin  i grabbed a piece of graph paper i 'm a physicist so 
 a napkin  
 draw a little model galaxy in the middle 
 and now put the lens over the galaxy and what you 'll find is that you 'll see a ring an einstein ring now move the base off to the side and the ring will split up into arcs ok and you can put it on top of any image on the graph paper
  can see how all the the lines on the graph paper have been distorted and again  this is a
 kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing  
 ok  so the question is do we see this in the sky do we see arcs in the sky when we look at say a cluster of galaxies and the answer is yes  and so here 's an image from the hubble space telescope many of the images you are seeing
 are earlier from the hubble space telescope well first of all for the golden shape
  galaxies those are the galaxies in the cluster they 're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical 
  illusions or mirages  practically of the background galaxies so the streaks that you see all these streaks 
  so what we can do then is
 based on how much distortion we see in those images we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster and it 's an enormous amount of mass and also 
 you can tell by eye by looking at this that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies  they are centered on some
  in which the cluster is embedded ok  so this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye 
 ok so a quick review then to see that you 're following  so the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter this gravitationally attracting stuff
 is that galaxies the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large it must be embedded in dark matter
  the speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large it must be embedded in dark matter and we see these gravitational lensing effects these distortions that say that again  clusters are embedded in dark matter  
 ok so now let 's turn to dark energy  
 so to understand the evidence for dark energy  we need to discuss something that stephen hawking referred to in the previous session and that is the fact that space itself is expanding 
 so if we imagine
  a section of our infinite universe and so i 've put down four spiral galaxies ok
 and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure horizontal or vertical for measuring where things are 
 if you could do this what you would find that with each passing
  each passing year each passing billions of years ok the distance between galaxies is getting greater  
 and it 's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space they
 're not necessarily moving through space they 're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger ok that 's what the expansion of
 the universe or space means so they 're moving further apart now
  what stephen hawking mentioned as well is that after the big bang space expanded at a very rapid rate but because
 gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space  it tends to slow down the expansion of the space ok  so the expansion slows down with time 
 so in the last century ok  people debated about whether this expansion of space
 would continue forever
  whether it would slow down you know will be slowing down but continue forever slow down
 and stop  asymptotically stop  or slow down stop  and then reverse so it starts to contract again  
 so a little over a decade ago  two
 groups of physicists
  and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down  
 ok  by how much less is it expanding today compared to say a couple of billion years ago  
 the startling answer
 to this question ok from these experiments was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago 
 ok so the expansion of space is actually speeding up this was a completely surprising result
 there is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen  
 ok  no one was predicting ahead of time this is what 's going to be found it was the opposite of what was expected  
 so we need something to be able to explain that now it turns out in the mathematics you can put it in as a term that 's an energy but it 's a completely different type of energy from anything we 've ever seen before  we call it dark energy
  and it has this effect of causing space to expand  but we don 't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point ok so it 's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in 
 now  
 so at this point then what i want to really emphasize to you is that first of all dark matter and dark energy are completely different things ok there are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe and they have very different effects
  dark matter  because it gravitationally attracts it tends to encourage the growth of structure ok so clusters of galaxies will tend to form because of all this gravitational attraction 
 dark energy on the other hand is putting more and more space between the galaxies makes it the gravitational attraction
 between them decrease and so it impedes the growth of structure so by looking at things like clusters of galaxies 
 and how they
 their number density how many there are as a function of time we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming 
 in terms of dark matter  i said that we don 't have any you know really persuasive argument for
 dark energy do we have anything for dark matter and the answer is yes
 we have well motivated candidates for the dark matter  now what do i mean by well well motivated  i mean that we have
 mathematically consistent theories
 that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon ok things that i haven 't even talked about 
 that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting new particle so this is
  exactly what you want in physics where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory that was actually developed for something else  
 but we don 't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate 
 ok one or both  who knows or it could be something completely different now we look for these dark matter particles because after all  they are here
  in the room ok and they didn 't come in the door they just pass through anything they can come through the building through the earth they 're so non interacting 
 so one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it so a crystal that will ring if that happens so 
  one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector  and they 've put it deep down in an iron mine in minnesota
  deep under the ground and in fact in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far 
 they haven 't seen anything ok  but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are 
 there 's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year
 and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this
  the large hadron collider a particle physics accelerator that we 'll be turning on later this year it is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the large hadron collider
  of the big questions
