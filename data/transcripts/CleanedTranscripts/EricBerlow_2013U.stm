  an ecologist and sean 's a physicist
 and we both study complex networks  and we met a couple years ago when we discovered that we had both given a short ted talk about the ecology of war and we realized that we
  connected by the ideas we shared before we ever met and then we thought you know there are thousands of other talks out there especially tedx talks that are popping up all over the world 
 how are they connected and what does that global conversation look like so sean 's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that sean gourley exactly so
 we took twenty four thousand tedx talks from around the world one hundred and forty seven different countries  and we took these talks and we wanted to find the mathematical structures
  the ideas behind them and we wanted to do that so we could see how they connected with each other  and so of course if you 're going to do this kind of stuff you need a lot of data so the data that you 've got
 is a great thing called youtube and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from youtube all the comments all the views who 's watching it where are they watching it  what are they saying in the comments  
 but we can also pull up using speech to text translation we can pull the entire transcript and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself
  so we can take their transcript and actually do some pretty cool things we can take natural language processing algorithms to kind of read through with a computer line by line extracting key concepts from this  
 and we take those key concepts and they sort of form this mathematical structure of an idea  
 and we call that the meme ome 
 and the meme ome you know quite simply is the mathematics that underlies an idea  and we can do some pretty interesting analysis
  with it  which i want to share with you now 
 so each idea has its own meme ome and each idea is unique with that but of course  ideas they borrow from each other they kind of steal sometimes and they certainly build on each other  
 and we can go through mathematically and take the meme ome from one talk and compare it to the meme ome from every other talk and if there 's a similarity between the two of them  we can create a link and represent that as a graph just like eric and i are connected
 so that 's theory that 's great  let 's see how it works in actual practice  
 so what we 've got here now is the global footprint of all the tedx talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from new york all the way down to little old new zealand in the corner  
 and what we did on this is we analyzed the top twenty five percent of these  and we started to see where the connections
  where they connected with each other  cameron russell talking about image and beauty connected over into europe  we 've got a bigger conversation about israel and palestine radiating outwards from the middle east  
 and we 've got something a little broader like big data with a truly global footprint reminiscent of a conversation that is happening everywhere  
 so from this we kind of run up against the limits of what we can actually do with a geographic projection but luckily computer technology allows us to go out into
  so we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this and the similar talks kind of smash together  and the different ones fly apart  and what we 're left with is something quite beautiful eb 
 so i want to just point out here that every node is a talk they 're linked if they share similar ideas and that comes from a machine reading of entire talk transcripts  
 and then all these these topics that pop out they 're not from tags and keywords they come from the network structure of interconnected ideas  keep going sg absolutely so i got a little
  quick on that but he 's going to slow me down  
 we 've got education connected to storytelling triangulated next to social media you 've got of course the human brain right next to healthcare which you might expect 
 but also you 've got video games which is sort of adjacent as those two spaces interface with each other  but i want to take you into one cluster that 's particularly important to me  and that 's the environment  
 and i want to kind of zoom
  on that and see if we can get a little more resolution 
 so as we go in here what we start to see apply the physics engine again we see what 's one conversation is actually composed of many smaller ones the structure starts to emerge 
 where we see a kind of fractal behavior of the words and the language that we use to describe the things that are important to us all around this world so you 've got food economy and local food at the top you 've got greenhouse gases solar and nuclear waste what
  you 're getting is a range of smaller conversations each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share creating a broader concept of the environment  
 and of course from here we can go and and zoom in and see well  what are young people looking at  and they 're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion this is their kind of resonance for the conversation around the environment  
 if we split along
 gender lines we can see females resonating heavily with
 food economy  but also out there in hope and optimism and so there 's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here
 throw to eric for the next part eb yeah i mean  just to point out here you cannot get this kind of perspective from a simple tag search on youtube 
  let 's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation out of environment and look at all the talks together 
 now often when we 're faced with this amount of content we do a couple of things to simplify it
  we might just say well  what are the most popular talks out there  
 and a few rise to the surface there 's a talk about gratitude there 's another one about personal health and nutrition  and of course there 's got to be one about porn right
  and so then we might say well gratitude that was last year what 's trending now what 's the popular talk now  and we can see that the new emerging top trending topic is about digital privacy
  so this is great it simplifies things but there 's so much creative content that 's just buried at the bottom  
 and i hate that how do we bubble stuff up to the surface that 's maybe really creative and interesting well
 we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that 
 remember it 's that network structure that is creating these emergent topics and let 's say we could take two of them like cities and genetics and say well are there any talks that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines and that 's essentially this kind of creative remix
  is one of the hallmarks of innovation  well here 's one by jessica green about the microbial ecology of buildings it 's literally defining a new field  
 and we could go back to those topics and say well  what talks are central to those conversations in the cities cluster one of the most central was one by
 by mitch joachim about ecological cities and in the genetics cluster
 we have a talk about synthetic biology by craig venter these are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline we could go the other direction and say well  what are talks that are broadly synthesizing a lot of different kinds of fields we used a measure of ecological diversity to get this 
 like a talk by steven pinker on the history of violence very synthetic 
 and then of course there are talks that are so unique they 're kind of out in the stratosphere in their own special place  and we call that the colleen flanagan index
  and if you don 't know colleen she 's an artist and i asked her
  's it like out there in the stratosphere of our idea space and apparently it smells like bacon 
 i wouldn 't know
 so we 're using these network motifs to find talks that are unique ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields ones that are central to their topic  and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate 
  fields  okay we never would have found those with our obsession with what 's trending now  
  of complexity or the patterns of how things are connected sg so that 's exactly right we 've got
 ourselves in a world that 's massively complex  
 and we 've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it  
 and those algorithms whilst being kind of useful are also very very narrow  
 and we can do better than that because we can realize that their complexity is not random it has mathematical structure
 and we can use that mathematical structure to go and explore things like the world of ideas to see what 's being said to see what 's not being said  and to be a little bit more human and hopefully a little smarter thank you
