  talk about the simple truth in leadership in the 21st century 
 in the 21st century we need to actually look at and what i 'm actually going to encourage you to consider today is to go back to our school days
  when we learned how to count  
 but i think it 's time for us to think about what we count because what we actually count truly counts  let me start by telling you a little story 
 this is van quach she came to this country in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six from vietnam she changed her name to vivian because she wanted to fit in here in america 
 her first job was at an inner city motel in san francisco as a maid i happened to buy that motel about three months after vivian started working there so vivian
  working together for twenty three years 
 with the youthful idealism of a 26 year old in one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven i started my company and i called it joie de vivre a very impractical name
  because i actually was looking to create joy of life and this first hotel that i bought motel was a 
  in the inner city of san francisco as i spent time with vivian i saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre in how she did her work it
 made me question and curious how could someone actually find joy in cleaning toilets for a living  
 so i spent time with vivian and i saw that
 she didn 't find joy in cleaning toilets her job her goal and her calling was not to become the world 's greatest toilet scrubber 
 what counts for vivian was the emotional connection she created
  with her fellow employees and our guests and what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that she was taking care of people who were far away from home  because vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home 
 that very human lesson more than twenty years ago  served me well during the last
 economic downturn we had
  in the wake of the dotcom crash and nine eleven san francisco bay area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of american hotels 
 we were the largest operator of hotels in the bay area so we were particularly vulnerable  
 but also back then remember we stopped eating french fries in this country  well not exactly of course not 
 we started eating freedom fries 
 and we started boycotting anything that was french  
 well my name of my company
 joie de vivre
  i started getting these letters from places like alabama and orange county
 saying to me that they were going to boycott my company because they thought we were a french company and i 'd write them back and i 'd say what a minute we 're not french we 're an american company  we 're based in san francisco and i 'd get a terse response oh that 's worse 
 so
  one particular day when i was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre i ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices  
 and i initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution  but given my befuddled state of mind i ended up in the self help section very quickly 
 that 's where i got reacquainted with abraham maslow 's hierarchy of needs 
 i took one psychology class in college  and i learned about this guy abraham maslow  as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs  
 but as i sat there for four hours
 the full afternoon reading maslow i recognized something that is true of most leaders 
 one of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect  
 and that is that we 're all human
 each of us  no matter what our role is in business has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace  
 so as i started reading more maslow what i started to realize is that
  later in his life  
 wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective to organizations and specifically to business  but unfortunately he died prematurely in one thousand nine hundred and seventy  and so he wasn 't really able to live that dream completely  so i realized in that dotcom crash
 that my role in life was to channel abe maslow  and that 's what i did
  a few years ago when i took that five level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what i call the transformation pyramid which is survival success and transformation it 's not just fundamental in business it 's fundamental in life 
 and we started asking ourselves the questions about how we were actually addressing the higher needs these transformational needs for our key employees
 in the company  these three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five
  maslow 's hierarchy of needs  
 but as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers  i realized we had no metrics we had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right  
 so we started asking ourselves  what kind of less obvious metrics could we use to actually evaluate our employees ' sense of meaning or our customers ' sense of emotional connection with us 
  we actually started asking our employees do they understand the mission of our company 
 and do they feel like they believe in it can they actually influence it and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it we started asking our customers did they feel an emotional connection with us in one of seven different kinds of ways  
 miraculously as we asked these questions and started giving attention higher up the pyramid  what we found is we created more loyalty
  our customer loyalty skyrocketed our employee turnover dropped to one third of the industry average  and during that five year dotcom bust  we tripled in size
 as i went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure
  start valuing the intangible if we 're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure and all we can measure is the tangible in life  we 're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid  
 so i went out and studied a bunch of things and i found a survey that showed that ninety four percent
 of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their
  things like intellectual property their corporate culture their brand loyalty  and yet only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business  
 so as leaders we understand that intangibles are important  but we don 't have a clue how to measure them 
 so here 's another einstein quote not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be
  i hate to argue with einstein  but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business
 actually can 't be counted or valued aren 't we going to spend our lives
 just mired in measuring the mundane it was that sort of heady question about what counts
 that led me to take my ceo hat off for a week and fly off to the himalayan peaks 
 i flew off to a place that 's been shrouded in mystery for centuries a place some folks call
 shangri la it 's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world i went to bhutan  
 the teenage king of bhutan was also a curious man but this was back in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away 
 at age seventeen
  he started asking the kinds of questions that you 'd expect of someone with a beginner 's mind 
 on a trip through india  early in his reign as as king he was asked by an indian journalist about the bhutanese gdp the size of the bhutanese gdp gdp
 the king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later  
 he said the following  he said why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product  why don 't we care
 now  in essence the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success what has come to be
 known as gnh or gross national happiness most world leaders didn 't take notice and those that did thought this was just buddhist economics 
 but the king was serious this was a notable moment because this was the first time a world leader in almost two hundred years had suggested
 that that intangible of happiness that that leader two hundred years ago thomas jefferson with the declaration of independence
 two hundred years later  
 this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness is something that we should measure and it 's something we should actually value as government officials for the 
  next three three dozen years as king this king actually started measuring and managing
  around happiness in bhutan including just recently taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy
 with no bloodshed no coup bhutan for those of you who don 't know it is the newest democracy in the world just two years ago  
 so as i spent time with leaders in the gnh movement i got to really understand what they 're doing and i got to spend some time with the prime minister over dinner i asked him an impertinent question
  asked him  how can you create and measure
 something which evaporates in other words happiness 
 and he 's a very wise man and he said listen  bhutan 's goal is not to create happiness  
 we create the conditions for happiness to occur in other words we create a habitat of happiness 
  he said that they have a science behind that art and they 've actually created four essential pillars nine key indicators and seventy two different metrics that help them to measure their gnh  one of those key indicators is 
 how do the bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day it
 's a good question  how do you feel about how you spend your time each day time is one of the scarcest resources
 in the modern world  and yet of course that
  little intangible piece of data doesn 't factor into our gdp calculations 
 as i spent my week up in the himalayas i started to imagine what i call an emotional equation  
 and it focuses on something i read long ago from a guy named rabbi hyman schachtel how many know him  anybody one thousand nine hundred and fifty four he wrote a book called the real enjoyment
  and he suggested that happiness is not about having what you want 
 instead it 's about wanting what you have or in other words  i think the bhutanese believe happiness equals
 wanting what you have imagine gratitude divided by
 having what you want gratification the bhutanese aren 't on some aspirational treadmill constantly focused
  on what they don 't have 
 their religion their isolation their deep respect for their culture and now the principles of their gnh movement all have fostered a sense of gratitude gratitude about what they do have 
 how many of us here as tedsters in the audience spend more of our time in the bottom half of this equation  in the denominator
  do focus on the pursuit of happiness
 as if happiness is something that we have to go out an object that we 're supposed to get or maybe many objects actually in fact if you look in the dictionary many dictionaries 
 define pursuit as to chase with hostility do we pursue happiness with hostility 
  but back to bhutan bhutan 's bordered on its north and south by thirty eight percent of the world 's population 
 could this little country like a startup in a mature industry be the spark plug that influences a 21st century of middle class in china and india  
 bhutan 's created the ultimate export a new global currency
  and there are forty countries around the world today that are studying their own gnh 
 you may have heard  this last fall nicolas sarkozy in france announcing the results of an 18 month
 study by two nobel economists focusing on happiness and wellness in france 
 sarkozy suggested that world leaders should stop myopically focusing on gdp and consider a new index  what some french are
  just three days ago three days ago here at ted we had a simulcast of david cameron potentially the next prime minister of the uk quoting one of my favorite speeches of all time robert kennedy 's poetic speech from 
 when he suggested that we 're myopically focused on the wrong thing and that gdp is a misplaced
  so it suggests that the momentum is shifting 
 i 've taken that robert kennedy quote and i 've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here this is a collection of things that robert kennedy said in that quote 
 gdp counts everything from air pollution to the destruction of our redwoods  
 but it doesn 't count the health of our children or the integrity of our public officials  as you look at these two columns
  it make you feel like it 's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count a new way to imagine
 what 's important to us in life 
 certainly robert kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that he said gdp measures everything in short except that which makes life worthwhile 
 wow  so how do we do that
  let me say one thing we can just start doing
 ten years from now at least in this country  
 why in the heck in america are we doing a census in two thousand and ten we 're spending ten billion dollars on the census we 're asking ten simple questions it is simplicity  
 but all of those questions are tangible they
 're about demographics they 're about where you live  how many people you live with and whether you own your home or not that 's about it we
 're not asking meaningful metrics we 're not asking important questions
  's intangible 
 abe maslow said long ago something you 've heard before  but you didn 't realize it was him  he said if the only tool you have is a hammer 
 everything starts to look like a nail 
 we 've been fooled by our tool  
 excuse that expression 
 we 've been fooled by our tool
  of the world 's gdp today is in that intangible industry we call service the service industry the industry i 'm in 
 and only thirty six percent is in the tangible industries of manufacturing and agriculture 
 so maybe it 's time that we get a bigger toolbox right maybe it 's time we get a toolbox that doesn 't just count what 's easily counted the tangible in life
  but actually counts what we most value  the things that are intangible 
 i guess i 'm sort of a curious ceo  
 i was also a curious economics major as an undergrad i learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption
 as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same
  in fact as leaders what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling 
 in vivian 's case 
 her unit of production isn 't the tangible hours she works it 's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work 
 this is dave arringdale who 's actually
 been a longtime guest at vivian 's motel he stayed there a hundred times in the last twenty years  
 and he 's loyal to the property because of the relationship that vivian and her fellow employees have created with him they 've created a habitat of happiness for dave  he tells me 
 that he can always count on vivian and the staff there to make him feel at home  
  between creating the intangible of employee happiness
 with creating the tangible of financial profits in their business we don 't have to choose between
 inspired employees and sizable profits we can have both in fact inspired employees quite often help make
  what the world needs now  in my opinion is business leaders and political leaders who know what to count  
 we count numbers we count on people  
 what really counts is when we actually use our numbers to truly take into account our people 
 i learned that from a maid in a motel
 and a king of a country
  what can you start counting today 
 what one thing can you start counting today that actually would be meaningful in your life whether it 's your work life or your business life  
 thank you very much
