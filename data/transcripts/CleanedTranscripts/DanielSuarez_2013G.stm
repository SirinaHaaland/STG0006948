  'd probably think something like this  
 but i 'm actually not here to talk about fiction  i 'm here to talk about very real killer robots autonomous combat drones
  referring to predator and reaper drones  which have a human making targeting decisions i 'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons
 that make lethal decisions about human beings all on their own there 's actually a technical term for this lethal autonomy  
 now lethally autonomous
  killer robots would take many forms
 flying driving or just lying in wait  
 and actually they 're very quickly becoming a reality  
 these are two automatic sniper stations currently deployed in the dmz between north and south korea 
 both of these machines are capable of automatically identifying a human target
 and firing on it the one on the left
 at a distance of over a kilometer
  in both cases there 's still a human in the loop
 to make that lethal firing decision  but it 's not a technological requirement it 's a choice 
 and it 's that choice that i want to focus on because as we migrate lethal decision making from humans
 to software we risk not only taking the humanity out of war  but also changing our social landscape entirely  far from the battlefield
 that 's because
 the way humans resolve conflict
 shapes our social landscape  and this has always been the case throughout history for example these were state of the art weapons systems in one thousand four hundred a d 
 now they were both very expensive to build and maintain but with these you could dominate the
  and the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that power was focused at the very top and
 what changed 
 technological innovation gunpowder cannon  and pretty soon armor and castles were obsolete  
 and it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield
 versus how many people you brought to the battlefield  and as armies grew in size
  arose as a political and logistical requirement of defense 
 and as leaders had to rely on more of their populace  they began to share power representative government began to form  
 so again the tools we use to resolve conflict
 shape our social landscape autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool except that by
 requiring very few people to go to war  they risk
 re centralizing power into very few hands  possibly reversing a five century trend toward democracy 
 now i think knowing this 
 we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions to do what humans do best which is adapt 
 but time is a factor  seventy nations are developing
  of their own  and as you 'll see remotely piloted combat drones
 are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons that 's because once you 've deployed remotely piloted drones there are three powerful factors
 pushing decision making away from humans
 and on to the weapon platform itself the first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce
  example in two thousand and four the u s drone fleet produced a grand total of seventy one hours of video surveillance for analysis
  by two thousand and eleven this had gone up to three hundred thousand hours 
 outstripping human ability to review it all but even that number is about to go up drastically 
 the pentagon 's gorgon stare and argus programs will put up to
  camera eyes
 on each drone platform  
 and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it and that means visual intelligence software will need to scan it for items of interest  
 and that means very soon drones will tell humans what to look at not the other way around  but there 's a second
  away from humans and onto machines and that 's electromagnetic jamming  severing the connection between the drone and its operator  
 now we saw an example of this in two thousand and eleven when an american rq 170 sentinel drone got a bit confused over iran due to a gps spoofing attack  
 but any 
 drone is susceptible to this type of attack  and that means drones
  will have to shoulder more decision making they 'll know their mission objective  
 and they 'll react to new circumstances without human guidance 
 they 'll ignore external radio signals and send very few of their own  
 which brings us to really the third and most powerful incentive
  away from humans and onto weapons  
 plausible deniability  
 now we live in a global economy
 high tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents  
 cyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designs to parts unknown  and in that environment it is very likely that a successful drone design
 will be knocked off in contract factories proliferate in the gray market
  situation sifting through the wreckage of a suicide drone attack it will be very difficult to say who sent that weapon 
 this raises the very real possibility
 of anonymous war  
 this could tilt the geopolitical balance on its head make it very difficult for a nation to turn its firepower against an attacker  
 and that could shift the balance in the
  century away from defense and toward offense it could make military action a viable option not just for small nations  
 but criminal organizations  private enterprise even powerful individuals 
 it could create a landscape of rival warlords
 undermining rule of law and civil society now if
 responsibility and transparency are two of the cornerstones
  of representative government autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both now you might be thinking that citizens of high tech nations
 would have the advantage in any robotic war that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable particularly against developing nations  
 but i think the truth is the exact opposite  i think citizens of
 high tech societies are more vulnerable vulnerable to robotic weapons  and the reason can be summed up in one word data 
 data powers high tech societies  
 cell phone geolocation telecom metadata social media  email text financial transaction data  transportation
  it 's a wealth of real time data
 on the movements and social interactions of people in short we are more visible to machines than any people in history  
 and this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons  
 what you 're looking at here
 is a link analysis map of a social group  lines indicate social connectedness between
  and these types of maps can be automatically generated
 based on the
 data trail modern people leave behind 
 now it 's typically used to market goods and services to targeted demographics  but it 's a dual use technology  
 because targeting is used in another context notice that certain individuals are highlighted these are the hubs of social networks 
  and these people also can be automatically identified from their communication patterns 
 now if you 're a marketer you might then target them with product samples  try to spread your brand through their social group  
 but if you 're a repressive government
 searching for political enemies you might instead remove them eliminate them disrupt their social
  and those who remain behind lose social cohesion and organization
 now in a world of cheap proliferating robotic weapons  borders would offer very little protection to critics of distant governments
 or trans national criminal organizations popular movements agitating for change
 could be detected early and their leaders eliminated before their ideas achieve critical mass and ideas achieving
  critical mass is what political activism in popular government is all about anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action
 an easy choice for all sorts of competing interests  and this would
 put a chill on free speech
 and popular political action the very heart of democracy  and this is why we need an international treaty on
  robotic weapons and in particular a global ban
 on the development and deployment of killer robots  
 now we already have international treaties on nuclear and biological weapons 
 and while imperfect these have largely worked  
 but robotic weapons
 might be every bit as dangerous because they will almost certainly be used and they would also be corrosive to our democratic
  institutions  
 now in november two thousand and twelve the u s department of defense
 issued a directive requiring a human being be present in all lethal decisions  this temporarily
 effectively banned autonomous weapons in the u s military but that directive needs to be made
  and it could set the stage for global action 
 because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons  
 and we need it now before there 's a devastating attack or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world to rush to adopt these weapons before thinking through the consequences 
 autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power in too few hands  and they would imperil
  democracy itself  
 now  don 't get me wrong  i think there are tons of great uses for unarmed civilian drones  
 environmental monitoring search and rescue logistics 
 if we have an international treaty on robotic weapons  how do we gain the benefits of autonomous
 drones and vehicles while still protecting ourselves against illegal robotic weapons
  i think the secret will be transparency  
 no robot should have an expectation of privacy in a public place 
 each robot and drone should have a cryptographically signed
  burned in at the factory that can be used to track its movement through public spaces we have license plates on cars  tail numbers on aircraft this is no different  
 and every citizen should be able to download an app that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles moving through public spaces around them 
 both right now and historically 
 and civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones
 to detect rogue drones and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down
  should notify humans to their presence  and in certain very high security areas  perhaps civic drones would snare them and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility  
 but notice this is more an immune system
 than a weapons system it would allow us to avail ourselves of the use of autonomous vehicles and drones while still preserving our
  civil society we must
 ban the deployment and development
 of killer robots let 's not succumb to the temptation to automate war  autocratic governments
 and criminal organizations undoubtedly will but let 's not join them 
 autonomous robotic weapons would concentrate too much power in too few unseen hands  
 and that would be corrosive to representative government 
 let 's make sure for democracies
  at least killer robots remain fiction  thank you
