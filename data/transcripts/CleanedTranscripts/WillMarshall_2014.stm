  needs no introduction it needs no introduction in part because the apollo seventeen astronauts when they were hurtling around the moon
  beings to realize that we 're on spaceship earth  
 fragile and finite as it is and that we need to take care of it  but while this picture is beautiful  it 's static  and the earth is constantly changing it
 's changing on days ' time scales with human activity  
 and the satellite imagery we have of it today is old  
  and that 's important because you can 't fix what you can 't see what we 'd ideally want is images of the whole planet every day  
 so what 's standing in our way what 's the problem  
 this is the problem satellites are big expensive and they 're slow  this one weighs three tons  it 's six
  four meters wide  it took up the entire fairing of a rocket just to launch it one satellite one rocket  it cost eight hundred and fifty five million dollars 
 satellites like these have done an amazing job at helping us to understand our planet  
 but if we want to understand it much more regularly 
 we need lots of satellites and this model isn 't scalable so me and my friends we started planet labs to make satellites
  i 'm going to show you what our satellite looks like 
 this is our satellite  
 this is not a scale model  this is the real size it 's ten by ten by thirty centimeters it weighs four kilograms  
 and we 've stuffed the latest and greatest electronics and sensor systems into this little package
 so that even though this is really small
 this can take pictures ten times the resolution of the big satellite here  even though it weighs one thousandth of the mass  
 and we call this satellite dove thank you 
 we call this satellite dove and we call it dove because satellites are
  these sort of things  but ours have a humanitarian mission so we wanted to call them doves  
 and we haven 't just built them though we 've launched them and not just one  but many  
 it all started in our garage  yes we built our first satellite prototype in our garage now this is pretty normal for a silicon valley company that we are but we believe
  first time for a space company  and
 that 's not the only trick we learned from silicon valley  we
 rapidly prototype our satellites we use release early release often on our software  and we take a different risk approach we take them
 outside and test them  we even put satellites in space just to test the satellites  and we 've learned to manufacture our satellites at scale  
 we 've used modern production techniques so we can build large numbers of them
 i think for the first time we call it agile aerospace
 and that 's what 's enabled us to put so much capability into this little box 
 now  what has bonded our team over the years
 is the idea of democratizing access to
  in fact the founders of our company chris robbie and i we met over fifteen years ago at the united nations when they were hosting a conference
 about exactly that question how do you use satellites to help humanity  how do you use satellites to help people in developing countries or with climate change  
 and this is what has bonded us our entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity 
 you could say we 're space geeks but not only do we care about what 's up there we care about what 's down here too i 'm going to show you a video
  just four weeks ago of two of our satellites being launched from the international space station  
 this is not an animation  this is a video taken by the astronaut looking out of the window it
 gives you a bit of a sense of scale of our two satellites it 's like some of the smallest satellites ever are being launched from the biggest satellite ever 
 and right at the end the solar array glints in the
  we didn 't just launch two of them like this we launched twenty eight of them it
 's the largest constellation of earth imaging satellites in human history  and it 's going to provide a completely radical new data set about our changing planet  
 but that 's just the beginning 
 you see we 're going to launch more than one hundred of these satellites like these over the course of the next year
 's going to be the largest constellation of satellites in human history  and this is what it 's going to do acting in a single orbit plane that stays fixed with respect to the sun the earth rotates 
  underneath they 're all cameras pointed down and they slowly scan across as the earth rotates underneath 
  a line scanner for the planet  
 we don 't take a picture of anywhere on the planet every day  we take a picture of every single place on the planet every day  even though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago  
 we 've already got some initial imagery from the satellites
 and i 'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now  
 this is the very first picture taken by our satellite  it happened to be over uc davis ' campus in california when we turned the camera on 
 but what 's even cooler is when we compare it to the previous latest image of that area
 which was taken many months ago  and the image on the left is from our satellite  and we see buildings are being built 
 the general point is that we will be able to track urban growth as it happens around the whole world in all cities every day  
 water as well  thank you we
 'll be able to see the extent of all water bodies around the whole world every day and help water
  security 
 from water security to food security 
 we 'll see crops as they grow in all the fields in every farmer 's field around the planet every day and help them to improve crop yield  
 this is a beautiful image that was taken just a few hours ago
 when the satellite was flying over argentina the general point is there are probably hundreds and thousands of applications of this data i 've mentioned a few but there 's others deforestation
  the ice caps melting we can track all of these things every tree on the planet every day  
 if you took the difference between today 's image and yesterday 's image you 'd see much of the world news you 'd see floods and fires and earthquakes  
 and we have decided therefore that the best thing that we could do with our data is to ensure universal access to it 
 we want to ensure everyone can
 ngos and companies and scientists and journalists to be able to answer the questions that they have about the planet  we want to enable the developer community to
 run their apps on our data in short we want to democratize access to information about our planet  
 which brings me back to this you see this will be an entirely new global data set  and we believe that together
  can help to take care of our spaceship earth  
 and what i would like to leave you with is the following question  
 if you had access to imagery of the whole planet every single day  what would you do with that data what problems would you solve what exploration would you do well
 i invite you to come and explore with us  thank you very much
