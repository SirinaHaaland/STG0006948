  a couple years ago  an event planner called me because i was going to do a speaking event  and she called and she said i 'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer
  you a researcher i think but i 'm afraid if i call you a researcher no one will come because they 'll think you 're boring and irrelevant 
 and i was like 
 okay and she said but the thing i liked about your talk is you 're a storyteller so i think what i 'll do is just call you a storyteller 
 and of course the academic insecure part of me was like
  let me think about this for a second  i tried to call deep on my courage  
 and i thought you know i am a storyteller  i 'm a qualitative researcher i collect stories that 's what i do and maybe stories are just data
  and i 'm going to talk to you today we 're talking about expanding perception and so i want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research
 that fundamentally expanded my perception
 and really actually changed the way that i live and love
  and work and parent
 and this is where my story starts  
 when i was a young researcher doctoral student 
 my first year i had a research professor who said to us here 's the thing  if you cannot measure it  it does not exist 
 and i thought he was just sweet talking me i was like
  bachelor 's and a master 's in social work and i was getting my ph d in social work so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the life 's messy 
 love it 
 and i 'm more of the life 's messy  clean it up organize it and put it into a bento box 
 and so to think that i had found my way to found
  a career that takes me really one of the big sayings
 in social work is lean into the discomfort of the work and i 'm like  knock discomfort upside the head and move it over
 and get all a 's that was my mantra  
 so i was very excited about this  and so i thought you know what this is the career for me because i am interested in some messy topics  but i want to be able to
  make them not messy  i want to understand them i want to hack into these things that i know are important
 and lay the code out for everyone to see 
 so where i started was with connection because by the time you 're a social worker for ten years what you realize
 is that connection is why we 're here it 's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives this is
  all about it doesn 't matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice mental health
 and abuse and neglect what we know is that connection  the ability to feel connected is
 neurobiologically that 's how we 're wired it 's why we 're here  so i thought you know what i 'm going to start with connection 
 well you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss  and she tells you
  you do really awesome and one opportunity for growth 
 and all you can think about is that opportunity for growth  right  well  apparently this is the way my work went as well  because when you ask people about love  
 they tell you about heartbreak  when you ask people about belonging  they 'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded and when you ask people
  about connection  the stories they told me were about disconnection  
 so very quickly really about six weeks into this research i ran into this unnamed thing
 that absolutely unraveled connection
 in a way that i didn 't understand or had never seen  and so i pulled back out of the research and thought i need to figure out what this is and it turned out to be shame
  and shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection is there something about me that if other people know it or see it 
 that i won 't
 be worthy of connection  
 the things i can tell you about it it 's universal  we all have it the only people who don 't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection  
 no one wants to talk about it and the less you talk about it the more you have it
 underpinned this shame this i 'm not good enough 
 which we all know that feeling i 'm not blank enough  i 'm not thin enough rich enough beautiful enough smart enough  promoted enough 
 the thing that underpinned this was
 excruciating vulnerability  this idea
  in order for connection to happen we have to allow ourselves to be seen  really seen  
 and you know how i feel about vulnerability i hate vulnerability and so i thought this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick  
 i 'm going in i 'm
 going to figure this stuff out i 'm going to spend a year  i 'm going to totally deconstruct shame  i 'm going to understand how vulnerability works  and i 'm going to outsmart it 
 so i was ready  and i was really excited
 as you know it 's not going to turn out well 
 you know this  
 so i could tell you a lot about shame but i 'd have to borrow everyone else 's time but here 's what i can tell you that it boils down to
 and this may be one of the most important things that i 've ever learned in the decade of doing this research 
 my one year turned into six years
 thousands of stories  hundreds of long interviews focus groups at one point people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories
 thousands of pieces of data
 in six years  and i kind of got a handle on it i kind of understood this is what shame is this is how it works 
 i wrote a book i published a theory  but something was not okay
  okay and what it was is that if i roughly took the people i interviewed and divided them into people
 who really have a sense of worthiness that 's what this comes down to a sense of worthiness
 they have a strong sense of love and belonging
 and folks who struggle for it and
 folks who are always wondering if they 're good enough  there was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging
 and the people who really struggle for it and that was the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging
 believe they 're worthy of love and belonging
 that 's it they believe they 're worthy 
 and to me the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we 're not worthy of
  connection was something that personally and professionally i felt like i needed to understand better so what i did
 is i took all of the interviews where i saw worthiness where i saw people living that way and just looked at those
  what do these people have in common i have a slight office supply addiction but that 's another talk  
 so i had a manila
  a manila folder and i had a sharpie  and i was like what am i going to call this research and the first words that came to my mind were 
  people living from this deep sense of worthiness so i wrote at the top of the manila folder  and i started looking at the data in fact  i did it first in
  pulled the incidents what 's the theme what 's the pattern my husband left town with the kids
 because i always go into this jackson pollock crazy thing where i 'm just writing and
 in my researcher mode  and so here 's what i found 
 what they had in common was a sense of courage and i want to separate courage and bravery
  for you for a minute courage the original definition of courage  when it first came into the english language it 's from the latin word cor 
 meaning heart and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart  
 and so these folks had very simply the courage to be imperfect 
 they had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others
 because as it turns out we can 't practice compassion with other people if we can 't treat ourselves kindly  and the last was they had connection  and this was the hard part
 as a result of authenticity they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be
 in order to be who they were  which you have to absolutely do that for connection
  the other thing that they had in common was this  
 they fully embraced vulnerability  
 they
 believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful 
 they didn 't talk about
  vulnerability being comfortable nor did they really talk about it being excruciating as i had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing 
 they just talked about it being necessary  
 they talked about the willingness
 to say i love you first the willingness to
 do something where there are no guarantees  the willingness
  to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram they
 're willing to invest in a relationship
 that may or may not work out they thought this was fundamental  
 i personally thought it was betrayal
  i could not believe i had pledged allegiance to research  where our job you know the definition of research is to control
 control and predict to study phenomena for the explicit explicit reason to control and predict and now
 my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting  this led to
 a little breakdown
  i call it a breakdown my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening 
 a spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown but i assure you it was a breakdown  
 and i had to put my data away and go find a therapist let me tell you something you know who you are when you call your friends and say i
  so i found a therapist 
  here 's the thing
  struggle and i said well  i have a vulnerability issue  and i know that vulnerability is the core
 of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness  but it appears that it 's also the birthplace
 of joy of creativity 
 of belonging of love and i think i have a problem and i need some help
  and i said but here 's the thing no family stuff no childhood shit
  it just is what it is and i said oh my god this is going to suck 
 and it did and it didn 't and it took about a year  and you know how there are people that when they realize that
  vulnerability
 and tenderness are important that they surrender and walk into it 
 a that 's not me and b i don 't even hang out with people like that 
 for me  it was a yearlong street fight  it was a slugfest vulnerability pushed i pushed back
  i lost
 the fight but probably won my life back and so then i went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they the 
  choices they were making  and what  what we are doing with vulnerability
  why do we struggle with it so much am i alone in struggling with vulnerability 
 no so this is what i learned  
 we numb vulnerability
 when we 're waiting for the call it was funny  i sent something out on twitter and on facebook that says how would you define vulnerability what makes you feel vulnerable and within an hour and a half i had one hundred and fifty responses
  because i wanted to know what 's out there 
 having to ask my husband for help because i 'm sick and we 're newly married  initiating sex with my husband
  initiating sex with my wife 
 being turned down  asking someone out 
 waiting for the doctor to call back getting laid off laying off people  this is the world we live in 
 we live in a vulnerable world
  and one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability and i think
  there 's evidence and it 's not the only reason this evidence exists but i think it 's a huge cause we are
 the most in debt obese  addicted
 and medicated adult cohort in u s history  
 the problem is and i learned this from the research that you cannot selectively
  you can 't say  here 's the bad stuff 
 here 's vulnerability here 's grief here 's shame here 's fear here 's disappointment i don 't want to feel these  i 'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin 
 i don 't want to feel these  and i know that 's knowing laughter i hack into your lives for a living
 without numbing the other affects our emotions you cannot selectively numb so when we numb those  we numb joy  
 we numb gratitude we numb happiness  
 and then we are miserable  and we are looking for purpose and meaning  and then we feel vulnerable so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin  
 and it becomes this dangerous cycle
  one of the things
 that i think we need to think about is why and how we numb and it doesn 't just have to be addiction  
 the other thing we do is we make everything that 's uncertain certain  religion
 has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty i 'm right
  that 's it 
 just certain  
 the more afraid we are the more vulnerable we are the more afraid we are  this is what politics looks like today  there 's no discourse anymore there 's no conversation 
 there 's just blame you know how blame is described in the research 
 a way to discharge pain and discomfort 
 we perfect
 if there 's anyone who wants their life to look like this it would be me  
 but it doesn 't work  because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks 
 which just i hope in one hundred years people will look back and go wow 
 and we perfect most dangerously our children  let me tell you what we think about children
  for struggle when they get here  
 and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand our job is not to say look at her she 's perfect my job is just to keep her perfect make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and yale by seventh 
 that 's not our job our job is to look and say you know what you 're imperfect and you 're wired for struggle but you are worthy of love and belonging 
 that 's our job  show me a generation of kids
  raised like that and we 'll end the problems i think that we see today we pretend
 that what we do doesn 't have an effect on people 
 we do that in our personal lives we do that corporate whether it 's a bailout an oil spill 
 a recall  we pretend like what we 're doing doesn 't have a huge impact on other people i would say to companies this is not our
  first rodeo people  we just need you to be authentic and real and say we
 're sorry we 'll fix it 
 but there 's another way  and i 'll leave you with this this is what i have found to let ourselves be seen  
 deeply seen  vulnerably seen 
 to love with our whole hearts
 even though there 's no guarantee and that 's really hard and i can tell you as a parent that 's excruciatingly difficult
 to practice gratitude and joy
 in those moments of terror when we 're wondering can i love you this much can i believe in this this passionately  can i be this fierce
  just to be able to stop and instead of catastrophizing what might happen to say i 'm just so grateful  because to feel this vulnerable means i 'm alive 
 and the last which i think is probably the most important 
 is to believe that we 're enough  because when we work from a place  i believe that says i 'm enough 
 then we stop screaming and start listening 
 we 're kinder and gentler to the people around us and we 're kinder and gentler to ourselves 
 that 's all i have
