  want to talk to you about two things tonight number one teaching surgery
 and doing surgery is really hard  and second
  that language is one of the most profound things that separate us
 all over the world  and in my little corner of the world these two things are actually related  and i want to tell you how tonight  
 now  nobody wants an operation who here has had surgery  
 did you want it  keep your hands up if you wanted an operation nobody wants an operation 
  nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions
 that cause a lot of pain 
 that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school that leave a big scar  
 but if you have to have an operation what you really want is a minimally invasive operation that 's what i want to talk to you about tonight
 how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better universal translator
  now this type of surgery is hard  and it starts by putting people to sleep 
 putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen blowing them up like a balloon  sticking one of these sharp pointy things
 into their abdomen
 it 's dangerous stuff
 and taking instruments and watching it on a tv screen so let 's see what it looks like
 so this is gallbladder surgery we perform a million of these a year in the united states alone this is the real thing there 's no blood  
 and you can see how focused the surgeons are how much concentration it takes you can see it in their faces it
 's hard to teach  and it 's not all that easy to learn
  we do about five million of these in the united states and maybe twenty million of these worldwide 
 all right 
 you 've all heard the the term he 's a born surgeon let me tell you surgeons are not born 
 surgeons are not made either there are
 no little tanks where we 're making surgeons  surgeons are trained
 one step at a time
  starts with a foundation basic skills we build on that and we take people hopefully 
 to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant then we teach them to be a surgeon in training  
 and when they do all of that for about five years they get the coveted board certification if you need surgery you want to be operated on by a 
  surgeon you get your board certificate
  and you can go out into practice  and eventually if you 're lucky you achieve mastery 
 now that foundation is so important
 that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the united states sages 
 started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure
 that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong
  foundation of knowledge
 and skills
 necessary to go on and do procedures  now the science behind this is so potent
 that it became required by the american board of surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified it
 's not a lecture it 's not a course  it 's all of that
  it 's hard  now
 just this past year one of our partners the american college of surgeons  teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons
 should be fls certified before they do minimally invasive surgery and are we talking about just people here in the u s and canada  no
 we just said all surgeons  so to lift this education and training
 worldwide is a very large task  something i 'm very personally excited about
 as we travel around the world sages does surgery all over the world teaching and educating surgeons  
 so we have a problem and one of the problems is distance  we can 't travel everywhere  we need to make the world a smaller place
  and i think that we can develop some tools to do so and one of the tools i like personally
 is using video  so i was inspired by a friend this is allan okrainec from toronto  and he proved
 that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing  so here 's allan teaching an
  surgeon in africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally
  invasive surgery very inspiring  
 but for this examination which is really hard  
 we have a problem  
 even people who say they speak english only fourteen percent pass  
 because for them it 's not a surgery test  it 's an english test  
 let me bring it to you locally i work at the cambridge hospital it 's the primary
  harvard medical school teaching facility  we have more than one hundred translators covering sixty three languages  
 and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital  it 's a big labor intensive effort  
 if you think about the worldwide burden
 of trying to talk to your patients not just teaching surgeons just trying to talk to your patients there aren 't enough translators in the world
 we need to employ technology
 to assist us in this quest 
 at our hospital we see everybody from harvard professors to people who just got here last week  
 and you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can 't talk to  
 and there isn 't always a translator available
  so we need tools we need a universal translator  
 one of the things that i want to leave you with
 as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world  
 it 's really about setting up a dialogue  we have a lot to learn here in the united states we spend more money
 per person for outcomes that are not better than many
  in the world  maybe we have something to learn as well  
 so i 'm passionate about teaching these fls skills all over the world  
 this past year i 've been in latin america  i 've been in china  talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery 
 and everywhere i go
 the barrier is we want this but we need it in our language
  so here 's what we think we want to do imagine giving a lecture
 and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously i want to talk to the people in asia  
 latin america  africa  europe
 seamlessly  accurately
 and in a cost effective fashion using technology  and it has to be
 bi directional they have to be able to teach us something as well it
 's a big task  so we looked for a universal translator i thought there would be one out there your webpage has translation your cellphone has translation  
 but nothing that 's good enough
 to teach
 surgery  because we need a lexicon what is a lexicon a lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain i need to have a health
  care lexicon  and in that i need a surgery lexicon that 's a tall order  we have to work at it 
 so let me show you what we 're doing 
 this is research can 't buy it we 're
 working with the folks at ibm research from the accessibility center to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator  
 it starts with a framework system
  where when the surgeon delivers the lecture
 using a framework of captioning technology  
 we then add another technology to do video conferencing  
 but we don 't have the words yet so we add a third technology  and now we 've got the words and we can apply the special sauce 
 the translation  we get the words up in a window
 and then apply the magic
 work with a fourth technology  and we currently have access to eleven language pairs more to come
 as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place  and i 'd like to show you our prototype
 of stringing all of these technologies that don 't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful narrator 
 fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery
 module five manual skills practice  students may display captions
 in their native language steven schwaitzberg 
 if you 're in latin america  you click the i want it in spanish button
 and out it comes in real time in spanish  but if you happen to be sitting in beijing at the same time by using technology in a constructive fashion
 you could get it in mandarin or you could get it in russian
 on and on and on simultaneously without the use of human translators 
 but that 's the lectures if you remember what i told you about fls at the beginning  it 's knowledge
 and skills the difference in an operation between doing something successfully
 and not may be moving your hand
 this much  so we 're going to take it one step further we 've brought my friend allan back
 orient your loop this way now go ahead and cut  
 very good oscar i 'll see you next week ss so that 's what we 're working on
 in our quest for the universal translator  we want it to be
  we have a need to learn as well as to teach i can think of a million uses for a tool like this 
 as we think about intersecting technologies everybody has a cell phone with a camera
 we could use this everywhere  whether it be health care  patient care  engineering law conferencing  translating videos 
 this is a ubiquitous tool 
 in order to break down our barriers we have to learn to talk to people to demand
 that people work on translation  we need it for our everyday life in order to make the world a smaller place  thank you very much
