  my name is ryan lobo  and i 've been involved in the documentary
 filmmaking business all over the world for the last ten years during the process of making these films
 i found myself taking photographs often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen i found this photography of
  mine almost compulsive and at the end of a shoot  i would sometimes feel that i had photographs that told a better story than
 documentary 
 i felt  when i had my photographs that i was holding on to something true regardless of agendas or politics  
 in two thousand and seven i traveled to three war zones  i traveled to iraq afghanistan and liberia
  and over there i experienced other people 's suffering up close and personal immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories and
 at times i experienced great fear for my own life 
 as always i would return to bangalore and often to animated discussions at friend 's homes where we would discuss various issues
  while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings where a drink often cost more than what they 'd paid their  14 year old maid  
 i would feel very isolated during these discussions  
 but at the same time i questioned myself and my own integrity and purpose in storytelling  and i decided that
 i had compromised just like my friends in those discussions
  where we told stories in contexts we made excuses for rather than taking responsibility for 
 i won 't go into
 details about what led to a decision i made  
 but let 's just say it involved alcohol cigarettes other substances and a woman 
 laughter i basically decided that it was i not the camera or the network or anything that lay outside myself
 that was the only instrument in storytelling truly worth tuning 
 in my life when i tried to achieve things like success or recognition they eluded me  
 paradoxically when i let go of these objectives and worked from a place of compassion and purpose 
 looking for excellence rather than the results of it everything arrived on its own
 photography transcended culture  including my own and it is for me a language which expressed the intangible and gives voice to people and stories without 
 i invite you into three recent stories of mine which are about this way of looking if you will which i believe exemplify the tenets of what i like to call
  in two thousand and seven
 i went to liberia  where a group of my friends and i
 did an independent self funded film still in progress 
 on a very legendary and brutal war lord named general butt naked 
 his real name is joshua and he 's pictured here in a cell where he once used to torture and murder people including children
  joshua claims to have personally killed more than ten thousand people during liberia 's civil war 
 he got his name from fighting stark naked and he is probably the most prolific mass murderer alive on earth today 
 this woman witnessed the general murdering her brother 
 joshua commanded
  to commit unspeakable crimes  and enforced his command with great brutality  
 today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin and they are destitute like these young men in the image 
 how do you live with yourself if you know you 've committed
 horrific crimes  today
 the general is a baptized christian evangelist  and he 's on a mission we accompanied joshua as he walked the earth  visiting villages
  where he had once killed and raped he seeked forgiveness and he claims to endeavor to improve the lives of his child soldiers 
 during this expedition i expected him to be killed outright and us as well  but what i saw opened my eyes to
 an idea of forgiveness which i never thought possible in the midst of incredible poverty and loss people who had nothing
 absolved a man who had
  everything from them 
 he begs for forgiveness and receives it from the same woman whose brother he murdered  
 senegalese the young man seated on the wheelchair here was once a child soldier under the general 's command  
 until he disobeyed orders and the general shot off both his legs 
  he forgives the general in this image he risked his life as he walked up to people whose families he 'd murdered  
 in this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him 
 and joshua remains silent as they vented their rage against him 
 this image to me is almost like from a shakespearean play with a man surrounded by various influences  
 desperate to hold on to something true within himself  in a context of great suffering that he
  created himself  
 i was intensely moved during all this but the question is 
 does forgiveness and redemption replace justice joshua  in his own words says that he does not mind standing trial for his crimes  and speaks about them from soapboxes across monrovia to an audience that often includes his victims 
 a very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of separation of church and state
  the second story i 'm going to tell you about is about a group of very special fighting women with rather unique peace keeping skills 
 liberia has been devastated by one of africa 's bloodiest civil wars which has left more than two hundred thousand people dead  thousands of women scarred by rape and crime on a spectacular scale 
 liberia is now home to an
  united nations contingent of indian peacekeepers 
 these women many from small towns in india help keep the peace far away from home and family 
 they use negotiation and tolerance more often than an armed response the commander told me that a woman could gauge a potentially violent situation much better than men  
 and that they were definitely capable of diffusing it
  this man was very drunk and he was very interested in my camera  until he noticed the women who handled him with smiles and ak 47s at the ready of course 
 this contingent seems to be quite lucky  and it has not sustained any casualties even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in liberia and yes 
 all of those people killed were male  
 many of the women are married with children  and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children
 i accompanied these women on their patrols  and watched as they walked past men many who passed very lewd comments incessantly  
 and when i asked one of the women about the shock and awe response she said don 't worry same thing back home we know how to deal with these fellows and ignored them
  in a country ravaged by violence against women indian peacekeepers have inspired many local women to join the police force
  when the war is over and all the film crews have left the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar  i came back to india and
 nobody was interested in buying the story and one editor told me that she wasn 't interested in doing what she called manual labor stories 
 in two thousand and seven and two thousand and nine i did stories on the delhi fire service the dfs which during the summer is probably the world 's most active
  fire department they answer more than five thousand calls in just two months and all this against incredible logistical odds  like
 heat and traffic jams something amazing happened during this shoot  
 due to a traffic jam we were late in getting to a slum  a large slum which had caught fire  
 as we neared angry crowds attacked our trucks and stoned them by hundreds of people all over the place these men were
  terrified as the mob attacked our vehicle  
 but nonetheless despite the hostility firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire  running the gauntlet through hostile crowds and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury 
 some of the local people forcibly took away the hoses from the firemen to put out the
  hundreds of homes were destroyed  
 but the question that lingered in my mind was what causes people to destroy fire trucks headed to their own homes  
 where does such rage come from and how are we responsible for this
 forty five percent of the fourteen million people who live in delhi live in unauthorized slums  which are chronically
  they lack even the most basic amenities and this is something that is common to all our big cities 
 back to the dfs  a huge chemical depot caught fire  thousands of drums filled with petrochemicals were blazing away and exploding all around us 
 the heat was so intense that hoses were used to cool down firefighters fighting extremely close to the fire  and with no protective clothing 
 in india we often love to complain about our government bodies but over
  here the heads of the dfs mr r c sharman mr a k sharman  led the firefight with their men 
 something wonderful in a country where manual labor is often looked down upon 
 over the years my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested and i 've had very serious doubt about its efficacy and my own faith in humanity
 however a film we shot still airs on the national geographic channel  and when it airs i get calls from all the guys i i was with
 and they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them  
 some of the firemen told me that they were also inspired to do better because they were so pleased to get thank yous rather than brick bats
  the power of storytelling
