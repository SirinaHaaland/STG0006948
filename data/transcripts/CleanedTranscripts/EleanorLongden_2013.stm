  for the first time to go to university was a bright day brimming with hope and optimism
 i 'd done well at school expectations for me were high and i gleefully entered the student life of lectures parties and traffic cone theft
 now appearances of course
  can be deceptive and to an extent this feisty energetic persona of lecture going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer albeit a very well crafted and convincing one
 underneath i was actually deeply unhappy insecure and fundamentally frightened
 frightened of other people of the future of failure and of the emptiness that i felt was within me but i was skilled at hiding it and from the outside appeared to be
  someone with everything to hope for and aspire to this
 fantasy of invulnerability was so complete that i even deceived myself and as the first semester ended and the second began there was no way that anyone could have predicted what was just about to happen
 i was leaving a seminar when it started humming to myself fumbling with my bag just as i 'd done a hundred times before when suddenly i heard a voice
  observe she is leaving the room
 i looked around and there was no one there but the clarity and decisiveness of the comment was unmistakable
 shaken i left my books on the stairs and hurried home and there it was again she is opening the door
 this was the beginning
 the voice had arrived and the voice persisted days and then weeks of it on and on narrating everything i did in
  person she is going to the library she is going to a lecture
 it was neutral impassive and even after a while strangely companionate and reassuring although i did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that
  it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion so for example if i was angry and had to hide it which i often did being very adept at concealing how i really felt
  otherwise it was neither sinister nor disturbing although even at that point it was clear that it had something to communicate to me about my emotions
 particularly emotions which were remote and inaccessible
 now it was then that i made a fatal mistake in that i told a friend about the voice and she was horrified a subtle conditioning process had begun
 the implication that normal people don 't hear voices and the fact that
  did meant that something was very seriously wrong
 such fear and mistrust was infectious suddenly the voice didn 't seem quite so benign anymore
 and when she insisted that i seek medical attention i duly complied and which proved to be mistake number two
 i spent some time telling the college g p about what i perceived to be the real problem anxiety low self worth fears about the future and was met with bored indifference until
 i mentioned the voice upon which he dropped his pen swung round
 and began to question me with a show of real interest and to be fair i was desperate for interest and help and i began to tell him about my strange commentator
 and i always wish at this point the voice had said she is digging her own grave
 i was referred to a psychiatrist who likewise took a grim view of the voice 's presence subsequently interpreting everything i said through a lens of
  latent insanity
 for example i was part of a student tv station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus and during an appointment which was running very late i
 said i 'm sorry doctor i 've got to go i 'm reading the news at six now it 's down on my medical records that eleanor has delusions that she 's a television news broadcaster
 it was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me a hospital admission followed the first of many
  many a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next and then worst of all a toxic tormenting sense
 of hopelessness humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects
 but having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom my fear and resistance towards it intensified
 now essentially this represented taking an aggressive stance towards my own mind a
  kind of psychic civil war and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow progressively hostile and menacing
 helplessly and hopelessly
 i began to retreat into this nightmarish inner world in which the voices were destined to become both my persecutors and my only perceived companions
 they told me for example that if i proved myself worthy of their help then they could change
  life back to how it had been and a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set a kind of labor of hercules it started off quite small for example pull out three strands of hair
 but gradually it grew more extreme culminating in commands to harm myself and a particularly dramatic instruction
 you see that tutor over there you see that glass of water well you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students which i actually did and which needless to say did not endear me
  the faculty
 in effect a vicious cycle of fear avoidance mistrust and misunderstanding had been established
 and this was a battle in which i felt powerless and incapable of establishing any kind of peace or reconciliation
 two years later and the deterioration was dramatic by now i had the whole frenzied repertoire terrifying voices grotesque
  visions bizarre intractable delusions
 my mental health status had been a catalyst for discrimination verbal abuse and physical and sexual assault and i 'd been told by my psychiatrist eleanor
 you 'd be better off with cancer because cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia
 i 'd been diagnosed drugged and discarded and was by now so tormented by the voices that i attempted to drill a
  hole in my head in order to get them out
 now looking back on the wreckage and despair of those years it seems to me now as if someone died in that place
 and yet someone else was saved
 a broken and haunted person began that journey but the person who emerged was a survivor
 and would ultimately grow into the person i was destined to be
 many people have harmed me in my life and i remember them all
 but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with the people who 've helped me
 the fellow survivors the fellow voice hearers the comrades and collaborators
 the mother who never gave up on me who knew that one day i would come back to her and was willing to wait for me for as long as it took
  doctor who only worked with me for a brief time but who reinforced his belief that recovery was not only possible but inevitable
 and during a devastating period of relapse told my terrified family
 don 't give up hope i believe that eleanor can get through this
 sometimes you know it snows as late as may but summer always comes eventually
 fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and
  generous people who fought with me and for me and who waited to welcome me back from that agonized lonely place
 but together they forged a blend of courage creativity integrity and an unshakeable belief that my shattered self could become healed and whole
 i used to say that these people saved me but what i now know is they did something even more important in that they empowered me to save myself and crucially
 they helped me to understand something which i 'd always suspected
 that my voices were a meaningful response to traumatic life events particularly childhood events
 and as such were not my enemies but a source of insight into solvable emotional problems
 now at first this was very difficult to believe not least because the voices appeared so hostile and menacing
 so in this respect a vital first step was learning to separate
  out a metaphorical meaning
 from what i 'd previously interpreted to be a literal truth so for example voices which threatened to attack my home i learned to interpret as my own sense of fear and insecurity in the world rather than an actual objective danger
 now at first i would have believed them i remember for example sitting up one night on guard outside my parents room to protect them from what i thought was a genuine threat from the voices because
 i 'd had such a bad problem with self injury that most of the cutlery in the house had been hidden
 so i ended up arming myself with a plastic fork kind of like picnic ware and sort of sat outside the room clutching it and waiting to spring into action should anything happen it was like don 't mess with me i 've
 got a plastic fork don 't you know
 strategic but a later response and much more useful would be to try and deconstruct the message
  behind the words
 so when the voices warned me not to leave the house then i would thank them for drawing my attention to how unsafe i felt because if i was aware of it then i could do something positive about it but go on to 
  reassure both them and myself that we were safe and didn 't need to feel frightened anymore
  collaboration in which we could learn to work together and support one another
 throughout all of this what i would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself
 and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that i 'd never had an opportunity to process or resolve
 memories of sexual trauma and abuse of anger shame guilt low self worth
 the voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it and
  possibly one of the greatest revelations was when i realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly
 and as such it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care
 it was armed with this knowledge that ultimately i would gather together my shattered self each fragment represented by a different voice
 gradually withdraw from all my medication and return to
  psychiatry only this time from the other side
 ten years after the voice first came i finally graduated this time with the highest degree in psychology the university had ever given
 and one year later the highest masters which shall we say isn 't bad for a madwoman
 in fact one of the voices actually dictated the answers during the exam which technically possibly counts as
  and to be honest sometimes i quite enjoyed their attention as well as oscar wilde has said the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about
 it also makes you very good at eavesdropping because you can listen to two conversations simultaneously so it 's not all bad
 i worked in mental health services i spoke at conferences i published book chapters and academic articles and i argued and continue to do so
  the relevance of the following concept that an important question in psychiatry shouldn 't be what 's wrong with you but rather what 's happened to you
 and all the while i listened to my voices with whom i 'd finally learned to live with peace and respect
 and which in turn reflected a growing sense of compassion acceptance and respect towards myself
 and i remember the most moving and extraordinary moment when supporting another young woman who was terrorized by her voices and becoming fully aware for the very first time that i no
  felt that way myself but was finally able to help someone else who was
 i 'm now very proud to be a part of intervoice the organizational body of the international hearing voices movement
 an initiative inspired by the work of professor marius romme and dr sandra escher which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy
 a sane reaction to insane circumstances
 not as
  an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured but a complex significant and meaningful experience to be explored
 together we envisage and enact a society that understands and respects voice hearing supports the needs of individuals who hear voices
 and which values them as full citizens
 this type of society is not only possible it 's already on its way
 to paraphrase chavez
 once social change begins it cannot be reversed
 you cannot humiliate the person who feels pride you cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore
 for me the achievements of the hearing voices movement are a reminder that empathy fellowship justice and respect are more than words
 they are convictions and beliefs and that beliefs can change the world
  last twenty years the hearing voices movement has established hearing voices networks
 in twenty six countries across five continents
 working together to promote dignity solidarity and empowerment for individuals in mental distress to create a new language and practice of hope
 which at its very center
 lies an unshakable belief in the power of the individual
 as peter
  levine has said the human animal is a unique being endowed with an instinctual capacity to heal
 and the intellectual spirit to harness this innate capacity
 in this respect for members of society there is no greater honor or privilege than facilitating that process of healing for someone
 to bear witness to reach out a hand to share the burden of someone 's suffering and to hold
  the hope for their recovery
 and likewise for survivors of distress and adversity that we remember we don 't have to live our lives forever defined by the damaging things that have happened to us
 we are unique we are irreplaceable what lies within us can never be truly colonized contorted or taken away
 the light never goes out
 as a very wonderful doctor once said to me
  don 't tell me what other people have told you about yourself tell me about you thank
