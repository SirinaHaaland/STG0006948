  for a moment what i need to do is project something on the screen of your imagination 
 we 're in 17th century japan on the west coast  and a little wizened
 monk is hurrying along
  midnight to the crest of a small hill he arrives on the small hill dripping with water 
 he stands there  and he looks across at the island sado  
 and he scans across the ocean and he looks at the sky  
 then he says to himself very quietly
  was a brilliant man he said more with less than any human that i have ever read or talked to 
 basho in seventeen
  driven by a storm now past and captured the almost impossible
 beauty of our home galaxy with
 millions of stars probably hundreds and hundreds of who knows
  maybe even an ocean that we will probably call sylvia in time 
 as he was nearing his death his disciples and followers
 kept asking him what 's the secret how can you
 make haiku poems so beautiful so easily 
 and toward the end he said
  if you would know the pine tree go to the pine tree 
 that was it 
 laughter sylvia has said we must use every capacity we have
 in order to know the oceans  if we would know the
  we must go to the oceans  and what i 'd like to talk to you today about a little bit is
 really transforming
 the relationship or the interplay between humans and oceans
 with a new capability that is not at all routine yet i hope it will be 
 there are a few key points one of them is the oceans are central to the quality of life on earth
  another is that there are bold new ways of studying oceans that we have not used well yet  
 and the last is that these bold new ways that we are exploring as a community
 will transform the way we look at our planet our oceans and eventually how we manage
 probably the entire planet for what it 's worth  
  scientists do when they begin is to start with the system they define what the system is the system isn 't chesapeake bay  
 it 's not the kuril arc  it 's not even the entire pacific it 's the whole planet the entire planet continents and oceans together that 's the system 
 and basically our challenge is to
 optimize the benefits and mitigate the risks of living on a planet
  that 's driven by only two processes 
 two sources of energy one of which is solar that drives the winds the waves  the clouds the storms and photosynthesis 
 the second one is internal energy  and these two war against one another almost continuously  
 mountain ranges plate tectonics moves the continents around
 forms ore deposits volcanoes erupt that 's the planet that we live on 
 it 's immensely complex now i don 't expect all of you to see all the details here but what i want you to see is this is about ten percent
 of the processes that operate within the oceans
 almost continuously and have for the last four billion years  this is a system that 's been around a very long time 
  these have all co evolved what do i mean by that they interact with one another constantly 
 all of them interact with one another so the complexity of this system that we 're looking at the one driven by the sun
 upper portion mostly and the lower portion is partly driven by the input from heat below and by other processes  
 this is very very important because this is the system this is the crucible out of which life on the planet came
  and it 's now time for us to understand it we must understand it 
 that 's one of the themes that sylvia reminds us about understand this ocean of ours this
 basic life support system  the dominant life support system on the planet  
 look at this complexity here  this is only one variable if you can see the complexity you can see
 how tiny little
 eddies
 and large eddies and the motion this is just sea surface temperature  
 but it 's immensely complicated 
 now a layer in the other two or three hundred processes that are all interacting partly as a function of temperature partly as a function of all the other factors  and you 've got a really
 complicated system that 's our challenge is to understand understand this system in new
 and phenomenal ways and there 's an urgency to this part of the urgency comes from the fact that of order 
 a billion people on the planet currently are undernourished or starving  
 and part of the issue
 is
 for cody
 who 's here  sixteen years old and i have permission to relay this number
  when he forty years from now is the age of nancy brown  there are going to be
 another two and a half billion people on the planet 
 we can 't solve all the problems by looking only at the oceans  but if we don 't understand the fundamental life support system of
  much more thoroughly than we do now then the stresses
 that we will face  and that cody will face  and even nancy who 's going to live till she 's ninety eight will have
 really problems
 coping 
 all right let 's talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans  look at this diagram which is showing
 warm waters in red  
  in blue and on the continents what you 're seeing in bright green is the growth of vegetation  
 and in olive green  the dieback of vegetation and in the lower left hand corner there 's a clock ticking away
 from one thousand nine hundred and eighty two to one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and then cycling again 
 what you 'll see is that the rhythms of growth of vegetation a subset of which is food on the continents is directly tied to the rhythms of the sea surface
 control or at least significantly influence correlate with 
 the growth patterns and the drought patterns and the rain patterns on the continents so people in kansas in a wheat field in kansas need to understand
 that the oceans are central to them as well another complexity this is the age of the oceans i 'm going to layer in on top of this
 the tectonic plates
  the age of the ocean the tectonic plates  gives rise to a totally new phenomenon that we have heard about
 in this conference and i
 share with you some very high definition video that we collected in real time  seconds after this video was taken people in
 beijing people in sydney people in amsterdam people in washington d c were watching
 now you 've heard of hydrothermal vents  but the other discovery is that deep below the sea floor  there is vast
 reservoir of microbial activity which we have only just discovered and we have almost no way to study  some people have estimated
 that the
 biomass tied up in these microbes living in the pours and the cracks of the sea floor and below
 rival the total amount of living biomass at the surface of the planet  it 's an astonishing
 insight  and we have only found out about this recently this is very very exciting 
 it may be the next rainforest in terms of pharmaceuticals  we know little or nothing about it 
  marcel proust has this wonderful saying that the real voyage of discovery consists not so much in seeking new territory  
 but possibly in having new sets of eyes new ways of seeing things a new mindset 
 and
 many of you remember the early stages of oceanography  when we had to use what we had at our fingertips  and
 it wasn 't easy it wasn 't easy in those days some of you remember this i 'm sure
  and now we have an entire suite of tools that are really pretty powerful ships satellites moorings  
 but they don 't quite cut it they don 't quite give us what we need 
 and the program that i wanted to talk to you about just a little bit here was funded  and it involves autonomous vehicles
  like the one running across the base of this image 
 modeling on the right hand side there 's a very complex computational model 
 on the left hand side there 's a new type of mooring which i 'll show you in just a second and on the basis of
 several points the oceans are complex and they 're central to the life on earth 
 they are changing rapidly but not predictably and the models that we need to predict the future do not have enough data to refine them the computational power is
  amazing but without data those models will never ever be predicted  and that 's what we really need for a
 variety of reasons they 're dangerous but we feel that ooi this ocean observatory initiative which the national science foundation has
 begun to fund has the potential to really transform things and the goal of the program is to launch an era of scientific discovery and understanding across
  and within the ocean basins  utilizing widely accessible interactive
 telepresence  it 's a new world we will be present throughout the volume of the ocean at will 
 communicating in real time  and this is what the system involves a number of
 sites in the southern hemisphere shown in those circles  and in the northern hemisphere there are four sites i won 't talk a lot about most of them right here but
 the one on the west coast that 's in the box is called the regional scale nodes it was once called neptune 
 and let me show you what 's behind it fiber
 way of communicating you can see the copper tips on these things 
  but the bandwidth is in those tiny little threads smaller than the hair on your head in diameter  and this particular
 set here can transmit something of the order of three to five
 terabits per second  this is phenomenal bandwidth 
 and this is what the planet looks like we are already laced up as if we 're in a fiber optic corset if you like this is what it looks like and the cables go
 really continent to continent
  it 's a very powerful system  and most of our communications consist of it so this is the system that i 'm talking about 
 off the west coast it 's coincident with the tectonic plate the juan de fuca tectonic plate  
 and it 's going to deliver abundant power and unprecedented bandwidth across this entire volume in the overlying ocean on the sea floor and below the sea floor 
 bandwidth and power and a wide variety of processes
  that will be operating 
 this is what one of those primary nodes looks like and it 's like a sub station with power and bandwidth that can spread out over an area the size of seattle 
 and the kind of science that can be done will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved and can bring the instrumentation to the table they will bring it
  in a sense like having time on a telescope except you 'll have your own port climate change ocean acidification dissolved
 oxygen  carbon cycle  coastal upwelling fishing dynamics the full spectrum of
 earth science and ocean science simultaneously in the same volume so anyone coming along later simply accesses the
 the database and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place
  and this is just the first of these 
 in conjunction with our canadian colleagues  we 've set this up now i want to take you into the caldera on the left hand side there is a large
 volcano called axial seamount  
 and we 're going to go down into the axial seamount using animation here 's what this system is going to look like that we are funded to build at this point
 very powerful that 's an elevator
  that 's constantly moving up and down but it can be controlled by the folks on land who are responsible for it 
 or they can transfer control to someone in india or china who can take over for a while because it 's all going to be directly connected through the internet there
 will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore all available to anyone who has any interest in using it this is going to be much more powerful than
  having a single ship in a single location then move to a new location  we 're flying across the
 the caldera floor  
 there is a number of robotic systems there 's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will if those are your experiments
  the kinds of systems that will be down there the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor consist of if you can read them there there 's cameras there 's pressure sensors
  fluorometers  there 's seismometers it 's a full spectrum of tools now that mound right there
 actually looks like this this is what it actually looks like  
 and this is the kind of activity that we can see with high definition video because the bandwidth
 of these cables is so huge that we could have five to ten stereo hd systems running
  continuously and again directed through robotic techniques from land 
 very very powerful  
 and these are the things that we 're funded to do today so what can we actually do tomorrow  we 're about to ride the wave of
 technological opportunity there are emerging technologies throughout
 the field around oceanography  which we will incorporate into
  oceanography and through that convergence we will transform oceanography into something even more magical 
 robotics systems are just incredible these days  
 absolutely incredible and we will be bringing robotics of all sorts into the ocean  
 nanotechnology this is a small generator it 's smaller than a postage stamp and it can generate power just by being attached to your shirt as you move just as
  you move it generates power there are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean  continuously 
 imaging many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than i but stereo imaging at four times the definition that we have in hd will be routine within five years  
 and this is the magic one 
 as a result of the human genome process we are in a situation where events that take place in the
 like an erupting volcano or something of that sort
 can actually be sampled we pump the fluid through one of these systems  
 and we press the button  and it 's analyzed for the genomic character and that 's transmitted back to land immediately so in the volume of the ocean  we will know not just the physics and the chemistry  
 but the base of the food chain will be transparent to us with data
  on a continuous basis 
 grid computing the power of grid computers is going to be just amazing here  we will soon be using grid computing to do pretty much everything like adjust the data and everything
 that goes with the data the power generation will come from the ocean itself  and the next
  generation fiber will be simply magic it 's far beyond what we currently have 
 so the presence of the power and the bandwidth in the environment will allow all of these new technologies to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented so within five to seven years i see us having
 a capacity to be completely present throughout the ocean
 and have all of that connected to the internet  so we can reach
  delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation here 's an example  
 when earthquakes take place massive amounts of these new microbes we 've never seen before come out of the sea floor 
 we have a way of addressing that a new way of addressing that 
 we 've determined from the earthquake activity that you 're seeing here that the top of that volcano is erupting so we deploy the troops
  troops are the autonomous vehicles of course  
 and they fly into the erupting volcano 
 they sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor during an eruption which have the microbes that have never been to the surface of the planet before 
 they eject it to the surface where it floats and it is
 picked up by an autonomous airplane  and it 's brought back
 to the laboratory within twenty four hours of the eruption
 this is doable all the pieces are there 
 a laboratory many of you heard what happened on nine seven 
 some doctors in new york city removed the gallbladder of a woman in france 
 we could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning  and it would be on live tv
  if we have interesting things to show  so we can bring an entirely new telepresence
 to the world
 throughout the ocean this i 've shown you sea floor but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth  
 it 's going to be amazing  and
 as i go here  i just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms and indeed what we can bring into your pocket
 many of you don 't think of this yet but the ocean will be in your pocket  it won 't be long it
 won 't be long  
 so let me leave you then
 with a few words from another poet  if you 'll forgive me 
  he says speaking i think for the human race but certainly for the ted conference and sylvia 
 we shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started
 and know the place for the first time  arrive through the unknown remembered
  gate where the last of earth left to discover is that which was the beginning at the source of the longest river
 the voice of a hidden waterfall not known because not looked for but heard half heard
  in the stillness beneath the waves of the sea
