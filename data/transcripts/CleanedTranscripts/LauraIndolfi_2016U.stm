  by raising your hand how many of you know at least one person on the screen wow
 it 's almost a full house it 's true  they are very famous in their fields and
 do you know what all of them have in common 
 they all died of pancreatic cancer  
 however although it 's very very sad this news it 's also thanks to their personal stories that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be
 it 's become the third cause of cancer deaths and only eight percent of the patients will survive beyond five years  
 that 's a very tiny number  especially if you compare it with breast cancer
  rate is almost ninety percent  
 so it doesn 't really come as a surprise that being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer means facing an almost certain death sentence 
 what 's shocking though is that in the last forty years  this number hasn 't changed a bit while much more progress has been made with other types
  so how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective 
 as a biomedical entrepreneur i like to work on problems that seem impossible  understanding their limitations and trying to find new innovative solutions that can change their outcome 
 the first piece of bad news with pancreatic cancer is that your pancreas is in the middle of your belly  literally it 's depicted in orange on the screen  
 but you can barely see it until i remove all
 the other organs in front 
 it 's also surrounded by many other vital organs like the liver the stomach the bile duct 
 and the ability of the tumor to grow into those organs is the reason why pancreatic cancer is one of the most painful tumor types 
 the hard to reach location also prevents the
  this brings us to the second piece of bad news 
 pancreatic cancer tumors have very few blood vessels
 why should we care about the blood vessel of a tumor  
 let 's think for a second how chemotherapy works the drug is injected in the vein and it navigates throughout the
 until it reaches the tumor site it 's like driving on a highway  trying to reach a destination  
 but what if your destination doesn 't have an exit on the highway you will never get there 
 and that 's exactly the same problem for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer  
 the drugs navigate throughout
  all of your body  they will reach
 healthy organs resulting in high toxic effect for the patients overall  but very little will go to the tumor  
 therefore  the efficacy is very limited 
 to me it seems very counterintuitive to have a whole body treatment to target a specific organ  
 however in the last forty years a lot of money  research and effort have gone towards finding new powerful drugs to
  pancreatic cancer  but nothing has been done in changing the way we deliver them to the patient  
 so after two pieces of bad news  i 'm going to give you good news  hopefully 
 with a collaborator at mit and the massachusetts general hospital in boston  we have revolutionized the way we treat cancer by making localized drug delivery a reality  
 we are basically
 parachuting you on top of your destination  avoiding your having to drive all around the highway  
 we have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one 
 they are flexible enough that they can be
 folded to fit into the catheter  so the doctor can implant it directly on top of the tumor with minimally invasive surgery
  they are solid enough that once they are positioned on top of the tumor they will act as a cage  they will actually physically prevent the tumor from entering other organs controlling the the metastasis the
 devices are also biodegradable that means that once in the body  they start
  delivering the drug only locally slowly
 and more effectively than what is done with the current whole body treatment 
 in pre clinical study we have demonstrated that this localized approach is able to improve by twelve times the response to treatment  
 so we took a drug that is already known and by just delivering it locally where it 's needed the most we allow a response that is twelve times more powerful
  reducing the systemic toxic effect  
 we are working relentlessly to bring this technology to the next level  we are finalizing the pre clinical testing and the animal model required prior to asking the fda for approval for clinical trials  
 currently the majority of patients will die from pancreatic cancer  we are hoping that one day
  we can reduce their pain extend their life and potentially make pancreatic cancer a curable disease 
 by rethinking the way we deliver the drug we don 't only make it more powerful and less toxic  we are also opening the door to finding new innovative solutions
 for almost all other impossible problems in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond  thank you very much
