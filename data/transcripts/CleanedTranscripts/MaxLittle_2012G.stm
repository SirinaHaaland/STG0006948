  i do applied math and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math is that we are like management consultants no one knows what the hell we do  
 so i am going to give you some attempt today to try and explain to you what i do 
 so dancing is one of the most human of activities
  we delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on now ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise
 and a high level of
 of skill  and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it now  
 sadly neurological disorders such as parkinson 's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary
  as it is doing to my friend jan stripling who was
 a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time  
 so great progress and treatment has been made over the years however there are six point three million people worldwide who have the disease 
 and they have to live with incurable weakness tremor  rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease so what we need
 are objective tools
 to detect the disease before it 's too late we need to be able to measure progression objectively
  only way we 're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure  
 but frustratingly with parkinson 's disease and other movement disorders there are no biomarkers so there 's no simple blood test that you can do  
 and the best that we have is like this 20 minute neurologist test you have to go to the clinic to do it it 's very very costly  and that means that outside the clinical trials 
 it 's just never done
  never done  but what if patients could do this test at home now that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic and what if
 patients could do that test themselves right no expensive staff time required takes about $ three hundred  by the way in the neurologist 's clinic to do it  
 so what i want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this because you see in one sense at least we are all virtuosos like my friend jan stripling
  so here we have a video
 of the vibrating vocal folds 
 now this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers 
 because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds  
 and we all actually have the genes for it foxp2 for example and like ballet it takes an extraordinary level of training  i mean
  just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak 
 from the sound we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates 
 and just as the limbs are affected in parkinson 's so too are the vocal organs so on the bottom trace you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor  
 we see all the same symptoms we see vocal tremor  weakness and rigidity the speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while and that 's one of the example symptoms of it  so
  these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle in some cases but with any digital microphone and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning which is very advanced by now  we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies
 on a continuum between health and disease
 using voice signals alone  so these voice based tests how do they stack up against expert clinical tests
  a whole new set of hospitals to do it  and they 're both accurate okay but in addition voice based tests are non expert that means they can be
 take about thirty seconds at most they 're ultra low cost and we all know what happens when something becomes  ultra low cost it becomes massively scalable
 so here are some amazing goals that i think we can deal with now  we can reduce logistical difficulties with
  patients no need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup we can do high frequency monitoring to get objective data 
 we can perform  low cost mass recruitment for clinical trials and we can make population scale screening feasible for the first time we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it 's too late 
 so taking the first steps towards this today we 're launching the parkinson 's voice initiative with aculab and patientslikeme
 're aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet anyone healthy or with parkinson 's can call in 
 cheaply  and leave recordings a few cents each  and i 'm really happy to announce that we 've already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours  thank
  by taking all these samples of let 's say ten thousand people
  you 'll be able to tell who 's healthy and who 's not what are you going to get out of those samples max little yeah yeah so what will happen is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the
  you see some people may not do it they may not get through it but we 'll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances 
 and it 's getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors  and looking for the actual markers of the disease tr so you 're eighty six percent accurate 
  right now ml it 's much better than that actually my student thanasis i have to plug him because he 's done some fantastic work and now he
  be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test  and people with parkinson 's could call in record their voice and then their doctor can check up on their progress see where they 're doing in this course of the disease
