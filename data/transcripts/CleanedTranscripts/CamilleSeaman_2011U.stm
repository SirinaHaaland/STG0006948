  connection is very important to me through my work i 'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature
 and that everything is interconnected i first went to antarctica almost ten years ago where i saw my first
  icebergs i was in awe 
 my heart beat fast my head was dizzy trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me the icebergs around me were almost two hundred feet out of the water  
 and i could only help but wonder
 that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake year after year icebergs are born when they calve
 off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves  
 each iceberg has its own individual personality 
 they have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences  
 some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end  while others can 't take it anymore and crumble
  in a fit of dramatic passion 
 it 's easy to think when you look at an iceberg that they 're isolated that they 're separate and alone  
 much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves  but the reality is far from it 
 as an iceberg melts  i am breathing in its ancient
  fresh water that nourishes many forms of life 
 i approach photographing these icebergs as if i 'm making portraits of my ancestors 
 knowing that in these individual moments
 they exist in that way and will never exist that way again  it is not a death when they melt  it is not an end  but a continuation
 of their path through the cycle of life 
 some of the ice in the icebergs that i photograph is very young a couple thousand years old 
 and some of the ice is over one hundred thousand years old
  the last pictures i 'd like to show you are of an iceberg that i photographed in qeqetarsuaq  greenland 
 it 's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling  
 so here it is you can see on the left
  like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg
 and where it is at the waterline 
 you can see here it begins to roll and the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there this is an an average size greenlandic iceberg it 's about
 one hundred and twenty feet above the water  or forty meters and this video is real time
  and just like that the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality
