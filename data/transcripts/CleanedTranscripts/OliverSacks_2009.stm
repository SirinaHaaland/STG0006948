  we see with the eyes  but we see with the brain as well  and seeing with the brain is often called imagination  
 and we are familiar
 with the landscapes of our own imagination our inscapes we 've lived with them all our lives
 but there are also hallucinations as well  
 and hallucinations are completely different they don 't seem to be of our creation  they don 't seem to be under our control  they seem to come from the outside  
 and to mimic perception  so i am going to be talking
  and a particular sort of visual hallucination which i see among my patients 
 a few months ago i got a phone call
 from a nursing home where i work they told me that one of their residents an old lady in her 90s was seeing things  
 and they wondered if she 'd gone
  because she was an old lady whether she 'd had a stroke or whether she had alzheimer 's and so
 they asked me if i would come and see rosalie  
 the old lady  i went in to see her  it was evident straight away that she was
 perfectly sane and lucid
 and of good intelligence  but she 'd been very
  told me the nurses hadn 't mentioned this
 that she was blind 
 that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years  but now for the last few days she 'd been seeing things  
 so i said what sort of things and she said 
 people in eastern dress in drapes walking up and down stairs
  a man who turns towards me and smiles  but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth animals too 
 i see a white building it 's snowing a soft snow i see this horse with a harness  dragging the snow away 
 then one night  the scene
  i see cats and dogs walking towards me  they come to a certain point and then stop 
 then it changes again  i see a lot of children they are walking up and down stairs  they wear bright colors  rose and blue like eastern dress 
 sometimes she said  before the people come on she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor which seem to go up to the ceiling
  this like a dream and she said no it 's not like a dream it 's like a movie she said it 's got color it 's got motion but it 's completely silent 
 like a silent movie and she said that it 's a rather boring movie  she said all these people
 with eastern dress walking up and down very repetitive very limited
  it was a hallucination  but she was frightened she 'd lived ninety five years and she 'd never had a hallucination before
  she said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was
 thinking or feeling or doing that they seemed to come on by themselves or disappear  she had no control over them
 she said she didn 't recognize any of the people or places in
  hallucinations  and none of the people or the animals well they all seemed oblivious of her  
 and she didn 't know what was going on she wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind  
 well i examined her carefully she was a bright old lady
  perfectly sane she had no medical problems  she wasn 't on any medications which could produce hallucinations
  but she was blind  
 and i then said to her i think i know what you have i said there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness 
 this was originally described i said right back in the  18th century  by
 a man called charles bonnet  and you have charles bonnet syndrome
  nothing wrong with your brain there is nothing wrong with your mind you have charles bonnet syndrome 
 and she was very relieved at this that there was nothing seriously the matter  
 and
 also rather curious  she said who is this charles bonnet she said did he have them himself 
  not crazy i 'm not demented i have charles bonnet syndrome 
 well  so i did tell the nurses now this for me is a common situation  i work in old age homes  largely i see a lot of elderly people
 who are hearing impaired or visually impaired about ten percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations
  and about ten percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations  you don 't have to be completely blind only sufficiently impaired 
 now with the original description in the 18th century charles bonnet did not have them his grandfather
 had these hallucinations his grandfather was a magistrate
  had cataract surgery 
 his vision was pretty poor  
 and in one thousand seven hundred and fifty nine he described to his grandson various things he was seeing 
 the first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair  it was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles  
 and he knew it was a hallucination  you don 't have handkerchiefs in midair  and then he saw a big wheel
 in midair
  but sometimes he wasn 't sure whether he was hallucinating or not 
 because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions 
 so on one occasion when his granddaughters were visiting them he said and who are these handsome young men with you 
 and they said alas grandpapa  there are no handsome young men and then the handsome young men disappeared
 typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash they don 't usually fade in and out they are rather sudden  and they change suddenly 
 charles lullin the grandfather saw hundreds of different figures different landscapes of all sorts on one
  he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe  and realized it was himself that was the only figure he recognized
  on one occasion when he was walking in the streets of paris he saw this was real a scaffolding but when he got back home he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high 
 on his study table this
 repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia
 with him and with rosalie  what seems to be going on and rosalie said what 's going on and i said that as you lose vision as the visual 
  parts of the brain are no longer getting any input  they become hyperactive and excitable  
  the things you see can be very complicated indeed  with another patient of mine who also had some vision
 the vision she had could be disturbing on one occasion she said she
 saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant and he turned around and then he divided into six figures in striped shirts
  who started walking towards her  
 and then the six figures came together again like a concertina  once  when she was driving or rather her husband was driving  the road divided into four
 and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads she had very
 mobile hallucinations as well  
 a lot of them had to do with a car  sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car  
 he was very tenacious
  and he moved rather gracefully when when the car turned and then when they came to a stop the
 boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff one hundred foot in the air  and then disappear 
 another patient of mine
 had a different sort of hallucination this was a woman who didn 't have trouble with her eyes  but the visual parts of her brain a little tumor in the occipital cortex
 and above all she would see cartoons  these cartoons
 would be transparent and would cover half the visual field like a screen and especially she saw cartoons
 of kermit the frog 
  't watch sesame street  but she made a point of saying why kermit she said kermit the frog means nothing to me
  you know i was wondering about freudian determinants  why kermit 
 kermit the frog means nothing to me she didn 't mind the cartoons too much but what did disturb her was she got very persistent
 images or hallucinations of faces and as with rosalie  the faces were often deformed with very
  large teeth or very large eyes and these frightened her  
 well what is going on with these people as a physician i have to try and define what 's going on 
 and to reassure people especially to reassure them that they 're not going insane
 something like ten percent as i said of visually impaired people get these
 but no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them  
 because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something and if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed 
 in particular the notion is that if you see things or hear things you 're going mad but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different 
 psychotic hallucinations whether they are visual or vocal  they address you they accuse you they seduce you they humiliate you they jeer at you
  you interact with them
  there is none of this quality of being addressed with these charles bonnet hallucinations there is a film  you 're seeing a film which has nothing to do with you or that 's how people think about it
  there is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy  and sometimes if one has this one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place 
 in the past you 're at a particular road junction  you smell chestnuts roasting you hear the traffic all the senses are involved 
  of feeling  full of familiarity  located in space and time coherent dramatic 
 the charles bonnet ones are quite different  so in the
 charles bonnet hallucinations  you have all sorts of levels from the geometrical hallucinations the pink and blue squares the woman had up to
 quite elaborate hallucinations with
  figures and especially faces faces and sometimes deformed faces are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations  and one of the second commonest is cartoons  
 so what is going on  fascinatingly in the last few years it 's been possible to do
  on people as they are hallucinating  and in fact to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated
 as they are hallucinating when people have these simple geometrical hallucinations the primary visual cortex is activated this is the part of the brain which perceives edges and
  you don 't form images with your primary visual cortex when images are formed 
 a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe
 and in particular one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus  
 and it 's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus they maybe lose the ability to recognize
  but if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus they may hallucinate faces and this is exactly what you find in some of these people  
 there is an area
 in the anterior part of this gyrus
 where teeth and eyes are represented  and that part of the gyrus is activated
 when people get the the deformed
  there is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons it
 's activated when one recognizes cartoons when one draws cartoons and when one hallucinates them  
 it 's very interesting that that should be specific there
 are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes 
  and seventy it was found that there were not only parts of the brain  but particular cells face cells were discovered around one thousand nine hundred and seventy  
 and now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells which can be very very specific  so you may not only have 
 car cells you may have aston martin cells 
  i saw an aston martin this morning i had to bring it in and now it 's in there somewhere  
 laughter now at this level in what 's called the inferotemporal cortex
 there are only visual images or figments or fragments it 's only at higher levels
 that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion  and in the charles bonnet syndrome
  don 't go to those higher levels you 're in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images 
 or figments or fragmentary figments all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells  
  and one is not conscious of them  it is only if one is visually impaired or blind
 that the process is interrupted  and instead of getting normal perception  you 're getting an anarchic  
 convulsive stimulation or release of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex so suddenly you see a face suddenly you see a car  suddenly this
  this and suddenly that 
 the mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this 
 but not terribly successfully when these were first described it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams  
 but in fact people say i don 't recognize the people i can 't form any
  kermit means nothing to me you don 't get anywhere
 thinking of them as dreams  well  i 've more or less said what i
 wanted  i think i just
 i just want to recapitulate and say this is common think of the number of blind people there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations  but 
  are too scared to mention them  so this sort of thing needs to be brought into
 into notice for patients for doctors for the public finally  i think they are
 infinitely interesting and valuable  for giving one some insight as to how the brain works 
 charles bonnet said two hundred and fifty years ago he wondered how thinking these hallucinations how as he put it the theater of the mind
 could be generated
 by the machinery of the brain now  two hundred and fifty years later  i think we 're beginning to glimpse how this is done  thanks very much
 i was afraid you 'd ask that 
 yeah a lot of them  and actually i 'm a little visually impaired myself i 'm blind in one eye and not terribly good in the other  
 and i i see the geometrical hallucinations  but they stop there ca 
 and they don 't disturb
  well they don 't disturb me any more than my tinnitus  which i ignore  they occasionally interest me and i have many pictures of them
 in my notebooks  i 've gone and had an fmri myself to see how my visual cortex is taking over 
 and when i see all these hexagons and complex things which i also have in visual migraine  i wonder whether
  everyone sees things like this and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit ca 
 that was an utterly utterly fascinating talk thank you so much for sharing
