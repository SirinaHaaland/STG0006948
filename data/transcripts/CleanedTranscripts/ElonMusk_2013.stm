  kind of crazy dream would persuade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all electric car elon
 musk well it goes back to when i was in in university  i thought about what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world
 or the future of humanity
  i think it 's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production that sort of overall sustainable energy problem is is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century  independent of environmental concerns
 in fact  even if producing co2 was good for the environment given that we 're going to run out of hydrocarbons  we need to find some sustainable means of
  electricity comes from burning fossil fuels  how can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help em 
 right
 there 's two elements to that answer one is that  even if you take the same source fuel and and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars you 're still better off  so if you take say natural
  if you burn that in a modern general electric natural gas turbine you 'll get about sixty percent efficiency  
 if you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car you get about twenty percent efficiency  
 and the reason is in the stationary power plant you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more 
 is voluminous  and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source  
  even after you 've taken transmission loss into account and everything even using the same source fuel you 're at least twice as better off charging an electric car then burning it at the power plant ca 
 that scale delivers efficiency em 
 yes  it does and then the other point is  we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway electricity generation so given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation then it makes sense for us to have electric
  as the mode of transport ca so we 've got some video here of of the tesla being assembled which if we could play that that first video
 so what what is innovative about this process in this vehicle em 
 sure  so 
 in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport and i should say that i think actually all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets
  there 's just no way around newton 's third law the
 question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport and in order to do that for cars  you have to come up with a really energy efficient car so that means making it incredibly 
  light and so what you 're seeing here is the only  all aluminum body and chassis car made in north america in fact we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack  
  drag coefficient of any car of its size so
 as a result the energy usage is very low  
 and it has the most advanced battery pack  and that 's what gives it the range that that 's competitive so you can actually have on the order of a 250 mile range ca i mean  those battery packs are incredibly
 heavy but you think the math the math can still work out intelligently by combining light body heavy battery you can still gain spectacular efficiency
  exactly  the rest of the car has to be very light to offset the mass of the pack  and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range and in fact
 customers of the model s are sort of competing with each other to try to get the highest possible range  i think somebody recently got four hundred and twenty miles out of a single charge  ca bruno bowden who 's
  that was the good news the bad news was that to do it he had to drive at eighteen miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops 
 em i mean  you can certainly drive
 if you drive it sixty five miles an hour  under normal conditions 
 two hundred and fifty miles is a reasonable number ca let 's show that second video showing the tesla in action on ice not at all a dig at the new york times
  surprising thing about the experience of driving the car em in creating an electric car  the responsiveness of the car  is really incredible so we wanted really to have people feel as though
 they 've almost got to mind meld with the car so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one and as you as you
 corner and accelerate it just happens like the car has 
  you can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness you can 't do that with a gasoline car
 i think that that 's really a profound difference and people only experience that when they have a test drive ca i mean this is a
 beautiful but expensive car is there a road map where this becomes a 
 the goal of tesla has always been to have a sort of three step process
  where version one was an expensive car at low volume version two is
 medium priced and medium volume  and then version three would be low price high volume so we 're at step two at this point  so we had a $ one hundred thousand sports car which was the roadster then we 've got the model s 
 which starts at around fifty thousand dollars and our third generation car which should hopefully be out in about three or four years
 and so i think we 're making progress in that direction and i feel confident that we 'll get there ca i mean right now if you 've got a short commute you can drive you can get back you can charge it at home
  there isn 't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast do you see that coming really truly or just on a few key routes 
 em there actually are far more charging stations than people realize
 and
 at tesla we developed something called a supercharging technology
 and we 're offering that if you if you buy a model s for free  forever  and so this is something that maybe a lot of people don 't realize
  we actually have california and nevada covered and we 've got the
 eastern seaboard from boston to d c covered by
  be able to drive from l a to new york just using the supercharger network which charges at five times the rate of
 anything else
 and the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop to stop time of about six or seven  so if you drive for three hours  you want to stop for twenty or thirty minutes because that 's normally what people will stop for so if you start
 a trip at nine a m by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat hit the restroom coffee and keep going
  proposition to consumers is for the full charge it could take take an hour  so it 's common don 't expect to be out of here in ten minutes wait for an hour but the good news is you 're helping save the planet and by the way the electricity is free  you don 't pay anything em 
 actually what we 're expecting is  for people to stop for about twenty to thirty minutes not for an hour
  it 's actually better to to drive for
 about maybe one hundred and sixty one hundred and
  seventy miles
 and then stop for half an hour and then keep going that 's the natural cadence of a trip ca all right so
 this is only one string to your energy bow you 've been working on on this solar company solarcity what 's
 unusual about that em well as i mentioned earlier we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption
 i 'm quite confident that the primary means
 of power generation will be solar  i mean it 's really indirect fusion is what it is we
 've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun
  and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization what most people know but don 't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely
  be a frozen ice ball at three degrees kelvin
  and the the sun powers the entire system of precipitation  
 the whole ecosystem is solar powered ca 
 but in a gallon of gasoline you have effectively thousands of years of sun power compressed into a small space so it 's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar and to remotely
  you can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system most people choose to lease
  and the thing about solar power is that it doesn 't have any feed stock or operational costs so once it 's installed 
 it 's just there it works for decades it 'll work for probably a century
  so therefore the key thing to do is to get the cost of that initial installation low  and then get the cost of the financing low 
  because that interest those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar and we 've made huge progress in that direction and that 's why i 'm
 confident we 'll actually beat natural gas ca so your current proposition to consumers is  don 't pay so much up front
  em zero ca pay zero up front  we will install panels on your roof  you will then pay 
 how long is a typical lease 
  as you 're sort of alluding to quite straightforward it 's no money down and your utility your utility bill decreases
 pretty good deal ca so that seems like a win for the consumer no risk  you 'll pay less than you 're paying now for you the dream here then is that
 i mean who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer
  google is one of our big partners here
 and they have an expected return on that capital with that capital solarcity purchases and installs the panel on on the roof and then charges the
 homeowner or business owner a monthly lease
  payment  which is less than the utility bill ca but you yourself get
 a  long term commercial benefit from that power you 're kind of building a new type of distributed utility 
 em exactly what it amounts to is a giant distributed utility 
 i think it 's a good thing because utilities
 have been this monopoly  and people haven 't had any choice so effectively it 's the first time
 there 's been competition
  for this monopoly  because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines but now it 's on your roof so i think it 's actually very empowering for
 homeowners and businesses ca and you really picture a future where a majority of power in america  within a decade or two or within
  least a plurality of power and most likely a majority  and
 i predict it will be a plurality in less than twenty years   i made that bet with someone ca definition of plurality is em more from solar than any other source
  two or three years ago so in roughly eighteen years  
 i think we 'll see more power from solar than any other source ca all right  so let 's go back to another bet that you made with yourself i guess a kind of crazy bet you 'd made some money
 from the sale of paypal  you decided to build a space
  you hear the joke about the guy who made a small fortune in the space industry
  it was a close call things almost didn 't work out  we came very close to failure  but we managed to get through that point in two thousand and eight  the
 goal of spacex is to try to
 advance rocket technology and in particular to try to crack a problem that i think is vital for humanity to become a space faring civilization  which is
  that was a dream of yours in a way from a young age you 've dreamed of mars and beyond 
 em i did build rockets when i was a kid but i didn 't think i 'd be involved in this it was really more from the standpoint of
 what are the things that need to happen in order for
 the future to
  an exciting and inspiring one  and
 i really think there 's a fundamental difference if you sort of look into the future between
 a humanity that is a space faring civilization that 's out there exploring the stars on multiple planets  and i think that 's really exciting 
 compared with with one where we are forever confined to earth until some eventual extinction event ca so you 've somehow slashed the cost of building a rocket by seventy five percent depending on how you calculate it how on earth have you done that
  been doing this for years how have you done this em well we 've made significant advances in the technology of the airframe the engines the electronics
 and the launch operation   there 's a long list of of innovations that that we 've come up with there
 that are a little difficult to communicate in in this talk but
  you think it 's more dangerous to patent than not to patent em since our primary competitors are national governments  the enforceability of patents is questionable ca that 's
 really really interesting
 but the big the big innovation is still ahead and you 're working on it now tell us about this
  ca in fact let 's roll that video and you can you can talk us through it what 's happening here em absolutely  so the thing about rockets is that
 they 're all expendable all rockets that fly today are fully expendable the space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time  and the parts that were reusable took
  nine months to refurbish for flight  so the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight
 obviously that doesn 't work very well for ca what just happened there we just saw something land em 
 that 's right so
 it 's important that the the rocket stages be able to come back to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours
  realize is the cost of the fuel of the propellant is very small it 's much like on a jet  so the cost of the of the propellant is about 3 percent of the cost of the rocket  
 so it 's possible to achieve let 's say roughly 100 fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket
 that 's why it 's so important every mode of transport that we use whether it 's planes trains automobiles
  bikes horses is reusable  but not rockets  
 so we must solve this problem in order to become a space faring civilization ca you asked me the question earlier of how popular
 traveling on cruises would be if you had to burn your ships afterward em certain cruises are apparently highly problematic 
 ca definitely more
  so that 's potentially absolutely disruptive
 technology and i guess paves the way for your dream to actually take at
 some point to take humanity to mars at scale you 'd like to see a colony on mars em 
 yeah exactly spacex or some combination of companies and and governments needs to make progress in the direction of making life multi planetary of establishing
  on another planet on mars being the only realistic option
 and then building that that base up until we 're a true  multi planet species ca so
 progress on this let 's make it reusable how is that going that was just a simulation video we saw how 's it going em 
 we 're actually  we 've been making some good progress recently with something we call the grasshopper test project where we 're testing the vertical landing
 portion of of the flight the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky
 and we 've had some good tests ca can we see that em yeah so that
 's just to give a sense of scale we dressed a cowboy as johnny cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket ca 
 all right let 's see that video then because this is actually amazing when you think about it you 've never seen this before a rocket blasting off and
  's hovering at about forty meters and it 's constantly adjusting the angle  the pitch and yaw of the
  maintaining roll with cold gas thrusters
  projects at scale how on earth has one
 person been able to innovate in this way  what is it about you em 
 i don 't know actually  
 i don 't have a good answer for you i work a lot  i mean
 is that you
 have an ability to think at a system level of design that pulls together design technology and business so if ted was tbd design technology and business into one
 package synthesize it in a way that very few people can and and this is the critical thing feel
  you bet your fortune on it and you seem to have done that multiple times  i mean  almost no one
 can do that is that could we have some of that secret sauce can we put it into our education system can someone learn from you it is truly amazing what you 've done
  of first principles reasoning generally i think there  are what i mean by that is  boil things down to
 their fundamental truths and reason up from there as opposed to reasoning by analogy  
 through most of our life we get through life by reasoning by analogy which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations
  be able to get through the day  but when you want to do something new you have to
 have to apply the physics approach physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive like quantum mechanics it 's really counterintuitive  
 so
 i think i think that 's an important thing to do and then also
 to really pay attention to negative feedback and solicit it particularly from friends this may sound
  like simple advice but
 hardly anyone does that  and it 's incredibly helpful ca boys and girls watching  study physics learn from this man elon
 musk i wish we had all day
