  i wanted to well this morning i want to talk about the future
 of human driven transportation about how we can cut congestion  pollution
 and parking
 by getting more people into
  fewer cars and how we can do it with the technology
 that 's in our pockets and yes i 'm talking about smartphones not  self driving cars but to get started
 we 've got to go back over one hundred years because it turns out there was an uber
 way before uber
  and if it had survived the future of transportation would probably already be here 
 so let me introduce you to the jitney in one thousand nine hundred and fourteen it was created or invented
 by a guy named lp draper  he was a car salesman from la and he had
  he was cruising around downtown los angeles my hometown and he saw trolleys with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go he
 said well why don 't i just put a sign on my car
 that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney that was slang for a nickel  
 and so people jumped on board  and not just in los angeles but across the country
  there were fifty thousand rides per day in seattle forty five thousand rides per day in kansas
 and one hundred and fifty thousand rides per day in los angeles to give you some perspective uber in los angeles
 is doing one hundred and fifty seven thousand rides per day today 
 one hundred years later  
  these are the trolley guys the existing transportation monopoly at the time they were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut  
 and so they got to work
 and they went to cities across the country
 and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney 
 and there were all kinds of regulations there were licenses often they were pricey  in some cities
  jitney driver you were required
 to be in the jitney for sixteen hours a day in other cities they required two jitney drivers for one jitney  
 but there was a really interesting regulation which was
 they had to put a backseat light
 install it in every jitney to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning
  so what happened  well within a year this thing had taken off  
 but the jitney by one thousand nine hundred and nineteen was regulated completely out of existence  
 that 's unfortunate 
 because well when you can 't share a car then you have to own one  and car ownership skyrocketed and it 's no wonder
 that by two thousand and seven there was a car for every man
  woman and child in the united states and that phenomenon had gone global in china by two thousand and eleven 
 there were more car sales happening in china than in the us 
 now all this private ownership of course had a public cost in the us we spend seven billion hours
  sitting in traffic 
 one hundred and sixty billion dollars in lost productivity of course also sitting in traffic and one fifth of all of our carbon footprint
 is spewed out in the air by those cars that we 're sitting in now 
 that 's only four percent of our problem though  because if you have to own a car then that means ninety six percent of the time your car is
  and so up to thirty percent of our land and our space
 is used storing these hunks of steel  
 we even have skyscrapers built for cars that 's the world we live in today  
 now cities have been dealing with this problem for decades it 's called mass transit and even in a city like new york city
  one of the most densely populated in the world and one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world 
 there are still two point five million cars that go over those bridges
 every day  why is that well it 's because mass transit hasn 't yet figured out
 how to get to everybody 's doorstep  and so back in san francisco where i live the situation 's much worse in fact much worse
  world  and so the beginning of uber in two thousand and ten was well we just wanted to push a button and get a ride we didn 't have any grand ambitions 
 but it just turned out that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride  and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides  
 we saw a lot of people pushing the same button
 at the same time going
 essentially to the same place  and so we started thinking about well how do we make those two trips and turn them into one 
 because if we did that ride would
 be a lot cheaper up to fifty percent cheaper
 and of course for the city you 've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars  and so the big question for us was 
  could you have a cheaper ride
 cheap enough that people would be willing to share it 
 and the answer fortunately is a resounding yes  in san francisco  before uberpool 
 we had well everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted 
 and the bright colors is where we have the most cars and once we introduced uberpool 
  you see there 's not as many bright colors 
 more people getting around the city in fewer cars  taking cars off the road  it looks like uberpool is working  
 and so we rolled it out in los angeles
 eight months ago and since then we 've taken seven point nine million miles off the roads
 and we 've taken one point four thousand metric tons of co2 out of the air
  but the part that i 'm really 
 but my favorite statistic
 remember i 'm from la i spent years of my life sitting behind the wheel going how do we fix this my favorite part
 is that eight months later we have added one hundred thousand new people that are carpooling every week
  now in china everything is supersized  
 and so we 're doing fifteen million uberpool trips per month that 's five hundred thousand per day and of course we 're seeing that exponential growth happen in fact we 're seeing it in la too 
 and when i talk to my team we don 't talk about hey well one hundred thousand
  to a million and
 in china  well  that could be several million  
 and so uberpool is a very great solution for urban carpooling  but what about the suburbs 
 this is the street where i grew up in los angeles it 's actually a suburb called northridge california and well look
  those mailboxes they kind of just go on forever  and every morning at about the same time 
 cars roll of out their driveway most of them one person in the car 
 and they go to work they go to their place of work so the question for us is well how do we turn
 all of these commuter cars and literally there 's tens of millions of them how do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars
  well  we have something for this that we recently launched called ubercommute you
 get up in the morning get ready for work get your coffee go to your car
 and you light up the uber app and all of a sudden you become an uber driver  
 and we 'll match you up with one of your neighbors on your way to work
 and it 's a really great thing there 's just one hitch
  it 's called regulation so fifty four cents a mile what is that  well  that is what the us government has determined
 that the cost of owning a car is per mile 
 you can pick up anybody in the united states and take them wherever they want to go at a moment 's notice for fifty four cents a mile or less  
 but if you charge sixty cents a mile
  but what if for sixty cents a mile we could get half a million more people carpooling
 in los angeles  and what if
 at sixty cents a mile we could get fifty million people carpooling in the united states if we could it 's obviously something we should do  
 and so it goes back to the lesson of the
  fifteen this thing was taking off  imagine without the regulations that happened if that thing could just keep going
 how would our cities be different today would we have parks in the place of parking lots 
 well we lost that chance but technology has given us another opportunity  
 now  i 'm as excited as anybody
  but do we have to really wait five ten or even twenty years to make
 our new cities a reality with the technology in our pockets today  and a little smart regulation 
 we can turn every car into a shared car 
 and we can reclaim our cities
 starting today 
  you know
 i mean the company you 've built is absolutely astounding  you only just talked about a small part of it here
 a powerful part the idea of turning cars into public transport like that
  couple other questions because i know they 're out there on people 's minds so first of all last week i think it was
 i switched on my phone and tried to book an uber and i couldn 't find the app
  you had this very radical very bold  brave redesign tk sure ca 
 how did it go did you notice other people not finding the app that day are you going to win people over for this redesign
  first i should probably just say well  what we were trying to accomplish and i think if you know a little bit about our history  
 it makes a lot more sense which is when we first got started 
 it was just black cars  it was literally you push a button and get an s class and so what we did was
 almost what i would call an immature version of a luxury brand that looked like a badge on a luxury car and as we 've gone worldwide and gone from
  auto rickshaws in india 
 it became something that was important for us to be more accessible 
 to be more hyperlocal to be about the cities we were in and that 's what you see with the patterns and colors and to be more iconic because a u doesn 't mean anything in sanskrit 
 and a u doesn 't mean anything in mandarin  
 and so that was a little bit what it was about now when you first roll out something like that i mean
  mean your hands are sweating you 've got you know you 're a little worried 
 what we saw is a lot of people actually at the beginning we saw a lot more people opening the app because they were curious what they would find when they opened it
  and our numbers were slightly up from what we expected
 supporters and investors  who
 have been with you the whole way believe that the only chance of sort of taking on the powerful entrenched interests of taxi industry and so forth is to have someone who is a fierce relentless competitor which you 've certainly proved to be 
 some people feel you 've almost taken that culture too
  you know like a year or two ago there was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset  
 how did it feel like inside the company during that period did you notice a loss of business did you learn anything from that tk 
 well look i think i 've been an entrepreneur since i 've been in high school and
 you have in various different ways an entrepreneur will see hard times and for us it was about a year and a half ago  and for us
  it was hard times too now inside we felt like
 i guess at the end of the day we felt like we were good people doing good work
 but on the outside that wasn 't evident  and so there was a lot that we had to do to sort of
 we 'd gone from a very small company i mean if you go literally two and a half years ago our company was four hundred people
  and today it 's six thousand five hundred 
 and so when you go through that growth you have to sort of cement your cultural values and talk about them all of the time  
 and make sure that people are constantly checking to say are we good people doing good work 
 and if you check those boxes the next part of that is making sure you 're telling your
  i think we learned a lot of lessons but i think at the end of it we came out stronger but it was it was certainly a difficult period ca
 it seems to me everywhere you turn you 're facing people who occasionally give you a hard time some uber drivers in new york and elsewhere are mad as hell now because you changed the fees and they can barely
 they claim barely afford the deal anymore
  you said that you started this originally
 just the coolness of pressing a button and summoning a ride  this thing 's taken off you 're affecting the whole global economy basically at this point you 're being
 forced to be whether you want it or not a kind of global visionary who 's 's changing the world i mean
 who are you do you want that are you ready to go with that and and be what
  there 's a few things packed in that question so
 first is on on the pricing side i mean keep in mind
 when we first started was literally ten or fifteen percent cheaper than our black car product it 's now
 in many cities half the price of a taxi 
 and we have all the data to show that the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers what
  happens is when the price goes down people are more likely to take uber
 at different times of the day than they otherwise would have 
 and they 're more likely to use it in places they wouldn 't have before  and what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off 
 they 're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in 
 and so what that means is
  more trips per hour more minutes of the hour where they 're productive and actually earnings come up 
 and we have cities where we 've done literally five or six price cuts and have seen those price cuts go up over time so even in new york
 we have a blog post we call four septembers compare the earnings september after september after september same month every year 
 and we see the earnings going up over
  as the price comes down and there 's a perfect price point you can 't go down forever  
 and in those places where we bring the price down but we don 't see those earnings pop we bring the prices back up 
 so that addresses that first part and then the enigma and and
 all of this i mean the kind of entrepreneur i am is one that gets really excited about solving hard problems 
 and the way i like to describe it is it 's kind of like a math professor 
 you know if a
  math professor doesn 't have hard problems to solve that 's a really sad math professor
  and so at uber we like the hard problems and we like
 getting excited about those and solving them but we don 't want just any math problem we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find and we want the one that if you solve it
  there 's a little bit of a wow factor ca 
 in a couple years ' time say five years ' time i don 't know when you roll out your incredible  self driving cars  at probably a lower cost than
 you currently pay for an uber ride what do you say to your army of a million drivers plus at that time tk explain that again at which time
 it 's likely going to take a lot longer than i think some of the hype or media might expect  that 's part one part two is it 's going to also take
 there 's going to be a long transition these cars will work in certain places and not in others 
 for us it 's an interesting challenge  right because well
 google 's been investing in this since two thousand and seven tesla 's
  going to be doing it apple 's going to be doing it the manufacturers are going to be doing it this is a world that 's going to exist and for good reason
 a million people die a year in cars  
 and we already looked at the billions or even trillions of hours worldwide that people are spending sitting in them driving frustrated anxious and think about the quality of life that
 improves when you when you give people their time
  time back and it 's not so anxiety ridden so i think there 's a lot of good  
 and so the way we think about it is that it 's a challenge but one for optimistic leadership where instead of resisting
 resisting technology maybe like the taxi industry or the trolley industry
 we have to embrace it or be a part of the future but how do we optimistically lead through it are there ways
  to partner with cities are there ways to have education systems vocational training etc for that transition period  it will take a lot longer than i think we all expect especially that transition period  
 but it is a world that 's going to exist and it is going to be a better world ca 
 travis what you 're building is absolutely incredible and i 'm hugely grateful to you for coming to ted and sharing so openly thank you so much
