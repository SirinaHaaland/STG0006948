  this is going to be a motivational speech because imagine my motivation standing between this strong 
  on twitter feel free to quote me if i say something memorable stupid funny whatever i love seeing my name on twitter  so  hi  i 'm rick  
 i 'm a politician  
 i 'm sorry 
 how many in here have heard of the swedish pirate party before
  show of hands 
 ok that 's practically everybody probably due to the fact that we are sweden 's sweden 's neighbor  i frequently ask how many have heard of any other political party and there 's always just scattered hands in the audience compared to
 this first question which is one half to two thirds this is actually the first time ever that does not match it was
 practically everybody so for those who haven 't heard of us
  the pirate party we love the net  
 we love copying and sharing  and we love civil liberties 
 for that some people call us pirates  
 probably in an attempt to make us bow our heads and feel shame that didn 't work very well  we decided to stand tall about it instead 
 and so in two thousand and six i founded a new political party  
 i led it for its first five years
 the european elections the last european elections we became the largest party
 and the the most coveted youth demographic sub 30 and what 's interesting is we did that on less than one percent
 of the competition 's budget  we had a campaign budget total of fifty thousand euros they had six million between them
  beat them 
 that gave us a cost efficiency advantage of over two orders of magnitude  
 and i 'm gonna share the secret recipe of how we did that 
 we developed swarm methodologies
  and they can be applied to any business or social cause  
 well  almost any there 's a small asterisk by the end  and i 'll get to that in just a minute 
 but applying these and we 've done this dozens of times we know that this works  
 we 've put two people in the european parliament  we have forty five people in various german state parliaments we 're in the
  czech senate many many many more local councils and as said we 've spread to seventy countries  and that 's not bad for a political movement that hasn 't even been around for a decade
 so today we 're going to talk a bit about
 how people are motivated to be part of change to be part of something bigger than
  how you can channel this into an organization that harnesses this great power
 of wanting to make the world a better place  
 and in the end  come out a little on the better when
 i speak to businesspeople  i frequently make them very upset
 when i contradict them and say that no your employees
 are not your most valuable asset your most valuable asset
 is the thousands of people who want to work for you for free and you don 't let them 
 they get very upset about that 
 a swarm is a congregation of tens of thousands of volunteers that have chosen
  of their own will to converge on a common goal there 's this futurama quote 
 when push comes to shove  you gotta do what you love
 even if it 's not a good idea i mean  seriously what kind of idiot thinks they can change the world
  this kind of idiot apparently  but it works  
 what you need to do is to put a stake in the ground you need to announce your goal just say i want to accomplish this 
 i 'm going to do this 
 and it doesn 't need to be very costly my announcement was just two lines in a chat channel
  hey look the pirate party has its website up now after new year 's and the address that was all the advertising i ever did the next time i had several hundred activists
 wanting to work with us 
 when you provide such a focus point a swarm intelligence emerges  when people can rally to a
  and that 's what gives you this
 two orders of magnitude of cost efficiency 
 it 's a huge advantage you 're running circles around all the legacy organizations 
 and there are four goals that need to be fulfilled
 in your goal in order for this to work these four criteria
 are that your goal must
  let 's take a look at them it needs to be tangible a lot of people say well you know  we should make the world a better place or 
 yeah  we should all feel good now 
 not going to work  you need a binary are we there yet  or are
  not there yet it needs to be credible somebody seeing the project plan that you 're posting
 needs to see that yes this project plan will take us from where we are to where we want to be 
 you need to break it down into subgoals that each by themselves are seen as doable  and when you add the subgoals together 
 we 've gone to where we want it
 needs to be
 and this is where it gets exciting in terms of working
  anybody who sees this project plan needs to immediately say i want to do this
 and there 's my spot and they will be able to jump right into the project and start working on it
 without asking anybody 's permission  and that is exactly what 'll happen 
 and last but not least it needs to be epic  it needs to energize people it needs
  electrify people shoot for the moon 
 on second thought don 't shoot for the moon  we 've already been there shoot for mars 
 in contrast  you will never be able to get a volunteer swarm forming
  electrify people go to mars 
 a lot of people kind of balk at the obstacles we 're going to climb a huge mountain so how do you motivate people to do that well it turns out that obstacles are not the problem 
 not knowing the obstacles is the
  if you know how high the mountain is you know exactly what it takes to scale it we know exactly how far away mars is and what it takes to get there 
 if you can plan it like a project
 you can plan what resources you need and you can execute it exactly like a project let 's see we 're going to mars  we need two dozen volunteer rocket scientists one dozen volunteer 
  some crazy dude who will mix rocket fuel in his backyard
 and so on 
 when you can list the resources you know what you need to get there when you know what you need to get there 
 you can go there 
 and the next thing is to encourage this development of a swarm intelligence which is where the cost efficiency comes in
  there 's a ted talk
 on motivation that debunks that we work for money  
 and it presents science on how we 're really motivated by three things in terms of larger creative tasks when we work for something bigger than ourselves 
 we work for
 autonomy  mastery and purpose we 've covered purpose already as in working for something bigger
  credible inclusive and epic so where 
 that motivation talk ends
 what it doesn 't answer is how do you build an organization
 that harnesses this motivational power 
 and this is where working swarmwise comes in this is where swarm intelligence comes in turns out that there are three factors that you optimize for
  and each of these are in complete opposite to what you learn at a business school 
 but it works  we know it works  we have people in many many parliaments to prove it 
 those three factors are speed  trust and scalability 
  we optimize for speed by cutting bottlenecks out of the loop  cutting them out of the decision loop  that means cutting yourself out of the decision loop  
 which can be hard  
 but you 've got to communicate your vision so passionately so strongly that everybody knows what the goal is
 and can find something some step that takes the movement just a little closer to that goal  and when tens of thousands
  of people do that on a weekly basis  you become an unstoppable force  we had a three person rule
 in our organization saying that if three self identified volunteers in the movement were in agreement that something was good for the movement
 they had the green light from the highest office to go ahead and act in the name of the
  including spending resources when you talk about this kind of empowerment to
 to traditional businesspeople  they think you belong in a zoo  
 but you know what i led this organization for five years there were fifty thousand
 registered members and many many more anonymous activists  it was not abused once 
 everybody had the key to the treasure chest  it was not abused one
 single time turns out when you give people the keys to the castle and look them in the eye and say i trust you 
 they step up to the plate  and that 's a beautiful thing to see happen  
 obviously not everything went according to plan but that 's a different thing we made mistakes  we should expect mistakes if you 're pioneering something that means you must
 by definition venture into the unknown  when you 're trying the unknown  some things won 't go as planned that 's part of the definition of venturing into the unknown 
 to find the great you must allow mistakes to happen  so you must communicate that we expect some things to go wrong to create a
  for iteration speed  
 meaning that we try  we fail  we try again we fail faster we fail better we try again we fail better again  
 maybe after we 've tried fifteen times we 've mastered some some specific subject so you want to minimize the time it takes to try those fifteen times 
 we optimize on trust we encourage
  you need to communicate your vision so strongly so that everybody can translate it into their own context
 because language is an incredibly strong
  advantage of working swarmwise 
 this leads to a lot of different approaches tried in parallel in different social groups who try out different methods of working toward the goal  
 some of them will work
 but in order to find the great ones  you need this diversity  and you need to communicate that we need that diversity  if somebody on this
  side does not understand what those guys are doing  that 's ok because we all trust each other to work for the better of the movement and
 it 's ok that i don 't understand their social context i 'm not expected to i understand my social context i contribute with something i know 
 make people aware of this diversity  finally scalability get feet
  in business school they teach you to use a lean organization forget that 
 just scale up the organization from the get go start with ten thousand empty boxes and an org chart covering
 down to every minor city  when you have lots and lots of small responsibilities in such a scaffolding
 that supports the swarm supports the activists you 'll find that
  boxes in the org charts are getting filled in
 quite rapidly and they start to get filled in beyond your horizon with people you 've never heard of 
 and so this swarm keeps growing keeps growing
 to tens of thousands of people each taking on something something small with very very decentralized mandate to act on the organization
  and this is when a swarm intelligence emerges  
 this is when you have this beehive logic where everybody knows what 's to be done everybody is taking their own small steps towards it 
 so the swarm starts to starts to act as a coherent organism  and it 's amazing to watch  this
 is when you 're awarded by the
  of magnitude two orders of magnitude  this is not just a silver bullet 
 so we 've been talking a lot about the big picture today you can use these swarm methods for a lot of stuff do you want to change the world 
 do you want to bring clean water to a billion people teach three billion people to read  maybe you 're into social change you want to introduce
 unconditional basic income or
 maybe you want to take humanity to mars  you can do this using these methods 
 you can do this it 's about leadership it 's about deciding what you want to do and telling it to the world 
 because no matter
 whether you
 think you can or cannot change the world no matter whether you think you can or cannot change the world
  you are probably right  
 so one question i want everybody here to ask themselves today
 is the observation that change doesn 't just happen  somebody makes it happen
 do you want to be that person 
 do you want to be that person  
 and then one
  one last thing 
 there 's one component more that 's required to work swarmwise that i haven 't mentioned yet  and that is fun
 this goes beyond just enjoying your job  this goes beyond having a pinball machine in the
  this is required to succeed to get
 that cost efficiency advantage of two orders of magnitude for the reason that you need to attract volunteers 
 and people in this aspect are rather predictable 
 people will go to other people who are having fun 
 in contrast
  they will walk an extra mile to avoid people who are not having fun 
 so 
 having fun is more than just having a pinball machine in the office  it 's an absolute and
 unavoidable requirement
 for organizational and operational success when you 're working
  so in summary
 a recipe for a swarm organization
 using these motivational methods to a huge competitive advantage 
 your goal  it needs to be tangible  credible  inclusive and epic
  your organization needs to be optimized
 for speed trust and scalability  
 you need to enjoy yourselves  and that will reward you with two orders of magnitude of cost efficiency advantage thank you
