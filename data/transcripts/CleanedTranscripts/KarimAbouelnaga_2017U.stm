  getting a college education is a 
  investment when you 're growing up poor you 're not accustomed to thinking that far ahead instead you 're thinking about where you 're going to get your next meal
 and how your family is going to pay rent that month besides
 my parents and my friends ' parents seemed to be doing just fine driving taxis and working as janitors it wasn 't until i was a teenager when i realized
 i didn 't want to do those things by then i was two thirds of the way through my education and it was almost too late to turn things around 
 when you grow up poor you want to be rich  i was no different i 'm the
 second oldest of seven and was raised by a single mother on government aid in queens new york 
 by virtue of growing up low income my siblings and i went to some of new york city 's most struggling public schools 
 i had over sixty absences when i was in seventh grade  
 because i didn 't feel like going to class 
 my high school had a
  percent graduation rate and even worse  only twenty percent of the kids graduating were college ready 
 when i actually did make it to college  i told my friend brennan how our teachers would always ask us to
 raise our hands if we were going to college  
 i was taken aback when brennan said karim  i 've never been asked that question before 
 it was always what college are you going to just the way that question is phrased made it unacceptable for him
  not to have gone to college  nowadays i get asked a different question how were you able to make it out for years
 i said i was lucky  
 but it 's not just luck when my older brother and i graduated from high school at the very same time and he later dropped out of a two year college
  i wanted to understand why he dropped out
 and i kept studying 
 it wasn 't until i got to cornell as a presidential research scholar that i started to learn about the very real educational consequences of being raised by a single mother on government aid
 and attending the schools that i did that 's when my older brother 's trajectory began to make complete sense to me  
 i also learned that our most admirable education reformers people like arne duncan the former us secretary of education
 or wendy kopp the founder of teach for america had never attended an inner city public school like i had 
 so much of our education reform is driven by a sympathetic approach  where people are saying let 's go and help these poor inner city kids or these poor black and latino kids 
 instead of an empathetic approach  
 where someone like me who had grown up in this environment could say i know the adversities that you 're facing
 and i want to help you overcome them today when i get questions about how i made it out  i share that one of the biggest reasons
 is that i wasn 't ashamed to ask for help 
 in a typical middle class or affluent household if a kid is struggling  there 's a good chance that a parent or a teacher will come to their rescue
 even if they don 't ask for help  however if that same kid is growing up poor and doesn 't ask
  for help  there 's a good chance that no one will help them there are virtually no social safety nets available 
 so seven years ago  i started to reform our public education system shaped by my firsthand perspective 
 and i started with summer school 
 research tells us
  of the achievement gap  which is the disparity in educational attainment between rich kids and poor kids or black kids and white kids  
 could be directly attributed to the summer learning loss
 in low income neighborhoods kids forget almost three months of what they learned during the school year over the summer 
 they return to school in the fall and their teachers spend another two months reteaching them old material that 's five months
  the school year in the united states is only ten months if kids lose five months of learning every single year that 's half of their education half 
 if kids were in school over the summer then they couldn 't regress  but traditional summer school is poorly designed 
 for kids it feels like punishment and for teachers it feels like babysitting 
 but how can we expect principals to execute an effective summer program when the school year ends the last week of june
 and then summer school starts
  just one week later 
 there just isn 't enough time to find the right people sort out the logistics and design an engaging curriculum that excites kids and teachers 
 but what if we created a program
 over the summer that empowered teachers as teaching coaches to develop
  role models as teaching fellows
 to help kids realize their college ambitions  what if empowered high achieving kids as mentors
 to tutor their younger peers
 and inspire them to invest in their education 
 what if we empowered all kids as scholars 
 asked them what colleges they were going to designed a summer school they want to attend
 to completely eliminate the summer learning loss and close two thirds of the achievement gap  
 by this summer my team will have served over four thousand low income children  trained over three hundred aspiring teachers
 and created more than one thousand seasonal jobs across some of new york city 's most disadvantaged neighborhoods
  our kids are succeeding two years of independent evaluations tell us that our kids eliminate the summer learning loss and make growth of one month in math
 and two months in reading  so instead of returning to school in the fall three months behind they now go back four months ahead in math
 and five months ahead in reading
 ten years ago if you would have told me that i 'd graduate in the top ten percent of my class from an ivy league institution
 and have an opportunity to make a dent on our public education system just by tackling two months of the calendar year  i would have said 
  what 's even more exciting is that if we can prevent five months of lost time just by redesigning two months  
 imagine the possibilities that we can unlock by tackling the rest of the calendar year  
 thank you
