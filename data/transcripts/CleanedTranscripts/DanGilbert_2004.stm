  to speak two million years seems like a really long time  but evolutionarily two million years is nothing and yet in two million years the human brain has nearly
  pound brain of our ancestor here habilis to the almost three pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears  what is it
 about a big brain that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one  
 well it turns out when brains triple in size they don 't just get three times bigger  they gain new structures  
 and one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part called the
  lobe particularly a part called the pre frontal cortex what
 does a  pre frontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time it turns out the  pre frontal cortex does lots of things but one of the most important things it does
 is an experience
  pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don 't make real mistakes in planes 
 human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life this is a trick that none of our 
  ancestors could do and that no other animal can do quite like we can it 's a marvelous adaptation it 's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees
  and into the shopping mall 
 laughter all of you have done this  ben and jerry 's doesn 't have  liver and onion ice cream  and it 's not because they whipped some up tried it and went yuck it 's because 
 without leaving your armchair you can simulate that flavor and say yuck before you make
  let 's see how your experience simulators are working let 's just run a quick diagnostic before i proceed with the rest of the talk here 's two different futures that i invite you to contemplate 
 you can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer one of them is winning the lottery this is about three hundred and fourteen million dollars  and the other is becoming paraplegic
  just give it a moment of thought  you probably don 't feel like you need a moment of thought  
 interestingly there are data on these two groups of people data on how happy they are and this is exactly what you expected isn 't it  
 but these aren 't the data  i made these up these are the data  
 you failed the pop quiz and you 're hardly five minutes into the lecture  because the fact is
 that a year after losing the use of their legs and a year after winning the lotto
  lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives 
 don 't feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time 
 the research that my laboratory has been doing that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing has revealed something really quite startling to us
  something we call the impact bias which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly 
 for the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are from field studies to laboratory studies we see that 
  winning or losing an election gaining or losing a romantic partner getting or not getting a promotion passing or not passing a college test on and on 
  almost floors me a recent study showing how
 major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago with only a few exceptions  it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness
  i am the happiest man alive  i have that in me that can convert poverty to riches adversity to prosperity  i am more invulnerable than achilles fortune
  hath not one place to hit me what kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head well  it turns out it 's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have
 human beings have something that we might think of as a psychological immune system a system of cognitive processes largely non conscious cognitive processes 
 that help them change their views of the world so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves 
 we synthesize happiness  but we think happiness is a thing to be found now  you don 't need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing 
  happiness i suspect though i 'm going to show you some experimental evidence  you don 't have to look very far for evidence i took a copy of the new york times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness
  one minute 's regret it was a glorious experience i believe it turned out for the best who are these characters who are so damn happy 
 the first one is jim wright some of you are old enough to remember he was the chairman of the house of representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young republican named newt gingrich found 
  out about a shady book deal he had done  he lost everything the most powerful democrat in the country lost everything he lost his money he lost his power
 what does he have to say all these years later i am so much better off physically financially mentally and in almost every other way what other way would there be to be better off vegetably minerally  animally  
 he 's pretty much covered them there 
 moreese bickham is somebody you 've never heard of moreese bickham uttered these words upon being released he was
  a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience  harry s langerman uttered these words
  and he 's somebody you might have known but didn 't because in one thousand nine hundred and forty nine he read a little article in the paper about
 a hamburger stand owned by two brothers named mcdonalds and he thought that 's a really neat idea so he went to find them  they said we can give you a franchise on this for three thousand bucks harry went back to 
  new york asked his brother an investment banker to loan him the $ three thousand and his brother 's immortal words were you idiot nobody eats hamburgers he wouldn 't lend him the money and of course six months later ray kroc had exactly the same idea  it turns out people do eat hamburgers
  and ray kroc for a while became the richest man in america 
 and then finally  some of you recognize this young photo of pete best who was the original drummer for the beatles  until they you know sent him out on an errand and snuck 
  away and picked up ringo on a tour  well in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four when pete best was interviewed yes he 's still a drummer
  he 's a studio musician he had this to say i 'm happier than i would have been with the beatles okay 
 there 's something important to be learned from these people and it is the secret of happiness  here it is finally to be revealed 
 first accrue wealth power and prestige then lose it 
 second spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can third make somebody else
  because when people synthesize happiness as these gentlemen seem to have done we all smile at them but we kind of roll our eyes and say yeah right you never really wanted 
  the job oh yeah right you really didn 't have that much in common with her and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your
  we smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality as what we might call natural happiness what are these terms 
 natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don 't get what we wanted 
 and in our society we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind why do we have that
  it 's very simple  what kind of economic engine would keep churning
 if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it  
 with all apologies to my friend matthieu ricard 
 a shopping mall full of zen monks is not going to be particularly profitable because they don 't want stuff enough 
 i want to suggest
  to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring
 as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for i 'm
 a scientist so i 'm going to do this not with rhetoric but by marinating you in a little bit of data  let me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used to demonstrate
 the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks and this
  and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked in this case because this experiment uses them these are monet prints 
 so everybody can rank these monet prints from the one they like the most to the one they like the least  now we give you a choice 
 we happen to have some extra prints in the closet we 're going to give you one as your prize to take home  we happen to have number three and number four we tell the subject this
 is a bit of a difficult choice
  because neither one is preferred strongly to the other but naturally people tend to pick number three because they liked it a little better than number four  
 sometime later it could be fifteen minutes it could be fifteen days the same stimuli are put before the subject and the subject is asked to re rank the stimuli tell us how much you like them now 
 what happens
  watch as happiness is synthesized this is the result that has been replicated over and over again  you 're watching happiness be synthesized would you like to see it again 
 happiness the one i got is really better than i thought that other one i didn 't get sucks 
 that 's the synthesis of happiness now 
 what 's the right response to that yeah right 
 now here 's the experiment we did and i hope this is going to convince you that yeah right was not the right response
 we did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia these are hospitalized patients most of them have korsakoff 's syndrome a polyneuritic psychosis 
 they drank way too much and they can 't make new memories ok they remember their childhood  but if you walk in and introduce yourself and then leave the room when you come back
  they don 't know who you are we took our monet prints to the hospital and we asked these
 patients to rank them from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least 
 we then gave them the choice between number three and number four like everybody else they said gee thanks doc that 's great i could use a new print i 'll take number three 
 we explained we would have number
  you don 't remember i was just here with the monet prints sorry doc i just don 't have a clue no problem jim 
 all i want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one
  you like the least what do they do well let 's first check and make sure they 're really amnesiac  
 we ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own which one they chose last time which one is theirs and what we find is amnesiac patients 
  just guess these are normal controls where if i did this with you all of you would know which print you chose  but if i do this with amnesiac patients they don 't have a clue
  they can 't pick their print out of a lineup 
 here 's what normal controls do they synthesize happiness right this is the change in liking score the change from the first time they ranked to the second time 
  they ranked normal controls show that was the magic i showed you now i 'm showing it to you in graphical form 
 amnesiacs do exactly the same thing think about this result these people like better the one they own  but they don 't know they own it 
 yeah right is not the right response what these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really
  not just saying it because they own it because they don 't know they own it  
 when psychologists show you bars  
 you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people 
 and yet all of us have this psychological immune system this capacity to synthesize happiness  but some of us do this trick better than others  and some situations allow anybody
  to do it more effectively than other situations do it turns out
 that freedom  the ability to make up your mind and change your mind 
 is the friend of natural happiness because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most
  but freedom to choose to change and make up your mind is the enemy of synthetic happiness and i 'm going to show you why  dilbert already knows of course dogbert 's tech 
  support how may i abuse you my printer prints a blank page after every document why complain about getting free paper free aren 't you just giving me my own paper look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same 
  people accept the things they cannot change indeed the psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck when we are trapped this
 is the difference between dating and marriage you go out on a date with a guy and he picks his nose you don 't go out on another date you 're married to a guy and he picks his nose he
 has a heart of gold don 't touch the fruitcake  you find a way
 to be happy with what
  now what i want to show you is that people don 't know this about themselves and not knowing this can work to our
 supreme disadvantage here 's an experiment we did at harvard we created 
  a black and white photography course and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom so we gave them cameras they went around campus they took twelve
 pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their
 their dog and all the other things they wanted to have harvard memories of 
 they bring us the camera we make up a contact sheet  they figure out which are the two best pictures and we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms and they blow two of them up and they have two gorgeous eight by 10 glossies of meaningful things to them and we say which one would you like to give up 
 i have to give one up yes we need one as evidence of the class project so you have to give me one you have to make a choice you get to
  keep one and i get to keep one now there are two conditions in this experiment in one case the students are told 
 but you know if you want to change your mind i 'll always have the other one here and in the next four days before i actually mail it to headquarters 
 headquarters i 'll be glad to swap it out with you in fact i 'll come to your dorm room just give me an email better yet
 check with you 
 you ever want to change your mind it 's totally returnable 
 the other half of the students are told exactly the opposite 
 make your choice  and by the way the mail is going out gosh in two minutes to england your picture will be winging its way over the atlantic you will never see it again  
 half of the students in each of these conditions are asked to make predictions about how much they 're going to come to like
 the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind
 other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms and they are measured over the next three to six days on their liking satisfaction with the pictures and look at what we find first of all here 's what students think is going to happen 
 they think they 're going to maybe come to like the picture they chose
 a little more than the one they left behind  but these are not statistically significant differences it 's a very small increase
 and it doesn 't much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition 
 bad simulators because here 's what 's really happening both right before the swap and five days later people who are stuck with that picture who have no choice who can never change their mind 
 like it a lot  
  i gotten the right one maybe this isn 't the good one maybe i left the good one have killed themselves they don 't like their picture and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired they still don 't like
 their picture  why  because the [ reversible ] condition is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness  
 so here 's the final piece of this experiment we bring in a whole new group of
 naive harvard students and we say
  you know we 're doing a photography course and we can do it one of two ways 
 we could do it so that when you take the two pictures you 'd have four days to change your mind or
 we 're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it which course would you like to be in 
 duh sixty six percent of the students 
  to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind hello
 sixty six percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture  
 because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness
 grows the bard said everything best of course  and he 's making my point here but he 's making it
  tis nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so 
 it 's nice poetry but that can 't exactly be right is there really nothing good or bad is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to paris are just the same thing
 that seems like a 
 they can 't be exactly the same in more turgid prose but closer to the truth was the father of modern capitalism adam smith and he said this this is worth contemplating
 the great source of both the misery and disorders of human life
 seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another some of these situations may no doubt deserve to be preferred to others  
 but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor
 which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice
 or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly 
 or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice in other words  yes some things are better than others  we should have preferences that lead us into one future over
  but when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures we are at
 risk when our ambition is bounded  
 it leads us to work joyfully when our ambition is unbounded it leads us to lie to cheat to steal to hurt others to sacrifice things of real value when our fears are bounded  
 we 're prudent  we 're cautious  we 're thoughtful when our fears are unbounded
  and overblown  we 're reckless  and we 're cowardly 
 the lesson i want to leave you with from these data 
 is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience
