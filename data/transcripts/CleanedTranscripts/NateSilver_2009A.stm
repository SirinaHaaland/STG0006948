  the election for the first time in the united states a predominantly white
 group of voters voted for an african american candidate for president and in fact barack obama did quite well he won three hundred and seventy five electoral
  and he won about seventy million
 popular votes more than any other presidential candidate of any race of any party in history if you compare how obama did against how john kerry had done four years earlier
 democrats really like seeing this transition here where almost every state becomes bluer becomes more democratic even states obama lost like out west those states became more blue in the south in the northeast
  almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions
 here and there 
 one exception is in massachusetts that was john kerry 's home state no big surprise obama couldn 't do better than kerry there or in arizona which is john mccain 's home 
 obama didn 't have much improvement but there is also this part of the country kind of in the middle region here this kind of arkansas
 tennessee oklahoma west virginia region now if you look at ' ninety six bill clinton the last democrat to actually win how he did in
  you see real big differences in this part of the country right here the kind of appalachians ozarks highlands region as i call it twenty or thirty point swings from how bill clinton did in ' ninety six
  to how obama did in two thousand and eight yes bill clinton was from arkansas but these are very very profound differences 
 but yeah what 's the matter with arkansas 
 and when we think of arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations we think of a bunch of
 rednecks quote unquote with guns and we think people like this probably don 't want to vote
 for people who look like this and are named barack obama we think it 's a matter of race and is this fair are we
 kind of stigmatizing people from arkansas and this part of the country and the answer is it is at least partially fair  we know that race was a factor and the reason why we know that is because
 we asked those people actually we didn 't ask them but when they conducted exit polls
 in every state in thirty seven states out of the fifty they asked a question that was pretty direct about race they asked this question 
 in deciding your vote for president today was the race of the candidate a factor  we 're looking for people that said yes race was a factor moreover it was an important factor
 and people who voted for john mccain as a result of that factor maybe in combination with other factors and maybe alone we 're looking for this behavior among white voters or really
 non black voters  
 so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question in louisiana about one in five white voters said yes one of the big reasons why i voted against barack obama is because he was an
 if those people had voted for obama even half of them obama would have won louisiana safely same is true with i think all of these states you see on the top of the list meanwhile  california 
 new york we can say oh we 're enlightened but you know certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted i suppose manifestation of racially based voting 
  said yes barack obama 's race was a problem for me you see 
 comparing the map to ' ninety six you see an overlap here this really seems to explain why barack obama did worse in this one part of the country so we have to ask why is racism 
  predictable in some way is there something driving this is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in
  or are there more systematic factors at work and so we can look at a bunch of different variables 
 these are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time things like income and religion education which of these seem to drive
 this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on november 4th 
 and there are a couple of these that that have strong predictive relationships one of which is
  where you see the states
 with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red  and you see this part of the country the kind of appalachians region is less educated it 's just a fact and you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns 
 the other variable that 's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in 
 states that are more rural even to some extent of the states like new hampshire and maine they
  voting against barack obama so it 's the combination of these two things it 's education and the type of neighbors that you have which we 'll talk about more in a moment and the thing about states like arkansas and tennessee is that they 're both very rural and they are educationally impoverished  
 so yes racism is predictable these things among maybe other variables but these things seem to predict it we 're going to drill
  bit more now into something called the general social survey this is conducted by the university of chicago every other year  and they ask a series of really interesting questions in two thousand they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes
 one simple question they asked is does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood 
 we can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different in cites about eighty percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race but in rural communities only about
  thirty percent probably because if you live on a farm you might not have a lot of neighbors period but nevertheless you 're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you so what we 're going to do now
 is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors or really some neighbor of another race and people who have only white neighbors 
 and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes not a lot of difference this was
  eight years ago some people were more republican back then but you see democrats versus republican not a big difference based on who your neighbors are and even some questions about race for example affirmative action which is kind of a political question a policy question about race if you will
 not much difference here affirmative action is not very popular frankly with white voters period but people with black neighbors and people
  neighborhoods feel no differently about it really 
 but if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will 
 do you favor a law banning interracial marriage there is a big difference people who don 't have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial 
  marriage as people who do just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you and likewise they asked not in two thousand but in the same survey
  you see people without neighbors who are african american who were much more likely to say that would give me a problem so it 's really not even about urban versus rural it 's about who you live with racism is predictable and it 's predicted by
 interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you people of other races so if you want to address it the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of
  have a couple of very obvious i suppose ideas for maybe how to do that 
 i 'm a big fan of cities especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups i think cities
 facilitate more of the kind of networking the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis but also not everyone wants to live in a city certainly not a city like new york so we can think more about things like 
 street grids this is the neighborhood where i grew up in east lansing michigan it 's a traditional midwestern community which means you have real
  grid you have real neighborhoods and real trees and real streets you can walk on and you interact a lot with your neighbors people you like people you might not know
  and as a result it 's a very tolerant community which is different i think than something like this which is in schaumburg illinois where every little set of houses has their own 
  starbucks and stuff
 i think that actually this type of urban design which became more prevalent in the 
  1980s i think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under ronald reagan  but also here is another idea we have
 is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from new york abroad but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from nyu 
 have them go study for a
  university of arkansas and vice versa do it at the high school level  
 literally there are people who might be in school in arkansas or tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from
 another part of the country or of another racial group i think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do
 get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise
