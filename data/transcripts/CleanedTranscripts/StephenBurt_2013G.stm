  all the time and write about it frequently and take poems apart to see how they work because i 'm a word person i understand the world
 best most fully in words rather than say pictures or numbers and when i have a new experience or a new
  feeling i 'm a little frustrated until i can try to put it into words i think i 've always been that way i devoured science fiction as a child i still do  
  and i found poems by andrew marvell and matthew arnold and emily dickinson and william butler yeats because they were quoted in science fiction and i loved their sounds and i went on
  all that other technical stuff that you care about if you already care about poems because poems already made me happier and sadder 
  and more alive and i became a poetry critic because i wanted to know how and why 
  programming serve one purpose the greek word poem it just means a made thing and poetry is a set of techniques ways of making patterns 
  that put emotions into words the more techniques you know the more things you can make and the more patterns you can recognize in things you might already like or love
  that said poetry does seem to be especially good at certain things for example 
 we are all going to die 
 poetry can help us live with that poems are made of words nothing but words  the particulars in poems are like the
  the personalities that distinguish people from one another poems are easy to share easy to pass on and when you read a poem you can imagine someone 's speaking to you or for you  
 maybe even someone far away or someone made up or someone deceased 
 that 's why
 we can go to poems when we want to remember
 something or someone to celebrate or to look beyond death or to say goodbye  
 and that 's one reason poems can seem important 
 even to people who aren 't me who don 't so much live in a world of words  
 the poet frank o 'hara said if you don 't need poetry bully for you 
 but he also said when he didn 't want to be alive anymore the thought that he wouldn 't write any more poems had stopped him
  poetry helps me want to be alive and i want to show you why by showing you how 
 how a couple of poems react to the fact that we 're alive in one place at one time in one culture and in another we won 't be alive at all 
 so here 's one of the first
 poems i memorized it could address a child
 or an adult
  from far from eve and morning from yon 
  sky  the stuff of life to knit me blew hither here am i 
 now for a breath i tarry nor yet disperse apart take my hand quick and tell me what have you in your heart  speak
  and i will answer how shall i help you say  ere to the wind 's twelve quarters i take my endless way [ a e housman ]
 now this poem has appealed to science fiction writers it 's furnished at least three science fiction titles  i think because it says 
  poems can brings us news from the future or the past or across the world 
  poems can bring people together temporarily  which i think is true  and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes but for how it rhymes cleanly 
  and simply on the two and four say and way with anticipatory hints on the one and three answer and quarters as if the poem itself were coming
  plays up the fact that we die by exaggerating the speed of our lives a few years on earth become
 one speech one breath it
 's a poem about loneliness the i in the poem feels no connection will last and it might look like a plea for help ' til you get to the word help 
 where this i facing you taking your hand is more like a teacher or a genie or at least that 's what he wants to believe 
  had written the poem that he wanted to hear  
 now this next poem really changed what i liked and what i read and what i felt i could read as an adult it might not make any sense to you if you haven 't seen it before 
 the garden 
  coral from lipstick ads in the fifty 's fruit of the tree of such knowledge
 to smack  meaning kiss or hit  it appears in the guise of outworn usages because we are bad
  big masculine threat insinuating and slangy [ rae armantrout ]
  i found this poem in an anthology of almost equally confusing poems in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine i just heard that there were these scandalous writers called language poets who didn 't make any sense and i wanted to go and 
 see for myself what they were like and some of them didn 't do much for me but this writer rae armantrout did an awful lot  and i kept reading her until i felt i knew what was going on 
  sex as we know it and death and guilt come into the world at the same time it 's also about how appearances deceive how our culture can sweep us along into doing and 
  saying things we didn 't intend or don 't like and armantrout 's style is trying to help us stop or slow down
  as in domestic abuse because
 sexual attraction can seem threatening  
 the red that means fertility can also mean poison oleander is poisonous and outworn usages like smack for kiss or hit can help 
  us see how our unacknowledged assumptions can make us believe we are bad either because sex is sinful or because we
  tolerate so much sexism we let guys tell women what to do 
 the poem reacts to old lipstick ads and its edginess about statement its reversals and halts have everything to do with resisting the language of ads that want to tell 
  us so easily what to want what to do what to think that resistance is a lot of the point of the poem  which shows me armantrout shows me what it 's like to hear grave
  threats and mortal dishonesty in the language of everyday life and once she 's done that i think she can show other people women and men 
 what it 's like to feel that way and say to other people women and men who feel so alienated or so threatened that they 're not alone  
 now 
 how do i know that i 'm right
 about this somewhat confusing poem well in this
  case i emailed the poet a draft of my talk and she said yeah  yeah that 's about it yeah 
 but usually you can 't know you never know you can 't be sure  
 and that 's okay all we can do we is listen to poems and and look at poems and guess and see if they can bring us what we need and
 if you 're wrong about some part of a poem  nothing bad will happen
  now  this next poem is older than armantrout 's but a little younger than a e housman 's 
 the brave man 
 the sun  that brave man comes through boughs that lie in wait  that brave man  
 green and gloomy eyes in dark forms of the grass run away  the good stars
 pale helms and spiky spurs run away  fears of my bed fears of life and fears of death run away  
 that brave man comes up from below and walks without meditation  that brave man [ wallace stevens ]
 now the sun in this poem in wallace stevens ' poem seems so
  the person in the poem is so afraid the sun comes up in the morning through branches dispels the dew the eyes on the grass and defeats stars envisioned 
 as armies brave has its old sense of showy as well as its modern sense courage this sun is not afraid to show his face 
  is the reveal stevens saves for that fourth stanza where run away has become a refrain this person might want to run away too but fortified by the sun 's example he might just rise 
 stevens saves that sonically odd word meditation for the end  
 unlike the sun human beings think we meditate on past and future
  life and death above and below and it can make us afraid 
 poems the patterns in poems show us not just what somebody thought or what someone did or what happened but
 what it was like to be a person like that to be so anxious so lonely so inquisitive 
 so goofy so preposterous
  so brave  
 that 's why poems can seem at once so durable so personal and so ephemeral like something inside and outside you at once 
 the scottish poet denise riley compares poetry to a needle a sliver of outside i cradle inside and the american poet terrance hayes wrote six poems called wind in a box one of them asks
  me what am i going to do when i 'm dead 
 and the answer is that he 'll stay with us or won 't stay with us inside us as wind as air as words  
 it is easier than ever to find poems that might stay inside you that might stay with you from long long ago or from right this minute from far away or from right close to where you live  almost no matter
  where you live 
 poems can help you say help you show how you 're feeling but they can also introduce you to feelings ways of being in the world people very much unlike you maybe even
 people
 from long long ago  some poems even tell you that that is what they can do 
 that 's what john keats is
  doing
 in his most mysterious perhaps poem  
 it 's mysterious because it 's probably unfinished he probably left it unfinished  
 and because it might be meant for a character in a play but it might just be keats ' thinking about what his own writing his
  at least i hear  mortality  and i hear the power of older
 poetic techniques  and i have the feeling you might have the feeling of meeting even for an instant almost becoming someone else from long ago someone quite memorable 
 this living hand now warm and capable of earnest grasping would if it were cold and in the icy silence of the tomb so haunt thy days and
  chill thy dreaming nights that thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood so in my veins red life might stream again and thou be 
 see here it is i hold it towards you
