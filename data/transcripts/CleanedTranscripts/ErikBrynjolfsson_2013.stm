  let 's start the story one hundred and twenty years ago when american factories began to electrify their operations  igniting the
  the amazing thing is that productivity did not increase in those factories for thirty years  
 thirty years that 's long enough for a generation of managers to retire 
 you see the first wave of managers simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors  
 but they didn 't redesign the factories to take advantage of electricity 's flexibility 
 it fell to the next generation to invent new work processes  and then productivity soared
  soared  often doubling or even tripling in those factories 
 electricity is an example of a general purpose technology like the steam engine before it 
 general purpose technologies drive most economic growth  because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations  like lightbulbs and yes  factory redesign 
 is there a general purpose technology of our era
  sure  it 's the computer  
 but technology alone is not enough technology is not destiny  
 we shape our destiny  
 and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to redesign their factories we 're going to need to reinvent our organizations and even our whole economic system 
 we 're not doing as well at that job as we should be as we 'll see in a moment productivity is
  actually doing all right  but it has become decoupled from jobs  and the income of the typical worker
 is stagnating these troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed
 as the end of innovation but they are actually the growing pains of what andrew mcafee and
 i call
 the new machine age 
 let 's look at some data  
 so here 's gdp per person in america 
 there 's some bumps along the way  but the big story is you could practically fit a ruler to it 
 this is a log scale so what looks like steady growth is actually an acceleration in real terms  and here 's productivity 
 you can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid 
  but it matches up pretty well with the second industrial revolution when factories were learning how to electrify their operations  after a lag productivity accelerated again 
 so maybe history doesn 't repeat itself  but sometimes it rhymes 
 today productivity is at an all time high  and despite the great recession  it grew faster in the  2000s than it did in the
  growing faster than it did during the second industrial revolution  and that 's just the united states  the global news
 is even better worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate in the past decade than ever in history  
 if anything all these numbers actually understate our progress  because
 the new machine age is more about knowledge creation than just physical production it 's mind
  not matter brain not brawn ideas not things 
 that creates a problem for standard metrics because we 're getting more and more stuff for free 
 like wikipedia  google skype  and if they post it on the web even this ted talk now getting stuff for free is a good thing right  sure of
  that 's not how economists measure gdp zero price
 means zero weight in the gdp statistics 
 according to the numbers the music industry is half the size that it was ten years ago  
 but i 'm listening to more and better music than ever you know i bet you are too 
 in total my research estimates that the gdp numbers miss over three hundred billion dollars per year in free goods and
  services on the internet 
 now let 's look to the future there are some super smart people who are arguing that we 've reached the end of growth  
 but
 to understand the future of growth  we need to make predictions about the underlying drivers of
  i 'm optimistic  because the new machine age is digital  exponential
 and combinatorial  when goods are digital they can be replicated with perfect quality
 at nearly zero cost  and they can be delivered
 almost instantaneously  welcome to the economics of abundance  
 but there 's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world measurement
 is the lifeblood of science
 and progress in the age of big data  we can measure the world in ways we never could before  
 secondly the new machine age is exponential 
 computers get better faster than anything else ever a child 's playstation
  but our brains are wired for a linear world as a result exponential trends take us by surprise 
 i used to teach my students that there are some things you know computers just aren 't good at like driving a car through traffic 
 that 's right  here 's andy and me grinning like madmen because we just rode down route one hundred and one in yes a driverless car
 thirdly the new machine age is combinatorial  the stagnationist view is that ideas get used up like low hanging fruit  
 but the reality
 is that each innovation creates building blocks for even more innovations  here 's an example 
 in just a matter of a few weeks an undergraduate student of mine built an app that ultimately reached one point three million users
  users 
 he was able to do that so easily because he built it on top of facebook  and facebook was built on top of the web  and that was built on top of the internet and so on and so forth 
 now individually digital  
 exponential and combinatorial would each be game changers put them together  and we 're seeing a wave of astonishing
  like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound you know
 robots are even revolutionizing cat transportation 
 laughter but perhaps the most important invention the most important invention
 is
 machine learning  
 consider one project ibm 's watson these little dots here those are all the champions on the quiz show
  jeopardy at first watson wasn 't very good  
 but it improved at a rate faster than any human could and shortly after dave ferrucci showed this chart to my class at mit watson beat the world jeopardy champion 
 at age seven  watson is still kind of in its
  its teachers let it surf the internet
 unsupervised the next day it started answering questions with profanities  
 damn 
 but you know watson is growing up fast it 's being tested for jobs in call centers  and it 's getting them  
 it 's applying for legal banking and medical jobs  and getting some of them  
 isn 't it ironic that at the very moment we are building intelligent
  machines perhaps the most important invention in human history some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating  
 like the first two industrial revolutions  
 the full implications of the new machine age are going to take at least a century to fully play out  
 but they are staggering  
 so does that mean we have nothing to worry about 
 no technology is
  not destiny  
 productivity is at an all time high  but fewer people now have jobs  
 we have created more wealth in the past decade than ever  but for a majority of americans their income has fallen  
 this is the great decoupling
 of productivity from employment of
  not surprising that millions of people have become disillusioned by the great decoupling but like too many others they misunderstand its basic causes 
 technology is racing ahead  but it 's leaving more and more people
 behind today  we can take a routine job codify it in a set of machine readable instructions
  and then replicate it a million times you know
 i recently overheard a conversation that epitomizes these new economics 
 this guy says 
 nah  i don 't use h & r block anymore turbotax does everything that my tax preparer did but it 's faster  cheaper and more accurate 
 how can a skilled worker compete with a $ thirty nine piece of software she can 't 
  millions of americans do have faster  cheaper more accurate tax preparation  and the founders of intuit have done very well for themselves  
 but seventeen percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs 
 that is a microcosm of what 's happening not just in software and services 
 but in media and music in finance and manufacturing in retailing and trade in short 
 in every industry 
 people are racing against the
  machine  and many of them are losing that race what can we do to create shared prosperity  
 the answer is not to try to slow down technology 
 instead of racing against the machine we need to learn to race with the machine that is our grand challenge 
 the new machine age
 can be dated to a day fifteen years
  ago when garry kasparov the world chess champion  played deep blue a supercomputer 
 the machine won that day  and today a chess program running on a cell phone can beat a human grandmaster  
 it got so bad that when he was asked what strategy he would use against a
  but today a computer is no longer the world chess champion  
 neither is a human because kasparov organized a freestyle tournament
 where teams of humans and computers could work together  and the winning team had no grandmaster  and it had no supercomputer
 what they had
 was better teamwork  and they showed
 that a team of humans and computers working together could beat any computer
 or any human working alone racing with the machine
 beats racing against the machine  technology is not destiny  we shape our destiny
