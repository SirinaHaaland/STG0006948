  were displaced by natural disasters in two thousand and ten now there was nothing particularly special about two thousand
  and a half million people are displaced by natural disasters every single year 
 now usually when people hear statistics or stats like that you start thinking about places like haiti or other kind of exotic or maybe even impoverished areas  
 but it happens right here in the united states every single year  
 last year alone ninety nine federally declared disasters were on file with fema 
 from joplin
  and tuscaloosa alabama 
 to the central texas wildfires that just happened recently  now how does the most powerful country in the world handle these displaced people 
 they cram them onto cots put all your personal belongings in a plastic garbage bag stick it underneath  and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena or a gymnasium  
 so obviously there 's a massive housing gap  and this really upset me  because academia tells you after a major disaster there 's
  typically about an 18 month time frame
 to we kinda recover start the recovery process but what most people don 't realize is that on average it takes forty five to sixty days or more for the infamous fema trailers to even begin to show up 
 before that time people are left to their own devices  
 so i became obsessed
 with trying to figure out a way to actually fill this gap this actually became my creative obsession
  i put aside all my freelance work after hours and started just focusing particularly on this problem  
 so i started sketching two days after katrina i started sketching and sketching and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this and
 as things started to congeal or ideas started to form i started sketching digitally on the computer  
 but it was an obsession  so i couldn 't just stop there  i started experimenting making models
  talking to experts in the field taking their
 feedback and refining and i kept on refining and refining for nights and weekends for over five years now my obsession ended up driving me to create
 full size prototypes in my own backyard and actually spending my own personal savings on everything from tooling to patents and
 a variety of other costs  but in the end i ended up with this modular housing system that can
  react to any situation or disaster it can be put up in any environment from an asphalt parking lot
 to pastures or fields  because it doesn 't require any special setup or specialty tools 
 now at the foundation and kind of the core of this whole system is the exo housing unit  which is just the individual shelter module and though it 's light light enough that you can actually lift it by hand and move it around  and it actually sleeps
  four people 
 and you can arrange these things as kind of more for encampments and more of a city grid type layout or you can circle the wagons essentially and form these circular pods out of them  which give you this 
  communal area for people to actually spill out into so they 're not actually trapped inside these units 
 now this fundamentally changes the way we respond to disasters because gone
  are the horrid conditions inside a sports arena or a gymnasium where people are crammed on these cots inside now we have instant neighborhoods outside  
 so the exo is designed to be simply  basically like a coffee cup they can actually stack together
 so we get extremely efficient transportation
  and storage out of them in fact fifteen exos can fit on a
 single semi truck by itself this means the exo can actually be transported and set up faster than any other housing option available today  
 but i 'm obsessive so i couldn 't just stop there so i actually started modifying the bunks where you could actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving so the same unit can now be used for an office or storage location 
 the doors can actually swap out so you can actually put on a
  rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control or a connector module that would allow you to actually connect multiple units together  which gives you larger and kind of compartmentalized 
 living spaces so now this same kit of parts this same unit can actually serve as a living room
  like a great idea but how do you make it real so the first idea i had initially was just to go the federal and state governments and go here take it for free 
 but i was quickly told that boy our government doesn 't really work like that okay okay 
 so maybe i would start a nonprofit to kind of help consult and get this idea going
  our government looks
 to private sector for things like this 
 okay  so maybe i would take this whole idea and go to private corporations that would have this mutually shared benefit to it  but i was quickly told by some corporations
 that my personal passion project was not a brand fit
 because they didn 't want their logos stamped across the ghettos of haiti  now i wasn 't just
  my day job sent me to work out of our milan office for a few months  
 so i was like what will i do  so i actually scheduled sleep on my calendar and spent the 8 hour time difference on conference calls with material suppliers manufacturers and potential customers
  and we found through this whole process we found this great little manufacturer in virginia  
 and if his body language is any indication that 's the owner of what it 's like for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer you 've got to
 see what happens here but g s industries was fantastic they actually built three prototypes for us by hand 
  so now we have prototypes that can show that four people can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably than a tent could ever provide  
 and they actually shipped them here to texas for us now a funny thing started happening other people started to believe in what we were doing and actually offered us
 hangar space donated hangar space to us and then the georgetown airport authority was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed  so now we had a hangar
  hangar space to work in and prototypes to demo with
