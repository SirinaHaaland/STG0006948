  of the five senses vision is the one that i appreciate the most and it 's the one that i can least take for granted  
 i think this is partially due to my father who was blind it was a fact that he didn 't make much of a fuss about usually one time in nova scotia when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun
  one as in the carly simon song which
 may or may not refer to james taylor  warren beatty or mick jagger we 're not really sure they handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes 
 but dad got really scared he didn 't want us doing that he wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers so that there was no chance at
  that our eyes would be damaged 
 i thought this was a little strange at the time what i didn 't know at the time was that my father had actually been born with perfect eyesight  
 when he and his sister martha were just very little their mom took them out to see a total eclipse or actually a solar eclipse
 and not long after that both of them started losing their eyesight  decades later it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of
  as near as we can tell it had nothing whatsoever to do with that solar eclipse but by then my grandmother had already gone to her grave thinking it was her fault 
 so dad graduated harvard in one thousand nine hundred and forty six married my mom and bought a house in lexington massachusetts  
 where the first shots were fired against the british in one thousand seven hundred and seventy five although we didn 't actually hit any of them until concord 
 he got a job working for raytheon designing guidance systems  which was part of the route one
  axis in those days so the equivalent of silicon valley in the ' 70s 
 dad wasn 't a real militaristic kind of guy he just felt bad that he wasn 't able to fight in world war ii on account of his handicap  although they did let him get through the 
 army physical exam before they got to the very last test which was for vision 
 so dad started racking up all of
  these patents and gaining a reputation as a blind genius rocket scientist inventor but to us he was just dad and our home life was pretty normal 
 as a kid i watched a lot of television and had lots of nerdy hobbies like mineralogy and microbiology and the space program and a little bit of politics i played a lot of chess  but at the age of fourteen a friend got me interested in comic books and i decided that was what i wanted to do for a living
  so here 's my dad he 's a scientist  he 's an engineer
 and he 's a military contractor so 
 he has four kids right  one grows up to become a computer scientist one grows up to join the navy 
 one grows up to become an engineer and then there 's me 
 the comic book artist 
  makes me the opposite of dean kamen because i 'm a comic book artist son of an inventor and he 's an inventor son of a comic book artist right it 's true 
 the funny thing is dad had a lot of faith in me he had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist even though he had no direct evidence that i was any good whatsoever everything he saw was 
  just a blur now this gives a real meaning to the term blind faith which doesn 't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people
 now faith in things which cannot be seen which cannot be proved is not the sort of faith that i 've ever really related to all that much i tend to like science  where what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know  
 but there 's a middle ground too a middle ground tread by people like poor old charles babbage and his steam driven computers that were never built
  really understood what it was that he had in mind except for ada lovelace  
 and he went to his grave trying to pursue that dream  
 vannevar bush with his memex this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips he had this vision  
 and i think a lot of people in his day probably thought he was a bit of a kook and yeah  we can
  that 's not the point he understood the shape of the future 
 so did j c r licklider and his notions for computer human interaction same thing he understood the shape of the future even though
 it was something that would only be
 implemented by people much later  or paul baran and his vision for packet switching hardly anybody listened to him in his day 
 or even the people who actually pulled it off the people at bolt beranek
  and newman in boston who
 just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network and sketching things on the back of napkins and and on note papers and arguing over dinner at howard johnson 
  's on route one hundred and twenty eight in lexington massachusetts just two miles from where i was studying the queen 's gambit deferred and listening to gladys knight & the pips singing midnight train
  in my dad 's big easy chair you know  so three types of vision right 
 vision based on what one cannot see  the vision of that unseen and unknowable  
 the vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained and this third kind a vision of something which
 can be  which may be based on knowledge
 but is as yet unproven 
 now we 've seen a lot of examples of people who are pursuing that sort of vision in science  but i think it 's also true in the arts  it 's true in politics it 's even true in personal endeavors 
 what it comes down to really is four basic principles learn from everyone  
 follow no one 
 watch for patterns  and work like hell i think these are the four principles that go into this and it 's that third one 
  where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves 
 what 's interesting is that this particular way of looking at the world is i think only one of four different ways that manifest themselves in different fields of endeavor in comics  i know 
 that it results in sort of a formalist attitude towards trying to understand how it works 
 authenticity of human experience and honesty and rawness these are four very different ways of looking at the world i even gave them names the classicist the animist the formalist and iconoclast 
 interestingly they seem to correspond more or less to jung 's four subdivisions of human thought 
 and they reflect a dichotomy of art and delight on left and the right  tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom  
 and if you go on the diagonal you get content and form and then beauty
  and truth  and it probably applies just as much to music and movies and fine art which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all
  or for that matter nothing to do with our conference theme of inspired by nature 
 except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives a ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him but
  stings him anyway and they both die but not before the frog asks him why and the scorpion says because it 's my nature in that sense yes  
 so this was my nature  the thing was i saw that the route i took to discovering
 this focus in my in my work and who i was
 i saw it as as just this this road to discovery actually it was just
  embracing my nature which means that i didn 't actually fall that far from the tree after all  
 so what does a scientific mind do in the arts 
 i started making comics  but i also started trying to understand them almost immediately one of the most important things about comics that i discovered was that comics are a visual medium but they try to embrace all of the senses within it
  the different elements of comics like pictures and words and the different symbols and everything in between that comics presents are all funneled through the single conduit a vision 
 so we have things like resemblance  where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted in a couple of different directions abstracted from resemblance  but still retaining the complete meaning 
 or abstracted away from both resemblance and meaning towards the picture plane  put all these three together and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography
  comics can embrace  and if you move to the right you also get language because that 's abstracting even further from resemblance but still maintaining meaning 
 vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage as well 
 also to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals
 there 's also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics  
 comics is a kind of call and response in which the artist gives you something to see within the panels  and then gives you something to imagine between the panels 
 also another sense which comics ' vision represents and that 's time sequence is a very important aspect of comics
  presents a kind of temporal map  and this temporal map was something that energizes modern comics  but i was wondering if perhaps it also energizes
 other sorts of forms and i found some in history
 you can see this same principle operating in these ancient versions of the same idea what 's happening is an art form is colliding with a given technology  whether it 's paint on stone like the tomb of menna the scribe
  in ancient egypt or a bas relief sculpture rising up a stone column or a 200 foot long embroidery or painted deerskin and tree bark running across 
 what 's interesting is once you hit print and this is from one thousand four hundred and fifty by the way all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves rectilinear panel arrangements simple line drawings without tone and a
 within one hundred years you already start to see word balloons and captions  and it 's really just a hop skip and a jump from here to here  
 so i wrote a book about this in ' ninety three but as i was finishing the book i had to do a little bit of typesetting and i was tired of going to my local copy shop to do it so i bought a computer  
 and it was just a little thing it wasn 't good for much
 except text entry but my father had told me about moore 's law
 back in the
 70s and i knew what was coming  
 and so 
 i kept my eyes peeled to see if the sort of changes that happened when we went from pre print comics to print comics would happen when we went beyond to post print comics 
 so one of the first things proposed was that we could mix the visuals of comics with the sound motion and interactivity of the
  being made in those days this was even before the web  
 and one of the first things they did was they tried to take the comics page as is and transplant it to monitors 
 which was a classic mcluhanesque mistake of appropriating the shape of the previous technology as the content of the new technology 
 and so what they would do is have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages and they would introduce all this sound and motion 
 the problem was that if you go with this basic idea that space equals time in comics what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion which are
  temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time they break with that continuity of presentation 
 interactivity was another thing there were hypertext comics but the thing about hypertext is that everything in hypertext is either here not here or connected to here it 's profoundly nonspatial the distance from abraham 
  lincoln to a lincoln penny to penny marshall to the marshall plan to plan nine to nine lives it 's all the same
 laughter but in comics in comics
  every aspect of the work every element of the work has a spatial relationship to every other element at all times  so the question was was there any way to preserve that spatial relationship while still taking advantage of all of the things that digital had to offer us  
 and i found my personal answer for this in those ancient comics that i was showing you each of them has a single unbroken
  reading line  whether it 's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right or even going in a backwards zigzag across those 
  the same thing is happening that is that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time is being carried out without any compromise but there were compromises when print hit 
 adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments  so the basic idea of comics was being
  broken again and again and again and again and i thought ok well 
 if that 's true is there any way when we go beyond today 's print to somehow bring that back 
 now  the monitor
 is just as limited as the page technically right it 's a different shape but other than that it 's the same basic limitation 
 but that 's only if you look at the monitor as a page  
 but not if you look at the
  monitor as a window  and that 's what i propose that perhaps we could create these comics on an infinite canvas  along the x axis and the y axis
 and staircases 
 we could do circular narratives that were literally circular we could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn parallel narratives could be literally parallel
  y and also z 
 so i had all these notions this was back in the in the late ' 90s and other people in my business thought i was pretty crazy but a lot of people then went on and actually did it i 'm going to show you a couple now 
 this was an early
 collage comic by a fellow named jasen lex 
 and notice what 's going on here what i 'm searching for is a durable mutation that 's what all of us are searching for as media head into this
  new era  we are looking for mutations that are durable that have some sort of staying power 
 now  we 're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium  and we 're carrying it through all the way from beginning to end that 's that entire comic you just saw up on the screen right now  
 but even though even though we 're only experiencing it one piece
  that 's just where the technology is right now  as the technology evolves as you get full immersive displays and whatnot 
 this sort of thing will only grow it will adapt it will adapt to its environment it 's a durable mutation 
 here 's another one  this is by drew weing this is called ' pup ' ponders the heat death of the universe
  see what 's going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas
  is you 're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about we 'll
 go by this a little quickly you get the idea i just want to get to the last panel
  just one more 
 talk about your infinite canvas it 's by a guy named daniel
  merlin goodbrey in britain
