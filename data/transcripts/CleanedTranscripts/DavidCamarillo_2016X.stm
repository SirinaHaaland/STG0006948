  the word concussion evokes a fear these days more so than it ever has and i know this personally  
 i played ten years of football was struck in the head thousands of times  and
 i have to tell you though what was much worse than that was a pair of bike
  accidents i had where i suffered concussions  and i 'm still dealing with the effects of the most recent one today as i stand in front of you 
 there is a fear around concussion that does have some evidence behind it 
 there is information that a repeated history of concussion can lead to early dementia such as alzheimer 's and chronic traumatic encephalopathy
  subject of the will smith movie concussion 
 and so everybody is caught up in football and what they see in the military but you may not know that bike riding is the leading cause of concussion for kids sports related concussion that is  
 and so another thing that i should tell you that you may not know is that the helmets that are worn in bicycling and football and many activities
  not designed or tested for how well they can protect your children against concussion they 're in fact designed and tested for their ability to
 protect against skull fracture  and so i get this question all the time
 from parents and they ask me would you let your own
  should i let my child play soccer and
 i think that as a field we 're a long way from giving an answer with any kind of confidence there  
 so i look at that question from a bit of a different lens  and i want to know how can we prevent concussion 
 is that even possible 
 and most experts think that it 's not
  but the work that we 're doing in my lab is starting to reveal more of the details around concussion so that we can have a better understanding  the reason we 're able 
 to prevent skull fracture with helmets is because it 's pretty simple we know how it works concussion has been much more of a mystery 
  the cdc website comes up and this video essentially tells the whole story what
 you see is the head moves forward 
 the brain lags behind then the brain catches up and smashes into the skull  it rebounds off the skull and then proceeds to run into the other side of the skull 
 and what you 'll notice is highlighted in this video from the cdc  which i 'll note was
  funded by the nfl is that the
 outer surface of the brain  where it
 was to have smashed into the skull  looks like it 's been damaged or injured so it 's on the outer surface of the brain 
 and what i 'd like to do with this video is to tell you
 that there are some aspects that are probably right indicative of what the scientists think happens with concussion  
  probably more that 's wrong with this video  so
 one thing that i do agree with and i think most experts would is that the brain does have these dynamics it does lag behind the skull and then catch up and move back and forth and oscillate that we think is true 
 however the amount of motion you see in the brain in this video
 is is probably not right at all there 's very little room in the cranial vault only a few
  's filled entirely with cerebral spinal fluid  which acts as a protective layer  and so the brain as a whole probably moves very little inside the skull  
 the other problem with this video is that the brain is shown as a kind of rigid whole as it moves around and that 's not true either 
 your brain is one of the softest substances in your body  and you can think of it kind
  so as your head is moving back and forth your brain is twisting and turning and contorting and the tissue is getting stretched  and so
 most experts i think would agree that concussion is not likely to be something that 's happening on this outer surface of the brain  but rather it 's something that 's much deeper towards the center of the brain  
 now the way that we 're approaching this problem to try to understand the
  and to figure out if we can prevent it is we are using a device like this it 's a  mouthguard 
 it has sensors in it that are essentially the same that are in your cell phone accelerometers  gyroscopes  and when someone is struck in the head it can tell you
 how their head moved at a thousand samples per second  
 the principle behind the mouthguard is this it fits onto your teeth your teeth are one of the hardest substances
  in your body  so it rigidly couples to your skull and gives you the most precise possible measurement of how the skull moves 
 people have tried other approaches with helmets we 've looked at other sensors that go on your skin  and they all simply move around too much and so we found that this 
  is the only reliable way to take a good measurement 
 so now that we 've got this device
  we can go beyond studying cadavers because you can only learn so much about concussion from studying a cadaver  
 and we want to learn and study live humans  so where can we find a group of willing volunteers to go out and smash their heads
 into each other on a regular basis and sustain concussion  well i was one of them  and it 's your local friendly stanford football team  
 so this is our laboratory
 and i want to show you the first concussion we measured with this device one of the things that i should point out
 is the device has this gyroscope in it and that allows you to measure the rotation of the head most experts think that that 's the critical factor that might start to tell us what is happening in concussion 
 so please watch this video
  a little excessive there  
 but you get the idea  so when you look at just the film here pretty much the only thing you can see is he got hit really hard and he was hurt  
 but when we extract the data out of the mouthguard that he was wearing we can see much more detail much richer information
  and one of the things that we noticed here
 is that he was struck in the lower left side of his face mask  and so that did something first that was a little counterintuitive his head did not move to the right in fact it rotated first to the left 
 then as the neck began to compress  the force of the blow caused it to whip back to the right  so
 this left right motion was sort of a 
 phenomenon and we think that is probably what led to the brain injury
 this device is only limited in such that it can measure the skull motion but what we really want to know is what 's happening inside of the brain  
 so we collaborate with svein kleiven 's group in sweden they 've developed a finite element model of the brain  
 and so this is a simulation using the data from our mouthguard from the injury i just showed you and what you see is the brain this
 the brain twisting and contorting as i mentioned so you can see this doesn 't look a lot like the cdc video 
 now the colors that you 're looking at are how much the brain tissue is being stretched  
 and so the red is fifty percent that means the brain has been stretched to fifty percent of its original length the tissue in that particular area  
 and the main thing i want to draw your attention to is this red spot so the red spot is very close to the center of the brain
 and relatively speaking you don 't see a lot of of colors like that on the exterior surface
 as the cdc video showed now to explain a little more detail about how we think concussion
 might be happening one thing i should mention is that we and others have observed that a concussion is more likely when you 're struck and your head rotates in this direction 
 this is more common
  in sports like football but this seems to be more dangerous so what might be happening there  
 well one thing that you 'll notice in the human brain that is different than other animals is we have these two very large lobes we have the right brain and the left brain 
 and the key thing to notice in this figure here is that right down the center of the right brain and the left brain there 's a large fissure that goes deep into the brain  
 and in that fissure
 in this image you 'll have to trust me there is a fibrous sheet of tissue it 's called the falx and it runs from the front of your head all the way to the back of your head and it 's quite stiff  
 and so
 what that allows for is when you 're struck and your head rotates in this left right direction  forces can rapidly transmit right down to the center of your brain
  what 's there at the bottom of this fissure it
 's the wiring of your brain 
 and in fact this red bundle here at the bottom of that fissure is the single largest fiber bundle that is the wiring that connects the right and left sides of your brain 
 it 's called the corpus callosum 
 and we think that this might be one of the most common mechanisms of
  as the forces move down they strike the corpus callosum  it causes a dissociation between your right and your left brain and could explain some of the symptoms of concussion 
 this finding is also consistent of what we 've seen in this brain disease that i mentioned chronic traumatic encephalopathy  
 so this is an image of a 
  football player and the thing that i want to point out is if you look at the corpus callosum and
  back here so you can see the size of a normal corpus callosum and the size of the person here who has chronic traumatic encephalopathy  it is
 greatly atrophied and the same goes for all of the space in the ventricles these ventricles are much larger  and so all of this tissue near the center of the brain has died off over time so what we 're
  there is some good news here  
 and i hope to give you a sense of hope by the end of this talk
 one of the things that we 've noticed specifically about this mechanism of injury is although there 's a rapid transmission of the forces down this fissure  
 it still takes a defined amount of time 
 and what we think is that if we can slow the head down just
  the brain does not lag behind the skull but instead it moves
 in synchrony with the skull  then we might be able to prevent this mechanism of concussion 
 so how can we slow the head down 
 laughter a gigantic helmet  
 so with more space you have more time and this is a bit of a joke but some of you may have seen this this is bubble soccer and it 's a real sport in fact i saw some young adults
 playing this sport down the street from my house the other day and as far as i know there have been no reported concussions but
 in all seriousness this principle does work but this has gone too far this isn 't something that 's practical for bike riding or
 playing football  and so we are collaborating with a company in sweden called hvding some of you may have seen their work
  and they 're using the same principle of of air to give you some extra space
 to prevent concussion  kids don 't try this at home please 
 this stuntman does not have a helmet 
 he instead has a neck collar  and this neck collar has sensors in it the
  it detects when he 's likely to have a fall and there 's an airbag that explodes and triggers the same way that
 an airbag works in your car essentially and
 in the experiments we 've done in my lab with their device we found that it can greatly reduce the risk of concussion in some scenarios compared to a normal bicycle helmet  
 so it 's a pretty exciting development  
 but in order for
 us to actually realize the benefits of technology that can prevent concussion
 it needs to meet regulations 
 that 's a reality  and this device is for sale in europe but is not for sale in the us and probably won 't be any time soon so
 i wanted to tell you why there are some good reasons and then there are some not so good reasons 
 bike helmets are federally regulated  the consumer
 product safety commission has been given jurisdiction to approve any bike helmet for sale
  and this is the test they use this is back to what i was telling you at the beginning about skull fracture that 's what this test is for 
 and that 's an important thing to do it can save your life but it 's not sufficient i would say so for example one thing this test doesn 't evaluate
 is it doesn 't tell you is that airbag going to trigger at the right time and place and not trigger when it doesn 't need to
  it 's not going to tell you is this helmet likely to prevent concussion or not 
 and if you look at football helmets which aren 't regulated 
 they still have a very similar test they 're not regulated by the government anyway they have an industry body which is the way most industries work  but this industry body i can tell you has been quite resistant to updating their standards  
 so in my lab we are working on not only the mechanism of concussion
  but we want to understand how can we have better test standards  and we hope that the government can use this type of information to encourage innovation by letting consumers know how protected are you
 with a given helmet  and i want to bring this back finally to the original question i asked which is 
 would i feel comfortable letting my child play football or ride a bicycle  
 and this might be just a result of my own traumatic experience i 'm much more nervous about
  my daughter rose riding a bicycle
  so she 's a year and a half old  and she 's already  
 well wants to anyway race down the streets of san francisco this is the bottom of one of these streets  and so
 my personal goal is to and i believe this is possible is to further develop these technologies and in
  working on something in my lab in particular that really makes optimal use of the given space of a helmet  and i am confident that we will be able to before she 's ready to ride a two wheeler 
 have something available that can in fact really reduce the risk of concussion and comply with regulatory bodies  and so what i 'd like to do and i know that this is for some of you of more immediate nature i 've got a couple years here
 is to be able to tell parents and grandparents when i 'm asked
 it is safe and healthy for your children to engage in these activities  and i 'm very fortunate to have a wonderful team at stanford that 's working hard on this 
 so i hope to come back in a few years with with the final story  but for now i will tell you 
 please don 't just be afraid when you hear the word concussion there is hope
