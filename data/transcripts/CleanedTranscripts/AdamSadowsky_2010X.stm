  hi there i 'm going to be talking a little bit about
 music  machines and life 
 or more specifically what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video 
 some of you may recognize this image this is the opening
  frame of the video that we created we 'll be showing the video at the end but before we do i want to talk a little bit about
 what it is that they wanted  now when we first started talking to ok go
 the name of the song is this too shall pass 
 we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with  and we were very excited about this because 
 of course they have a history of
  dancing with machines 
 they 're responsible for this video here it goes again
  50 million plus views on youtube  four guys dancing on treadmills
  no cuts just a static camera a fantastically viral and wonderful video so we were really excited about working with them and
 we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted and they explained that they wanted kind of a rube goldberg machine now for those of you
  who don 't know a rube goldberg machine is a complicated contraption an incredibly
 piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task  so we were excited by this idea  and we started talking about exactly what it would look like  and we came up with some parameters  because you know
  but it also is pretty wide open  and we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video  so
 we came up with a list of requirements the ten commandments and they were in order of ascending difficulty  the first is no magic everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a
  rule of thumb was that if my mother couldn 't understand it then we couldn 't use it in the video  
 they wanted band integration that is the machine acting upon the band members  specifically not the other way around 
 they wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling so as the song picks up emotion so should the machine get grander
 in its process they wanted us to make use of the space  so we have this
  warehouse we were using divided between two floors it included an exterior loading dock we used all of that including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through they wanted it messy and we were happy to oblige 
 the machine itself would start the music  so the machine would get started it would travel some distance  reacting along the way  hit play on an ipod or a 
  tape deck or something that would start playback and the machine would maintain synchronization throughout
 and speaking of synchronization they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way  
 okay 
 they wanted it to end precisely on time okay so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect  and they wanted the music to drop out at a
 certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song 
 and as if that wasn 't enough all of these incredibly complicating things right  they wanted it in one shot 
 just some statistics
  get it on film to our satisfaction of those eighty five takes  only three actually successfully completed their run 
 we destroyed two pianos and ten televisions in the process  we went to home
  shoe after a nice dinner and returned back to the build and left it in a pile of stuff and another engineer thought well that would be a really good thing to use and ended up using it as a really nice trigger and it 's actually in the machine 
 so what did we learn from all of this well
  having completed this we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things  and we learned that small stuff stinks 
 little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust  and they fall out of the tracks the exact angles makes it hard to
 to get right and yet a bowling ball will always follow the same path it doesn 't matter what temperature it is doesn 't matter what 's in its way
 will pretty much get where it needs to go  but as much as the small stuff stinks  we needed somewhere to start so that we would have somewhere to go  and so you have to start with it you have to focus on it small stuff stinks  but of course it 's essential  right  
 what else planning is incredibly important you
 we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things it 's been said
  no battle plan survives contact with the enemy i think our enemy was physics and
 she 's a cruel mistress  
 often we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever  and so while planning is important so is flexibility these are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine 
 so also put reliable stuff last
  stuff that 's going to run every time again small to large
 is relevant here the little lego car in the beginning of the video references the big  real car near the end of the video the big real car works every time there 's no problem about it the little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and
 that 's a problem but you don 't want to have to reset the whole machine because the lego car at the end doesn 't work right so you put that up front so that if it fails at least you know you know you don 't have to reset the whole thing
 can be messy  
 there were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing  months were spent in this tiny cold warehouse and the wonderful elation that we that we had when we finally completed it so it 's important to remember that whether it 's good or it 's bad 
 this too shall
  and now to introduce their music video  we have ok go
  we can still do one better i think
  oh
  okay
