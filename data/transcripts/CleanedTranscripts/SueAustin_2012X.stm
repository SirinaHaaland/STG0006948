  wonderful to be here
 to talk about my journey to talk about the wheelchair and the freedom it has bought me  
 i started using a wheelchair sixteen years ago when an extended illness changed the way i could access the world
  i started using the wheelchair it was a tremendous new freedom 
 i 'd seen my life slip away and become restricted it was like having an enormous new toy  
 i could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again just being out on the street was exhilarating  
 but even though i had this newfound joy and freedom people 's reaction completely changed towards
 me it was as if they couldn 't see me anymore as if an invisibility cloak had descended  
 they seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair 
 when i asked people their associations with the wheelchair they
  i realized i 'd internalized
 these responses and it had changed who i was on a core level 
 a part of me had become alienated from myself 
 i was seeing myself not from my perspective but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people 's responses to me
  as a result  i knew i needed to make my own stories about this experience new narratives to reclaim my identity
  to negotiate the world  
 i was working to transform these internalized responses to transform the preconceptions that had so 
 shaped my identity when i started using a wheelchair by creating unexpected images 
 when i literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people it
 seemed to open up new perspectives  and therein lay the paradigm shift it showed that an arts practice can remake one 's identity and transform preconceptions
  by revisioning the familiar 
 so when i began to dive in two thousand and five i realized scuba gear extends your range of activity in just the same way as a wheelchair does 
 but the associations attached to scuba gear are ones of excitement and adventure completely different to people 's
  and the underwater wheelchair that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years 
 so to give you an idea of what that 's like  i 'd like to share with you one of the outcomes
 from creating this spectacle and show you what an amazing journey it 's taken me on
 the
 the
 the
 they
 the
 the
  most other things i 've experienced in life i literally
  have the freedom to move in three hundred and sixty degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom  
 and the incredibly unexpected thing is that other people seem to see and feel that too  their eyes literally light up and they say things like i want
  if you can do that i can do anything 
 and i 'm thinking it 's because in that moment of them seeing an object they have no frame of reference for or so transcends 
 the frames of reference they have with the wheelchair they have to think in a completely new way 
 for me this means that they 're seeing the value of difference 
 the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation we see and discover the power and joy
 of seeing the world from exciting new
  for me the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation 
 in fact i now call the underwater wheelchair portal because it 's literally pushed me through into a new way of being into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness 
 and the other thing is that because nobody 's seen or heard of an underwater wheelchair before and creating this spectacle is about creating new ways of seeing being and knowing now you
  have this concept in your mind you 're all part of the artwork too
