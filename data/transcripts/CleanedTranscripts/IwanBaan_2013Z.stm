  fortunate enough to work with many of the great international architects documenting their work
 and observing how their designs have the capacity to influence the cities in which they
  i think of new cities like dubai or ancient cities like rome
 with zaha hadid 's incredible maxxi museum 
 or like right here in new york with the high line 
 a city which has been so much influenced by the development of this 
 but what i find really fascinating is what happens when architects and planners leave and these places become appropriated by people  
  like here in chandigarh  india the city which has been completely designed by the architect le corbusier 
 now sixty years later the city has been taken over by people in very different ways from whatever perhaps intended for  
 like here where you have the people sitting in the windows of the assembly hall 
 but over the course of several years  i 've been documenting rem koolhaas 's cctv building in beijing
 and the olympic stadium in the same city by the
  architects herzog and de meuron at these large scale construction sites in china you see a sort of makeshift camp
 where workers live during the entire building process 
 as the length of the construction takes years  workers end up forming a rather rough and ready informal city  making for quite a juxtaposition against the sophisticated structures that they 're building 
 over the past
  seven years i 've been following my fascination with the built environment and for those of you who know me you
 would say that this obsession has led me to live out of a suitcase three hundred and sixty five days a year  
 being constantly on the move
 means that sometimes i am able to catch life 's most unpredictable moments  like here in new york the day after the sandy storm hit the city
  just over three years ago  i was for the first time in caracas venezuela  and while flying over the city i was just amazed by the extent to which the slums reach into every corner of the city 
 a place where nearly seventy percent of the population lives in slums  draped literally all over the mountains 
  office building which sits right in the center of caracas  the building was under construction until the collapse of the venezuelan economy and the death of the developer in the early ' 90s 
 about eight years ago people started moving into the abandoned tower
 and began to build their homes right in between every column of this unfinished tower  there 's only one little entrance
  to the entire building and the three thousand residents come in and out through that single door  
 together the inhabitants created public spaces and designed them to feel more like a home and less like an unfinished tower 
 in the lobby they painted the walls and planted trees
  they also made a basketball
  but when you look up closely you see massive holes where elevators and services would have run through within the tower people have come up with all sorts of
 solutions in response to the various needs which arise from living in an unfinished tower with no elevators the tower is like
  walkup designed in very specific ways by this group of people who haven 't had any education in architecture or
  inhabitant finding their own unique way of coming by this tower becomes like a living city a place which is alive with 
 and small businesses  the inventive inhabitants for instance find opportunities in the most unexpected cases like the adjacent parking garage which has been reclaimed 
  as a taxi route to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps in order to shorten the hike up to
  the apartments 
 a walk through the tower reveals how residents have figured out how to create
 walls how to make an air flow how to create transparency  circulation throughout the tower  
 essentially creating a home that 's completely adapted to the conditions of
  when a new inhabitant moves into the tower they already have a roof over their head so they just typically mark their space with a few curtains or sheets  
 slowly from found materials  walls rise  and people create a space out of any found objects or materials  
 it 's remarkable to see the design decisions that they 're making like when everything is made out of
  some residents will cover that red brick with another layer of red brick patterned wallpaper just to make it a kind of clean finish
 the inhabitants literally built up these homes with their own hands and this labor of love instills a great sense of pride in many families living in this tower  
 they typically make the best out of their conditions and try to make their spaces look nice and homey or at least up until as far as they can reach
  reach 
 throughout the tower you come
 across all kinds of services like the barber 
 small factories and every floor has a little grocery store or shop and
 you even find a church  
 and on the 30th floor there is a gym where all the weights and barbells are made out of the leftover pulleys from the elevators which were never installed
  from the outside behind this always changing facade you see how the fixed concrete beams provide a framework for the inhabitants to create their homes in an organic intuitive way that responds directly to their needs  
 let 's go now to africa to nigeria to a community called makoko 
 a slum where one hundred and fifty thousand people live just meters above the lagos lagoon 
 while it may appear to
  be a completely chaotic place 
 when you see it from above there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home 
 from the main dock people board long wooden canoes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expansive area  
 when out on the water it 's clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific
  way of living even the canoes become variety stores where ladies paddle from house to house selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits  
 behind every window and door frame  you 'll see a small child peering back at you  
 and while makoko seems to be packed with people what 's more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building 
 the population growth in
  nigeria and especially in these areas like makoko are painful reminders of how out of control things really are 
 in makoko very few systems and infrastructures exist electricity is rigged
 and freshest water comes from self built wells throughout the area this
  meet a specific way of living on the water  so fishing and boat making are common professions 
 you 'll have a set of entrepreneurs who have set up businesses throughout the area  like barbershops  
 cd and dvd stores  movie theaters  tailors  everything is there  
 there is even a photo studio where you see the sort of aspiration to live in a real house or
  to be associated with a faraway place  like that hotel in sweden 
 on this particular evening  i came across this live band dressed to the t in their coordinating outfits 
 they were floating through the canals in a large canoe with a fitted out generator for all of the community to enjoy 
 by nightfall the area becomes almost pitch black
  save for a small lightbulb or
 a fire  
 what originally brought me to makoko was this project from a friend of mine kunl adeyemi 
 who recently finished building this three story floating school for the kids in makoko 
 with this entire village existing on the water
  public space is
  so now that the school is finished the ground floor
 is a playground for the kids  but when classes are out the platform is just like a town square where the fishermen mend their nets
 and floating shopkeepers dock their boats  
 another place i 'd like to share with you is the zabbaleen in cairo they 're descendants of farmers who began migrating from the upper egypt
  and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes
 from all over cairo 
 for years  the zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages where they would move around trying to avoid the local authorities  
 but in the early  1980s they settled on the  mokattam rocks just at the eastern edge of the city  
 today they live in this area  approximately fifty thousand to seventy thousand people who live in this community of
  houses
 where up to three generations live in one
 structure 
 while these apartments that they built for themselves appear to lack any planning or formal grid 
 each family specializing in a certain form of recycling means that the ground floor of each apartment is reserved for
  and the upper floor is dedicated to living space 
 i find it incredible to see how these piles and piles of garbage are invisible to the people who live there like this very distinguished man
  who is posing while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him 
  while to most of us living amongst these piles and piles of garbage
 may seem totally uninhabitable to those in the zabbaleen this is just a different type of normal 
 in all these places i 've talked about today  what i do find fascinating is that there 's really no such thing as normal  and it proves that people are able to adapt to any kind of situation 
 throughout the day it 's quite common to come across a small party taking place
 in the streets just like this engagement
  party in this tradition the bride to be displays all of their belongings which they soon bring to their new husband a
 gathering like this one offers such a juxtaposition where all the new stuff is displayed
 and all the garbage is used as
 as props to display all their new home accessories 
 like makoko and the torre david
 throughout the zabbaleen you 'll find all the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood  
 there are the retail shops the cafes and the restaurants and the community is this community of coptic christians  
 so you 'll also find a church  along with the scores of religious 
 throughout the area  and also all the everyday services like the electronic repair shops the
  barbers  everything 
 visiting the homes of the zabbaleen is also full of surprises while from the outside  these homes look like any other informal structure in the city  
 when you step inside you are met with all manner of design decisions
 and interior decoration  despite
  having limited access to space and money the homes in the area are designed with care and detail 
 every apartment is unique  and this individuality tells a story about each family 's circumstances and values many of these people take their homes
 and interior spaces very
 seriously putting a lot of work and care into the details  the shared spaces are also treated in the same manner 
 where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns
  despite this elaborate decor  sometimes these apartments are used in very unexpected ways like this home which caught my attention while all the
 the mud and the grass was literally seeping out under the front door  
 when i was let in it appeared that this fifth floor apartment was being transformed into a complete
  animal farm where six or seven cows stood grazing in what otherwise would be the living room 
 but then in the apartment across the hall from this cow shed lives a newly married couple in what locals describe as one of the
 nicest apartments in the area
  the attention to this detail astonished me and as the owner of the home so proudly led me around this apartment 
 from floor to ceiling every part was decorated  
 but if it weren 't for the strangely familiar
 stomach churning odor that constantly passes through the 
 it would be easy to forget that you are standing next to a cow shed and on top of a landfill
  what moved me the most was that despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions i was welcomed with open arms
 into a home that was made with love care and unreserved passion  let 's move
 across the map to china to an area called
  henan and gansu 
 in a region famous for the soft  porous loess plateau soil there lived until recently an estimated forty million people in these houses underground 
 these dwellings are called the yaodongs through this architecture by subtraction
 built literally inside of the soil 
 in these villages you see an entirely altered landscape  and hidden behind these mounds of dirt are these square rectangular houses which sit
  seven meters below the ground  
 when i asked people why they were digging their houses from the ground  they simply replied that they are poor wheat and apple farmers who didn 't have the money to buy materials 
  and this digging out was their most logical form of living 
 from makoko to zabbaleen
  communities have approached the tasks of planning design and management of their communities and neighborhoods in ways that respond specifically to their environment and circumstances  
 created by these very people who live work and play in these particular spaces these neighborhoods are intuitively designed
 to make the most of their circumstances in most of these places the government is completely absent  leaving inhabitants with no choice but to
 reappropriate found materials  
 and while these communities are highly disadvantaged  they do present examples of brilliant forms of ingenuity  and prove that indeed we have the ability to
 adapt to all manner of circumstances  what makes places like the torre david particularly remarkable is this sort of skeleton framework where people can have a foundation where they can tap into
  now imagine what these already ingenious communities could create themselves and how highly particular their solutions would be if they were given the basic infrastructures that they could tap into  
 today you see these large residential development projects which offer cookie cutter housing solutions to massive amounts of people 
 from china to brazil these projects attempt to provide as many houses
  as possible but they 're completely generic and simply do not work as an answer to  the individual needs of the people 
 i would like to end with a quote from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration  zita cobb  
 the founder of the wonderful shorefast foundation based out of fogo island newfoundland 
 she says that there 's this plague of sameness which is killing the human joy and i couldn 't agree with her more
