  i 'm a designer and an educator i 'm a multitasking person  and i push my students to fly through
 a very creative multitasking design process  but how efficient is really this multitasking let 's consider
  consider for a while the option of
 monotasking 
 a couple of examples 
 look at that this is my multitasking activity result 
 so trying to cook answering the phone writing sms and maybe uploading some pictures about this awesome
  so someone tells us the story about supertaskers so this two percent of people who are able to control
 multitasking environment  but what about
 ourselves and what about our reality when 's the last time you really enjoyed just the voice of your friend  
 so this is a project i 'm working on and this is a series
  of front covers to downgrade our super  hyper 
 to downgrade our super hyper mobile phones into the essence of their function 
 another example have you ever been to
  how beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets on the island  
 but our multitasking reality is pretty different  and full of tons of information  
 so what about something like that to rediscover our sense of adventure 
 i know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono
 when the number
 of possibilities is so huge
  but i push you to consider the option of
 focusing on just one task or maybe turning your digital senses totally off
