  has allowed us to know so much about the far reaches of the the universe  which is at the same time
 tremendously important and extremely remote  and yet much much
  closer much more directly related to us there are many things we don 't really understand 
 and one of them is the extraordinary social complexity of the animals around us and today i want to tell you a few stories of animal complexity 
 but first  what do we call complexity  
 what is complex well
  something complicated comprises many small parts  all different 
 and each of them has its own precise role in the machinery on the opposite 
 a complex system is made of many many similar parts  and it is their interaction that produces a globally coherent behavior 
 complex systems have many interacting parts
 which behave according to simple individual rules
 and this results in emergent properties  the behavior of the system as a whole cannot be predicted from the individual rules only 
 as aristotle wrote  the whole is greater than the sum of its parts  but
 from aristotle let 's move onto a more concrete example of complex systems these are scottish terriers in the beginning  the system is disorganized
 then comes a perturbation  milk every individual starts pushing in one direction
 and this is what happens  
 the pinwheel is an emergent property of the interactions between puppies whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk and therefore to push in a random direction 
 so
 it 's all about finding the simple rules from which complexity emerges 
 i call this simplifying complexity and it 's what we do at the chair of systems design at eth zurich 
 we collect data on animal populations  analyze complex patterns try to explain them  
 it requires physicists who work with biologists with mathematicians and computer
  scientists and it is their interaction that produces  cross boundary competence to solve these problems  
 so again  the whole is greater than the sum of the parts  in a way 
 collaboration is another example of a complex system  
 and you may be asking yourself which side i 'm on biology
  it 's a little different and to explain i need to tell you a short story about myself 
 when i was a child i loved to build stuff to create complicated machines  so i set out to study electrical engineering and robotics 
 and my my end of studies project was about building a robot called er 1 it looked like this
 that would collect information from its environment and proceed to follow a white line on the ground
  it was very very complicated  but it worked beautifully in our test room  
 and on demo day professors had assembled to grade the project so we took er 1 to the evaluation room it
 turned out the light in that room was slightly different  the robot 's vision system got confused at the first bend in the line  
  and crashed into a wall 
 we had spent weeks building it and all it took to destroy it was a subtle change in the color of the light in the room 
 that 's when i realized that the more complicated you make a machine the more likely that it will fail due to something absolutely unexpected  
 and i decided that in fact i didn 't really want to create complicated stuff  
 i wanted to understand complexity the complexity of the world around us and
  especially in the animal kingdom which brings us to bats 
 bechstein 's bats are a common species of european bats they are very social animals mostly they roost or sleep together  
 and they live in maternity colonies which means that every spring  the females meet after the winter hibernation  and they stay together for about six months to rear their young
 carry a very small chip  which means that every time one of them enters enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes  we know where she is and more importantly we know with whom she is 
 so i study roosting associations in bats  
 and this is what it looks like  
 during the day  the bats roost in a number of sub groups in different boxes  it could be that on one day
  the colony is split between two boxes  
 but on another day  it could be together in a single box or split between three or more boxes  and that all seems rather erratic really it 's called fission fusion dynamics  
 the property for an animal group of regularly splitting and merging into different subgroups  so what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them
  together to extract a long term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony 
 okay  so that 's what this picture looks like  
 in this network all the circles are nodes individual bats  
 and the lines between them are social bonds  associations between individuals
  out this is a very interesting picture 
 this bat colony is organized in two different communities which cannot be predicted from the daily fission fusion dynamics  
 we call them cryptic social units  
 even more interesting in fact every year  around october  the colony splits up  and all
  but year after year  when the bats come together again in the spring  the communities stay the same 
 so these bats remember their friends for a really long time 
 with a brain the size of a peanut  they maintain individualized long term social bonds  we didn 't know that was possible 
 we knew that primates and elephants and dolphins could do that but compared to bats they have huge brains so
 how could it be that the bats maintain this complex stable social structure with such limited cognitive cognitive abilities  
 and this is where complexity brings an answer 
 to understand this system 
 we built a computer model of roosting  based on simple individual rules  and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony it
 's a mathematical model
  but it 's not complicated 
 what the model told us is that in a nutshell each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them 
 simple  individual rules this is all it takes to explain the social complexity of these bats  but it gets better 
 between two thousand and ten and two thousand and eleven the
  colony lost more than two thirds of its members probably due to the very cold winter 
 the next spring  it didn 't form two communities like every year  which may have led the whole colony to die because it had become too small 
 instead it formed a single cohesive social unit 
 which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years
 what we know is that the bats are not aware that their colony is doing this all they do is follow simple association rules  and from this simplicity emerges social complexity
 which allows the colony to be resilient against dramatic changes in the population structure  and i find this incredible
  to tell you another story but for this we have to travel from europe to the kalahari desert in south africa this is where meerkats live i 'm sure
 you know meerkats they 're fascinating creatures
 they live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy 
 there is one dominant pair and many subordinates some acting as sentinels some acting as babysitters some teaching pups and so on 
 what we do is put very small gps collars on these animals
  how they move together and what this has to do with their social structure 
 and there 's a very interesting example of collective movement in meerkats 
 in the middle of the reserve which they live in lies a road on this road there are cars  so it 's dangerous  
 but the meerkats have to cross it to get from one feeding place to
  so we asked 
 how exactly do they do this 
 we found that the dominant female is mostly the one who leads the group to the road  but when it comes to crossing it crossing the road she gives way to the subordinates 
 a manner of saying go ahead tell me if it 's safe 
 what i didn 't know in fact was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow for this change at the edge of the group to happen
 and if simple rules were sufficient
  to explain it  
 so i built a model 
 a model of simulated meerkats crossing a simulated road  
 it 's a simplistic model moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment they simply move together  
 when these particles get to the road  they sense some kind of obstacle  and they bounce against it the only difference
 between the dominant female  here in red  and the other individuals is that for her  the height of the obstacle  which is in fact the risk perceived from the road is just slightly higher  
 and this tiny difference in the individual 's rule of movement is sufficient to explain what we observe that
 the dominant female leads her group to the road and then gives way to the others for them to cross first
  george box who was an english statistician  once wrote all models are false  but some models are useful 
 and in fact  this model
 is obviously false  because in reality meerkats are anything but random particles but it 's also useful because it tells us that extreme
  at the individual level
 can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group  
 so again that 's simplifying complexity  i would like to conclude on what this means for the whole species  
 when the dominant female
 gives way to a subordinate it 's not out of courtesy  
 in fact the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group if she dies on the road  the whole group is at risk
  behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response these meerkats
 are replicating an evolved tactic that is thousands of generations old and they 're adapting it to a modern risk  in this case a road built by humans  
 they adapt very simple rules  and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat
 in the end  
 it may be bats which change their social structure in response to a population crash or
 it may be meerkats who show a novel adaptation to a human road or
 it may be another species 
 my message here and it 's not a complicated one but a simple one of wonder
  and hope
 my message here is that
 animals show extraordinary social complexity  and this allows them to adapt and respond to changes in their environment in
 three words in the animal kingdom  simplicity
 leads to complexity which leads to resilience  thank you
