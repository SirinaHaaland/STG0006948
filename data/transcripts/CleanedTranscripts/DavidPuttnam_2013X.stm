  if i may with the story of the paisley snail 
 on the evening of the 26th of august one thousand nine hundred and twenty eight may donoghue took a train from glasgow to the town of paisley seven miles east of the city  
 and there at the wellmeadow caf she had a scots ice cream
  float a mix of ice cream and ginger beer bought for her by a friend 
 the ginger beer came in a brown  opaque bottle labeled d stevenson glen lane paisley 
 she drank some of the ice cream float  but as the remaining ginger beer was poured into her tumbler a decomposed snail
 floated to the surface of her
  three days later she was admitted to the glasgow royal infirmary and diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis and shock 
 the case of donoghue vs stevenson that followed set a very important legal precedent 
 stevenson the manufacturer of the ginger beer was held to have a clear duty of care
 towards may donoghue even though there was no contract between them and indeed she hadn 't even bought the drink 
 one of the judges lord atkin described it like this you must take care to avoid acts or
  omissions
 which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbor  indeed one wonders
 that without a duty of care how many people would have had to suffer from gastroenteritis before stevenson eventually went out of business  now please hang on to that paisley snail story because
 it 's an important principle  last
  the hansard society a nonpartisan charity which seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy and encourage greater public involvement in politics
 published  alongside their annual audit of political engagement an additional section
 devoted entirely to politics and the media here are a couple of rather depressing observations from that survey  
 tabloid newspapers do not appear to advance the political citizenship of their readers
  are twice as likely to agree with a negative view of politics than readers of no newspapers 
 they 're not just less politically engaged they are consuming media that reinforces their negative evaluation of politics thereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical attitude to democracy and their own role within it
  little wonder that the report concluded that in this respect
 the press particularly the tabloids  appear not to be living up to the importance of their role in our democracy  
 now i doubt if anyone in this room would seriously challenge that view  
 but if hansard are right  and they usually are then we 've got a very serious problem on our hands and it 's one that i 'd like to spend the next ten minutes focusing upon  
 since the paisley snail  and especially over the past decade or so a great deal of thinking has been developed around the notion
  of a duty of care as it relates to a number of aspects of civil society  generally a duty of care arises when one individual or a group of individuals undertakes an activity which has the potential to cause harm to another  either physically  mentally or economically 
 this is principally focused on obvious areas such as our empathetic response to children and young people to our service personnel and to the elderly and infirm
 to equally important arguments around the fragility of our present system of government 
 to the notion that honesty  accuracy and impartiality are fundamental to the process of building and embedding an informed  participatory democracy 
 and the more you think about it the stranger that is a
  the pleasure of opening a brand new school in the northeast of england it had been renamed by its pupils as academy three hundred and sixty
 as i walked through their impressive glass covered atrium in front of me emblazoned on the wall in letters of fire
 was marcus aurelius 's famous injunction 
 if it 's not true don 't say it if it 's not right don 't do it  the head teacher saw me
  train back to london i couldn 't get it out of my mind  i kept thinking can it really have taken us over two thousand years to come to terms with that simple notion
 as being our minimum expectation of each other isn 't it time that we develop this concept of a duty of care
 and extended it to include a care for our shared but increasingly endangered
  after all the absence of a duty of care within many professions
 can all too easily amount to accusations of negligence and that being the case can we be really comfortable with the thought that we 're in effect being negligent in respect
 of the health of our own societies and the values that necessarily underpin them  
 could anyone honestly suggest on the evidence that the same media which hansard so roundly condemned
 have taken sufficient care to avoid behaving in ways which they could reasonably
  have foreseen
 would be likely to undermine or even damage
 our inherently fragile democratic settlement  
 now there will be those who will argue that this could all too easily drift into a form of censorship albeit self censorship but i don 't buy that argument  it has to be possible
 to balance freedom of expression with wider moral and social
  let me explain why by taking the example from my own career as a filmmaker 
 throughout that career i never accepted that a filmmaker should set about putting their own work outside or above what he or she believed to be a decent set of values for their own life
 their own family  and the future of the society in which we all live 
  to inhabit as i see it  filmmakers journalists even bloggers
 are all required to face up to the social expectations that come with combining the intrinsic power of their medium
 with their well honed professional skills  
 obviously this is not a mandated duty but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist or even blogger it strikes me as being utterly inescapable 
 we should always remember
 that our notion of individual freedom and its partner creative freedom is comparatively new in the history of western ideas and
 for that reason it 's often undervalued and can be very quickly undermined  
 it 's a prize easily lost  and once lost once surrendered  it can prove very very hard to reclaim and
  and its first line of defense has to be our own standards not those enforced on us by a censor or legislation 
 our own standards and our own integrity our integrity as we deal with those with whom we work
 and our own standards as we operate within society  and these standards of ours
 need to be all of a piece with a sustainable social agenda 
 they 're part of a collective responsibility the responsibility of the artist or the journalist to deal with the world as it really is and
 this in turn must go hand in hand
 with the responsibility of those governing society
 to also face up to that world and not to be tempted to misappropriate the causes of its ills  
 yet as has become strikingly clear over the last couple of years  
 such responsibility has to a very great extent been abrogated by large sections of the media  and as a
  policies of the parties of protest
 and their appeal to a largely disillusioned older demographic 
 along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial that typifies at least some of the young taken together these and other similarly contemporary
 aberrations
 are threatening to squeeze the life out of active  informed debate and engagement  and i stress active  
 the most ardent of libertarians might argue that donoghue v stevenson should have been thrown out of
 and that stevenson would eventually have gone out of business if he 'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it 
 but most of us i think accept some small role for the state to enforce a duty of care and the key word here is reasonable 
 judges must ask  did they take reasonable care and could they have reasonably foreseen the consequences of their actions  
 far from signifying overbearing state power
 it 's that small common sense test of reasonableness
 that i 'd like us to apply to those in the media who  after all set the tone and the content for much of our democratic discourse 
 democracy  
 in order to work requires that reasonable men and women take the time to understand and debate difficult sometimes complex issues  
 and they do so in an atmosphere which strives for the type of understanding that leads
  not agreement then at least a productive and workable compromise 
 politics is about choices  and within those choices  politics is about priorities  
 it 's about reconciling conflicting preferences wherever and whenever
 possibly based on fact but if the facts themselves are distorted
  resolutions are likely only to create further conflict with all the stresses and strains on society that inevitably follow 
 the media have to decide do they see their role as being to inflame
 or to inform because in the end  it comes down to a combination of trust and leadership
