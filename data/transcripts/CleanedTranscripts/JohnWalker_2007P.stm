  percent of us
 have the dream of listeners not being the musicians the listeners right  
 and we crave one thing even though we kind of don 't know it all the time we crave to be in the room
 with the musician the day it was recorded the day it was played
  to live concerts and we get that as much as we can but then we listen to the other ninety nine percent of our stuff recorded  
 and it turns out the further back you go in history the little rougher it sounds  
 and so
 we said there 's a solution to this let 's separate the performance as a thing out from the recording
  which was how it was made you know the thing with microphones in the room and all that day but the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers and what instruments they were using  and it 's the data
 hidden inside the recording in order to do this it 's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution and yamaha makes an incredible thing called the disklavier pro that
 looks like a nice grand
 piano there and you probably didn 't realize it 's going to do all these things but full of solenoids and fiber optics and computers and all this kind of stuff the highest resolution out of japan and this just didn 't work until we could cross this line that says high definition 
 and we were able to cross this line called the uncanny valley in terms of
 artificial intelligence terms we have a process where we you know kind of put it into the computer and digitize it  and then a whole lot of
  and we look at every single note and all the attributes of those notes how hard they were struck and how they were held down and how you move the fingers so we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers  and you know it 's a thing your piano teacher teaches you but
 we never had a science behind these kinds of things i 'm going to start with glenn gould he died twenty five years ago this year and was born seventy five years ago this year was a beloved pianist maybe the 
  great cult pianist of the twentieth century he just got tired of being in front of an audience and felt like a performing monkey was in fact
  his term so he stepped back and did nothing but the crafting of his work  and gould 's specialty was playing bach his maybe most famous recording was something called the goldberg variations bach only wrote themes and variations one time 
 he wrote some early pieces but late in his life in his mature period 
 he said here 's a theme thirty variations in fact the theme isn 't even the melody it 's the bass line
  gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about one in mono  and one in stereo  and the one in mono by the way 
 he used the pedal  and as he got older he said no no wait a minute i 'm going to get very scientific about this and not use the pedal what i 'd like you to hear live
 is the
  so let me tell you a little bit how this was done  first of all let me get you to the end step this is we have a fairly complex process that you know software and musicians and so on 
 but when we 're all done we know that the ear is
 final arbiter 
 we can play the original in one ear and a new recording in the other so i 'm going to do this for you right now  what you just heard and
 in the right speaker is going to be the original recording and the left speaker is going to be the new recording actually of an instrument just like that one  
 and i 'm going to play them
 together at the same time
 the
  there was no science
 for how skin hung off of muscle 
 right so in the video world we 've been able to invent in our lifetimes natural behavior and this is kind of another example of putting a science behind natural behavior  
 and then you heard the original
  ultimately i started with the experience and the experience is i want to be in the room and hear the musicians lots of you can afford to buy one of these  
 but 
 if not 
 there is now high definition surround sound  and i got to tell you if you haven 't heard high definition surround go down to your audio dealer your audiophile dealer  it 's so involving
 compared to regular stereo  but if you don 't have that maybe you
 on your headphones  and so on the same disk we have five recordings sony has five recordings and you could listen in headphones
 with this thing called binaural recording and it 's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument
  and it 's got microphones where the ears are and when you put on headphones and you listen to this  you 're inside
  glenn gould 's body  
 and it is a chuckle until  you know  the musicians who are musicians who play the piano listen to this say i can 't believe it it 's just what it 's like to play the piano except now you 're inside glenn gould 's body playing the piano  and it feels like your 
  fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process it 's a game changer here 's now something we know in spectacular quality the whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity what you heard today was not perfect it 's
  an amalgam of wood and cast iron and felt and steel strings and all these  and they 're all amazingly
 sensitive to temperature and humidity  
 so when you go into the recording session  you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to there 's the whole action there sitting kind of on the side and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano  without putting dates next to these things
 music will be turned into data like every field that 's occurred in the past
 audio has come very late to this game i 'm not talking about digitizing and bits and re mastering i 'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from which is how it was performed 
 and audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool they 're high resolution and they 're wired straight to our emotions  and you can 't trick them very easily 
 your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement you know 
 all right there 's this episode of
 i get it it was all just laid in for me yesterday there
  the episode of star trek for me was james daly played methuselah remember this one  
 and at some point he 's dancing with his and i won 't ruin the episode for you from one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven 
 right do you know where i 'm going  and nimoy i 'm sorry  spock sits down at the piano and he starts playing this brahms waltz and they all dance to it and then
  spock turns round he goes james i know all of the brahms waltzes and i don 't believe this is one of them in the category 
 that 's where i 'm at  i want to hear the waltzes brahms didn 't write  
 i want to hear the pieces that horowitz didn
  on a path now when we get to data that we can distill
 styles and templates and formulas and all these kinds of things again that you 've seen happen in the computer graphics world it 's now coming in this world the transition will be this one it says right now we think music is notes and how they 're played and
 i believe this is coming because what you 've just heard
 was a computer playing data no glenn gould in the room but yet it was human
  and i believe you 'll get to the next step the real dream of listeners
  every time you listen to a recording today every time you take out your ipod and whatever every time you listen to it it 's the same thing it 's frozen 
 wouldn 't it be cool if every time you listened it could be different this morning you 're sadder you want to hear your song
  same song played sadder than you did yesterday  you want to hear it played by different musicians you want to hear it in different rooms and whatever
