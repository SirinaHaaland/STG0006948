  this is my first time at ted normally as an advertising man i actually speak at ted evil  which is ted 's secret sister that that pays all the bills it 's held every two years in burma
 and i particularly remember a really good speech by kim jong il on how to get teens smoking again
 actually 
 it 's suddenly come to me after years working in the business that what we create in advertising which is intangible value you might call it perceived value you might call it badge value subjective value  
 intangible value of some kind gets rather a bad rap  
 if you think about it if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material
  you basically have two choices you can either live in a world which is poorer which people in general don 't like 
 or you can live in a world where actually intangible value constitutes a greater part of overall value 
 that actually intangible value in many ways is a very very fine substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things
 here is one example this is a train which goes from london to paris the question was given to a bunch of engineers about fifteen years ago how do we make the journey to
  paris better 
 and they came up with a very good engineering solution which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from london to the coast and knocking about forty minutes off a three and half hour journey time  
 now  call me mister picky i 'm just an ad man but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make
  now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks here is my naive advertising man 's suggestion what you should in fact do is employ all of the world 's top male and female supermodels  
 pay them to walk the length of the train handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the journey 
 now you 'll still have about three billion pounds left in change and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down
 here is another naive advertising man 's question again  and this shows that engineers  medical people scientific people have an obsession with solving the problems of reality 
 when actually most problems once you reach a basic level of wealth in society most problems are actually problems of perception 
  they seem fantastic to me they cost very little to develop they work extraordinarily well  
 they have no side effects or if they do they 're imaginary so you can safely ignore them so
 i was discussing this  and i actually went to the the marginal revolution blog by tyler cowen i don 't know if anybody knows it someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further and actually produce placebo education 
 the point is that education doesn 't actually work by teaching you things it actually works by giving you the impression that you 've had a very good education  which gives you an insane sense
  unwarranted  self confidence which then makes you very very successful in later life  so  welcome to oxford ladies and gentlemen
 the point of placebo education is interesting how many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception rather than that tedious hardworking and messy business of actually trying to change reality here 's a
 great example from history i 've heard this attributed to several
  other kings but doing a bit of historical research  it seems to be fredrick the great
 fredrick the great of prussia was very very keen for the germans to adopt the potato and to eat it  because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate wheat and potatoes  you get less price volatility 
  in bread and you get a far lower risk of famine because you actually had two crops to fall back on not one  the only problem is potatoes if you think about it look pretty disgusting 
  very few vegetables
 rather like contemporary scottish people 
 so actually 
 he tried making it compulsory the prussian peasantry said we can 't even get the dogs to eat these damn things they are absolutely disgusting and they 're good for nothing there are even records of people being executed for refusing to grow potatoes  
 so he tried plan b he tried the marketing solution which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable and none but the royal family could consume
  it  and he planted it in a royal potato patch with guards who had instructions to guard over it night and day  but with secret instructions not to guard it very well 
 now 18th century peasants know that there is one pretty safe rule in life which is if something is worth guarding it 's worth stealing  
 before long there was a massive underground potato growing operation in
  what he 'd effectively done is he 'd re branded the potato  
 it was an absolute masterpiece i told this story and a gentleman from turkey came up to me and said very very good marketer fredrick the great but not a patch on ataturk 
 ataturk rather like nicolas sarkozy was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil  in turkey to modernize it  
 now boring people would have just simply banned the veil  but that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback and a hell of a lot of resistance  
 ataturk was a lateral thinker he made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil
 i can 't verify that fully but it does not
 matter there is your environmental problem solved by the way guys 
 all convicted child molesters have to drive a porsche cayenne 
  it 's not the dollar it 's actually the peso in buenos aires very clever
 buenos aires street vendors decided to practice price discrimination to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists as an advertising man i have to admire that but the first thing 
  all value is subjective 
 second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion these funny signs that flash your speed at you some of the new ones on the bottom right now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face 
 to act as an emotional trigger  
 what 's fascinating about these signs is they cost about ten percent of the running cost of a conventional speed camera  but they prevent twice as many accidents so
 the bizarre thing which is baffling to conventional
 classically trained economists is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a sixty fine and three penalty points 
 tiny little behavioral economics detail in italy  penalty points go backwards you start with twelve and they take them away  because they found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on people 's behavior  
 in britain we tend to feel whoa got another three not
 so in italy  
 another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace
  actual or material value  which remember is what after all the environmental movement needs to be about this again is from prussia from i think about one thousand eight hundred and twelve one thousand eight hundred and thirteen the wealthy prussians to help in the war against the french 
 were encouraged to give in all their jewelry  and it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron  
  the interesting thing is that for fifty years hence the highest status jewelry you could wear in prussia wasn 't made of gold or diamonds it was made of cast iron  
 because actually never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry this actually had symbolic value  badge value it said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past so the modern equivalent would of course be this but 
 actually there is a thing just as there are veblen goods where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare there are opposite kind of things where
  actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous classless and minimalistic if you think about it shakerism was a proto environmental movement 
 adam smith talks about 18th century america where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great it was almost a block in the economy in new england because even wealthy farmers could find nothing 
  to spend their money on without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors it 's perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to
  more egalitarian societies what 's also interesting if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value a high component of intangible value versus their intrinsic value  they are often quite egalitarian 
 in terms of dress denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value coca cola
 a bunch of you may be a load of pinkos and you may not like the coca cola company  but it 's worth remembering
  andy warhol 's point about coke what warhol said about coke is he said what i really like about coca cola is the president of the united states can 't get a better coke than the bum on the corner of the street now that is
 actually when you think about it we take it for granted it 's actually a remarkable achievement to produce something that 's that democratic  
 now  we basically have to change our views slightly there is a basic view that
 real value involves making things involves labor it involves engineering
 it involves limited raw materials  
 and that what we add on top is kind of false it 's a fake version and there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it  it patently
 veers toward propaganda  however what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value  and it 's much fairer when
  this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food you had a monopoly supplier on the left you have rupert murdoch or the bbc 
 and on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it
 laughter nowadays the user is actually involved this is actually what 's called in the digital world user generated content although it 's called agriculture in the world of food 
 this is actually called a mash up where you take content that someone else has produced and you do
  something new with it in the world of food we call it cooking 
 this is food two point zero which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people 
 this is mobile food british are very good at that fish and chips in newspaper the cornish pasty  the pie
  the sandwich we invented the whole lot of them we 're not very good at food in general 
  the earl of sandwich didn 't invent the sandwich he actually invented the toasty but then the earl of toasty would be a ridiculous name 
 finally we have contextual communication now the reason i show you pernod it 's only one example every country has a contextual alcoholic drink 
 in france it 's pernod it tastes great within the borders of that country  but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else 
 unicum in hungary for example
  the greeks have actually managed to produce something called retsina which even tastes shite when you 're in greece 
 but so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people for giving them better information
 b j fogg at the university of stanford makes the point that actually the mobile phone is is he 's invented the phrase persuasive technologies he believes the mobile phone by
  timely and immediate is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented now if we have all these tools at our disposal we simply have to ask the question and thaler and sunstein have of how we can use these more intelligently i
 'll give you one example  if you had a large red button of this kind on the wall of your home and every time you pressed it it saved fifty dollars for you put fifty dollars into your pension  
 you would save a lot more  the reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior
  marketing has done a very very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying yet we 've never created the opportunity for impulse saving  
 if you did this 
 more people would save more it 's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions and the very nature of the decisions changes obviously i don 't want people to do this because as an advertising man i tend to regard saving as just consumerism needlessly postponed
  if anybody did want to do that that 's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about actually fundamental opportunities to change human behavior  now  i 've got an example here from canada
  there was a young intern at ogilvy canada
 called hunter somerville 
 who was working in improv in toronto and got a part time job in advertising and was given the job of advertising shreddies now this is the most perfect case of creating
 intangible
  added value  without changing the product in the slightest 
 shreddies is a strange square whole grain cereal only available in new zealand 
 canada and britain it 's kraft 's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown 
 in working out how you could re launch shreddies 
  he came up with this
  most perfect example of intangible value creation all it requires is photons neurons and a great idea
 to create this thing  i would say it 's a work of genius but naturally you can 't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research man so shreddies is actually producing a
  a six or a nine
  i 've
 heard
  debate raged there were conservative elements in canada unsurprisingly  who actually resented this intrusion so eventually the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise  
 which was the combo pack
  bear in mind there is an organization called the american institute of wine economics 
 which actually does extensive research into perception of things and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people 
  correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine except when you tell the people how expensive it is in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more 
 so drink your wine blind in the future
  but this is both hysterically funny but i think an important philosophical point which is going forward we need more of this kind of value  we need to spend more time appreciating what
  and less time agonizing over what else we can do two quotations to more or less end with one of them
 is poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new which isn 't a bad definition of what our job is to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar  but also to gain a greater appreciation  and place a far higher value on
 those things which are already existing 
 there is some evidence by the way that things like social networking help do that because they help people share news they give badge value to everyday little trivial activities so they actually reduce
  the need for actually spending great money on display  and increase the kind of third party enjoyment you can get from the smallest simplest things in life  which is magic
  replaces material value
