  of you women will be impacted by cardiovascular disease in your lifetime  
 so this is the leading killer of women it 's
 a closely held secret for reasons i don 't know in addition
  to making this personal so we 're going to talk about your relationship with your heart and all women 's relationship with their heart we
 're going to wax into the politics because the personal as you know is political 
 and not enough is being done about this and as we have watched women conquer breast cancer through the breast cancer campaign this is what we need to do now with heart 
  and eighty four more women die in the u s than men  
 so where we used to think of heart disease as being a man 's problem primarily which that was never true but that was kind of how everybody thought in the
 1950s and ' 60s and it was in all the textbooks it 's certainly what i learned when i was training 
  but if we were going to go forward and be sexist it 's actually a woman 's disease so it 's a woman 's disease now  
 and one of the things that you see is that male line the mortality is going down down down down down and you see the female line since 
  the gap is widening more and more women two three four times more women dying of heart disease than men and that 's too short of a time
  period for all the different risk factors that we know to change  so what this really suggested to us at the national level was that diagnostic 
  and therapeutic strategies which had been developed in men by men for men
  in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's heart disease kills more women
 at all ages
 than breast cancer 
 and the breast cancer campaign again this is not a competition we 're trying to be as good as the breast cancer campaign 
 we need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis now sometimes when people see this i hear this gasp
 we can all think of someone often a young woman who has been impacted by breast cancer  
 we often can 't think of a young woman who has heart disease 
 i 'm going to tell you why heart disease kills people often very quickly so the first time heart disease strikes in women
  half of the time it 's sudden cardiac death
 no opportunity to say good bye no opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy no opportunity to help her pick out a wig 
 breast cancer  mortality is down to four percent  
 and that is the forty years that women have advocated
 betty ford  nancy reagan stood up and said i 'm
  and it was okay to talk about it
 and then physicians have gone to bat we 've done the research we have effective therapies now women are living longer than ever 
 that has to happen in heart disease  and it 's time it 's not happening  and it 's time 
 we owe an incredible debt of gratitude to these two women 
 as barbara depicted in one of her amazing movies
  portrayed a young woman who wanted an education 
 and she wanted to study the talmud and so how did she get educated then she had to impersonate a man she had to look like a man she had to make other people believe 
 that she looked like a man and she could have the same rights that the men had 
 right around that time in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's that we saw women and heart disease deaths going up up up up up she wrote an editorial in the new england journal of medicine
 and said the yentl syndrome 
 women are dying of heart disease two three four times more than men  mortality is not going down it 's going up 
 and she questioned she hypothesized
  is this a yentl syndrome 
 and here 's what the story is is is it because women don 't look like men  they don 't look like that male pattern heart disease that we 've spent the last fifty 
  years understanding and getting really good diagnostics and really good therapeutics 
  they don 't get treated  they don 't get detected they don 't get the benefit of all the modern medicines 
 doctor healy then subsequently became the first female director of our national institutes of health and this is the biggest biomedical enterprise 
  research in the world  and it funds a lot of my research it funds research all over the place
 become director and she started in the face of a lot of controversy the women 's health initiative  
 and every woman in the room here has benefited from that women 's health initiative it told us about hormone replacement therapy it 's informed us about osteoporosis it informed us about breast cancer colon cancer in women  
 so a tremendous fund of knowledge
 despite again that so many people told her not to do it it was too expensive and the
 women aren 't worth it she was like nope sorry women are worth it 
 well there was a little piece of that women 's health initiative that went to national heart lung and blood institute which is the cardiology part of the nih 
 and we got to do the wise study and the wise stands for women 's ischemia syndrome evaluation and i have chaired this study for the last fifteen years 
 it was a study to specifically ask what 's going on with
  women  why are more and more women dying of ischemic heart disease 
 so in the wise fifteen years ago we started out and said well wow there 's a couple of key observations and we should probably follow up on that and our colleagues
 in washington d c had recently published that when women
  heart attacks and die compared to men who have heart attacks and die and again this is millions of people happening every day
 women in their fatty plaque and this is their coronary artery so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle
 women erode men explode you
 're going to find some interesting analogies in this physiology 
 so i 'll describe the male pattern heart attack first
 hollywood heart attack ughhhh horrible chest pain ekg goes pbbrrhh 
 so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal ekg there 's a big clot in the middle of the artery  and they go up to the cath lab and boom boom boom
 get rid of the clot that 's a man heart attack some women have those heart attacks  but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack where it erodes  doesn 't completely fill with clot
  symptoms are subtle
 ekg findings are different female pattern 
 so what do you think happens to these gals they 're often not recognized  sent home i 'm not sure what it was might have been gas  
 so we picked up on that and we said you know we now have the ability to look inside human beings
 with these special catheters called ivus intravascular ultrasound
 and we said we
 're going to hypothesize that the fatty plaque in women is actually probably different and deposited differently than men 
 and because of the the common knowledge of how women and men get fat when we watch people become
  men get fat 
 right here  it 's just a focal right there where do women get fat all over  
 cellulite here cellulite here  so we said look women look like they 're pretty good about putting kind of the garbage away smoothly putting it away 
 men just have to dump it in a single area so we
  so the yellow is the fatty plaque 
 and panel a is a man and you can see it 's lumpy bumpy he 's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries 
 panel b is the woman very smooth she 's just laid it down nice and tidy laughter
 and if you did that angiogram which is the red you can see the man 's disease so fifty years of honing and crafting these
 disease  kind of hard to see that female pattern disease so that was a discovery now
 what are the implications of that well once again women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem  so we are working now on
 a non invasive again these are all invasive studies ideally you would love
  fifty years of good non invasive stress testing we 're pretty good at recognizing male pattern disease with stress tests  
 so this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging we 're doing this at the cedars sinai heart institute in the women 's heart center
  we
 selected this for the research this is not in your community hospital but we would hope to translate this and we 're about two and a half years into a five year study 
 this was the only modality that can see the
  inner lining of the heart and if you look carefully you can see that there 's a black blush right there  
 and that is microvascular obstruction the syndrome the 
 now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction or obstruction 
 the second reason we really liked mri is that there 's no radiation so unlike the cat scans
 whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation we say do we really need that test 
  so we 're very excited about m r you can 't go and order it yet  but this is an area of active inquiry where actually studying women is going to advance the field for women and men
 what are the downstream consequences then
  heart disease
 is not recognized 
 this is a figure from an editorial that i published in the european heart journal this last summer  
 and it was just a pictogram to sort of show why more women are dying of heart disease  despite these good treatments that we know
  so she looks like barbara in the movie
 they get treated  
 and when you have female pattern and you look like a woman as barbara does here with her husband 
 they don 't get the treatment these are our  life saving treatments and those little red boxes are deaths 
  and why we think the yentl syndrome actually is is explaining a lot of these gaps 
 there 's been wonderful news also about studying women  finally in heart disease  and one of the the cutting edge areas that we 're just incredibly excited about is stem cell therapy  
 if you ask what is the big difference between women and men physiologically why are there women
  and men  because women
 bring new life into the world that 's all stem cells  so we hypothesized that female stem cells might be better
 at identifying the injury  doing some cellular repair or even producing new organs which is one of the things that we 're trying to do with stem cell therapy 
 these are
 female
 and male stem cells 
 and if you had an injured organ if you had a heart attack and we wanted to repair that injured area do you want those robust plentiful stem cells on the top  
 or do you want
 these guys that look like they 're out to lunch 
 and some of our investigative teams have demonstrated that female
  stem cells and this is in animals and increasingly we 're showing this in humans
 that female stem cells when put even into a male body  do better
 than male stem cells going into a male body 
 one of the things that we say about all of this female physiology because again as much as we 're talking about women and heart disease women do on average have better longevity than men
  is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology and understanding that is going to help men and and women  so this is not a zero sum game in anyway okay
 so here 's where we started  and remember paths crossed in 
 and eighty four and more and more women were dying of cardiovascular disease what has happened in the last fifteen years with this work
  we are bending the curve  
 we 're bending the curve  
 so just like the breast cancer story doing research 
 getting awareness going it works you just have to get it going 
 now are we happy with this we still have two to three more women dying for every man and i would propose with
 the better longevity that women have
  theoretically do better if we could just get treated  
 so this is where we are but we have a long row to hoe we 've worked on this for fifteen years and i 've told you we 've been working on male pattern heart disease for fifty years 
 so we 're thirty five years behind and we 'd like to think it 's not going to take thirty five years and
  it probably won 't but we cannot stop now too many lives are at stake  
 so what do we need to do you now hopefully have a more personal relationship with your heart 
 women have heard the call for breast cancer and they have come out for awareness campaigns 
 the women are very good about getting mammograms now and women do fundraising women participate they have put their money where their mouth
  is and they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns this is what we need to do with heart disease now  and it 's political 
 women 's health from a federal funding standpoint  sometimes it 's popular  sometimes it 's not so popular  
 so we have these feast and famine cycles  so i implore you to join the red dress campaign in this fundraising
  cancer  as we said  kills women  but heart disease kills a whole bunch more so if we can be as good as breast cancer and give women this new charge 
 we have a lot of lives to save so thank you for your attention
