  it 's everywhere we hear about it every single day  this
  over two
 billion records
 lost or stolen  
 and last year one hundred million of us  mostly americans  lost our health insurance data
 to thieves myself included  what 's particularly concerning about this
 is that in most cases  it was months before anyone even reported that these records
  stolen  
 so if you watch the evening news  you would think that most of this is espionage or nation state activity 
 and well  some of it is espionage you see is an accepted international practice  but in this case
  it is only a small portion
 of the problem that we 're dealing with how often do we hear
 about a breach followed by it was the result of a sophisticated nation state attack well often
 that is companies not being willing to own up to their own lackluster security practices 
 there is also a widely held belief
 that by blaming an attack on a
 nation state you are putting regulators at bay
 at least for a period of time  
 so where is all of this coming from the united nations estimates
 that eighty percent of it is from highly organized and
 this represents one of the largest illegal economies in the world 
 topping out at now get this four hundred and 
 billion dollars let me put that in perspective for all of you four hundred and
  billion dollars is larger than the gdp of one hundred and sixty nations  
 including ireland finland denmark and portugal to name a few
  so how does this work how do these criminals operate well  let me tell you a little story 
 about a year ago our security researchers were tracking a somewhat ordinary but sophisticated
  banking trojan called the dyre wolf 
 the dyre wolf would get on your computer via you clicking on a link in a phishing email that you probably shouldn 't have  
 it would then sit and wait  
 it would wait until you logged into your bank account  
 and when you did the bad guys would reach in steal your credentials  and then use that to steal your money
 this sounds terrible but the reality is in the security industry  this form of attack is somewhat commonplace
 however the dyre wolf had two distinctly different personalities
 one for these small transactions  but it took on an entirely different persona if you were in the business of moving
 large scale wire transfers  here 's what would happen
 you start the process of issuing a wire transfer  
 and up in your browser would pop a screen from your bank  indicating that there 's a problem with your account  and that you need to call the bank immediately  
 along with the number to the bank 's fraud department  so you pick up the phone and you call and after going through
 the normal voice prompts you 're met with an
 english speaking operator hello altoro mutual bank how can i help you 
 and you go through the process like you do every time you call your bank of giving them your name and your account number going through the security checks to verify you are who you said you are
 most of us may not know this  but in many large scale wire
  it requires two people to sign off on the wire transfer  so the operator then asks you to get the second person on the line  and goes through the same set of verifications and checks
  sounds normal right 
 only one problem  you 're not talking to the bank  
 you 're talking to the criminals  
 they had built an english speaking help desk fake overlays to the banking website  and this was so flawlessly executed that they were moving between a half a million and a million and a half dollars per
  attempt into their criminal coffers 
 these criminal organizations operate like highly regimented legitimate businesses 
 their employees work monday through friday 
 they take the weekends off how do we know this we know this because our security researchers see repeated spikes of malware on a friday afternoon 
 the bad guys  after a long weekend with the wife and kids
 come back in to see how well things went 
 the dark web is where they spend their time 
 that is a term used to describe the anonymous
 underbelly of the internet  where thieves can operate with anonymity and without detection  
 here they peddle their attack software
 and share information
  on new attack techniques  
 you can buy everything there from a base level attack to a much more advanced version 
 in fact in many cases you even see gold silver and bronze levels of service  
 you can check references  you can even buy attacks that come
  if you 're not successful  now these environments these marketplaces they look like
 an amazon or an ebay  you see products prices ratings and reviews
 of course if you 're going to buy an attack you 're going to buy from a reputable criminal with good ratings right 
 laughter this isn 't any different than checking on yelp or tripadvisor before going to a new restaurant
 so here is an example  this is an actual screenshot
 of a vendor selling malware  notice they 're a vendor level four they have a trust level of six they 've had four hundred positive reviews in the last year and only two negative reviews in the last month  
 we even see things like licensing terms here 's an example of a site you can go to if you want to change your identity
  they will sell you a fake id fake passports  but note the legally binding terms for purchasing your fake id  
 give me a break what are they going to do sue you if you violate them 
 this occurred a couple of months ago one of our security researchers was looking at a new android
  malware application
 that we had discovered it was called bilal bot 
 in a blog post she positioned bilal bot as a new  inexpensive
 and beta alternative
 to the much more advanced gm bot that was commonplace
  this review did not sit well with the authors of bilal bot  so they wrote her this very email 
 pleading their case
 and making the argument that they felt she had evaluated an older version
 they asked her to please update her blog with more accurate information
 and even offered to do an interview
 to describe
  to her in detail how their attack software was now far better than the competition  
 so look 
 you don 't have to like what they do but you do have to respect the entrepreneurial nature
 of their endeavors so how are we going to stop this
 it 's not like we 're going to be able to
 identify who 's responsible remember  they operate with anonymity
 and outside the reach of the law we 're certainly not going to be able to prosecute the offenders  i would propose that we need a
  and that approach needs to be centered on the idea
 that we need to change the economics for the bad guys  
 and to give you a perspective on how this can work  let 's think of the response we see
 to a healthcare pandemic  sars ebola  bird flu zika what is the top
  it 's knowing who is infected and how the disease is spreading 
 now governments  private institutions hospitals  physicians
 everyone responds openly
 and quickly  this is a collective and altruistic effort to stop the spread in its tracks
 and to inform anyone not
  infected how to protect or inoculate themselves  
 unfortunately  this is not at all what we see
 in response to a cyber attack 
 organizations are far more likely to keep information on that attack to themselves  
 why  because they 're worried about competitive advantage
  litigation
 or regulation we need
 to effectively democratize threat intelligence data we need to get all of these organizations to open up
 and share what is in their private arsenal of information 
 the bad guys are moving fast  we 've got to move
  faster and the best way to do that is to open up and share data on what 's happening
 let 's think about this in the construct
 of security professionals  remember  they 're programmed right into their dna to keep secrets  we 've got to turn that thinking on its
  we 've got to get governments  private institutions and security companies willing to share information at speed and here 's why  
 because if you share the information it 's equivalent to inoculation and
 if you 're not sharing you 're actually part of the problem  because you 're increasing the odds that other people could be impacted by the same attack techniques  
 but there 's an even bigger
  benefit by destroying criminals ' devices closer to real time  we break their plans  
 we inform the people they aim to hurt
 far sooner than they had ever anticipated  
 we ruin their reputations  we crush their ratings and reviews  we make cybercrime
 not pay  we change the economics for the bad guys  
 but to do this a first mover was required
 someone to change the thinking in the security industry overall about a year ago my colleagues and i
  were to take our data
 we had one of the largest threat intelligence databases in the world
 and open it up 
 it had information not just on what had happened in the past but what was happening in near real time  what if we were to publish it all
 openly on the internet  as you can
  this got quite a reaction first came the lawyers what are the legal implications of doing that 
 then came the business what are the business implications of doing that 
 and this was also met with a good dose of a lot of people just asking if we were completely crazy
  but there was one conversation that kept floating to the surface in every dialogue that we would have the realization
 that if we didn 't do this then we were part of the problem
  so we did something unheard of in the security industry 
 we started publishing  
 over seven hundred terabytes of actionable threat intelligence data  including information on real time attacks that can be used to stop cybercrime in its tracks 
 and to date  over four thousand organizations are leveraging this data  including half of the fortune one hundred
  and our hope as a next step is to get all of those organizations to join us in the fight and do the same thing and share their information
 on when and how they 're being attacked as well
  we all have the opportunity to stop it and we already all know how all we have to do
 is look to the response that we see in the world of health care
 and how they respond to a pandemic  simply put we need to be open and collaborative  thank you
