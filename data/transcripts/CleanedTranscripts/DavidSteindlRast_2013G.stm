  there is something
 you know about me something very personal  and there is something i know about
 every one of you  and that 's very central to your concerns
  that we know about everyone we meet anywhere in the world on the street  
 that is the very mainspring
 of whatever they do
 and whatever they put up with  
 and that is that all of us want to be happy  in this we are all together
  how
 we imagine our happiness that differs from one another  but it 's already a lot
 that we have all in common that we want to be happy  
 now my topic is gratefulness what is the connection between
 happiness and gratefulness
  would say well that 's very easy when you are happy  you are grateful  but think again 
 is it really
 the happy people that are grateful  
 we all know quite a number of people who have everything that it would take to be happy  and they are not happy
  they want something else or they want more of the same  
 and we all know people
 who have lots of misfortune 
 misfortune that we ourselves would not want to have  
 and they are deeply happy  they radiate happiness you are surprised why because they are grateful
  so it is not happiness that makes us grateful  it 's gratefulness that makes us happy  
 if you think it 's happiness that makes you grateful think again  it 's gratefulness that makes you happy  
 now we can ask what do
  how does it work 
 i appeal to your own experience we all know from experience how it goes  
 we experience something
 that 's valuable to us  something is given to us that 's valuable to us  and it 's really
  it has to be something valuable  and it 's a real gift  
 you haven 't bought it  you haven 't earned it  you haven 't traded it in you haven 't worked for it it 's just given to you 
 and when these two things come together something that 's really valuable to me and i realize it 's freely given 
 then
 gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart happiness
  spontaneously rises in my heart  that 's how gratefulness happens  now
 the key to all this
 is that
 we cannot only experience this once in a while  we cannot only have grateful experiences
  people who live gratefully grateful living  that is the thing and how can we live gratefully  
 by experiencing by becoming aware
 that every moment is a given moment as we say  it 's a
  you haven 't earned it  you haven 't brought it about in any way you have
 have no way of assuring that there will be another moment given to you and yet that 's the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us  
 this moment with all the opportunity that it contains  if we didn 't have this
 present moment  we wouldn 't have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything and this
  moment is a gift  it 's a given moment as we say  now we say
 the gift within this gift is really the opportunity  what you are really grateful for is the opportunity
  not the thing that is given to you because if that thing were somewhere else and you didn 't have the opportunity to enjoy it to do something with it
  be grateful for it  opportunity is the gift within every gift  
 and we have this saying opportunity knocks only once well
 think again  
 every moment is a new gift over and over again
  if you miss the opportunity of this moment another moment is given to us  and another moment 
 we can avail ourselves of this opportunity  or we can miss it 
 and if we avail ourselves of the opportunity  it is the key to happiness  
 behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands moment by moment
  can be grateful for this gift  does that mean
 that we can be grateful for everything
  certainly not we cannot be grateful for violence for war 
 for oppression for exploitation on the personal level we cannot be grateful for the loss of a friend for unfaithfulness
  i didn 't say we can be grateful for everything i said we can be grateful in every given moment
 for the opportunity  and even when we are confronted
 with something that is terribly difficult  
 we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity that is given to us  it isn 't as bad as it might seem
  when you look at it and
 and experience it  you find that most of the time what is given to us is the opportunity to enjoy  and we only miss it because 
  we are rushing through life and we are not stopping to see the opportunity  
  us  it 's a challenge to rise to that opportunity  
 and we can rise to it by learning something which is sometimes painful  learning patience for instance we have been told that the road to peace 
 is not a sprint but is more like a marathon that takes patience
  may be
 to stand up for your opinion to stand up for your conviction  
 that 's an opportunity that is given to us
  to learn  to suffer  to stand up all these opportunities are given to us  but they are opportunities and those who avail themselves of those opportunities
 are the ones that we
  they make something out of life and those who fail
 get another opportunity
 we always get another opportunity that 's the wonderful richness of life  so
 how can we find a method
 that will harness this how can each one of us find a method for living gratefully not just once in a while being grateful but moment by moment
 to be grateful  how can we do it it 's a very simple method it 's so simple that
 it 's actually what we were told as children when we learned to cross the street stop  
 look  go  that 's all 
 but how often do we
  we rush through life  we don 't stop  we miss the opportunity because we don 't stop
 have to stop  we have to get quiet  and we have to build stop signs into our lives 
 when i was in africa
 some years ago and then came back i noticed
  where i was i didn 't have drinkable water every time i turned on the faucet  i was overwhelmed  
 every time i clicked on the light 
 i was so grateful  it made me so happy  but after a while this wears off so i put little stickers  on the light switch and on the water faucet  and every time i turned it on 
 so
 leave it up to your own imagination you can find whatever
  works best for you but you need stop
 signs in your life and when you stop
  then the next thing is to look  
 you look you open your eyes  you open your ears you open your nose you open all your senses for this wonderful richness that is given to us
 there is no
  that is what life is all about to enjoy to enjoy what is given to us
 and then we can also open our hearts our hearts for the
  the opportunities also to help others  to make others happy because nothing makes us more happy than when all all of us are happy  
 and when we open our hearts to the opportunities the opportunities invite us to do
  something  and that is the third stop  look  and then go  and really do something 
 and what we can do is whatever life offers to you in that present moment  
 mostly it 's the opportunity to enjoy but
 sometimes it 's something more difficult
 go with it we are creative those are the creative people  
 and that little stop  look  go is such a potent seed that it can revolutionize our world  
 because
 we are
  the middle of a change of consciousness  and you will be surprised if you
 i am always surprised when i hear how many times this word gratefulness and gratitude comes up 
 everywhere you find it a grateful airline 
 a restaurant gratefulness a caf gratefulness a wine that is gratefulness  yes  i have even come across a toilet paper whose brand
  is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware how important this is and how this can change our world  
 it can change our world
 in
 immensely
 important ways  because if you 're grateful  you 're not fearful and if you 're not fearful you 're not violent
  if you 're grateful  you act out of a sense of enough
 and not of a sense of scarcity and you are willing to share  if you are grateful  you are enjoying the differences between people  and you are respectful to everybody  and that changes this power pyramid under which we live  
 and it doesn 't make for equality  but it makes for equal respect and that is the important thing 
 the future of the world will be a network
 not a pyramid turned upside down the revolution of which i am speaking is a nonviolent revolution  and it 's so revolutionary that it even 
 the very concept of a revolution  because the normal revolution is one where the power pyramid is turned upside down and those
  on the bottom are now on the top and are doing exactly the same thing that the ones before 
 what we need is a networking of smaller groups smaller and smaller groups who know one another who interact with one another 
  and that is a grateful world a grateful world is a world of
  are joyful people and joyful people
 the more and more joyful people there are the more and more we 'll have a joyful world 
 we have a network for grateful living and it has mushroomed  
 we couldn 't understand why it mushroomed  we have an opportunity for people to light a candle
 when they are grateful for something 
  and there have been
 fifteen million candles lit in one decade people are
 becoming aware that a grateful world
 is a happy world  and
 we all have the opportunity by the simple stop  look  go  to transform the world  
 to make it a happy place  and that is what i hope for us and
  this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same stop
