  the first question is why do we need to even worry about
 a pandemic threat what is it that we 're concerned about when i say we i 'm at the council on foreign relations we 're concerned in the national security community and of course in
  public health community 
 while globalization has increased travel  it 's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere all the time all over the world and that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you so a plague 
  outbreak in surat india becomes not an obscure event but a globalized event a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation katrina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have
  readiness in hand to be capable of handling things indeed an outbreak would be multiple katrinas at once our big concern at the moment is a virus called
  flu some of you call it bird flu which first emerged in southern china  in the mid 1990s but we didn 't know about 
 at the end of last christmas only thirteen countries had seen h5n1 but we 're now up to fifty five countries in the world have had this virus emerge
  in either birds or people or both 
 in the bird outbreaks we now can see that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus except the americas 
 and i 'll get into why we 've so far been spared in a moment  in domestic birds especially chickens it 's one hundred percent lethal  it 's one of the most lethal things we 've seen in circulation in the world
 in any recent centuries  and we 've dealt
 with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers with the result that there 's cover up 
 it 's also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds  there has been this centralized event in a place called lake chenghai china two years ago the migrating 
  birds had a multiple event where thousands died because of a mutation occurring in the virus  which made the species
  range broaden dramatically so that birds going to siberia to europe and to africa carried the virus which had not previously been possible we
 're now seeing outbreaks in human populations
 so far fortunately small events  tiny outbreaks
 occasional clusters 
 the virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years to form two distinct families if you will of the h5n1 viral tree with branches in them and with different attributes that are worrying
 so what 's concerning us well first of all 
 at no time in history have we succeeded in making in a timely fashion a specific vaccine for more than two hundred and sixty million people it 's not going
 to do us very much good in a global pandemic  
 you 've heard about the vaccine we 're stockpiling but nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective if we have a real outbreak 
 so one thought is after nine eleven when the airports closed our flu season was
  delayed by two weeks so the thought is  hey  maybe what we should do is just immediately we hear there is  h5n1 spreading from human to human the virus has mutated to be a human to human transmitter let 's shut down the airports 
 however  huge
 supercomputer analyses done of the likely effectiveness of this show that it won 't buy us much time at all and
  of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans for example all masks are made in china how do you get them mobilized around the world if you 've shut all the airports down 
 how do you get the vaccines moved around the world and the drugs moved and whatever may or not be available that would work  so it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive 
 we 're worried because this virus unlike any other flu we 've ever studied can be transmitted by eating
  we 've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats and now also domestic pet dogs 
 and in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets 
 we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu seizures central nervous system disorders partial paralysis this is not your normal 
  garden variety flu it mimics what we now understand about reconstructing
  eighteen flu virus the last great pandemic  in that it also jumped directly from birds to people we had evolution over time  
 and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings fifty five percent of people who have become infected with h5n1 have in fact succumbed  
 and we don 't have a huge number of people who got infected and never developed disease 
 in experimental feeding in monkeys you can see that it actually downregulates a specific immune system modulator  the result is that what kills you
  the virus directly but your own immune system
 overreacting saying whatever this is so foreign i 'm going berserk the result most of the deaths have been in people under thirty years of age  robustly healthy young adults  
 we have seen human to human transmission in at least three clusters
 fortunately involving very intimate contact still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk
 now
 you probably assume  well the governments are going to do something and we have spent a lot of money most of the spending in the bush administration has actually been more related to the anthrax results
 and bio terrorism threat
  but a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level to look at infectious diseases end result only fifteen states have been certified to be able to do mass distribution of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic
  the states would run out of hospital beds in the first week maybe two weeks 
 and forty states already have an acute nursing shortage add on pandemic threat you 're in big trouble so what have people been doing with this money  exercises  drills all over the world let 's pretend there 's a pandemic  let 's everybody run around and play your role
  main result is that there is tremendous confusion  most of these people don 't actually know what their job will be and the bottom line major thing
  come through in every single drill nobody knows who 's in charge  nobody knows the chain of command if it
 were los angeles is it the mayor the governor the president of the united states the head of homeland security  in fact  the federal government says it 's a guy called
 the principle federal officer who happens to be with tsa 
 the government says the federal responsibility will basically be about trying to keep the virus out which we all know is impossible
  and then to mitigate the impact
 primarily on our economy 
 the rest is up to your local community  everything is about your town where you live well how good a city council you have how good a mayor you have
 that 's who 's going to be in charge 
 most local facilities would all be competing to try and get their hands on their piece of the federal stockpile of a drug called tamiflu which may or may not be helpful i 'll get into that
 of available vaccines and any other treatments and masks and anything that 's been stockpiled and you 'll have massive competition 
 now we did purchase a vaccine you 've probably all heard about it made by
 sanofi aventis unfortunately it 's made against the current form of h5n1 we know the virus will mutate it will be a different virus the vaccine will probably be useless  
 so
 here 's where the decisions come in
  of your local town  let 's see should we order that all pets be kept indoors germany did that when h5n1 appeared in germany last year  
 in order to minimize the spread between households by household cats dogs and so on 
 what do we do when we don 't have any containment rooms with reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers to take care of patients these are in hong kong we have nothing like that here 
 what about quarantine
  the sars epidemic in beijing quarantine did seem to help we have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the united states and some states have differential policies county by county 
 but what about the no brainer things should we close all the schools well then what about all the workers they won 't go to work if their kids aren 't in school  encouraging telecommuting what works  
 well the british government did a model of telecommuting  six weeks they had all
  all people in the banking industry pretend a pandemic was underway  what they found was the core functions you know you still sort of had banks but you couldn 't get
 people to put money in the atm machines  nobody was processing the credit cards your insurance payments didn 't go through and basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs and that 's just office workers  bankers
  we don 't know how important hand washing is for flu shocking 
 one assumes it 's a good idea to wash your hands a lot but actually in scientific community there is great debate about what percentage of flu transmission between people is from sneezing and coughing and what percentage is on your hands  
 the institute of medicine tried to look at the masking question can we figure out a way  since we know we won 't have enough masks because we don 't make them in america anymore they 're
  or can we get away with some different kinds of masks in the sars epidemic we learned in hong kong that most of transmission was because people were removing their masks improperly  
 and their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask and then they rubbed their nose  bingo they got sars it wasn 't flying microbes 
 if you go online right now you 'll get so much phony baloney information you 'll end up buying this is called
 an n95 mask  ridiculous we don 't actually have a standard for what should be the protective gear for the first responders  the people who will actually be there on the front lines  
 and tamiflu you 've probably heard of this drug made by hoffmann la roche patented drug there is some indication that it may
 buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak
  should you take tamiflu for a long period of time well one of the side effects is suicidal ideations
 a public health survey analyzed the effect that large scale tamiflu use would have actually shows it counteractive to public health measures  making matters 
  worse and here is the other interesting thing when a human being ingests tamiflu only twenty percent is metabolized appropriately to be an active compound in the human being the rest
  turns into a stable compound  which survives filtration into the water systems  thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu and providing 
  them a chance to breed resistant strains and we now have seen tamiflu resistant strains in both vietnam in person to person transmission  and in egypt in person to person transmission so
 most of the governments have based their whole flu policies on building stockpiles of tamiflu  russia has actually stockpiled enough for ninety five percent of all russians 
 we 've stockpiled enough for thirty percent when i say enough that 's two weeks worth and then you 're on your own because the pandemic is going to last for eighteen to twenty four months 
 some of the poorer countries that have had the most
  have built up stockpiles they 're already expired they
 are already out of date  what do we know from one thousand nine hundred and eighteen the last great pandemic  the federal government abdicated most responsibility  
 and so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations all over america every city county state did their own thing 
 and the rules
 and the belief systems were wildly disparate  in some
 cases all schools all churches all public venues were closed  
 the pandemic circulated three times in eighteen months in the absence of commercial air travel the second wave was the mutated super killer wave 
 and in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers but by the time the second wave
 hit it took such a toll among the healthcare workers
 that we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines overall we lost seven hundred thousand people the virus was one hundred percent lethal to pregnant women and we don 't actually
  know why most of the death toll was fifteen to forty  year olds
 robustly healthy young adults  
 it was likened to the plague we don 't actually know how many people died the low ball estimate is thirty five million this was based on european and north american data 
 a new study by chris murray at harvard shows that if you look at the databases that were kept by the brits in india there was a
  among the indians so
 there is a strong belief that in places of poverty the death toll was far higher  and that a more likely toll is somewhere in the neighborhood of eighty to one hundred million people before we had commercial air travel  
 so are we ready as a nation no we 're not and i think even those in the leadership would say
  that is the case that we still have a long ways to go so what does that mean for you well the first thing is i wouldn 't start building up personal stockpiles of anything
 for yourself your family or your employees unless you 've really done your homework  
 what mask works  what mask doesn 't work how many masks do you need  
 the institute of medicine study felt that you could not recycle masks  well if you think it 's going to last eighteen
  going to buy eighteen months worth of masks for every single person in your family
 we don 't know again with tamiflu  the number one side effect of tamiflu is flu like symptoms  
 so then how can you tell who in your family has the flu if everybody is taking tamiflu
  if you expand that out to think of a whole community or all your employees in your company  you begin to realize how limited the tamiflu option
  might be everybody has come up to me and said well i 'll stockpile water or i 'll stockpile food or
 what have you but
 really do you really have a place to stockpile eighteen months worth of food twenty four months worth of food do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the
 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu 
 having to be prepared as communities not as individuals being prepared as nation being prepared as state being prepared as town  
 and right now most of the preparedness is deeply flawed  and i hope i 've convinced you of that which means that the real job is go out and say to your local leaders and your national leaders 
 why haven 't you solved these problems why are you still thinking that
  of katrina do not apply to flu and put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put  but
 i guess the other thing to add is if you do have employees and you do have a company i think you have certain responsibilities to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them  
 and you are trying to plan at a minimum the
 british banking plan showed that telecommuting can be helpful it probably does reduce
 exposure because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other or touching common objects and sharing things via their hands  but
 can you sustain your company that way  well if you have a dot com maybe you can otherwise you 're in trouble  
 happy to take your questions
  what factors determine the duration of a pandemic we don 't really know i could give you a bunch of flip this that and the other  but i would say that honestly we don 't know 
 clearly the
 bottom line is the virus eventually attenuates  and
  the moment that you see any evidence of serious human to human to transmission not just intimately between family members who took care of an ailing
  sister or brother  but a community infected
 spread within a school spread within a dormitory something of that nature  then i think that there is universal agreement now at who all the way down  
 send out the alert audience
 member some research has indicated that
  there is some evidence that taking lipitor and other common statins for cholesterol control may decrease your
 vulnerability to influenza  but we do not completely understand why the mechanism isn 't clear
 and
 i i don 't know that there is any way responsibly for someone to start medicating their children with their
 personal supply of lipitor or something of that nature  we have absolutely no idea what that would do you might
 be causing some very dangerous outcomes in your children doing such a thing audience member 
 how far along are we in being able to determine whether someone is actually carrying whether somebody has this before the symptoms are full blown lg right so
 i have for a long time said that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic
  for disease control has labeled a test they developed a rapid diagnostic it takes twenty four hours
 in a very highly developed laboratory  in highly skilled hands i
 'm thinking dipstick you could do it to your own kid it changes color it tells you if you have h5n1 in terms of
 where we are in science with dna identification
  capacities and so on it 's not that far off  but we 're not there and there hasn 't been the kind of investment to get us there audience member
 in the one thousand nine hundred and eighteen flu i understand 
  was some attenuation of the virus when it made the leap into humans is that likely do you think here i mean one
  eighteen strain to wild birds before it jumped from birds to humans  
 it 's curious that there is no evidence of mass die offs of chickens or household birds across america before the human pandemic happened 
 that may be because
  occurring on the other side of the world where nobody was paying attention  but the virus clearly went through one round around the world
 in
 a mild enough form that the british army in world war i actually certified that it was not a threat and would not affect the outcome of the war 
 and after circulating around the world came back in a form that was tremendously
  lethal  what percentage of infected people were killed by it again
 we don 't really know for sure it 's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with you had a weakened immune system you lived in poverty in india or africa your likelihood of dying was was far greater  but we don 't really know
  one of the things i 've heard is that the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia and that a pneumonia vaccine may
 offer you fifty percent better chance of survival lg for a long time  researchers in emerging diseases
 were kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat on the grounds that
 back in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen they didn 't have antibiotics  and that most people who die of regular flu which in regular flu years is about three hundred and sixty thousand people worldwide
  most of them senior citizens
 and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system and along comes pneumococcus or another bacteria streptococcus
 and boom they get a bacterial pneumonia  
 but it turns out that in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen that was not the case at all and so far in the h5n1 cases in people similarly bacterial infection
  has not been an issue at all 
 it 's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system that is the key to why people die of this virus
