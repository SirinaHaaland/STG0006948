  in the supermarket you 're buying some groceries  and you get given the option for a plastic or a paper shopping bag 
 which one do you choose if you want to do the right thing by the environment  
 most people do pick the paper  okay let 's think of why
 it 's brown to start with therefore it must be good for the environment  it 's biodegradable  it 's reusable in some cases it 's recyclable
 so when people are looking at the plastic bag it 's likely they 're thinking of something like this 
 which we all know is absolutely terrible and we should be avoiding at all expenses these kinds of environmental damages but
 people are often not thinking of something like this
 is the other end of the spectrum when we produce materials we need to extract them from the environment and we need a whole bunch of environmental impacts
 you see what happens is when we need to make complex choices us humans like really simple solutions  and so we often ask for simple solutions  and i
  that 's very complex and we 'll have to spend four hours talking about what exactly an eco material means because everything at some point comes from nature  
 and it 's how you use the material that dictates the environmental impact 
 so what happens is we have to rely on some sort of intuitive framework when we make decisions so i like to call that
  intuitive framework our environmental folklore
  it 's either the little voice at the back of your head
  or it 's that gut feeling you get when you 've done the right thing  so when you 've picked the paper bag or when you 've bought a fuel efficient car 
 and environmental folklore is a really important thing because we 're trying to do the right thing  but how do we know if we 're actually reducing the net environmental
  that our actions as individuals and as professionals and as a society are actually having on the natural environment  
 so the thing about environmental folklore is it tends to be based on our experiences the things we 've heard from other people it doesn 't tend to be based on any scientific framework  and this is really hard because 
  we live in incredibly complex systems  we have the human systems of how we communicate and interrelate and have our whole constructed
  society we have the industrial systems which is essentially the entire economy 
 and then all of that has to operate within the biggest system and i would argue the most important 
 the ecosystem 
 and you see the choices that we make as an individual  but the choices that we make in every single job that we have no matter how high or low you are in the pecking order has an impact on all of these
 systems and
 the thing is that we have to find ways if we 're actually going to address sustainability
 of interlocking those complex systems and making better choices that result in net environmental gains 
 what we need to do is we need to learn to do more with less  
 we have an increasing population and everybody likes their mobile phones especially in this situation here  
 so we need to find innovative ways of solving some
  of these problems that we face and that 's where this process called life cycle thinking comes in 
 so essentially everything that is created goes through a series of life cycle stages  and we use this scientific process called life cycle assessment or in america you guys say life cycle analysis 
 in order to have a clearer picture of how everything that we do in the technical part of those systems affects the natural environment
 so we go all the way back to the extraction of raw materials  and then we look at manufacturing  we look at packaging and transportation use and end of life  and at every 
  single one of these stages  the things that we do have an interaction with the natural environment and we can monitor how that interaction is actually affecting the systems and services that make life on earth possible 
  doing this we 've learned some absolutely fascinating things  and we 've busted a bunch of myths so to start with 
 there 's a word that 's used a lot  it 's used a lot in marketing  and it 's used a lot i think in our conversation when we 're talking about sustainability 
 and that 's the word biodegradability 
 now biodegradability
 is
 a material property
  is not a definition of environmental benefits allow me to explain 
 when something natural something that 's made from a cellulose fiber like  a piece of bread even or any food waste or even a piece of paper  
 when something natural
 ends up in the natural environment it degrades normally  its little carbon molecules that it stored up as it was growing are naturally released back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide
  dioxide but this is a net situation  most natural things don 't actually end up in nature  most of the things the waste that we produce end up in landfill 
 landfill is a different environment  in landfill those same carbon molecules degrade in a different way because a landfill is anaerobic  it 's got no oxygen
  it 's tightly compacted and hot 
 those same molecules they become methane and methane is a
  more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide  
 so our old lettuces and products that we have thrown out that are made out of biodegradable materials if they end up in landfill  
 contribute to climate change  you see there are facilities now that can actually capture that methane and generate power  displacing the need for fossil fuel power  
 but we need to be smart about this we need to identify how we can start to leverage
  these types of things that are already happening and start to design systems and services that alleviate these problems  because right now what people do is they turn around and they say let 's ban plastic bags we 'll give people paper because that is better for the environment 
 but if you 're throwing it in the bin and your local landfill facility is
 just a normal one then
 we 're having what 's called a double negative i
  i 'm a product designer by trade i then did social science  and so i 'm absolutely fascinated by consumer goods and how the consumer goods that we have kind of become immune to that fill our lives 
 have an impact on the natural environment  and these guys are like serial offenders  and i 'm pretty sure everyone in this room has a refrigerator  now america has this amazing ability to keep growing refrigerators in the last few years they 've grown one cubic foot on average
  size of a refrigerator and the problem is they 're so big now  it 's easier for us to buy more food that we can 't eat or find  
 i mean i have things at the back of my refrigerator that have been there for years all
 right and so what happens is we waste more food 
 and as i was just explaining food waste is a problem in fact here in the
  forty percent of food purchased for the home is wasted 
 half of the world 's produced food is wasted that 's the latest u n stats up to half of the food it 's insane it 's one point three billion tons of food per annum  
 and i blame it on the refrigerator well especially in western cultures because it makes it easier  i mean there 's a lot of complex systems going on here  i don 't want to make it so simplistic but the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this and one of the features of
 is
 the crisper drawer you all got crisper drawers the drawer that you put your lettuces in 
 lettuces have a habit of going soggy in the crisper drawers don 't they 
 yeah  soggy lettuces in the  u k this is such a problem that there was a government report a few years ago that actually said the second biggest offender of wasted food in the u k is the soggy lettuce it was called the soggy lettuce report  
 okay so this is a problem people
  these poor little lettuces are getting thrown out left right and center because the crisper drawers are not designed to actually keep things crisp 
 okay you need a tight environment you need like an airless environment to prevent the degrading that would happen naturally but the crisper drawers they 're just a drawer with a slightly 
  better seal anyway i 'm clearly obsessed don 't ever invite me over because i 'll just start going through your refrigerator and looking at all sorts of things like that but essentially this is a big
  problem  because when we lose something like the lettuce from the system not only do we have that impact i just explained at the end of life but we actually have had to grow that lettuce 
 the life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical we 've had to clear land we 've had to plant seeds phosphorus 
 fertilizers nutrients water sunlight all of the embodied impacts in that lettuce get lost from the system which makes it a far bigger environmental impact
 than the loss of the energy from the fridge  
 so we need to design things like this far better if we 're going to start addressing serious environmental problems  
 we could start with the crisper drawer and the size for those of you in the room who do design fridges that would be great
  the problem is imagine if we actually started to reconsider how
  sign of modernity but we actually haven 't really changed the design of them that much since the 
 a little bit  but
 essentially they 're still big boxes cold boxes that we store stuff in so imagine if we actually really started to identify these problems and use that as the foundation
 for finding innovative and elegant design solutions that will solve those
  system change design dictating the way in which the system can be far more sustainable  
 forty percent food waste is a major problem  imagine if we designed fridges that halved that 
 another item that i find fascinating is the electric tea kettle which i found out that you don 't do tea kettles in this country really do you but that 's
  percent of households in the united kingdom own an electric tea kettle 
 so they 're very popular  
 and i mean  if i were to work with a design firm or a designer  and they were designing one of these and they wanted to do it eco  they 'd  usually ask me two things they 'd say leyla how do i make it technically efficient because obviously energy 's a problem with this product 
 or how do i make it green
  how do i make the materials green
 in the manufacturing  
 would you ask me those questions  they seem logical right  
 yeah  well i 'd say you 're looking at the wrong problems because the problem is with use it 's
 with how people use the product sixty five percent of brits admit to over filling their kettle
 when they only need one cup of tea all of this extra water that 's being boiled requires energy and it 's been
  calculated that in one day of extra energy use from boiling kettles is enough to light all of the streetlights in england for a night  
 but this is the thing this is what i call a product person failure  but we 've got a product system failure going on with these little guys  and they 're so ubiquitous you don 't even notice they 're
  this guy over here though he does he 's named simon simon works for the national electricity company in the u k he has a very important job of monitoring all of the electricity coming into the system 
 to make sure there is enough so it powers everybody 's homes  he 's also watching television 
  the minute the ad break comes on this man has to rush to buy nuclear power from france  because everybody turns their kettles on at the same time 
 one point five million kettles  seriously problematic  
 so imagine if you designed kettles you actually found a way to solve these system failures because this is a huge amount of pressure on the
  system just because the product hasn 't thought about the problem that it 's going to have when it exists in the world now i looked at a number of kettles available on the market and found the minimum 
  fill lines so the little piece of information that tells you how much you need to put in there was between two and a five and a half cups of water just to make one cup of tea so
  one 's a boiling chamber and one 's the water holder  the user actually has to push that button to get their hot water boiled which means because we 're all lazy  
 you only fill exactly what you need  and this is what i 
  products products systems or services that intervene and solve these problems up front 
 now this is a technology arena so obviously these things are quite popular but i think if we 're going to keep
 designing buying and using and throwing out these kinds of products at the rate we currently do which is astronomically high 
 there are seven billion people who live in the world right now there are six billion mobile phone subscriptions as of last year  
 every single year one point five billion mobile phones roll off production
  and some companies report their production rate as being greater than the human birth rate 
 one hundred fifty two million phones were thrown out in the u s last year only eleven percent were recycled i 'm from australia we have a population of twenty two million don 't laugh and
 it 's been reported that twenty two million phones are in people 's drawers 
 we need to find ways of solving the problems around this because these things are so complicated
  they have so much locked up inside them 
 gold did you know that it 's actually cheaper now to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones than it is out of a ton of gold ore 
 there 's a number of highly complex and valuable materials embodied inside these things so we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly because this is otherwise what happens this is a community in ghana  
 and e waste is reported or electronic waste is reported by the
  to fifty million tons trafficked this is how they get the gold and the other valuable materials out they burn the electronic waste in open spaces these are communities  and this is happening all over the world  
 and because we don 't see the ramifications of the choices that we make as designers as businesspeople as consumers 
 then these kinds of externalities happen and these are people 's lives  
 so we need to find smarter
 innovative solutions to these problems if we 're going to start to live sustainably within this world  
 so imagine if when you bought your mobile phone your new one because you replaced your old one after fifteen to eighteen months is the average time that people replace their phones by the way
 so if we 're going to keep this kind of expedient mobile phone replacing then we should be looking at closing
  the loop on these systems  the people who produce these phones  and some of which i 'm sure are in the room right now  
 could potentially look at doing what we call closed loop systems or product system services  so identifying that there is a market demand and that market demand 's not going to go anywhere  so you design the product 
 to solve the problem design for disassembly design for light weighting we heard some some of those kinds of strategies being used in the tesla motors car today 
  are not hard  but understanding the system and then looking for viable
 consumer demand alternatives is how we can start radically altering
 the sustainability agenda because i hate to break it to you all consumption is the biggest problem
  but design is one of the best solutions 
 these kinds of products are everywhere
  by identifying alternative ways of doing things we can actually start to innovate  and i say actually start to innovate i 'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative
  but in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter as a criteria for fueling
 systems based solutions  because as i 've just demonstrated with these simple products
  they 're participating in these major problems  so we need to look across the entire life of the things that we do 
 if you just had paper or plastic obviously reusable is far more beneficial
 then
 the paper is worse and the paper is worse because it weighs four to ten times more than the plastic and when we actually compare from a life cycle perspective a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper 
 the paper is far better  but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag to carry your groceries home
  is not
 done with a kilo of each material it 's done with a very small amount of plastic and quite a lot more paper 
 because functionality defines environmental impact and i said earlier that the designers always ask me for the eco materials i say
  there 's only a few materials that you should completely avoid the rest of them it 's all about application  and at the end of the day  everything we design and produce in the economy or buy
  as consumers is done so for function we want something therefore we buy it so breaking things back down and delivering
 smartly  elegantly  sophisticated solutions
 that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing everything all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life 
 we can start to actually find really innovative solutions  and i 'll just leave you with one very quick thing that a designer said to me recently who i work with a senior designer i said how come you 're not doing
  sustainability
 i know you know this and he said well  recently i pitched a sustainability project to a client and turned and he said to me '
 i know it 's going to cost less  i know it 's going to sell more but we 're not pioneers because pioneers have arrows in their backs ' 
 i think we 've got a roomful of pioneers and i hope there are far more pioneers out there because we need to solve these problems thank you
