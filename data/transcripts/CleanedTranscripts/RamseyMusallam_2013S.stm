  more than just explosions chemistry is everywhere have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over some people nodding yes
  yes recently i showed this to my students  and i just asked them to try and explain why it happened 
 the questions and conversations that followed were fascinating  check out this video that maddie from my period three class sent me that evening
  as maddie 's chemistry teacher i love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class 
 but what fascinated me more is that maddie 's curiosity took her to a new level 
 if you look inside that beaker you might see a candle maddie 's using temperature to
  extend this phenomenon to a new scenario you
 know questions and curiosity like maddie 's are magnets that draw us towards our teachers  and they transcend
 all technology or buzzwords in education but if we place these technologies before student inquiry
  we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers our students ' questions 
 for example  flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time but if it is the focus of our students ' experience 
 it 's the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing  
 but if instead we have the guts to confuse our students perplex them and evoke real
  questions  through those questions we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust
 and informed methods of blended instruction  so
  lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside the truth is i 've been teaching for thirteen years now 
  to snap me out of ten years of pseudo teaching and help me realize
 that student questions are the seeds of real learning 
 not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information 
 in may of two thousand and ten at thirty five years old  
 with a two year old at home and my second child on the way i was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta 
  to open heart surgery this is the actual real email from my doctor right there  now when i got this i was press caps lock
 absolutely freaked out okay but i found surprising moments of comfort
 in the confidence that my surgeon embodied where did this guy get this confidence the audacity of it
  so when i asked him he told me three things
  he said first  his curiosity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure about what worked and what didn 't work  
 second 
 he embraced and didn 't fear the messy process of trial and error the inevitable process of trial and error  
 and third  through intense reflection he gathered the information that he needed
 to design and revise the procedure and then with a steady
  hand he saved my life 
 now i absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom and before i went back into the classroom that fall i wrote down three rules of my own
 that i bring to my lesson planning still today 
 rule number one curiosity comes first 
 questions can be windows to great instruction but not the other way around 
 rule number two
  two embrace the mess we
 're all teachers we know learning is ugly  
 and just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section one point two of chapter one of the one that we all skip okay 
 trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every
  day at sacred heart cathedral in room two hundred and six 
 and rule number three 
 practice reflection what we do is important it deserves our care  but it also deserves our revision 
 can we be the surgeons of our classrooms as if what we are doing one day will save lives our students our worth it 
 and each case is different all right 
  chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that out of my system before we move on so these are my daughters on the right  we have little emmalou
 southern family and on the left riley now riley 's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here she 's going to be four years old  
 and anyone who knows a four year old knows that they love to ask 
 why yeah  
  i could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything we all were at that age  
 but the challenge is really for riley 's future teachers the ones she has yet to meet  how will they grow this curiosity 
 you see i would argue that riley is a metaphor for all kids  
 and i think dropping out of school comes in many different forms
 to the senior who 's checked out before the year 's even begun or that empty
  desk in the back of an urban middle school 's classroom but if we as educators leave behind
 this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm
 as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry  we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day and spark their imagination thank you very much
