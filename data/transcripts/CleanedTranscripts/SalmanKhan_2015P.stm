 talk about the two ideas that at least based on my observations at khan academy are kind of the core or the key leverage points for for learning and it 's the idea of mastery and the idea
  i saw this in the early days working with my cousins a lot of them were having trouble with math at first because they had all of these gaps accumulated in their in their learning and because of that at some point they got 
  to an algebra class and they might have been a little bit shaky on some of the pre algebra and because of that
  those videos on youtube and i realized that people who were not my cousins were watching  
 and at first those comments were just simple thank yous i thought that was a pretty big deal i don 't know how much time you all spend on youtube
 most of the comments are not thank you they 're a
 little edgier than that but then the comments got a little more intense student after student saying that they had grown up not liking math
  was getting difficult as they got into more advanced math topics by the time they got to algebra they had so many gaps in their knowledge they couldn 't engage with it
 they thought they didn 't have the math gene  but when they were a bit older they took a little agency and decided to engage they found resources like khan academy and they were able to fill in those gaps 
  and master those concepts  and that reinforced their mindset that it wasn 't fixed that they actually were capable of of learning mathematics
  and in a lot of ways this is how you would master a lot of things in life it 's the way you would learn a martial art in a martial art  you would practice the white belt skills as long 
  as necessary  and only when you 've mastered it you would move on to become a yellow belt it 's the way you learn a musical instrument  you practice the basic piece over and over again and only when you 've mastered it
  you go on to the more advanced one but what we point out
 this is not the way a a traditional academic model is structured the type of academic model that most of us grew up in 
 in a traditional academic model we group students together usually by age and around middle school by age and perceived ability 
 and we shepherd them all together at the same pace  
 and what typically happens let 's say we 're in a middle school pre algebra class and the current unit is on exponents  
 the teacher will give a lecture on exponents
 go home do some homework the next morning we 'll review the homework then another lecture homework lecture homework that will continue for about two or three weeks  and then we get a test
 on that test  maybe i get a seventy five percent  maybe you get a ninety percent maybe you get a ninety five percent  and even though the test identified gaps in our knowledge i didn 't
  percent of the material even the a student what was the five percent they didn 't know even though we 've identified the gaps  the whole class will then move on to the next subject 
 probably a a more advanced subject that 's going to build on those gaps it might be logarithms or negative exponents and that process continues and you immediately start to realize how how 
  strange this is i didn 't know twenty five percent of the more foundational thing  and now i 'm being pushed to the more advanced thing
  this will continue for months years all the way until at some point i might be in an algebra class or trigonometry class
 and i hit a wall and it 's not because algebra is fundamentally difficult or because the student isn 't bright it
 's because i 'm seeing an equation and they 're dealing with exponents and that thirty percent that i didn 't know is showing up 
 and then i start to disengage to
  how absurd that is imagine if we did other things in our life that way say home building 
 so we bring in the contractor and say we were told we have two weeks to build a foundation 
 do what you can 
 laughter so they do what they can maybe it rains maybe some of the supplies don 't show up and two weeks later the inspector comes
  around says ok the concrete is still wet right over there that part 's not quite up to code i 'll give it an eighty percent you
 say great that 's a c let 's build the first floor 
 same thing  
 we have two weeks do what you can inspector shows up it 's a seventy five percent great that 's a d plus second floor third floor and all of a sudden while you 're building the third floor  the whole structure collapses  
  have in education or that a lot of folks have you might say maybe we had a bad contractor or maybe we needed better inspection or more frequent inspection  
 but what was really broken was the process we were artificially constraining how long we had to something pretty much ensuring a variable outcome
 and we took the trouble of inspecting and identifying those gaps  but then we built right on top of it  so the idea of mastery learning is to do the exact opposite
  instead of artificially constraining fixing when and how long you work on something pretty much ensuring that variable outcome the a b c d f
 do it the other way around  what 's variable is when and how long a student actually has to work on something  and what 's fixed is that they actually master the material  
 and it 's important to realize that not only will this make the student learn their exponents better
  the right mindset muscles it makes them realize that if you got twenty percent wrong on something it doesn 't mean that you have a c branded in your dna somehow 
 it means that you should just keep working on it you should have grit you should have perseverance  you should take agency over your learning  
 now a lot of skeptics might say well hey this is all great philosophically this whole idea of mastery based learning and its connection to mindset students taking agency over their learning
 makes a lot of sense but it seems impractical to actually do it every student would be on their own track it would have to be personalized you 'd have to have private tutors
 and worksheets for every student and these aren 't new ideas there were experiments in winnetka illinois one hundred years ago  where they did mastery based learning
  on demand assessments  
 but now today it 's no longer impractical we have the tools to do it students see an explanation at their own time and pace  there 's on demand video for that they need practice  they need 
  feedback  there 's adaptive exercises readily available for students  
  perseverance they 're taking agency over their learning and all sorts of beautiful things can start to happen in the actual classroom  
 instead of it being focused on the lecture students can interact with each other they can get deeper mastery over the material  they can go into simulations socratic dialogue
 to appreciate what we 're talking about and the the tragedy of of lost potential here i 'd like to give a little bit of a a thought experiment
 if we were to go four hundred years into the past to western europe which even then was one of the more literate parts of of the planet 
 you would see that about fifteen percent of the population knew how to read  
 and i suspect that if you asked someone who did know how to read say a member of the clergy what percentage of the population do you think is even capable of reading
  education system  maybe twenty or thirty percent 
 but if you fast forward to today we know that that prediction would have been wildly pessimistic that pretty close to one hundred percent of the population is capable of reading  
 but if i were to ask you
 a similar question 
 what percentage of the population do you think is capable of truly mastering calculus or understanding organic
  chemistry or being able to contribute to to cancer research a lot of you might say well with a great education system  maybe twenty thirty percent 
 but what if that estimate is just based on your own experience in a non mastery framework your own experience with yourself or observing your peers where you 're being pushed at this set pace 
  through classes accumulating all these gaps even when you got that ninety five percent what was that five percent you missed
 and it keeps accumulating you get to an advanced class all of a sudden you hit a wall and say i 'm not meant to be a cancer researcher not meant to be a physicist not meant to be a mathematician 
 i suspect that that actually is the case but if you were allowed to be operating in a mastery framework 
 if you were allowed to really take agency over your learning and when you get something wrong embrace it view that failure as a moment of learning that number
  that could really master calculus or or understand organic chemistry is actually a lot closer to one hundred percent  
 and this isn 't even just a nice to have 
 i think it 's a social imperative we 're exiting what you could call the industrial age and we 're going into this
  it 's clear that some things are happening in the industrial age society was a pyramid  at the base of the pyramid 
 you needed human labor 
 in the middle of the pyramid you had an information processing  a bureaucracy class and at the top of the pyramid you had your your owners of capital and and your entrepreneurs and and your creative class  
 but we know what 's happening already as we go into this information revolution the bottom of that pyramid
  take over even that middle tier  information processing that 's what computers are good at 
 so as a society we have a question all this new productivity is happening because of this technology but who participates in it 
 is it just going to be that very top of the pyramid in which case what does everyone else do how do they operate or do we do something that 's more aspirational 
 do we actually attempt to invert the pyramid  where you have a large creative class
 almost everyone can participate as an entrepreneur an artist as a researcher  
 and i don 't think that this is utopian  i really think that this is all based on the idea that if we let people tap into their potential
 by mastering concepts  by being able to exercise agency over their learning that they can get there 
 and when you think of it as just a a citizen of the world it 's pretty exciting
 think about the type of equity we can we have and the rate at which civilization could even progress 
 and so i 'm pretty optimistic about it i think it 's going to be a a pretty exciting time to be alive  thank you
