  like to dedicate this one to all the women in south africa
 those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid and of course i
  i m dedicating it also to my grandmother whom i think that she really played quite a lot of important role especially for me when i was an activist
 and being harassed by the police you will recall that in one thousand nine hundred and seventy six june sixteen the students of south africa boycotted
 the language of afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor as you know
 they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in afrikaans biology mathematics and
  what about our languages
 and the students wanted to speak to the government and police answered with bullets
 so every year june sixteen we will commemorate all those
 comrades or students who died and i was very young then
 i think i was eleven years and i started asking questions and that s when my political education you know
  started and i joined later on the youth organization under the african national congress
 so as part of organizing this and whatever this commemoration the police will round us up as you know
 they call us like leaders and i used to run away from home when i know that maybe the police might be coming
  around the ninth or tenth of june or so and
 my grandmother you know one time said no look you re not going to run away this is your place you stay here
 and indeed
 the police came because they ll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like after the twentyth or so
 so it was on the tenth of june and they came and they surrounded the house
 and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house
 and opened the kitchen door
 and she said to them vusi 's here
 and you 're not going to take him tonight i 'm tired of you having to come here harassing us while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes he is here and you 're not going to take him
  i 've got a bowl full of boiling water the first one who comes in here gets it
  all the
 lights
  you 're not
 going to
