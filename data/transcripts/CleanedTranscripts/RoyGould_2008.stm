  less than a year from now the world is going to celebrate the international year of astronomy  which marks the 400th anniversary of galileo 's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope
  in a few months the world is also going to celebrate
 the launch of a new invention
  from microsoft research  which i think is going to have as profound an impact on the way we view the universe as galileo did four centuries ago 
 it 's called the worldwide telescope 
 and i want to thank ted and microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention 
 and i want to urge you  when you get a chance to give it a closer look at the ted lab downstairs
  the worldwide telescope
 takes the best images from the
 world 's greatest telescopes on earth and in space  and has woven them seamlessly
 to produce a holistic view of the universe
  it 's going to change the way we do astronomy  it 's going to change the way we teach astronomy and i think most importantly it 's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe  
 if we were having this ted meeting in our grandparents ' day that might not be so big a claim 
 in one thousand nine hundred and twenty for example you weren 't allowed to drink if you were a woman you weren 't allowed to vote  and if you
 looked up at the stars and the milky way
  way on a summer night  what you saw
 was thought to be the entire universe in fact the head of harvard 's
 observatory back then gave a great debate in which he argued that the milky way galaxy was the entire universe  
 harvard was wrong big time of course we know today
 that galaxies extend far beyond our
  we can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe  
 all the way back in time  almost to the moment of the big bang itself  we can see across the entire spectrum of light  
 revealing worlds that had previously been invisible
  we see these magnificent star nurseries where
 nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise we
  see alien worlds we see alien solar systems three hundred now and still counting
 and they 're not like us  
 we see black holes at the heart of our galaxy  in the milky way  and elsewhere in the universe where time itself seems to stand still 
  our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented and i think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us have fallen through the cracks and that 's changing  i want to just briefly mention three reasons why my colleagues and i 
 in astronomy and in education are so excited about the worldwide telescope and why we think it 's truly transformative 
 first it enables you to experience the universe  the worldwide telescope for me
  a kind of magic carpet that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go second 
 you can tour the universe
 with astronomers as your guides  and i 'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you 're seeing but really
 people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe  who can share their enthusiasm
 and can make the universe a welcoming place  and third you can create your own tours you can share them with friends you can create them with friends
 and that 's the part that i think i 'm most excited about because i think that at heart we are all storytellers and in telling stories  
 each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way 
 we 're going to have a personal universe  i think we 're going to
  see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge  before i introduce the
 person responsible for the worldwide telescope i just want to leave you with this brief thought 
 when i ask people how does the night sky make you feel they often say oh tiny i feel tiny and insignificant 
 well 
  and thanks to the creators of the worldwide telescope
  we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe  
 i think the worldwide telescope will convince you that we may be tiny  but we are truly wonderfully significant  
 thank you i
  what you 're seeing here is
 a wonderful presentation but it 's one of the tours and actually this tour is one that was created earlier and the tours are all totally interactive  so that if i were to go somewhere you may be
  you can pause anywhere along the way  pull up other information
 there are lots of web and information sources about places you might want to go
 you can zoom in you can pull back out the whole resources are there available for you 
 so microsoft this is a project that worldwide telescope is dedicated
 to jim gray who 's our colleague and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible 
 it 's a labor of love for us and our small team
 and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe so basically kids of all ages like us
