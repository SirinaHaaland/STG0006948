  i thought we 'd just talk a little bit  and i wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a
  for those of you who have seen the picture in the
 little bio it might have given it away i 'm a double amputee and
 i was born without fibulas in both legs i was amputated at age one  and i 've been
 running like hell ever since all over the place ss well why don 't you tell them how you got to georgetown
  i won a full academic scholarship out of high school they pick three students out of the nation every year to
 get involved in international affairs and so i i won a full ride to georgetown and i 've been there for
 four years love it ss when aimee got there she decided that she 's kind of curious
  i 've always been involved in sports i played softball for five years growing up 
 i skied competitively throughout high school  and i got a little restless in college because i wasn 't doing anything for about a year 
 and i 'd never competed on on a disabled level you know  i 'd always competed against other
  i 'd never even met another amputee until i was seventeen  and
 i heard that they do these
 these track meets with all disabled runners and i figured oh i don 't know about this  but before i judge it let me go see what it 's all about so i
 booked myself a flight to boston in ' ninety five nineteen years old and
 definitely the dark horse candidate at this race i 'd never done it before i went out
  a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet to see how far i could run and about fifty meters was
 enough for me panting and heaving  and
 i had these legs that were made of a wood and plastic compound attached with velcro straps big thick five ply wool socks on
 you know  not the most comfortable things but all i 'd ever
  up there in boston against people wearing legs made of all things carbon graphite and
 you know  shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things and they 're all looking at me like ok we know who
 's not going to win this race and 
 i mean i went up there expecting i don 't know what i was expecting but you know when i saw
 a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet two inches
 dan o 'brien jumped five ' eleven in ' ninety six in atlanta  i mean if it just gives you a comparison of these are
 truly accomplished athletes without qualifying that word athlete and so i decided to give this a shot 
  heart pounding i ran my first race and i
 i beat the national
  you 've got speed you 've got natural speed but you
 don 't have any skill or finesse going down that track you were all over the place
 we all saw how hard you were working and so i decided to call the track coach at georgetown and i thank god i didn 't know just how
 huge this man is in the track and field world he 's coached five
  olympians and the man 's office is lined from floor to ceiling with all america
 certificates of all these these athletes he 's coached he 's
 just a rather intimidating figure and i called him up and said  listen i
 ran one race and i won
  on some of your practices see what drills you do and whatever that 's all i wanted just two practices can i just sit in and see what you
  coached a disabled athlete so therefore he had no preconceived notions of what i was or wasn 't capable of and i 'd never been coached before so this was like 
 here we go let 's start on this trip so
 he started giving me four days a week of his lunch lunch break his free time and i would
 come up to the track and
  good enough you can run on our women 's track team here
  speed i joined the women 's track team and no disabled person had ever done that run at a collegiate
 level so i don 't know it started to become an interesting mix
  and you know
  training in georgetown and knowing that i was going to have to get used to seeing the backs of all these women 's shirts you know i 'm running against the next flo jo and they 're all looking at me like 
 hmm what 's you know what 's going on here and
 putting on my georgetown uniform and and going out there and knowing
  in order to become better and i 'm already the best in the country you know you have to train with people who are inherently better than you and i went
 out there and made it to the big east which was sort of the championship race 
 really really hot and it 's the first i had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio  and
 i didn 't realize at that time that
  amount of sweating i would be doing in the sock it actually acted like a lubricant and i 'd be kind of pistoning in the socket and
 at about eighty five meters of my one hundred meters sprint in all my glory  i
 came out of my leg like i almost came out of it  in front of like five thousand people and i i mean was just mortified
  two hundred meters and he just sat there like this my pleas fell on deaf ears thank god because you know 
 the man is from
  so what if your leg falls off you pick it up you put the damn thing back on
  she 's all excited her family 's coming down it 's a big deal it 's now two years that you 've been running am no a year ss a year 
 and why don 't you tell them what happened right before you
 go run your race am okay well  atlanta  the paralympics  just for a little bit of clarification are the olympics for people with physical disabilities amputees
  persons with cerebral palsy and wheelchair athletes as opposed to the special olympics which
 deals with people with mental disabilities so
 here we are a week after the olympics and down at atlanta and i 'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago i got out on a gravel track and couldn 't run fifty meters  
 and so here i am never lost i set new records at the at the u s nationals the olympic trials that may and was
 sure  that i was coming home with the gold i was also the
 the only what they call bilateral bk below the knee i was the only woman who would be doing the long jump 
 i had just done the long jump and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says how do you do that you know we 're supposed to have a planar foot so we can 't get off on the springboard i said well
 i just did it no one told me that so it 's funny i 'm three inches within the world record
  and kept on from that point you know so i 'm signed up in the long jump signed up no i made it for the long jump and
 and the 100 meter 
 and i 'm sure of it you know i made the front page of my hometown paper that i delivered for six years you know it was like this is my time for shine 
 and we 're at the
  which is a few blocks away from the olympic stadium these legs that i was on which i 'll take out right now
 i was the first person in the world on these legs i was the guinea pig i 'm telling you 
 this was like talk about a tourist attraction everyone was taking pictures  what is this girl running on 
 and i 'm always looking around like 
 where is my competition it 's my first international
  have to get back to you on that one i wanted to find out times don 't worry you 're doing great 
 this is twenty minutes before my race in the olympic stadium  and they post the heat sheets  and i go over and look and my fastest time which was the world record was fifteen point seven seven then i
 'm looking
  lane two is twelve point eight lane three is twelve point five lane four is twelve point two i said 
 what 's going on and they shove us all into the shuttle bus  
 and all the women there are missing a hand so i 'm just 
 like they 're all looking at
  the scholarship or you know i 'd won
 five golds when i skied in everything i came in first and georgetown that was great  i was
  it was the best training because this was atlanta here we are like crme de la crme and there is no doubt about it that i 'm going to lose big and 
 you know i 'm just thinking oh my god my whole family got
 in a van and drove down here from pennsylvania and you know i was the only female u s sprinter  
 so
 they call us out
  my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd like the ones who are close enough to to the starting line to see and i 'm like
  sensation of me versus germany and everyone else estonia and poland was in this
 this heat and the gun went off and all i remember was
 finishing last and
 fighting back tears of frustration and and incredible incredible this this feeling of just being overwhelmed  and i had
  this if i had won everything but it was like  what was the point all this training i had transformed my life
  i became a collegiate athlete you know i became an olympic athlete and it made me really think about how
 the achievement was getting there i mean the fact that i set my sights just a year and three months before on becoming an olympic athlete
  and saying here 's my life going in this direction and i want to take it here for a while 
 and just seeing how far i could push it and the fact that i asked for help how many people jumped on board how many people gave of their time and their expertise
 and their patience to deal with me and that was this collective
  fifty people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to atlanta so i
 apply this sort of philosophy now to everything i do 
 sitting back and realizing the progression how far you 've come at this day to to this goal you know
 it 's important to focus on a goal i think but
  also recognize the progression on the way there and how how you 've grown as a person that 's the
 hair follicles on them and i can paint my toenails and
 seriously like i can wear heels  like you guys don 't understand what that 's like to be able to just go into a shoe store and
 buy whatever you want ss you got to pick your height am i got to pick my height exactly laughter
 patrick ewing who played for georgetown in the ' 80s comes back every summer and
 i had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he 'd come in with foot injuries
  these are my sprinting legs made of carbon graphite like i said
  silicon sheath i roll over to keep it on which when i sweat you know  i 'm pistoning out of it
  little bit of an art in them but without having the silicon sock i 'm just going to try slip in it
 and so i run on these  and have shocked half the world
 these these
 are supposed to simulate
 the actual form of a sprinter when they run if you ever watch a sprinter the
 ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track so when i stand in these legs  my hamstring and my glutes are contracted as they would be
  had i had feet and were standing on the ball of my 
 it 's a company in san diego called flex foot and i was a guinea pig as i hope to continue to be in
 every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out but actually these like i said are still the actual prototype  i need to get some new ones because
  these i got in a place called bournemouth england about two hours south of london  and i 'm the only person in the united
  serious athlete on the track i want to be feminine off the track and
 i think it 's so important not to be limited in any capacity whether it 's you know  your mobility or
 even fashion i mean i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want the shoes i want the skirts i want and
 i 'm hoping to try to bring
 to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people
 they 're also silicon this is a really basic basic prosthetic limb under here  it 's like a barbie foot
 under this it
 is it 's just stuck in this position
  good you can see it but like it really is there 're veins
 on the feet and then my heel is pink and my achilles ' tendon that moves a little bit  and
 it 's really an amazing store i got them a year and two weeks ago and
 this is just a silicon piece of skin i mean  what happened was two years ago this man in belgium was saying
 if i can go to madame tussauds ' wax museum and see
 jerry hall replicated down to the color of her eyes looking so real as if
 she breathed  why can 't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg
 or an arm or a hand i mean they make ears for burn victims they do amazing stuff with silicon ss 
 two weeks ago  aimee was up for the arthur ashe award at the espys  and she came into town
  and she rushed around and she said i have to buy some new shoes we 're an hour before the espys  and she she thought she 'd gotten a  two inch heel but she 'd actually bought a
  i need a little bit off
  actually going back in a couple of weeks to
 get some improvements i want to get legs like these made for flat feet so i can wear sneakers because i can 't with these ones so
