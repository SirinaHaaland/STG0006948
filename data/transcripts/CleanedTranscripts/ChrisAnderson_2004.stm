  i 'd like to speak about about technology trends  which is something that
 many of you follow but we also follow for related reasons 
 obviously being a technology magazine technology trends are are something that we write about
 but also it
 's part of being any monthly magazine you live in the future and we have a long lead time we have to plan issues many months in advance we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months nine months down the road so we 're in the forecasting business
  we also like a lot of companies create a product that 's based on technology trends
  this case ours is about
 ideas and information and if we 're lucky some entertainment  but the concept 's quite the same 
 and so we have to understand not only why tech 's important where it 's going  but also very importantly when
 the timing is is everything and it 's interesting when you look at the predictions made
 during the peak of the boom in the
  or internet advertising they were all right
 they were just wrong in time 
 almost every one of those has come true just a few years later  but the difference of a few years on on stock market valuations is obviously extreme  
 and that 's why timing is everything you 've probably seen something like this before this is the classic gartner hype curve which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology
  's lifespan and just for fun we put a bunch of technologies on it to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak or whether they were about to crash into
 the the trough of disillusionment 
 or
 rise back in the slope of enlightenment etc and this is one way to do technology forecasting get a sense of where technology
  and then anticipate the next upturn we tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important we 'll typically do it twice once we want to do it first we
 want to be the first to do it for the geeks who appreciate that we 'll catch it right there at the 
 we put linux on the cover  but then it comes back and sufficiently big technologies
 are going to hit the mainstream and they 're going to burst out and then it 's time to do it again last year  and that
  's one way that we we try to time technology trends  
 i 'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that i call my grand unified theory of predicting the future but it 's
 closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future  it 's based 's based on the presumption the observation even
  all important technologies go through four stages in their life at least one of one of the four stages  sometimes all four of the stages  
 and at each one of these stages can be seen as a collision
 a collision with
 something else for example a critical price line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world it 's an inflection point
  and these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology 's life is going to be and maybe how you
 can do something about it the first is the critical price the first stage in a technology 's advance is that it 'll fall below a critical price  
 after it falls below a critical price  it will tend if it 's successful to rise above a critical mass a penetration
  and that 's another important point  
 and then finally  a lot of technologies commoditize  towards the end of their life they become nearly free each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it it 's an opportunity for the technology to change and even if you missed  
 you know the first
  but hasn 't done displacement yet and hasn 't done free yet there 's still more opportunity in that i 'd like to demonstrate what i mean by this by telling the
 story of the dvd  which is a technology which has done all of these the dvd as you know was introduced in the 
 and it was quite expensive  but you can see that by one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight it had fallen below four hundred dollars and four hundred dollars was a psychological threshold
  it started to take off and you can see that the the units started to trend up the hidden inflection point it was taking off 
 the next thing it hit a year later 
 was critical mass in this case  twenty percent is often a good proxy for critical mass
 in a household and what 's interesting here is that something else took off along with it
 suddenly you have a dvd in the house you 've got high quality digital
 video you have a reason to have a big screen television you have a reason for dolby five point one surround sound 
 and maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them  and bring the rest of your entertainment in what 's interesting also is note that netflix was founded in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine reed hastings
  he clearly saw that that was a moment that was an inflection point that he could do something with 
 the next phase it hit was displacement  you can see around see around two thousand and one it finally out sold the vcr  
 and here too  
 you can see the implications in the world at large netflix was right the netflix model could capitalize on the dvd in a way that
  among the dvd 's many assets is that it 's very small you can stick it in the mailer
 and post it cheaply  that gave an advantage that was an implication of the technology 's rise that wasn 't obvious to everybody  
 and then finally  dvds are approaching free  there 's a company called apex a no name chinese firm who
 has  several times in the past year been the number one
  but they 're getting very very cheap and look at the interesting implication of it as they get cheaper  the premium brands the sonys and
  are gaining them they 're being commodified  and that 's what happens when things go to zero  it 's a tough market out there 
 now they 've introduced these four these four ways of looking at technology these four stages of technology 's life i
 'd like to talk about some other technologies out there just technologies on our radar and i 'll use this lens these four as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its
 top 10 technologies out there they 're just examples of technologies that are in each each one of these
 periods  but i think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers these intersections are interesting to think about start with
 gene sequencing as you probably know  gene sequencing in a large part because it 's built on computers is falling in price at a kind of a moore 's
 if craig venter indeed comes today he may tell you something about this
 to sequence the human genome for forty million dollars by the end of this year that 's as opposed to to billions just a few years ago  
 you know  our ability to
 to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer what 's interesting is that at the same time the number of genes that we 're discovering
  rising very quickly each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test there will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done very cheaply
  if you want to know
  you can learn about your own mosaic 
 here 's another technology that that 's approaching
 a critical price this is a fascinating research
  drug compounds and cocktails 
 in january two thousand the price was was ten thousand dollars or twenty seven dollars a day  
 the generics came in first in brazil and elsewhere  and the effect was just dramatic on pricing  
 today
 it 's less than fifty cents a day
  what 's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity if you look at the
 correlation between these two as the anti retrovirals come down the number of people you can treat goes radically up  and
 the clinton foundation and who
 believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by two thousand and five two million in sub saharan africa  
 and the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that 
 linux is another good example
 now we 've switched to critical mass these are now technologies that are hitting critical mass  if you look here here 's linux in red  and it 's hit twenty percent  
 interestingly it 's done a crossover before but not the crossovers that matter the crossover that 's going to matter is the one with the blue  
 but you can look and see the direction those lines are going you can see that at the twenty
  now taken seriously it 's not just for
 for the geeks any more that is i imagine what people in redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about 
 another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars i don 't know whether anybody has a prius two thousand and four but they 're fantastic  and if you look at the trends here by about two thousand and eight and i don 't think this is a crazy forecast
 they 'll be two percent of auto sales two percent isn 't twenty percent but in the car
  business which is slow moving that 's huge
 that 's arrival at two percent you start seeing them on the roads everywhere  and what 's interesting about
 about the hybrids taking off is you 've now introduced electric motors to to the automobile industry it 's the first radical change  in automobile technology in one hundred years and once you have electric motors you can do anything  
 you can change the structure
  of the car in any way you want  you can have regenerative braking you can have drive by wire you can have replaceable body shapes
 it 's a little thing that starts with a hybrid but it can lead to a whole new era of the car 
 voice over ip is something you may have heard something about again it 's kind of coming out of nowhere it 's a little hard to use right now there 's a company created by the kazaa founders
 called skype look at these numbers they launched it in august of last year  they already have nearly four million registered users
 that that 's critical mass  
 and the same thing 's happening on the carrier side  you 're looking at ip taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards 
 this is a tipping point
 if malcolm 's here  forgive me
 and it 's going to change the economics  and the speed  and the players in the
  industry it 's going to look a little bit like that 
 and finally  
 free free is really really interesting free is something that comes with digital  because
 the reproduction
  because it 's such an efficient protocol it comes with fiber optics because there 's so much bandwidth free is
 the gift of silicon valley to the world it 's an economic force  it 's a technical force it 's a deflationary force if
 not handled right it is abundance as opposed to scarcity free
  is probably the most interesting thing and here you have
 just the number of songs that can be stored on on a hard drive you know there could be a film 's [ unclear ] there but it 's basically every song ever made
 could be stored on four hundred dollars worth of storage
 by two thousand and eight  it takes
 that entire element  the physical element of songs off the table  and
  the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes  and hollywood 's worried as well they 're facing a force
 that they haven 't faced before  and their response is draconian 
 and not necessarily the the one that 's going to get them out of this 
 and finally i 'll give you one last
  last example of free perhaps the most powerful of all i mentioned fiber optics
 their abundance tends to make things free this is the price of a of a phone call to india per minute  and what 's interesting is that it was just one thousand nine hundred and ninety
 when it was
 more than two dollars a minute
 india had still has a regulated phone system and so and so did we it was
  there was just so much fiber out there  you couldn couldn 't hold back and look how quickly the price
