  what do men have to do with gender equality  gender equality is about women right  i mean the word
  about women 
 actually i 'm even here speaking as a middle class white man now i wasn 't always a middle class white man 
 it all happened for me about thirty years ago when i was in graduate school 
 and a bunch of us graduate students got together one day  and we said you know there 's an
  explosion of writing and thinking in feminist theory but there 's no courses yet 
 so we did what graduate students typically do in a situation like that we said  ok  let 's have a study group we
 'll read a text we 'll talk about it we 'll have a potluck dinner 
 so every week eleven women and me got together 
 we would read some text in feminist theory and have a conversation about it and during one of our conversations
 i witnessed an interaction that changed my life forever it was a conversation between two
 women one of the women was white and one was black and the white woman said this is going to sound very anachronistic now
 the white woman said all women face the same oppression as women all women are similarly situated in patriarchy
 and therefore all women have a kind of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood 
 and the black woman said i 'm not so sure  let me ask you a question so the black woman says to the white woman 
 when you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror what do you see 
 and the white woman said i see a woman 
 and the black woman said you see that 's the problem for me because when i wake up
  in the morning and i look in the mirror she said i see a black woman to me race is visible but to you race is invisible you don 't see it 
 and then she said something really startling she said that 's how privilege works 
 privilege is invisible to those who have it 
 it is a luxury i will say to the white people sitting in this room not to have to think about race every split second of our lives
 privilege is invisible to those who have it 
 now remember i was the only man in this group  so when i witnessed this i went oh no 
 laughter and somebody said well what was that reaction and i said well  when i wake up in the morning and i look in the mirror  i see a human being  i 'm kind
  the generic person you know i 'm a middle class white man i have no race no class no gender i 'm universally generalizable 
 so i like to think that was the moment i became a middle class white man  
 that class and race and gender were not about other people they were about me 
 i had to start thinking about them  and it had been privilege that had kept it invisible to me for so
  i wish i could tell you this story ends thirty years ago in that little discussion group  
 but i was reminded of it quite recently at my university where i teach  i have a colleague and she and i both teach the sociology of gender course on alternate semesters 
 so she gives a guest lecture for me when i teach  i give a guest lecture for her when she teaches  so i walk into her class to give a guest lecture about three hundred students in the room  
 and as i walk in one of the students looks up and says
  objective opinion 
 all that semester whenever my colleague opened her mouth what my students saw was a woman  
 i mean if you were to say to my students there is structural inequality based on gender in the united states they 'd say well of course you 'd say that you 're a woman you 're biased when i say it they go wow is that interesting is that going to be on the test how do you spell ' structural
  so i hope you all can see this is what objectivity looks like 
 disembodied western rationality 
 and that by the way is why i think men so often wear ties 
 because if you are going to embody disembodied western
  rationality you need a signifier 
 and what could be a better signifier of disembodied western rationality than a garment that at one end is a noose and the other end points to the genitals
  making gender visible to men is the first step to engaging men to support gender equality  
 now when men first hear about gender equality when they first start thinking about it  they often think many men think well  that 's right  that 's fair  that 's just that 's the ethical
  but not all men  
 some men think the lightning bolt goes off and they go oh my god yes gender equality and they will immediately begin to mansplain to you your oppression
 they see supporting gender equality something something akin to the cavalry like thanks very much for bringing this to our attention ladies we 'll take it from here 
  there 's another group though that actively resists gender equality  that sees gender equality as something
 that is detrimental to men 
 i was on a tv talk show opposite four white men this is the beginning of the book i wrote ' angry white men '
 these were four angry white men who believed that they white men in america
 were the victims of reverse discrimination in the workplace  
 and they all told stories about how they were qualified for jobs qualified for promotions  they didn 't get them they were really angry  and the reason i 'm telling you this is i want you to hear the title of this particular show  
 it was a quote from one of the men  and the quote
  a black woman stole my job 
 and they all told their stories qualified for jobs qualified for promotions didn 't get it really angry  and then it was my turn to speak 
 and i said i have just one question for you guys  and it 's about the title of the show '
 a black woman stole my job ' actually it 's about one word in the title i want to know about the word ' my '
 where did you get the idea it was your job 
 why isn 't the title of the show ' a black woman got the
  job ' or ' a black woman got a job ' 
 because without confronting men 's sense of entitlement  i don 't think we 'll ever understand why so many men resist gender equality 
 look we think this is a level playing field
  so any policy that tilts it even a little bit we think oh my god water 's rushing uphill  it 's reverse discrimination against us 
 so let me be very clear 
 white men in europe and the united states are the beneficiaries of the single greatest affirmative action program in the history of the world  it is called the history of the world
  to engaging men but why should we support gender equality of course it 's fair  it 's right and it 's just 
 but more than that gender equality is also in our interest as men  
 if you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives gender equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live gender equality
 is good for countries  it turns out according to most studies 
 that those countries that are the most gender equal are also the countries that score highest on the happiness scale  
 and that 's not just because they 're all in europe 
 even within europe those countries that are more gender equal also have the highest levels of happiness
  it is also good for companies  research by catalyst and others has shown has shown conclusively that the more gender equal companies are
 the better it is for workers the happier their labor force is  they have lower job turnover  they have lower levels of attrition  they have an easier time
 recruiting  they have higher rates of retention higher job
  satisfaction higher rates of productivity  
 so the question i 'm often asked in companies is boy this gender equality thing that 's really going to be expensive huh 
 and i say oh no in fact what you have to start calculating is how much gender inequality is already costing you 
 it is extremely expensive 
 so it is good for business  
 and the other thing is it 's good for men
 it is good for the kind of lives we want to live because young men especially have changed enormously  
 and they want to have lives that are animated by terrific relationships with their children they expect
 their partners their spouses their wives to work outside the home and be just as committed to their careers as they are i was talking to give you an illustration
  of this change
 some of you may remember this when i was a lot younger  there was a riddle that was posed to us some of you may wince to remember this riddle this riddle went something like this
 a man and his son are driving on the freeway and they 're in a terrible accident  and the father is killed
  and the son is brought to the hospital emergency room  and as they 're bringing the son into the hospital emergency room the emergency room attending physician sees the boy and says oh i can 't treat him that 's my son 
 how is this possible 
 we were flummoxed by this  we could not figure this out 
 laughter well  i decided to do a little experiment with my 16 year old son he
  of his friends
 hanging out at the house watching a game on tv recently  so i decided i would pose this riddle to them  just to see to gauge the level of change well
  they want to be able to balance work and family with their partners they want to be involved fathers now  it turns out
 that the more egalitarian our relationships the happier both
  partners are 
 data from psychologists and sociologists are quite persuasive here i think we have the the persuasive numbers the data to prove to men that gender equality is not a zero sum game  but a win win 
 here 's what the data show  now when men begin the process of
  we often have two phrases that we use to describe what we do we pitch in and we help out 
 and i 'm going to propose something a little bit more radical one word share 
 because here 's what the data show  when men share housework and childcare  their children do better in school 
 their children have lower rates of absenteeism higher rates of achievement they are less likely to be
  diagnosed with adhd they are less likely to see a child psychiatrist  they are less likely to be put on medication  
 so when men share housework and childcare  
 their children are happier and healthier  and men want this  when men share housework and childcare  their wives are happier
  not only that their wives are healthier  their wives are less likely to see a therapist less likely to be diagnosed with depression less likely to be put on medication more likely to go to the gym 
 report higher levels of marital satisfaction  
 so when men share housework and childcare  their wives are happier and healthier  and men certainly want this as well  
 when men share housework and childcare the men are healthier  they smoke less  drink less
  recreational drugs less often they are less likely to go to the er but more like to go to a doctor for routine screenings  they are less likely to see a therapist less likely to be diagnosed with depression less likely to be taking prescription medication  
 so when men share housework and childcare the men are happier and healthier  and who wouldn 't
  when men share housework and childcare  they have more sex 
 now of these four fascinating findings which one do you think men 's health magazine put on its cover 
 housework makes her horny 
 not when she does it now i will say just to remind
  these data were collected over a really long period of time  so i don 't want
 listeners to say hmm ok i think i 'll do the dishes tonight these data were collected over a really long period of time  
 but i think it shows something important  that when men 's health magazine put it on their cover they also called
  that gender equality is in the interest of countries of companies 
 and of men and their children and their partners  that gender equality is not a zero sum game it 's not a win lose it is a win win for everyone 
 and what we also know
 is we cannot fully empower women and girls unless we
  engage boys and men  we know this and my position is that men
 need the very things that women have identified that they need to live the lives they say they want to live in order to live the lives that we say we want to live 
 in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen on the eve of one of the great suffrage demonstrations down fifth avenue in new york city
  writer in in new york wrote an article in a magazine and the title of the article was feminism for men 
 and this was the first line of that article feminism will make it possible for the first time for men to be free
