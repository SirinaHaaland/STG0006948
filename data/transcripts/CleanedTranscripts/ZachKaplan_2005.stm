  keith and i lead a research team we investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties 
 over the last three years  we found over two hundred of these things and so we looked back into our library
 and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted 
 of these
  six the first one that we 're going to talk about is in the black envelope you 're holding it comes from a company
 in japan called geltech now go ahead and open it up keith schacht now
 be sure and take the two pieces apart 
 what 's unexpected about this is that it 's soft  but it 's also a strong magnet
  zach and i have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this 
 we spent a long time thinking about why this is and
 it 's just recently that we realized  it 's when we see something unexpected it changes our understanding of the way things work 
 as you 're seeing this gel magnet for the first time if you assume that all magnets had to be hard then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work
 now  it 's important to understand what the unexpected properties are but to really think about the implications of what this makes possible  
 we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world 
 so a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors  if you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material
 if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn 't make a loud noise and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed
 imagine taking the same material  
 but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker you know
 this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door in your closet  and you could literally stick
 your shoes up instead of using a shelf for me  i really love this idea if
 you come to my apartment and see my closet i 'm sure you 'd figure out why
  the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications
 it helps you see why this is significant what the potential is but we 've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference zk 
 it was like six months ago that keith and i were out in l a and we were at starbucks having coffee with roman coppola he works on mostly music videos
  and commercials with his company the directors bureau
 as we were talking roman told us that he 's kind of an inventor on the side and we were showing him the same gel magnet that you 're holding in your hand and you know we shared the same ideas 
 and you could see it in his face roman starts to get really excited
 and he whips out this manila folder he opens it up  and keith and i look in 
 and he starts showing us concepts that he 's been working on these things just get him really excited and so we 're looking at these concepts
  were just like 
 whoa this guy 's good because the way that he presented the concept his approach was totally different than ours he sold it to you
 as if it was for sale right now  
 when we were going in the car back to the airport we were thinking why was this so powerful 
 and as we thought about it more we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience
 just as if you saw it on tv so for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau
 to create a commercial for a product a product from the future
  we showed the concept to a few people before this and they asked us when 's it coming out so i just wanted to let you know
  's not actually coming out just the concept is zk 
 so now when we dream up these concepts it 's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint  
 so i just want to quickly explain how this would work 
 this is the magnetically levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial the gel that you 're holding would be lining the bottom of the board 
 now this is important for two reasons one  the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that if it were to hit the rider in the head it wouldn 't injure him in addition
  see from the diagram on the right the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you 're going down  the force of the water rushing down in addition to that repulsion force would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market  
 it 's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system
 when you get to the very bottom of the slide
  kick it to keith to explain why that 's important from a technical standpoint ks so i 'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal  it 's not a magnetic material  
 but something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you
  you see the magnet fell really slowly 
 now i 'm not going to get into the physics of it 
 but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet 's falling  the greater the stopping force zk now  our next technology is actually a 10 foot pole and i have it right here in my pocket 
  some of them automatically unroll like this one 
 they can be made to automatically roll up or they can be made stable like zach 's to hold any position in between zk
 as we were talking to the vendor to try to learn about how you could apply
  or how they 're being applied currently
 he was telling us that in the military
 they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their on their chests very concealed and then when they 're out on the field erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base 
 in our brainstorms  we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal so at the end of the game you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag 
 ks now the interesting thing about this is
  have to be an engineer to appreciate why a  10 foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting 
 laughter so we decided to go out onto the streets of chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this man i clean my ceiling fans with that and
 i get the spider webs off my house i do it that way woman i
 'd make my very own walking stick woman i would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree
  a spear that when you went deep sea diving you could catch the fish really fast and then roll it back up and you could swim
 easier yeah 
 zk now  for our next technology we 're going to do a little demonstration  and so we need a volunteer from the audience you sir
  we need you to stand right in front of the ted sign
  has been brought to you by target
  to the audience the temperature of your shirt go ahead sj it 's cold ks now the reason it 's cold is that 's it 's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns
 it 's a dry liquid developed by 3m it 's perfectly clear  it 's odorless it 's colorless  
 it 's so safe you could drink this stuff 
  before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends sj excellent thank you ks thanks for coming up let 's give him a big round of applause so
 what 's the significance of this dry liquid early versions of the fluid were actually used on a cray supercomputer
 now the unexpected thing about this is that zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we 'd damage the electronics that we 'd get him wet that we 'd hurt the books or the computers 
 it works because it 's non conductive so you can see here you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn 't cause any damage you can circulate it to draw the heat away  but today it 's most widely used in office buildings in the sprinkler system as
  a fire suppression fluid again it 's perfectly safe for people it puts out the fires doesn 't hurt anything  
 but our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game 
 so during halftime it could rain down on the players cool everyone down and in a matter of minutes it would dry wouldn 't hurt the court zk 
 our next technology comes to us from a company in japan called sekisui chemical one of their r  & d engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer  
 while he was doing this
  an unexpected thing we have a video to show you
  so you see there it didn 't bounce back now this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing  it 's technically called shape retaining property 
 now think about your interactions with aluminum foil
  is common in metal  you bend a piece of aluminum foil and it holds its place contrast that with a plastic garbage can and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back
  for example you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist  but doesn 't use a buckle taking it a little further if you wove those strips together
 kind of like a little basket you could make a shape retaining sheet 
 and then you could embed it in a cloth so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table so that way on a windy day it wouldn 't blow away 
 for our next technology it 's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself because it 's an ink
  so we 've prepared a video to show it applied to paper ks 
 as this paper is bending  the resistance of the ink changes 
 so with simple electronics  you can detect how much the page is being bent 
 now to think about the potential for this think of all the places ink is supplied on business
  on the back of cereal boxes board games any place you use ink you could change the way you interact with it zk 
 so my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book this could totally change the way that you interface with paper 
 you see the dark line on the side and the top as you turn the pages of the book the book can actually detect what page you 're on based on the curvature of the pages 
 in addition if you were to fold in one of the corners  then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes
  for our last technology we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works
  to smell like you narrator fresh watch from inventables dairy farms  packaging that changes color when your milk 's gone off don 't let milk spoil your morning zk 
 now this technology was developed by these two guys professor ken suslick and neil rakow of the university of illinois ks now the way it works
  there 's a matrix of color dyes 
 and these dyes change color in response to odors so the smell of vanilla that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow  this matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells 
 but like in the milk commercial if you know what odor you want to detect then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor zk 
 right it was that that started a conversation with professor suslick and myself and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible beyond
  detecting spoiled food it 's really where the significance of it lies 
 his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene and
 he kind of comically explained that time after time what the firemen would say is they would rush to the scene of the crime they would look around if there were no dead policemen it was ok to go
  i mean this is a true story they 're using policemen as canaries 
 but more seriously they determined that you could develop a device that can can smell better than the humans  and say if it 's safe for the firemen 
 in addition he 's spun off a company from the university called chemsensing where they 're working on medical equipment
  a patient can come in and actually blow into their device by detecting the odor of particular bacteria or viruses  or even lung cancer  
 the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results this can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients 
 currently they 're using a method of trial and error but this could tell you precisely what disease you have ks 
 so that was the six we had for you today but i hope you 're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating because every one of these six
  changed our understanding of what was possible in the world  prior to seeing this we would have assumed a 10 foot pole couldn 't fit in your pocket
 something as inexpensive as ink couldn 't sense the way paper is being bent  every one of these things and we 're constantly trying to find more zk 
 this is something that keith and i really enjoy doing i
 'm sure it 's obvious to you now  but it was actually yesterday that i was reminded of why i was having a conversation with steve jurvetson
  by the escalators and he was telling me that when chris sent out that little box one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand the sand that doesn 't get wet  he said that he was playing with it with his son  
 and you know his son was mesmerized because he would dunk it in the water he would take it out and it was bone dry 
 a few weeks later he said that his son was playing with a lock of his of his mother 's hair  and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair  and he took the thing and he looked up to steve and he said
  hydrophobic string 
 i mean  after hearing that story that really summed it up for me  thank you very much
