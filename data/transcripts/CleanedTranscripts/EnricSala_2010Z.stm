  to tell you two things today one is what we have lost and two a way to bring it back  and let me start with this this is my baseline  
 this is the mediterranean coast
 with no fish  bare rock
 and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae something like this is what i first saw when i jumped in the water for the first time
 in the mediterranean coast off spain now if an alien came to earth
 let 's call him joe
 what would joe see if joe jumped in a coral reef there are many things the alien could see very unlikely joe would
  jump on a pristine coral reef a virgin coral reef with lots of coral sharks crocodiles manatees groupers turtles etc 
 so probably what joe would see would be in this part in the greenish part of the picture 
 here we have the extreme with dead corals microbial soup and jellyfish  and where the
  this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now with very few corals algae overgrowing the corals lots of bacteria  and where the large animals are gone  
 and this is what most marine scientists have seen too  this is their baseline this is what they think is natural
 because we started modern science with scuba diving long after we started degrading marine ecosystems  so i 'm going to get us
  all on a time machine  and we 're going to the left we 're going to go back to the past to see what the ocean was like 
 and let 's start with this time machine the line islands  where we have conducted a series of national geographic expeditions this sea is an archipelago belonging to kiribati that spans across the equator
 and it has several uninhabited unfished pristine islands and a few inhabited islands  so let 's start with the first one christmas
  over five thousand people most of the reefs are dead most of the corals are dead overgrown by algae
 and most of the fish are smaller than the pencils we use to count them 
 we did two hundred and fifty hours of diving here in two thousand and five we didn 't see a single shark  
 this is the place that captain cook discovered in one thousand seven hundred and seventy seven and he described a huge abundance of sharks biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats while they were going ashore 
 let 's move the
  dial a little bit to the past fanning island two thousand five hundred people the corals are doing better here lots of small fish this is what many divers would consider paradise this is where you can see most of the florida keys national marine sanctuary  
 and many people think this is really really beautiful  if this is your baseline  
 if we go back
 to a place
 like palmyra atoll where i was with jeremy jackson a few years ago  the corals are doing better
 and there are sharks you can see sharks in every single dive  and this is something that is very unusual in today 's coral reefs  
 but then if we shift the dial two hundred five hundred years back  then we get to the places where the corals
 are absolutely healthy and gorgeous forming spectacular structures  and where the predators
 are the most
  have we learned from these places  this is what we thought was natural  
 this is what we call the biomass pyramid if we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them  
 this is what we would expect most of the biomass is low on the food chain the herbivores  the parrotfish the surgeonfish that eat the algae then the plankton feeders
 the little animals floating in the water  
 and then we have a lower biomass of carnivores and a lower biomass of top head or the sharks the large snappers the large groupers  
 but this is a consequence  this view of the world is a consequence of having studied degraded reefs 
 when we went to pristine reefs  we realized that the natural world was upside down 
 this pyramid was inverted the top head
  does account for most of the biomass in some places up to eighty five percent like kingman reef  which is now protected  
 the good news is that in addition to having more predators there 's more of everything 
 the size of these boxes is bigger we have more sharks more biomass of snappers more biomass of herbivores too like these parrot fish
 that are like marine goats  they clean the reef everything that grows enough to be seen they eat
 and they
 keep the reef clean and allow the corals to replenish 
 not only do these places these ancient pristine places have lots of fish but they also have other important components of the ecosystem like the giant clams pavements of giant clams in the lagoons up to twenty twenty five per square meter 
 these have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world and they filter the water they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens
  but
 still now we have global warming  if we don 't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law or their remoteness  this is great but
 the water gets warmer
 for too long and the corals die  so how are these fish these predators going to help well what we have seen is that in this particular area
  the water was too warm for too long and many corals bleached
 and many died in christmas where the food web is really trimmed down where the
 large animals are gone  the corals have not recovered in fanning island  the corals
 are not recovered but
 you see here a big table coral that died and collapsed 
 and the fish have grazed the algae  so the turf of algae is a little lower then you go to palmyra atoll
  that has more biomass of herbivores  and the dead corals are clean and
 the corals are coming back  and when you go to the pristine side did this ever bleach  
 these places bleached too but they recovered faster the more intact the more complete [ and ] the more complex your food web the higher
  more likely that the system is going to recover from the short term impacts of warming events 
 and that 's good news so we need to recover that structure we need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there
 so the ecosystem can adapt to the effects of of global warming  
 so if we have to reset the the baseline if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left 
  there are several ways one very clear way is the marine protected areas especially no take reserves that we set aside
 to allow for the recovery for marine life  and let me go back to that image of the of the mediterranean 
 this was my baseline this is what i saw when i was a kid and at the same time i was watching jacques cousteau 's shows on tv with all this richness and abundance
  and i thought that this richness
 belonged to tropical seas and that the mediterranean was a naturally poor sea 
 but little did i know  until i jumped for the first time in a marine reserve and this is what i saw 
 lots of fish after a few years between five and seven years fish come back they eat the urchins  and then the algae
 grow again so you have this little algal forest and in the size of a laptop you can find more than one hundred species of algae
 hundreds of species of little
 animals that then feed the fish  
 so that the system recovers  and this particular place the medes islands marine reserve is only ninety four hectares  and it brings six million euros to the local economy 
 twenty times more than fishing  
 and it represents eighty eight percent of all the
  these places not only help the ecosystem but also help the people
 who can benefit from the ecosystem
  so let me just give you a summary of what no take reserves do these places when we protect them  
 if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby this is what happens the number of species increases twenty one percent so if you have one thousand species
 you would expect two hundred more in a marine reserve this is very substantial  the size of organisms increases a third so your fish are now this big
 the abundance how many fish you have per square meter increases almost one hundred and seventy percent and the biomass this is the most spectacular change
 four point five times greater biomass on average just after five to seven years in some places up to ten times
 larger biomass inside the reserves  so we have all these things inside the reserve that grow and what do they do they reproduce
 that 's population biology one hundred and one if you don 't kill the fish they take a longer time to die  they grow larger
 and they reproduce a lot and same thing for invertebrates this is the example these are egg cases laid by a snail off the coast of chile  
 and this is how many eggs they they lay on the bottom outside the reserve you cannot even detect this
  one point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant  
 so these organisms reproduce  the little larvae juveniles
 spill over they all spill over  and then people can benefit from them outside too this is in the bahamas nassau grouper  
 huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve and the closer you get to the reserve  the more fish you have 
 so the fishermen are catching more you can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined
 so there is spill over there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help
 people around them  while at the same time the reserve is protecting
 the entire habitat it is building resilience  so what we have now
 or a world without reserves is like a debit account where we withdraw all the time and we never make any deposit reserves are like
  savings accounts we have this principal that we don 't touch that produces returns  social economic
 and ecological and if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves this is like compound interest 
 two examples again of how these reserves can benefit
 people this is how much
 fishermen get everyday in kenya fishing over
  series of years in a place where there is no protection it 's a free for all once the most
 degrading fishing gear  seine nets were removed  the fishermen were catching
 more if you fish less you 're actually catching more 
 but if we add the no take reserve on top of that the fishermen are still making more money by fishing less around an area that is protected  another example
  nassau groupers in belize in the mesoamerican reef  this is grouper sex  and the groupers aggregate around the full moons of december and january for a week 
 they used to aggregate up to the
 tens of thousands thirty thousand groupers about this big in one hectare in one aggregation fishermen knew about these things they caught them 
  and they depleted them when i went there for the first time in two thousand there were only three thousand groupers left  
 and the fishermen were authorized to catch thirty percent of the entire spawning population every year  so we did
 a simple analysis and it doesn 't take
 rocket science to figure out that if you take thirty percent every year  your fishery is going to collapse very quickly  and with the fishery 
 the entire reproductive ability of the species goes extinct  it happened in many places around the caribbean  and they would make four thousand dollars per year  total for the entire
  entire fishery several fishing boats now if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen
 if the fish were not cut  if we brought just twenty divers one month per year  the revenue would be
 more than twenty times higher and that would be sustainable over time so how much of this do we have if this is so good if this is such a
  of this do we have and you already heard that
 less than one percent of the ocean 's protected we 're getting closer to one percent now  thanks to the protections of the chagos archipelago 
 and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing  
 scientific studies recommend that at least twenty percent of the ocean should be protected  
 the estimated range is between twenty and fifty percent for a series of goals of biodiversity and fishery enhancement and resilience  
 now is this
  possible people would ask how much would that cost well let 's think about how much we are paying now to subsidize
 fishing thirty five billion dollars per year 
 many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices  
 well  there are a couple estimates of how much it would cost to create a network of protected areas covering twenty percent of the ocean that would be only a fraction
 of what we are now
 paying the government hands out to a fishery that is collapsing 
 people are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing 
 a creation of a network of reserves would provide direct employment for more than a million people plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits  
 so how can we do that if it 's so clear that these
 savings accounts are good for the environment and for people
 why don 't we have twenty fifty percent of the ocean 
 and how can we reach that goal well there are two ways of getting there  
 the trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the chagos archipelago  
 the problem is that we can create these large reserves only in places where there are no people where there is no social conflict where the political cost is really low
 and the economic cost is also low and
  and a few of us a few organizations in this room and elsewhere are working are working on this but what about the rest of the coast of the world where people live and make a living out of fishing well
 there are three main reasons why we don 't have tens of thousands of small reserves the first one is that people have no idea what marine reserves do
  and fishermen tend to be really really defensive when it comes to regulating or closing an area  even if it 's small 
 second the governance is not right because most coastal communities around the world don 't have the authority
 to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it it 's a top down hierarchical structure where people
 wait for government agents to to come and this is not effective and the government doesn
  have enough resources which takes us to the third
 reason why we don 't have many more reserves is that the funding models have been wrong ngos and governments
 spend a lot of time and energy and resources in a few small areas usually  
 so marine conservation and coastal protection has become a sink for government or philanthropic money and this is not sustainable
  so the solutions are just fixing these three issues first we need to develop a global awareness
  campaign to inspire local communities and governments
 to create no take reserves that are better than what we have now it 's the savings accounts versus the debit accounts with no deposits  
 second  we need to redesign our governance so
 conservation efforts can be decentralized  so conservation efforts don 't depend on
 work from ngos or from government agencies
 and can be created by the local communities like it happens in the philippines and a few other places and third  and very important we need to develop new business models  
 the philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves is not sustainable  we really need
 to develop
 models  business models where
  coastal conservation is an investment because we already know that these
 marine reserves provide social ecological and economic benefits and i 'd like to finish with one thought  which is that
 no one organization alone
 is going to save the ocean 
 there has been a lot of competition in the past  
 and we need to develop a new model of partnership truly collaborative where we are looking for
  complementing not substituting  the stakes are just too high to continue the way we are going  so let 's do that thank you very much
  biomass in the predators that seems impossible how
 could eighty five percent
 survive on fifteen percent es 
 well  imagine that you have two gears of a watch a big one and a small one the big one is moving very slowly  and the small one is moving fast
  that 's basically it the animals at the lower parts of the food chain  they reproduce very fast they grow really fast they produce millions of eggs up there you have sharks and 
  thirty years they reproduce very slowly they have a slow metabolism and basically they just maintain their biomass so basically the production surplus
 of these guys down there is enough to maintain this biomass that is not moving they are like capacitors of
  our picture of a food pyramid is just we have to change that completely
 es at least in the seas what we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid is the equivalent of the serengeti with five lions per wildebeest 
 and on land this cannot work 
 but at least on coral reefs are systems where there is a bottom component with structure we think this is universal but
 we have started studying pristine reefs only very recently ca so the numbers you presented
 really are astonishing  you 're saying we 're spending thirty five billion dollars now on subsidies 
 it would only cost sixteen billion to set up twenty percent of the ocean as
 marine protected areas that actually give new living
 choices to the fishermen as well  
 if the world was a smarter place we could solve this problem for negative nineteen billion dollars  we 've got nineteen billion to spend on health care or something es and then we have
 the under performance of fisheries that
 is fifty billion dollars so again one of the big solutions is have the world trade organization shifting the subsidies to
 sustainable practices ca okay so there 's a lot of examples that i 'm hearing out there about ending this subsidies madness so thank you for those numbers the
 last one 's a personal question a lot of the experience of people here who 've been in the oceans for a long time has just been seeing this
  degradation the places they saw that were beautiful getting worse depressing  talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced of going to these
 pristine areas and seeing things coming back 
 it is a spiritual experience we go there to try to understand the ecosystems to try to measure or count fish and sharks and see how these places are different from the places we know
  feeling
 is this biophilia that e o wilson talks about where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature of raw nature and there only there you
 really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger
 global ecosystem and if it were not for these places that show hope i don 't think i could continue doing this job it would be just too depressing
