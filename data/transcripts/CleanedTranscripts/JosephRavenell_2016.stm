  what do you see 
 most of you see a barbershop 
 but i see an opportunity an opportunity for health 
 an opportunity for health equity
  for black men  the barbershop is not just a place where you get your hair cut or your beard trimmed no it 's much more than that 
 historically  the barbershop has been a safe haven for black men  
 it 's a place where we go for friendship  solidarity and
  it 's a place where we go to get away from the stress of the grind of work
 and sometimes home life  it 's a place where we don 't have to worry about how we 're being perceived by the outside world 
 it 's a place where we don 't feel threatened or threatening 
 it 's a place of loyalty and trust for that reason
  's one of the few places where we can fearlessly be ourselves
 and just talk  
 the talk  the shop talk the conversation that is the essence of the black barbershop  
 i can remember going to the barbershop with my dad as a kid 
 we went to mr mike 's barbershop every other saturday  and like clockwork
  the same group of men would be there every time we went either waiting on their favorite barber
 or just soaking up the atmosphere  i can remember the jovial greeting
 that warmly welcomed us every time we went 
 hey rev they would say to my dad he 's a local pastor  and they treated him like a celebrity
  hey young fella how you doing they would say to me  making me feel just as special  
 i remember the range of the conversations was immense  
 the men would talk about politics and sports and music
 and world news  national news 
  there was some talk about women
 and what it was like to be a black man in america  but many times they also talked about health 
 the conversations about health were lengthy and deep  
 the men often recounted their doctor 's recommendations to cut salt in their diet
 or to eat less fried foods or to stop smoking
 or to
  reduce stress they talked about the different ways you could reduce stress like simplifying one 's love life 
 all ways to treat high blood pressure  there 's a lot of talk about high blood pressure in the
  that 's because almost forty percent of black men have it that means that almost every single black man
 either has high blood pressure or knows a black man who has it  
 sometimes those conversations in the barbershop would be about what happens when high blood pressure is not adequately
  you hear about eddie  he died last week  massive heart attack  he was fifty 
 more black men die from high blood pressure than from anything else  
 even though decades of medical wisdom and science have demonstrated that death from high blood pressure can be prevented with
  timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment  so why is high blood pressure so differentially deadly for black men  
 because too often high blood pressure is either untreated or under treated in black men 
 in part because of our lower engagement with the primary healthcare system
  in particular those with high blood pressure  are less likely to have a primary care doctor than other groups but why 
 some of our earliest research on black men 's health revealed that for many the doctor 's office is associated with fear  
 mistrust  disrespect  and unnecessary
  the doctor 's office is only a place that you go when you don 't feel well and when you do go you might wait for hours
 only to get the run around and to be evaluated by a stoic figure in a white coat who only has ten minutes to give you
 and who doesn 't value the talk  so it 's no wonder that some men don 't want to be bothered
 and skip going to the
  doctor altogether  especially if they feel fine 
 but herein lies the problem you can feel just fine
 while high blood pressure ravages your most vital organs  
 this is denny moe  owner
  of denny moe 's superstar barbershop in harlem  i 've been lucky enough to have denny as my barber for the last eight years  
 he said to me once hey doc you know  lots of black men trust their barbers more than they trust their doctors 
 this was stunning to me at first  but not so much when you think about it 
 black men have been with their current barbers on average as long as i 've been with denny about eight years  
 and black men see their barbers about every two weeks 
 not only do you trust your barber with your look and with your style  
 but you also trust him with your secrets and sometimes your life  
 denny like many barbers is more than just an
  a businessman and confidant  he 's a leader and a passionate advocate for the well being of his community  
 the very first time i walked into denny moe 's shop he wasn 't just cutting hair  
 he was also orchestrating a voter registration drive
 to give a voice to his customers and his community 
 with this kind of activism and community
  investment that typifies the black barbershop of course
 the barbershop is a perfect place to talk about high blood pressure and other health concerns in the community 
 first the barbershop is not a medical setting 
 and so it doesn 't have all the negative psychological baggage that comes along with that 
 when you 're in a barbershop
 and you 're among friends who share your history your struggle
 and your health risks  second because the barbershop is a place of connection  loyalty and trust 
 it 's a place where you 're more open to have a conversation about health
 and especially about high blood
  after all conversations about high blood pressure have all the elements of great shop talk 
 stress and high blood pressure  food and high blood pressure  
 relationships and high blood pressure and yes what it 's like to be a black man in america
 and high blood pressure  
 but you can do more than just talk about high blood pressure in the barbershop you can concretely take action
 here we have an opportunity to partner with the denny moe 's of the world
 and empower communities to address the health inequities that uniquely affect it 
 when high blood pressure screening expanded from clinics and hospitals to communities in the 1960s and ' 70s black physicians like
  eli saunders in baltimore
 and dr keith ferdinand in new orleans were at the forefront of bringing health promotion to community hubs in urban black neighborhoods  
 these pioneers paved the way for my professional journey
 with barbershops and health which began in chicago
 in medical school  
 the very first research project that i worked on as a medical student was to help design healthcare interventions that would appeal to black
  men  we conducted about a dozen focus groups
 with a broad  cross section of black men  
 and we learned that for them being healthy was as much about being perceived as healthy as it was about feeling healthy 
 and that feeling good
 went hand in hand with looking good 
 this work led to the development of
  project brotherhood a community clinic founded by dr eric whitaker
 that provided tailored healthcare to black men  
 part of this tailored care involved having a barber on the premises to reward the men who came for needed healthcare with a free haircut 
 to let the men
  valued how they looked as well as how they felt  and that what was important to them was also important to us  
 but while there 's only one project brotherhood  
 there are thousands of black barbershops where the intersection of health and haircuts can be cultivated  
 the next stop on my journey was dallas
  where we learned that barbers were not only willing but fully able to roll up their sleeves and participate
 in delivering needed health services to improve the health of their customers and their community 
 we teamed up with an amazing cadre of black barbers and taught them how to measure blood pressure and how to counsel their customers and refer them to doctors to help manage high blood pressure  
 the barbers were not only willing to do it
 but they were damn good at it 
 over a three year period  the barbers measured thousands of blood pressures resulting in hundreds of black men being referred to doctors for medical care of their high blood pressure  
  partnerships resulted in a
  twenty percent increase in the number of men
 who were able to achieve target blood pressure levels and a three point drop on average in the blood pressure of each participant 
 if we were to extrapolate that three point drop to every single black man with high blood pressure in america we would prevent eight hundred heart attacks  
 five hundred strokes and nine hundred deaths from high blood pressure
 in just one year
  our experience with barbershops has been no different in new york city where my journey has currently led me 
 with an incredible team of diverse research assistants community health workers and volunteers 
 we 've been able to partner with over two hundred barbershops and other trusted community venues
 to reach over seven thousand older black men  and we 've offered high blood pressure
  screening and counseling to each and every one of them 
 thanks to denny moe and the myriad other barbers and community leaders who shared the vision of opportunity and empowerment
 to make a difference in their communities we 've been able to not only lower blood pressure in our participants  but we 've also been able to impact other health indicators
 so what do you see 
 what is your barbershop 
 where is that place for you
 where people who are affected by a unique problem can meet a unique solution 
 when you find that place see the opportunity  thank you
