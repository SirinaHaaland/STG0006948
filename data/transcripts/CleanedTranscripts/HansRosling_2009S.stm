  about your mindset does your mindset correspond to my dataset 
 if not one or the other needs upgrading isn 't it when i talk to
  we learned it in college and what is the definition then the definition everyone knows they say but then you know i press them like this  so one girl said very
  it 's very easy western world is a long life in a small family developing world is a short life in a large family 
 and i like that definition because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset  and here you have the dataset 
 so you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family one two three four five children per woman on this axis  and here length of life life expectancy
  concept about the world  and really this is about the bedroom whether the man and woman decide to have small family and take care of their kids  and how long 
  they will live it 's about the bathroom and the kitchen if you have soap water and food you know  you can live long 
 developing world and we had one set of countries up there which was the western world they had small families and long life  
 and you are going to see here the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime  then the developing countries applied soap and water vaccination 
 and all the developing world started to apply family planning  and partly to usa who help to provide
  technical advice and investment  and you see all the world moves over to a two child family and a life with sixty to seventy years but some countries 
  remain back in this area here  and you can see we still have afghanistan down here we have
  had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born 
 and we in fact when we have played this over the world i was at the global 
  health conference here in washington last week  and i could see the wrong concept even
  't realize the improvement of mexico there and china in relation to united states  look here when i move them forward here we go  
 they catch up there 's mexico it 's on par with
  united states in these two social dimensions there was less than five percent of the specialists in global health that was aware of this
 this  this great nation mexico has the problem that arms are coming from north across the borders so they had to stop that 
 because they have this strange relationship to the united states you know  but if i would change this axis here i would instead  put income per person
  income per person i can put that here  and we will then see a completely different picture 
 by the way i 'm teaching you how to use our website gapminder world while i 'm correcting this  
 because this is a free free utility on the net  and when i now finally got it right  i can go back
 two hundred years in history  and i can find united states up there  and i can let the other countries be shown
 and now i have income per person on this axis  and united states only had some one two thousand dollars at that time  
 and the life expectancy was thirty five to forty years on par with afghanistan today
 and
 what has happened in the world  i will show now  this is instead of studying history for one year at university you can watch me for one minute now
  you can see how the brown bubbles  which is west europe  
 and the yellow one  which is the united states  they get richer and richer and also start to get healthier and healthier and this is now one hundred years ago  where the rest of the world remains behind 
 here we come  
  we are so scared about flu isn 't it it 's still remembered  the fall of life expectancy  and then we come up not until
 independence started look here you have china over there  you have india over there and this is what has happened did
  you note there that we have mexico up there  
 mexico is not at all on par with the united states but they are quite close and especially it 's interesting to see china and the united states during two hundred years
 because i have my oldest son now working for google after google acquired this software because in fact this is child labor my son and his wife sat in a closet
 for many years and
  and my youngest son who studied chinese in beijing  so they come in with the two perspectives i have you know  and my son youngest son who studied in beijing in china he got a  long term perspective  
 whereas when my oldest son who works for google he should develop develop by quarter 
 or by half year or google is quite generous so he can have one or two years to go  but in china they look generation after generation because they
 remember the very embarrassing period for one
  hundred years when they went backwards  
 and then they would remember the first part of last century  which was really bad  and we could go by this  so called great leap forward but this was 
 eventually brought health to china and then he died and then deng xiaoping started this amazing
  isn 't it strange to see that the united states first grew the economy and then gradually got rich  whereas china could
 get healthy much earlier  because they applied the knowledge of education nutrition  and then also benefits of penicillin and vaccines and family planning 
 and asia could have social development before they got
  so to me as a public health professor  it 's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now because what you see here  what you see here is the flat world of thomas friedman isn 't it it
 's not really really flat but the middle income countries and this is where i suggest to my students stop using the concept developing world 
 because after all talking about the developing world is like having two chapters in the history of the united states the last
  chapter is about present and president obama  and the other is about the past where you cover everything from washington to eisenhower  
 because washington to eisenhower that is what we find in the developing world  we could actually go to mayflower to eisenhower  
 and that would be put together into a developing
  which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way  which have great entrepreneurs but also have the collapsing countries so how could we make better sense about this 
  well one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution  this is the income distribution of peoples in the world  from $ one this is where you have food to eat these people go to bed hungry and this is the number of
  whether you have a public or a private health service system this is where you can provide health service for your family and school for your children and this is oecd countries green latin america 
 east europe  this is east asia  and the light blue there is south asia  and this is how the world changed it changed like this  
  projections  but i have to stop at the door of lehman brothers there you know because 
 that 's where the projections are not valid any longer
  probably the world will do this and then it will continue forward like this  but more or less this is what will happen  and we have a world which cannot be looked 
  upon as divided we have the high income countries here  with the united states as
  leading power we have the emerging economies in the middle which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout  and we have the low income countries here yeah 
 this is a fact that from where the money comes they have been saving you know over the last decade
  and here we have the low income countries where entrepreneurs are and here we have the countries in
  we have all this at the same time  that 's why it 's so problematic to describe what has happened in the developing world  because it 's so different what has happened there 
 and that 's why i suggest a slightly different approach of what what you would call it and you have huge differences within countries also i heard that your departments here were
  and on this axis  gdp and on this heath child survival  and it doesn 't come as a surprise that africa south of sahara is at the bottom  but when i split it when 
  i split it into into country bubbles the size of the bubbles here is the population then you see sierra leone and mauritius completely different 
  can split the others here is the south asian arab world  
 now all your different departments east europe latin america  and oecd countries  and here were are we have a continuum in the world 
 we cannot put it into two parts it is mayflower down here it is washington here  building building countries  it 's
 lincoln here advancing them it 's eisenhower bringing modernity into
  the countries  and then it 's united states today up here  and we have countries all this way 
 now  this is the important thing of understanding how the world has changed 
 at this point i decided to make a pause 
 and it is my task on behalf of the rest of the world to convey a thanks to the u s taxpayers
  for demographic health survey many are not aware of no this is not a joke  this is very serious  
 it is due to usa 's continuous sponsoring during twenty five years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality that we have a grasp of what 's happening in the world
  providing facts that it 's useful for the society and providing data free of charge on the internet for the world to use thank you very much quite the opposite of the world bank who compiled data
 with government money tax money and then they sell it to add a little profit in a very inefficient
  gutenberg way  
 but
 the people doing that at the world bank are among the best in the world and they are highly skilled professionals  
 it 's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies to deal with the world in the modern way  as we do and when it comes to free data and transparency united states of america
  is one of the best and that doesn 't come easy from the mouth of a swedish public health professor 
 and i 'm not paid to come here no 
 i would like to show you what happens with the data what we can show with this data look here   this is the world with income down there and child mortality  and what has happened in the world 
  and fifty during the last fifty years we have had a fall in child mortality  and it is the dhs that makes it possible to know this  and we had an increase in income and the blue former 
  developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world  we have a continuum but we still have of course congo  up there  we still have as poor countries as we have
  and that 's the bottom billion where we 've heard today about a completely new approach to do it and how fast has this happened  
 well  mdg four the
 united states has not been so eager to use mdg four  
 but you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it because it 's the only child mortality that we can measure  
 and we used to say that it should fall four percent per year 
 let 's see what sweden has done we used to boast about
 fast social progress  that 's where we were one thousand nine hundred one thousand nine hundred sweden was there  same child mortality as bangladesh had one thousand nine hundred and ninety though they had lower income 
 they started very well they used the aid well they vaccinated the kids they get better water and they reduced child mortality with an amazing four point seven percent per year they beat sweden  i run sweden the same sixteen year period second round
  's sweden one thousand nine hundred and sixteen against egypt one thousand nine hundred and ninety here we go  once again the usa is part of the reason here  they get safe water they get food for the poor  and they 
  get malaria eradicated five point five percent they are faster than the millennium development goal and third chance for sweden against brazil here
  amazing social improvement over the last sixteen years and they go faster than sweden  this means that the world is converging 
 the middle income countries the emerging economy  they are catching up they are moving to cities where they also get better assistance for that well the swedish students protest at 
  this point they say this is not fair  because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics that were not available for sweden
  i give you singapore the year i was born  singapore had twice the child mortality of sweden it 's the most tropical country in the world  a marshland on the equator and here we go  it took a little 
  time for them to get independent but then they started to grow their economy  and they made the social investment they got away malaria  they got a magnificent health system that beat both the u s and sweden we never thought it would happen that they would win over sweden
  these green countries are achieving millennium development goals these yellow are just about to be doing this  these red are the countries that doesn 't do it and the policy has to be improved not simplistic extrapolation
  we have to really find a way of supporting those countries in a better way we have to respect the middle income countries on what they are doing  and we have to
  we look at the world  this is dollar per person this is hiv in the countries the blue is africa  
 the size of the bubbles is how many are hiv affected you see the tragedy in south africa there  about twenty percent of the adult population are infected and in spite of them having quite a high income  they have a huge number of hiv infected  
 but you also see that there are african countries down here  
 there is no such thing as an hiv epidemic in africa 
 there 's a number five to ten countries in in africa that has the same level as sweden and united states  
 and there are others who are extremely high  and i will show you that what has happened in
 one of the best countries with the most vibrant economy in africa and a good governance botswana they have a very high level it 's coming down but now it 's not falling because there
  with help from pepfar  it 's working with treatment and people are not dying  and you can see it 's not that easy that it is war which caused this because here in congo  there is war  and here in zambia there is peace  
 and it 's not the economy richer country has a little higher if i split tanzania in its income the richer twenty percent in tanzania has more hiv than the poorest one and
  's really different within each country look at the provinces of kenya  they are very different and this is
 the situation you see it 's not deep poverty it 's the special situation probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population 
 in some countries or some parts of countries in south and eastern africa don 't make it africa  don 't make it a race issue make it a local issue  and do
  prevention at each place in the way it can be done there  so to just end up there are things
 of suffering in the one billion poorest which we don 't know  
 those who live beyond the cellphone  those who have yet to see a computer  those who have no electricity at home this
  this is the disease konzo i spent twenty years elucidating in africa  it 's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation  it 's similar to 
  the pellagra epidemic in mississippi in the ' 30s it 's similar to other nutritional diseases it will never affect a rich person  we have seen it here here in mozambique 
  this is the epidemic in mozambique  this is an epidemic in northern tanzania you never heard about the disease  
  cause crippling throughout the world and over the last two years two thousand people has been crippled in the southern tip of bandundu region that used to be the illegal diamond trade from the
  area in angola that has now disappeared  and they are now in great economic problem and one week ago for the
  were four lines on the internet
