  hate them don 't you  
 that awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives you absolutely crazy 
 knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood  
 that 's awful right  in fact  there 's only one good thing i can think of when it gets to mosquitos 
 when they fly into our bedroom at night they prefer to bite my wife
 but that 's fascinating right  why
 does she receive more bites than i do  and the answer is smell the smell of her body  
 and since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin
 that either attract or repel mosquitos some of us are just more attractive than others so my wife smells nicer than i do
  i just stink more than she does
  either way mosquitos find us in the dark by sniffing us out they smell us 
 and during my ph d i wanted to know exactly
 what chemicals from our skin mosquitos used african malarial mosquitos use to track us down at night and there
 's a whole range of compounds that they do use and this was not going to be an easy task
 and therefore we set up various experiments  
 why did we set up these experiments  because half the world 's population runs the risk of contracting
 a killer disease like malaria
 through a simple mosquito bite 
 every thirty seconds  somewhere on this planet a child dies of malaria  and paul levy this morning he was talking about the metaphor of the seven
  united states well in africa  we have the equivalent of seven jumbo 
 crashing every day  
 but perhaps if we can attract these mosquitos to traps bait it with our smell  we may be able to stop transmission of disease  
 now solving this puzzle was not an easy
  because we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin but we undertook some remarkable experiments
 that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed first we observed
 that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body  strange so we set up an experiment
 whereby we put a naked volunteer
 in a large cage and in that cage we released mosquitos to see where they were biting on the body of that person  and we found some remarkable
  differences on the left here you see the bites
 by the dutch malarial mosquito on this person  they had a very strong preference for biting on the face in contrast the african malarial mosquito
 had a very strong preference for biting the ankles
 and feet of this person  and that of course we should have known all along
  and so we started focusing on the smell of feet on the smell of human feet until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature
 that said that cheese smells after feet
 rather than the reverse think of it and this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment we tried
  with a tiny little piece
 of limburger cheese  which smells badly after feet to attract african malaria mosquitos and you know what it worked 
 in fact  it worked so well
 that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of limburger cheese
 that we 're using in tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos
  than humans  
 limburg  be proud of your cheese 
 as it is now used in the fight against malaria 
 that 's the cheese just to show you 
 my second story
 is remarkable as well  it 's about man 's best friend it 's about dogs
  and i will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria 
 one of the best ways of killing mosquitos is not to wait until they fly around like adults
 and bite people and transmit disease  it 's to kill them when they 're still in the water
 as larvae  why because they are just like the cia in that pool of water these larvae
  are concentrated they 're all together there they are immobile they can 't escape from that water they can 't fly
 and they 're accessible you can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there right  
 so
 the problem that we face with this is that throughout the landscape all these pools of water with the larvae they are scattered all over the place
  it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides  
 and last year we thought very very hard how can we resolve this problem  
 until we realized that just like us we have a unique smell  that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell  
 and so we set up another crazy experiment because we collected the smell of these larvae
  put it on pieces of cloth  and then did something very remarkable 
 here we have a bar with four holes  and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole ooh that was very quick  
 and then you see the dog it 's called tweed it 's a border collie he 's examining these holes and now he 's got it already  
 he 's going back to check the control holes again  but he 's coming back to the first one  and now he 's locking into that smell  which means that now we can use dogs
  with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria 
 this lady is ellen van der zweep she 's one of the best dog trainers in the world and she believes that we can do a lot more 
 since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites
 smell different compared to people that are uninfected she 's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite
 that means that in a population where malaria has gone down all the way  and there 's few people remaining with parasites that the dogs can find these people we can treat them with anti malarial drugs and give the final blow to malaria  
 man 's best friend in the fight against malaria 
 my third story is perhaps even more remarkable  and i should say  has never been shown to the public until today
  yeah  it 's a crazy story  but i believe it 's perhaps the best
 and ultimate revenge against mosquitos ever in fact people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitos
  and the question of course is what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitos  and the answer
 i have right here
 in my pocket
  if i get it it 's a tablet a simple tablet  and when i take it with water
  here in this box i have a cage
 with several hundred hungry female mosquitos
 that i 'm just about to release 
 just kidding  just kidding what i 'm going to show you is i 'm gonna stick my arm into it
 and i will show you how quickly they will bite
 don 't worry i do this all the time in the lab there we go 
 now on the video 
 on the video here 
 i 'm going to show you exactly the same thing except that what i 'm showing you on the video happened one hour after i took the tablet have a look 
 that doesn 't work
  sorry about that 
 i 'm sticking in my arm i 'm giving them a big juicy blood meal i 'm shaking them off and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very very sick indeed here shown in fast motion 
 and three hours later
 what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitos 
 very dead mosquitos  and i 'm going to say ladies and gentlemen we have swapped the cards with mosquitos
  don 't kill us we kill 
 now
 maastricht 
  be prepared
  now think of what we can do with this we can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito born diseases of epidemics 
 right  
 and better still imagine what would happen if in a very large area  everyone would take these drugs this drug for just three weeks  
 that would give us an opportunity to actually eliminate malaria as a disease
