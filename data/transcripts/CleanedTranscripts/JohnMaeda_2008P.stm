  i 'm going to like go through some slides from way back when and walk through them to give you a sense of how i end up here  so  basically it all began with
 this whole idea of a computer
  who has a computer  yeah o k so everyone has a computer  even a mobile phone it 's a computer and
 anyone remember this workbook 
 instant activities for your apple free poster in each book  this was how computing began don 't forget a computer came out it had no software  
 you 'd buy that thing you
  plug it in and it would do absolutely nothing at all 
 so you had to program it and there were great programming like tutorials like this this i mean  this was great it 's like
  you know herbie the apple ii it 's such a great way to i mean  they should make java books like this and
 we 've have no problem learning a program but this was a great grand time of the computer when it was just a raw raw what is it kind of an
  this era coincided with my own childhood i grew up in a tofu factory in seattle  who of you grew up in a family business  
 suffered the torture yes  yes  
 the torture was good wasn 't it good torture it was just life changing you know and so in my life you know i was in the tofu it was a family business and
 my mother was a kind of a designer also she 'd make this kind of like wall of tofu cooking and it would confuse the customers because they all
  was a restaurant a bad sort of branding thing or whatever but anyway that 's where i grew up in  this little tofu factory in seattle  and
 it was kind of like this a small room where i kind of grew up i 'm big there in that picture that 's my dad my dad was kind of like macgyver  really  
 he would invent like ways to make things heavy like back here there 's like 
 concrete block technology here and he would need the concrete blocks to
 to press the tofu because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing and so you have to have heavy stuff to push out the liquid and make it hard tofu comes out in these big batches  
 and my father would sort of cut them by hand i can 't tell you family business story you 'd understand this my father was the most sincere man possible  he walked into a safeway once on a rainy day  slipped broke his arm rushed out
  safeway 
 so instead you know my father 's like  arm 's broken for two weeks in the store and that week now those two weeks were when my older brother and i had to do everything  and 
  that was torture real torture  because you see we 'd seen my father taking the big block of tofu and cutting it
  but anyways the tofu to me was kind of my origin basically 
 and because working in a store was so hard i liked going to school  it was like heaven  and
 i was really good at school  so when i got to mit you know as most of you who are creatives your parents all told you not to be creative
  i was good at art and good at math and my father says  he 's john 's good at math  
 i went to mit did my math but i had this wonderful opportunity because computers had just become visual 
 the apple
 macintosh just came out i had a mac in hand when i went to mit  and
 it was a time when a guy who kind of could cross the two sides it was a good time and so i remember that my first major piece of software was on a direct copy of
 i made
 a desktop publishing system way back when and that was kind of my first step into figuring out how to oh these two sides are kind of fun to mix
  and the problem when you 're younger for all you students out there is your head gets kind of big really easy  and when i was making icons i was like the icon master  and i was like yeah i 'm
  i had the fortune of going to something called a library 
 and in the library i came upon this very book i found this book it 's called thoughts on design by a man named paul rand it 's a little slim volume i 'm not sure if you 've seen 
  this it 's a very nice little book it 's about this guy paul rand who was one of the greatest graphic designers and also a great writer as well  and when i saw this man 's
  i realized how bad i was at design  or whatever i called it back then and i suddenly had
 a kind of career goal kind of in hot pursuit
  so i kind of switched i went to mit finished i got my masters and then went to art school after that 
 and just began to design stuff like chopstick wrappers napkins menus whatever i could get a handle on 
  up in the design world whatever  and isn 't it
 that strange moment when you publish your design remember that moment publishing your designs 
 remember that moment it felt so good didn 't it so i was published you know so wow my design 's in a book you know  after that things kind of got strange and i got thinking about the computer  because the computer to me always kind of bothered me  
 i didn 't quite get it  and paul rand was a kind of crusty designer you know a crusty designer like a good kind of like a good french bread you
 know he wrote in one of his books a yale student
  once said ' i came here to learn how to design not how to use a computer ' design schools take heed this is in the ' 80s in the great clash of computer non computer people a very difficult time actually  
 and this to me was an important message from rand
  and so i began to sort of mess with the computer at the time  this is the first sort of
 play thing i did my own serious play i built a working version of
 illustrator ish thing  it looks like illustrator it can like draw it was very hard to make this actually it took a month to make this part
 and then i thought what if i added this feature where i can say  this point  you can fly like a bird you 're free kind of thing so i could sort of change the
 kind of stability with a little control there on the dial  and i can sort of watch it flip around  and this is in
 and when my professors saw this  they were very upset at me  they were saying  why 's it moving  they were saying make it stop now now i was saying well
 that 's the whole point it 's moving and he says well when 's it going to stop and i said never and he said even worse stop it now  i
  what is this computer  it 's a strange medium  it 's not like print  it 's not like
 video it lasts forever it 's a very strange medium so i went off with this and
 began to look for things even more 
 and so in japan i began to experiment with people  this is actually bad human experiments i would do these things where i 'd have students become pens
  there 's blue pen red pen green
  and he kind of messed up see humans don 't know how to take orders the computer 's so good at it this guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once you know you pen do this and
 you pen do this and so began to have
  with our hands  and then someone discovered this a ha moment where you could use coordinate systems  we thought 
 ah this is when it 's going to happen in the end he drew a house  
 it was the most boring thing  it became computerish we began to think computerish the the x y system and so that was kind of a revelation  
 and after this i wanted to build a computer out of people called a
  a computer where the people are the
 parts
 i have behind this wall a disk drive a cpu a graphics card a memory system they 're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard
  it 's put inside the computer  and
 that little program 's on that cardboard disk
  she wears the disk
  and reads the data off the sectors of the disk and the computer starts up it sort of boots up really and it 's a sort of a working computer and when i built 
  this computer i had a moment of what is it called the epiphany where i realized that the computer 's just so fast
  if you move your mouse  the mouse changes on the screen on the computer when you move your mouse that arrow moves around  
 on this computer  if you move the mouse it takes half an hour for the mouse cursor to change to give you a sense of the speed the scale the computer is just so amazingly fast o k 
 and so after this i began to do experiments for different companies  this is something i did for sony
  to sound  
 so if you talk into the mike you 'll hear some music in your headphones  if you talk in the phone then video would happen  so i began to experiment with industry in different ways with this kind of
 mixture of skills i did this ad i don 't believe in this kind of alcohol but i do drink sometimes  and chanel so getting to do different projects and
 also one thing i realized is that
 i like to make things we like to make things it 's fun to make things and so
  i never developed the ability to have a staff  i have no staff it 's all kind of made by hand these sort of broken hands and
 these hands
 were influenced by this man mr inami naomi this guy was my kind of like mentor  he was the first digital media producer in tokyo  he 's the guy that kind of 
  discovered me and kind of got me going in digital media  he was such an inspirational guy
  we 'd be in his studio like 
 and then he 'd show up from some client meeting he 'd come in and say you know  if i am here  everything is okay and you 'd
 feel so much better you know  and
 i 'll never forget how like  but i 'll never forget how like  he had a sudden situation with his he had an aneurysm
  and so for three years he was out and he could only blink and so i realized at this moment i thought wow how fragile is this this thing we 're wearing this body and mind we 're wearing and so i thought  how do you go 
  for it more how do you take that time you have left and go after it so naomi was pivotal in that  
  computer program has all these images inside the program  so if you can see here you know that program you 're seeing in the corner  if you spread it out  it 's all these things all at once 
  it 's real simultaneity it 's nothing we 're used to working with we 're so used to working in one vector  this is all at the same time the computer lives in so many dimensions
  the same time i was frustrated because i would go to all these art and design schools everywhere  and there were these like the computer lab you know and this is like in
 the late 1990s 
 and this is in basel a great graphic design school and here 's this like dirty  kind of shoddy  kind of dark computer room and i began to wonder is this the goal is this what we want  you know  and
  i began to be fascinated by machines you know like copy machines and so this is actually in basel i noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive this is like a touch screen and i noticed how you can
  only touch five places and so why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere became a question  
  what is this thing
 in front of me this computer thing it didn 't make any sense so i began to make things again this is another series of objects made of old computers from my basement i made
 i took my old macintoshes and made different
 objects out of them from tokyo
  i began to be very disinterested in computers themselves so i began to make paintings out of palmpilots i made this series of
 works  they 're paintings i made and put a palmpilot in the middle as a kind of display that 's sort of thinking  i 'm abstract art what am i  i 'm abstract and so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction  
 i began to be fascinated by plastic so i spent four months making eight plastic blocks
  perfectly optically transparent as a
 kind of release of stress because of that i became interested in blue tape so in san francisco at c c i had a whole exhibition on blue tape i made a whole installation out of blue tape blue painters ' tape and at this point my wife kind of got worried about me so
 i stopped doing blue tape
 and began to think well what else is there in life and
  that would live inside little boxes out of mdf  this is a series of light boxes i made for a show in italy very simple boxes you just press one button and some led interaction occurs
  series of lamps i made this is a bento box lamp it 's sort of a
 plastic rice lamp it 's very friendly i did a show in london last year made out of
 ipods i used ipods as a material  so i took sixteen ipod nanos and made a kind of
 a nano fish basically  recently this is for reebok i 've done shoes for reebok as well  as a kind of a hobby for apparel  so anyways  there are all these things
  the thing i love the most is to experience taste the world the world is just so tasty we think we 'll go to a museum that 's where all the tastes are no they 're all out there so this is like 
 in front of the eiffel tower really actually
 around the louvre area this i found where nature had made a picture for me  this is a perfect 90 degree angle by nature in this strange moment where like these things kind of appeared  we all are creative people 
  we have this this gene defect in our mind we can 't help but stop  right this feeling 's a wonderful thing
  museum  this is from the cape last year i discovered that i had to find the equation of art and design which we know as
 it 's everywhere on the beach i discovered i began to collect every instance of  circle triangle square i put these all back by the way  and i also discovered how
  i brought you guys together again  so  three years ago i discovered the letters m i t occurring in simplicity and complexity my alma mater mit and i had this moment a kind of m night shayamalan moment where i thought  whoa i have to do this  
 and i went after it with passion
  recently this risd opportunity kind of arose going to risd and i couldn 't reconcile this real easy because the the letters had told me mit forever  but i discovered in the french word raison d 'tre 
 i was like aha wait a
 second  and there risd appeared  and so i realized it was o k to go 
 so i 'm going to risd actually
  is i was outside risd and some student wrote this on some block and i thought wow  risd wants to know what itself is and i have no idea what risd should be actually or what it wants to be but one thing i have to tell you is that although i 'm a technologist
