  let 's imagine a sculptor building a statue just chipping away with his chisel  
 michelangelo had this elegant way of describing it when he said every block of stone has a statue inside of it and it 's the task
  the sculptor to discover it 
 but what if he worked in the opposite direction not from a solid block of stone but from a pile of dust  
 somehow gluing millions of these particles together to form a statue 
 i know that 's an absurd notion it 's probably impossible the only way you get a statue from a pile of dust is if the statue built itself
 if somehow we could compel millions of these particles to come together to form the statue now as odd as that sounds that
 exactly the problem i work on in my lab  i don 't build with stone i build with nanomaterials they 're these
 just impossibly small fascinating little objects  they 're so small that if this controller was a nanoparticle a human hair would be the size of this entire room 
 and they 're at the heart of a field we call nanotechnology which
 i 'm sure we 've all heard about and we 've all heard how it is going to change everything
  i was a graduate student it was one of the most exciting times to be working in nanotechnology there were scientific breakthroughs happening all the time  
 the conferences were buzzing there was tons of money pouring in from funding agencies  
 and the reason is when objects get really small they 're governed by a different set of physics that govern ordinary objects like the ones we
 interact with we call this physics quantum mechanics and what it tells you is that you can precisely tune their behavior just by making seemingly small changes to them like adding or removing a handful of atoms or twisting the material  
 it 's like this ultimate toolkit you really felt empowered you felt like you could make anything and we were doing it and by we i mean
 my whole generation of graduate students we were trying to make blazing fast computers using
  we were constructing quantum dots that could one day go in your body and find and fight disease there were even groups trying to make an elevator to space using carbon nanotubes 
 you can look that up that 's true
  anyways we thought it was going to affect all parts of science and technology from computing to medicine  
 and i have to admit i drank all of the kool aid i mean every last drop  
 but that was fifteen years ago
  science was done really important work we 've learned a lot  
 we were never able to translate that science into new technologies into technologies that could actually impact people 
 and the reason is these nanomaterials they 're like a  double edged sword the same thing that makes them so interesting their small size also makes them impossible to work
  it 's literally like trying to build a statue out of a pile of dust and we just don 't have the tools that are small enough to work with them 
 but even if we did it wouldn 't really matter because we couldn 't one by one place millions of particles together to build a technology  
 so because of that all of the promise and all of the excitement has remained just that 
 promise and excitement we don 't have any disease fighting nanobots there 's no elevators to space  and the thing that i 'm most interested in no new types of computing
  now that last one that 's a really important one we just have come to expect the pace of computing advancements to go on indefinitely we 've built entire economies on this idea 
 and this pace exists because of our ability to pack more and more devices onto a computer chip  
 and as those devices get smaller they get faster they consume less power and they get cheaper  and it 's this convergence that
  this incredible pace as an example if i took the room sized computer that sent three men to the moon and back and somehow compressed it
 compressed the world 's greatest computer of its day so it was the same size as your smartphone
 your actual smartphone that thing you spent three hundred bucks on and just toss out every two years would blow this thing away you would not be impressed
  couldn 't do anything that your smartphone does  it would be slow you couldn 't put any of your stuff on it 
 you could possibly get through the first two minutes of a walking dead episode if you 're lucky 
 the point is the progress it 's not gradual  the progress is relentless  it 's exponential it compounds on itself year after year to the point where if you compare a technology from one generation to the next
 and we owe it to ourselves to keep this progress going we want to say the same thing ten twenty thirty years from now look what we 've done over the last thirty years  
 yet we know this progress may not last forever in fact the party 's kind of winding down it 's like last call for alcohol right if you look under the covers 
 by many metrics like speed
  the progress has already slowed to a halt  
 so if we want to keep this party going  we have to do what we 've always been able to do and that is to innovate 
 so our group 's role and our group 's mission is to innovate by employing carbon nanotubes because we think that they can provide a path to continue this pace 
 they are just like they sound they 're tiny hollow tubes of carbon atoms  and their nanoscale size that small size gives rise to these just outstanding electronic properties 
  the science tells us if we could employ them in computing we could see up to a ten times improvement in performance  it 's like skipping through several technology generations in just one step  
 so there we have it we have this really important problem
 and we have what is basically the ideal solution the science is screaming at us this is what you should be doing to solve your problem
  started let 's do this but you just run right back into that  double edged sword this ideal solution contains a material that 's impossible to work with i 'd have to arrange billions of them just to make one single computer chip  
 it 's that same conundrum it 's like this undying problem  
 at this point we said let 's just stop  let 's not go down that same
  's just figure out what 's missing
 what are we not dealing with what are we not doing that needs to be done 
 it 's like in the godfather right when fredo betrays his brother michael we all know what needs to be done fredo 's got to go 
 but michael he puts it off fine i get it their mother 's still alive it would make her upset 
 we just said what 's the fredo in our problem what are we not dealing with what are we not doing but needs to be done to make this a success
  and the answer is that the statue has to build itself we have to find a way somehow to compel to convince billions of these particles to assemble themselves into the technology 
 we can 't do it for them  they have to do it for themselves and it 's the hard way and this is not trivial  
  in this case it 's the only way  
 now as it turns out this is not that alien of a problem
  we just don 't build anything this way  people don 't build anything this way  but if you look around and there 's examples everywhere
 mother nature builds everything this way everything is built from the bottom up  you can go to the beach you 'll find these simple
 organisms that use proteins basically molecules to template what is essentially sand just plucking it from the sea and building these extraordinary architectures
  with extreme diversity 
 and nature 's not crude like us just hacking away  she 's elegant and smart building with what 's available molecule by molecule making structures with a complexity
 and a diversity that we can 't even approach  and she 's already at the nano  she 's been there for hundreds of millions of years we 're the ones that are late to the party
  're going to use the same tool that
 nature uses and that 's chemistry chemistry is the missing tool and chemistry works in this case
 because these nanoscale objects are about the same size as molecules so we can use them to steer these objects around much like a tool that
 's exactly what we 've done in our lab we 've developed chemistry that goes into the pile of dust into the pile of
  and pulls out exactly the ones we need then we can use chemistry to arrange literally billions of these particles into the pattern we need
 to build circuits and because we can do that we can build circuits that are many times faster than what anyone 's been able to make using nanomaterials before 
 chemistry 's the missing tool and every day our tool gets sharper and gets more precise  and eventually and we hope this is within
 a handful of years
  we can deliver on one of those original promises  
 now computing is just one example  
 it 's the one that i 'm interested in that my group is really invested in  but there are others in renewable energy in medicine in structural materials 
 where the science is going to tell you to move towards the nano  that 's where the biggest
 benefit is  but if we 're going to do that the scientists of today and tomorrow are going to need new tools
  and they will need chemistry that 's the point the beauty of science is that once you develop these new tools they 're out there they 're out there forever and anyone anywhere can pick them up and use and use them  and help to deliver on the promise of nanotechnology
 thank you so much for your time
