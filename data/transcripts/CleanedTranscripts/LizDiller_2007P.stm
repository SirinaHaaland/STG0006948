  aside from keeping the rain out and and producing some
 some usable space  architecture is nothing but a special effects machine that delights and disturbs the
  our work is
 across media the work comes in all shapes and sizes it 's small and large this is an
 ashtray a water glass from urban planning and master planning to theater and
 all sorts of stuff the thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space 
 and these are everyday conventions conventions that are so obvious
 that we are blinded by their
  familiarity and i 've assembled a sampling of of work that that all share a kind of productive nihilism
 that 's used in the service of creating a particular special effect and that is something like nothing or something next to nothing
 it 's
 done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference
 in a world that we naturally
 sleepwalk through  this is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the swiss expo two thousand and two on lake neuchatel near geneva  
 and we wanted to use the water not only as a context but as a primary building material we wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere 
  no walls no roof no purpose just a mass of atomized water a big cloud  and this proposal was a reaction to the 
  of emergent technologies
 in recent national and world expositions  which feeds or has been feeding our insatiable appetite for visual stimulation
 with an ever greater digital virtuosity  high definition in our opinion has become the new orthodoxy
  and we ask the question can we use technology high technology
 to make an expo pavilion that 's decidedly low definition 
 that also challenges the conventions of space and skin and rethinks our dependence on vision so this is how we sought to do it water 's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through
 an array of
 thirty five thousand of them  
 and a weather station is on the structure it reads the shifting conditions of temperature humidity  wind direction wind speed  dew point  and it processes this data 
 in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout 
  this is just in construction and there 's a
 tensegrity structure it 's about three hundred feet wide the size of a football field and it sits on just four very delicate columns these are the fog nozzles  
 the interface and basically the system is kind of reading the the real weather and producing kind of 
  very interested in creating weather
  whiteout
 and white noise of the pulsing nozzles  
 so this is an exhibition pavilion where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do
  and we pride ourselves it 's a spectacular anti spectacle in which all the conventions of spectacle
  the audience is dispersed focused attention and dramatic build up and climax are all replaced by a kind of
 attenuated attention that 's sustained by a sense of apprehension
 caused by the fog  and this is very much like how the victorian novel used
 fog in this way  so here the world is put out of focus while our visual dependence is put into
  ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar  so  all the waters of the world are served there so we thought that you know after being
 at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water you could also drink this building  and
  it is sort of a theme but it goes
 a little bit  you know deeper than that we really wanted to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense and maybe share our kind of
 sensibility with our other senses  you know when we did this project
 it was a kind of tough sell because the swiss said well why are we going to spend you know ten million dollars producing
 an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate
  thought well  we tried to convince them and in the end  you know  they adapted this as a as a national icon
 that came to represent swiss doubt
  which we you know  it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of anyway it 's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed
  and so it 's now a memory of an apparition actually  but it
 continues to live in edible form and this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in switzerland
 to have a chocolate bar  anyway moving along 
 so in the ' 80s and ' 90s we were mostly known for independent work such as
 installation artist architect
  we did a lot of media work also a lot of experimental theater projects in two thousand and three the whitney mounted a retrospective
 of our work that featured a lot of this work from the ' 80s and ' 90s however  the work itself
 resisted the very nature of a retrospective and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show this was a piece on tourism
 in the united states this is soft sell for 42nd street this was something done at the cartier foundation master slave at the moma the
 project series a piece called parasite and so there were many many of these kinds of projects  anyway
 they gave us the whole fourth floor and you
  the problem of the retrospective was something we were very were very uncomfortable with it 's a kind of invention of the museum that 's supposed to
 bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work and our work doesn 't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all
  and
 one of the recurring themes by the way that in the work was a kind of hostility toward the museum
  and asking
 about the conventions of the museum like the wall the white wall  so what you see here is basically a plan of many installations that were put there  and we actually had to install 
 white walls to separate these pieces which didn 't belong together  but these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time we used the wall to partition the thirteen installations of the project
  is actually the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element which was a new piece that created that we created for the
 which was a robotic drill basically that went all the way around cruised the museum
 went all around the walls and did a lot of damage 
 so the drill was mounted on this robotic arm we worked with by the way honeybee robotics this
  is the brain honeybee robotics designed the mars driller  and it was really very much fun to work with them they weren 't doing their primary work which was
 for the government  while they were helping us with this 
 in any case the way it works is that an intelligent navigator
 basically
 maps the entire surface
  unfolded it 's about three hundred
 linear feet  and it randomly generates points within a three dimensional matrix  
 it selects a point it guides the drill to that point it pierces the dry wall  leaving a half inch hole before traveling to the next location
  opening views from gallery to gallery clusters of holes randomly opened up
 sections of wall and so this was a three month performance piece in which
 the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element  and also the acoustic separation was destroyed
  also the visual separation  and there was also this constant background groan
 which was very annoying and this is one of the blackout spaces where there 's a video piece that became totally
 not useful  so rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display the wall now actively competed for attention and
 this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance
 basically exposed the discomfort of the work
 to this
 encompassing nature of the retrospective it
 was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text  moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago it 's the 
 the institute of contemporary art in boston  which is on the waterfront
 and there 's not enough time to really introduce the building but i 'll simply say that the building negotiates
  between this outwardly focused nature of of the site you know it 's a really great waterfront site in boston
 and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum  so the nature of the building is that it looks at looking i mean that 's its primary objective
  the building incorporates the site  but it dispenses it in very small doses
 in the way that the museum is choreographed so you come in
 and you 're basically squeezed by the theater by the belly of the theater into this very compressed space where the view is turned off then you come up
 in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall
 this elevator 's about the size of a new york city studio apartment and then this is a view going up and then you could come into the theater which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop and many musicians
 choose to use the theater glass walls totally open the view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light
  then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view the original intention of this space which was
 unfortunately never realized was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out in this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries the intention was really to not get a
  to have the view stalk you so the view would open up as you walked
 from one end to the other this was eliminated because the view was too good and the mayor said no we just want this open 
 the architect lost here but culminating and that 's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk
 is this mediatheque which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building so this is
  's quite substantial so it 's already sticking out into space enough and then from that is this 
 is this small area called the mediatheque  the mediatheque has something like sixteen stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web  
 and
 this was really a kind of very important
  part of this building and here is a point where architecture this is like
 architecture is only a framing device it only edits the harbor view the industrial harbor
 just through its walls its floors and its and its ceiling to only expose
 the the water itself the texture of water much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that
  and here is where we really felt that there was a great
 convergence of the technological and the natural in the project  but there is just no information it 's just
 it 's just hypnosis  moving along to lincoln center these are the guys
  that did the project in the first place fifty years ago  we 're taking over now doing work that ranges in scale from small scale repairs to major renovations 
  and major facility expansions but we 're doing it with a lot less testosterone  this is the extent of of the work that 's to be completed by two thousand and ten 
  and it happens to be our current
 obsession  and it plays a little bit with the purging
 and and adding of distraction it 's alice tully hall  and it 's tucked under the juilliard building
 and descends several
 levels under the street so this is the entrance to tully hall as as it used to be before the renovation which we just started  and we
  asked ourselves why couldn 't it be exhibitionistic like the met or like some of the other buildings at lincoln center  
 and one of the things that we were asked to do was give it a street identity  expand the lobbies and and make it visually accessible  and this building which is just naturally hermetic
  we stripped we basically did a striptease architectural
  where we 're framing with this kind of canopy
 the underside of three levels of expansion of juilliard about forty five thousand square feet
 cutting it to the angle of broadway  and then exposing using that canopy to frame tully hall  before and after shot 
 applause wait a minute it 's just in that state we have a long
  what i wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that i have left to just talk about the hall itself which is kind of where we 're really
 doing a massive amount of work so the hall is is a multi purpose hall the clients have asked us to produce a great
 chamber music hall  now that 's really tough to do with a hall that has one thousand one hundred seats chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and
  they asked us to bring an intimacy  how do you bring an intimacy into a hall  intimacy for us means a lot of different things it means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy 
 one thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall  another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall it 's like a coffin it basically sends all the sound 
  half absorptive half reflective which is not very good for concert sound  this is avery fisher hall  but the notion of junk visual junk was very very important to us to 
  get rid of visual noise  because we can 't eliminate a single seat the architecture is restricted to eighteen inches so it 's a very very thin architecture first we do a kind of partial box and box
  to take away the distraction of the subway noise 
 next we wrap the entire hall almost like this olivetti keyboard with a material with a wood material that basically covers all the surfaces wall 
 ceiling floor stage  steps  everything boxes  but it 's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage  and here 's an acoustic shelf looking up the hall just a section of the stage 
  single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high performance skin  but one more added feature so now that we 've stripped the hall of all visual distraction everything that prevents 
 this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house the audience with the performers 
 the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is
 when the concert starts so what we wanted to do was produce this this effect this lighting effect
  which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls 
 and what it what it entails is
 the use of resin of this very thick resin with a veneer
  of the same kind of wood that 's used throughout the hall in a kind of seamless
 continuity that wraps the hall in light  like a belt of light rather than separating like a proscenium would separate the audience from
  from performers it connects audience with players  and this is
  sense of what this is going to look like in full scale 
 and this is a guy from salt lake city this is what they look like out there 
 and for us i mean it 's really kind of a very strange thing but the moments in the hall
 that the that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin very similar to
  the parting of curtains or or the raising of a chandelier the walls will
 just exude this glow temporarily stealing attention from the stage  and this is tully in construction now
 i have no ending to say except that i 'm a couple of minutes over
