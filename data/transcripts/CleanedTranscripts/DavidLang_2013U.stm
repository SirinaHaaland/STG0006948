  so this video was taken at aquarius undersea laboratory four miles off the coast of key largo about sixty feet below the surface
  uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts  and last year they invited us along for the ride 
 all the footage was taken from our open rov which is a robot that we built in our garage 
 so rov stands for remote operated vehicle  which in our case means our little robot
  back to the computer topside  
 it 's open source meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design it
 's built with mostly off the shelf parts
 and costs about one thousand times cheaper than the rovs james cameron used to explore the titanic 
  they 've been around for decades  scientists use rovs to explore the oceans  oil and gas companies use them for exploration
 and construction what we 've built isn 't unique  it 's how we 've built it that 's really unique  so
 i want to give you a quick story of how it got started so a few years ago  my friend eric and i decided we wanted to explore this underwater
 cave in the foothills of the sierras  
 we had heard this story about lost gold from a gold rush era robbery and we wanted to go up there unfortunately we didn 't have any money and we didn 't have any tools to do it 
 so eric had an initial design idea for a robot
  but we didn 't have all the parts figured out  so we did what anybody would do in our situation  we asked the internet for help 
 more specifically  we created this website openrov com and shared our intentions and our plans
 for the first few months it was just eric and i talking back to each other on the forums
  but pretty soon we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists  and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do  
 we kept working on it we learned a lot we kept prototyping and eventually we decided we wanted to go to the cave we were ready
  so about that time our little expedition became quite a story and it got picked up in the new york times and we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted
  a kit that they could build this open rov themselves  so
 we decided to put the project on kickstarter  and when we did we raised our funding goal in about two hours and all of a sudden had this money to make these kits  
 but then we had to learn how to
 make them i mean we had to learn small batch manufacturing so
 we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation  but we were able to do it we got all the kits
  made thanks a lot to techshop which was a big help to us and we shipped these kits all over the world just before christmas of last year so it was just a few months ago  
 but we 're already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world including this shot from under the ice in antarctica  
 we 've also learned the penguins love robots
  we 're still publishing all the designs online encouraging anyone to build these themselves that 's the only way that we could have done this by being open source we 've created this distributed r & d network and we 're moving faster than any venture backed counterpart 
 but the actual robot is really only half the story 
 the real potential the long term potential is with this community of diy ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe
  what can we discover when there 's thousands
  of these devices roaming the seas  
 so you 're probably all wondering the cave did you find the gold well
 we didn 't find any gold  but we decided that what we found was much more valuable it was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration 
 it 's something that 's not limited to the james camerons of the world but something that we 're all participating in it 's an underwater world we 're all exploring together
