  a few days after my husband paul
 was diagnosed with stage iv lung cancer  we were lying in our bed at home  and paul said it
 's going to be ok 
 and i remember answering back
  just don 't know what ok means yet 
 paul and i had met as first year medical students at yale he was smart and kind and super funny 
 he used to keep a gorilla suit in the trunk of his car  and he 'd say it 's for emergencies only 
 i fell in love with paul as i watched the care he took with his patients
 he stayed late talking with them  seeking to understand the experience of illness and not just its technicalities 
 he later told me he fell in love with me
 when he saw me cry over an
  a heart that had ceased beating  
 we didn 't know it yet  but even in the heady days of young love we were learning how to approach suffering
  together  
 we got married and became doctors i was working as an internist and paul was finishing his training as a neurosurgeon
 when he started to lose weight 
 he developed excruciating back pain and a cough that wouldn 't go away  
 and when he was admitted to the hospital a ct scan revealed tumors in paul
  lungs and in his bones  
 we had both cared for patients with devastating diagnoses  now it was our turn  
 we lived with paul 's illness for twenty two months he wrote a memoir about facing mortality  
 i gave birth to our daughter cady  and we loved her and each other
 we learned directly how to struggle through really tough medical decisions 
 the day we took paul into the hospital for the last time
 was the most difficult day of my life 
 when he turned to me at the end and said i 'm ready 
  i knew that wasn 't just a brave decision it was the right one 
 paul didn 't want a ventilator and cpr in that moment the most important thing to paul
 was to hold our baby daughter 
 nine hours later paul died 
 i 've always thought of myself as a caregiver most physicians do
  and taking care of paul deepened what that meant 
 watching him reshape his identity during his illness  learning to witness and accept his pain 
 talking together through his choices
 those experiences taught me that resilience does not mean bouncing back to where you were before 
 or pretending that the hard stuff isn 't hard  
 it is so
 hard  it 's painful  messy stuff  but it 's the stuff  and
 i learned that when we approach it together  we get to decide what success looks like 
 one of the first things paul said to me after
  i want you to get remarried and i was like  whoa i guess we get to say anything out loud 
 it was so shocking
 and heartbreaking 
 and generous  and really comforting because it was so starkly honest and that honesty turned out to be exactly what we needed
 early in paul 's illness  we agreed we would just keep saying things
 out loud  tasks like making a will or completing our advance directives tasks that i had always avoided
 were not as daunting as they once seemed  i realized that completing an advance directive is an act of love
 like a wedding vow a pact to take care of someone  codifying the promise
 that til death do us part  i will be there 
 if needed  i will speak for you  i will honor your wishes 
 that paperwork became a tangible part of our love story 
 as physicians paul and i were in a good position to understand and even accept his diagnosis
 we weren 't angry about it luckily because we 'd seen so many patients
 in devastating situations and we knew that death is a part of life  
 but it 's one thing to know that it was a very different experience to actually live with the sadness and uncertainty of a serious illness  
 huge strides are being made against lung cancer
  but we knew that paul likely had months to a few years left to live  
 during that time paul wrote about his transition from doctor to patient 
 he talked about feeling like he was suddenly at a crossroads and how he would have thought he 'd be able to see the path 
 that because he treated so many patients maybe he could follow in their footsteps
  but he was totally disoriented  rather than a path  paul wrote i saw instead
 only a harsh  vacant gleaming white desert as if a sandstorm had erased all familiarity 
 i had to face my mortality
 and try to understand what made my life worth living
 and i needed my oncologist 's help to do so 
 the clinicians taking care of paul gave me an even deeper appreciation for my colleagues in health care 
 we have a tough job we
 're responsible for helping patients have clarity around their prognoses
 and their treatment options  and that 's never easy but it 's especially tough
  when you 're dealing with potentially terminal illnesses like cancer  
 some people don 't want to know how long they have left others do  
 either way we never have those answers  
 sometimes we substitute hope
 by emphasizing
  said they painted a rosier picture than their honest opinion when describing a patient 's prognosis 
 it 's an instinct born out of kindness  
 but researchers have found that when people better understand
 the possible outcomes of an illness
  they have less anxiety  greater ability to plan and less trauma for their families  
 families can struggle with those conversations  but for us we also found that information
 immensely helpful with big decisions most notably  
 whether to have a baby  
 months to a few years meant paul was
  not likely to see her grow up  but he had a good chance of being there for her birth and for the beginning of her life  
 i remember asking paul
 if he thought having to say goodbye to a child would make dying even more painful and his answer astounded me
  in order to spite cancer  but because we were learning that living fully
 means accepting suffering 
 paul 's oncologist tailored his chemo so he could continue working as a neurosurgeon which
  initially we thought was totally impossible 
 when the cancer advanced and paul shifted from surgery to writing 
 his palliative care doctor prescribed a stimulant medication so he could be more focused 
 they asked paul about his priorities and his worries  they asked him what
  he was willing to make those conversations are the best way to ensure that your health care
 matches your values  
 paul joked that it 's not like that birds and bees talk you have with your parents where you all get it over with as quickly as possible and then pretend it never happened 
 you revisit the conversation as things change you keep saying things out loud
  i 'm forever grateful because paul 's clinicians felt that their job wasn 't to try to give us answers they didn 't have or
 only to try to fix things for us  but to counsel paul through painful choices when his body was failing
 but his will to live wasn
  i received a dozen bouquets of flowers but i sent just one to paul 's oncologist because
 she supported his goals and she helped him weigh his choices she knew that living
 means more than just staying alive 
 a few weeks ago a patient came into my clinic a woman dealing with
 a serious chronic disease  
 and while we were talking about her life and her health care she said i love my palliative care team 
 they taught me that it 's ok to say ' no ' 
 yeah  i thought of course it is  but many patients don 't feel that 
 compassion and choices did a study where they asked people about their
  health care preferences and a lot of people started their answers with the words well if i had a choice 
 if i had a choice  and when i read that if i understood better
 why one in four people receives excessive or unwanted medical treatment or watches a family
  member receive excessive or unwanted medical treatment 
 it 's not because doctors don 't get it  we do  
 we understand the real psychological consequences on patients and their families the things is we deal with them too 
 half of critical care nurses and a quarter of
  quitting their jobs because of distress
 over feeling that for some of their patients they 've provided care that didn 't fit with the person 's values  
 but doctors can 't make sure your wishes are respected until they know
 what they are would you want to be on life support if it offered any chance of longer life are you most worried
  about the quality of that time  rather than quantity both of those choices are thoughtful and brave  
 but for all of us it 's our choice that 's true at the end of life
 and for medical care throughout our lives if you 're pregnant do you want genetic screening is a knee replacement right or not 
 do you want to do dialysis in
  a clinic or at home the answer is it depends what medical care
 will help you live the way you want to 
 i hope you remember that question the next time you face a decision in your health care 
 remember that you always have a choice  
 and it is
 ok to say no to a treatment that 's not right for you there 's a poem
 by w s merwin it 's just two sentences long that captures how i feel now 
 your absence has gone through me like thread through a needle  everything i do
 is stitched with its color 
 for me that poem evokes my love for paul and a new fortitude
 that came from loving and losing him 
 when paul said it 's going to be ok that didn 't mean
 that we could cure his illness instead
  we learned to accept both joy and sadness at the same time to uncover beauty and purpose both despite
 and because we are all born
 and we all die 
 and for all the sadness and sleepless nights it turns out there is joy  i leave flowers on paul 's grave
  and watch our two year old run around on the grass  i build bonfires on the beach and watch the sunset
 with our friends  
 exercise and mindfulness meditation have helped a lot 
 and someday  i hope i do get remarried 
 most importantly i get to watch our daughter grow
 i 've thought a lot about what i 'm going to say to her when she 's older 
 cady  
 engaging in the full range of experience living and dying love and loss
 is what we get to do being human
 doesn 't happen despite
 suffering it happens within it 
 when we approach suffering together  when we choose not to hide from it 
 our lives don 't diminish they expand 
 i 've learned that cancer isn 't always a battle  or if it is  maybe it 's a fight for something different
  than we thought 
 our job isn 't to fight fate  but to help each other through 
 not as soldiers
 but as shepherds 
 that 's how we make it ok even when it 's not 
 by saying it out loud  by helping each other through
 and a gorilla suit never hurts either
