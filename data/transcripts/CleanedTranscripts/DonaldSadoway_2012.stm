  the electricity powering the lights in this theater
 was generated just moments ago  because the way things stand today electricity demand must be in constant balance
 with electricity supply 
 if in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage some tens of megawatts of wind power stopped pouring into the grid 
 the difference would have to be made up
 from other generators immediately  
 but coal plants nuclear plants can 't respond fast enough 
 a giant battery could with a giant battery we 'd be able to address the problem of intermittency that prevents
  wind and solar from contributing to the grid in the same way that coal gas and nuclear do today 
 you see the battery is the key enabling device here with it we could draw electricity from the sun even when the sun doesn 't shine  
 and that changes everything 
 because then renewables such as wind and solar come
  out from the wings here to center stage  today i want to tell you about such a device  it 's called the liquid metal battery  
 it 's a new form of energy storage that i invented at mit along with a team of my students
 and post docs now the theme of this year 's ted conference is full
  the entire range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation from the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays of which the range of visible light is only a small part 
 so i 'm not here today only to tell you how my team at mit has drawn out of nature a solution to one of the world 's great problems 
 i want to go full spectrum
 and tell you how in the process of developing this new
  technology we 've uncovered some surprising heterodoxies that can serve as
 lessons for innovation  ideas worth spreading  and you know if we
 're going to get this country out of its current energy situation  
 we can 't just conserve our way out  we can 't just drill our way out  we can 't bomb our way out we 're going to do
  it the old fashioned american way we 're going to invent our way out working together now
 let 's get started 
 the battery was invented about two hundred years ago by a professor  alessandro volta at the university of padua in italy  
 his invention gave birth to a new field of science  electrochemistry  and new technologies such as
  electroplating  
 perhaps overlooked volta 's invention of the battery for the first time also demonstrated the utility of a professor 
 until volta nobody could imagine a professor could be of any use 
 here 's the first battery
 a stack of
  zinc and silver separated by cardboard soaked in brine this is the starting point for designing a battery
 two electrodes in this case metals of different composition 
 and an electrolyte in this case salt dissolved in water  the science is that simple 
 admittedly i 've left out a few details now i 've taught you that battery science is straightforward
 and the need for grid level storage is compelling
 but the fact is that today there is simply no battery technology capable of meeting
 the demanding performance requirements of the grid
 namely uncommonly high power long service lifetime and super low cost we need to think about the problem differently
  we need to think big  we need to think cheap  
 so let 's abandon the paradigm of let 's search for the coolest chemistry and then hopefully we 'll chase down the cost curve by just making lots and lots of product  
 instead let 's invent to the price point of the electricity market so
 that means that
 certain parts of the periodic table are axiomatically  off limits this battery needs to be made out of
  i say if you want to make something dirt cheap  make it out of dirt 
 preferably dirt that 's locally sourced  
 and we need to be able to build this thing
 using simple manufacturing techniques and factories that don 't cost us a fortune  
 so about six years ago i started thinking about this problem
  and in order to adopt a fresh perspective  i sought inspiration from beyond the field of electricity storage
 in fact i looked to a technology that neither stores nor generates electricity but instead consumes electricity huge amounts of it 
 i 'm talking about the production of
  hall in the united states and heroult in france and just a few short years following their discovery aluminum changed from a precious metal costing as much as silver
 to a common structural material 
 you 're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter it 's about fifty feet wide and recedes about half a mile row after row of cells that
  inside  resemble volta 's battery with three important differences volta 's battery works at room temperature  it 's fitted with solid electrodes 
 and an electrolyte that 's a solution of salt and water the hall heroult cell operates at high temperature a temperature high enough that the aluminum metal product is liquid 
  water  but rather salt that 's melted  it 's this combination of liquid metal molten salt and high temperature that allows us to send high current through this thing 
 today  we can produce virgin metal from ore at a cost of less than fifty cents a pound that 's the economic miracle of
  that caught and held my attention to the point that i became obsessed with inventing a battery that could capture this gigantic economy of scale  
 and i did  
 i made the battery all liquid
 liquid metals for both electrodes and a molten salt for the electrolyte i 'll show you how
  liquid metal at the bottom 
 molten salt in between  
 so now how to choose the metals 
 for me the design exercise always begins here
 with the periodic table  enunciated by another professor  dimitri
  everything we know is made of some combination of what you see depicted here  and that includes our own bodies  
 i recall the very moment one day when i was searching for a pair of metals that would meet the constraints of earth abundance  
 different opposite density
 and high mutual reactivity  i felt the thrill of realization when i knew i 'd come upon the answer
 magnesium
 for the top layer  and antimony
 for the bottom layer you know
 i 've got to tell you 
 one of the greatest benefits of being a professor  colored chalk 
 laughter so to produce current magnesium loses two electrons to
  become magnesium ion  
 which then migrates across the electrolyte accepts two electrons from the antimony  and then mixes with it to form an alloy  
 the electrons go to work in the real world out here
 a source of electricity it could be something like a wind farm  and then we reverse
 the current  and this forces magnesium to 
 and return to the upper electrode restoring the initial
 constitution of the battery and the current passing
  between the electrodes generates enough heat to keep it at temperature it 's
 pretty cool at
 least in theory  but does it really work  so what to do next  we go to the laboratory  
 now do i hire
 seasoned professionals  
  i hire a student
 and mentor him  teach him how to think about the problem to see it from my perspective
 and then turn him loose this is that student david bradwell  who in this image  appears to be wondering if this thing will ever work 
 what i didn 't tell david at the time was i myself wasn 't convinced it would work  but david 's young and he 's smart
 and he wants a ph d and he proceeds to build
 he proceeds to build the first ever liquid metal battery
 of this chemistry 
 and based on david 's initial promising results  
 which were paid with seed funds at mit i was able to attract major
 research funding from the private sector
 and the federal government  and that allowed me to expand my group to twenty people
 a mix of graduate students post docs and even some undergraduates  and i was able to attract really really good people people who share my passion for science and service to society  not science and service for career building 
 and if you ask these people why they work on liquid metal battery their answer would hearken back to president kennedy 's remarks
 at rice university in
  nine hundred and sixty two when he said and i 'm taking liberties here we choose to work on grid level storage not because it is easy but because it is hard 
 applause so this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery  we start here with our workhorse one watt hour cell  i called it the shotglass
  we 've operated over four hundred of these perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries not just magnesium and antimony  along the way we scaled up to the twenty watt hour cell i call it the hockey puck  
 and we got the same remarkable results  and then it was onto the saucer that 's two hundred watt hours 
 the technology was proving itself to be robust and scalable  
 but the pace wasn 't fast
  enough for us so a year and a half ago  david and i along with another research staff member formed a company to accelerate the rate of progress
  and the race to manufacture product  so today at lmbc  we 're building cells sixteen inches in diameter with a capacity of one kilowatt hour one thousand times the capacity of that initial shotglass cell we call that the pizza
  cell on the horizon it 's going to be thirty six inches in diameter we call that the bistro table  but it 's not ready yet for prime time viewing  
 and one variant of the technology has us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules aggregating the modules
 into a giant battery that fits in a 40 foot shipping container for placement in the field  and this has a nameplate capacity of two
 two million 
 that 's enough energy to meet the daily electrical needs of two hundred american households  so here you have it
  what have we learned from all this 
 so what have we learned from all this let me share with you some of the surprises the heterodoxies 
 they lie beyond the visible temperature  
 conventional wisdom says set it low at or near room temperature  and then install a control system to keep it there
 avoid thermal runaway liquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature with minimum regulation 
 our battery can handle the very high temperature rises that come from current surges  
 scaling  conventional wisdom says reduce cost by producing many liquid metal battery is designed to reduce cost by producing fewer
  but they 'll be larger 
 and finally human resources  conventional wisdom says hire battery experts seasoned professionals who can draw upon their vast experience 
  and knowledge to develop liquid metal battery  i hired students and post docs and mentored them 
 human potential  so you see the liquid metal battery story
 is more than an account of inventing technology  it 's a blueprint for inventing inventors
