  on that basis i feel like i 've really arrived  the other thing to think of is what an honor it is as a politician to give a ted talk
  politics with the expenses scandal has sunk so low there was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing
 rats in their experiments with politicians and someone asked why and they said well there 's no shortage of politicians 
 no one really minds what happens to them
 and after all there are some things that rats just won 't do
 now i know you all love data  so i 'm starting with a  data rich slide this i think is the most important fact to bear in mind in 
 british politics or american politics and that is we have run out of money  we have vast budget deficits this is my global public
  i think what this leads to
 is a very simple recognition that there 's one question in politics at the moment above all other and it 's this one 
 how do we make things better without spending more money  
 because there isn 't going to be a lot of money to improve public services or to improve government or to improve so many of the things that politicians talk about 
 so what follows from that is that if you think
  think
 it 's all about money
 you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and policing
 by spending more money 
 you can only measure progress by spending money you 're going to have a pretty miserable time but if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being
 things like your family relationships friendship community values then actually this is an
  incredibly exciting time to be in politics 
 and the really simple argument i want to make tonight the really straightforward argument is this 
 that if we combine the right political philosophy the right political thinking 
 with the incredible information revolution that has taken place and that all of you know so much more about than
  i think there 's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics remake government remake public services  and achieve what 's up on that slide which is a big increase in our well being that 's the argument
 i want to make tonight so starting with
 the political philosophy  now i 'm not saying for a minute that british conservatives have all the answers of course we don 't 
 but there are two things at heart that i think drive a conservative philosophy that are really
  relevant to this whole debate  the first is this we believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives if you give people more choice if you put them in the driving seat 
 then actually you can create a stronger and better society  and if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today i think you can completely as i 've said remake
 politics remake government remake your public services
  the second thing
 we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature politics and politicians will only succeed
 if they actually try and treat with people
 as they are rather than as they would like them to be 
 now if you combine this very simple very conservative thought go with the grain of human nature
 with all the advances in behavioral economics some of which we
  just hearing about  again i think we can achieve a real increase in well being in happiness in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money  
 now  why do i think now is the moment to make this argument well i 'm afraid you 're going to suffer a short  condensed history lesson
 about what i would say are the
  the bureaucratic age and what we now live in which i think is a 
  age a simpler way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of local control then we went to a world of central control 
 and now we 're in a world of people control 
 local power  central power now people power  now 
  king a thousand years ago  thought he could turn back the waves  couldn 't turn back the waves  couldn 't actually turn back very much  because if you were king a thousand years ago  while it still took
 hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country  there wasn 't much you were in charge of you weren 't in charge of policing justice education health welfare you could just about go to war
 and that was about it this was the pre bureaucratic age
  an age in which
 everything had to be local 
 you had to have local control because there was no nationally available information because travel was so restricted so this was the pre bureaucratic age  
 next part of the cold history lesson the lovely picture of the british industrial revolution  
 suddenly all sorts of transport travel information were possible  and this gave birth to what i like to call  the bureaucratic age and hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully there we are
  have the big  strong  central state it was able
 but only it was able to organize health care education policing justice  
 and it was a world of as i say not local power  but now central power  it had sucked all that power up from the localities  it was able to do
  the next great stage which all of you are so familiar with the massive information revolution just consider this one
 fact 
 one hundred years ago  sending these ten words cost fifty dollars right now here we are linked up to long beach and everywhere else and all these secret locations
 for a fraction of that cost and we can send and receive huge quantities of information without
  what does this mean for our politics for our public services for our government
 well i can 't in the time i 've got give huge numbers of examples  but let me just give
 a few of the ways that life can change  and this is so obvious in a way because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop
  the way we travel the way that business is done that is already happened the information and internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways but it hasn 't in every way yet touched our government so how could this happen 
 well i think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference  in transparency
  in greater choice and in accountability in giving us that genuine people power  if we take transparency here is one of my
 favorite websites the missouri accountability portal in the old days 
 only the government could hold the information and only a few elected people could try and grab that information and question it and challenge it now here on one
  one state in america 
 every single dollar spent by that government is searchable is analyzable is checkable think of the huge change that means any business that wants to 
  bid for a government contract can see what currently is being spent anyone thinking i could do that service better i could deliver it cheaper it 's all available there we have only in government 
  and in politics  started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution
 so complete transparency will make a huge difference  
 in this country if we win the election we are going to make all government spending over twenty five thousand pounds transparent and available online  searchable for anyone to see  
 we 're going to make every contract we 're announcing this today
 available on the internet so anyone can see what the terms are what the conditions are driving huge value for money  but also huge increases
  believe in well being as well  choice now you all
 shop online compare online do everything online  and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface of public services like education  or health care or policing  
 and you 're going to see this change massively we should
  making this change with the information revolution in our country with searchable health sites so you can see what operations work out properly what records doctors have the cleanliness of hospitals
 who does best at infection control all of the information that would once be locked in the department of health is now available for all of us to see  
 and the third of these big changes accountability this i think is a huge change it is a crime map this is a crime map from
 chicago
 so instead of having a situation where only the police have the information about which crimes are committed where  and we have to
 employ people in government to try and hold the police to account  suddenly we 've got this vast opportunity for people power where we as citizens can see what crimes are being committed where when and by whom and we can hold the
  and you can see this
 looks a bit like a chef 's hat but actually that 's an assault the one in blue 
 you can see what crime is committed where and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account  so those three ways transparency  
 accountability
 and choice will make a huge difference  now i also said the other principle that i think we should work on is understanding of people is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature you can achieve so much more 
 now we 're got a huge
  revolution in understanding of why people behave in the way that they do and a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use  we 're working with some of these people we 're being advised by some of these people 
 as was said to try and bring all the experience to book let me just give you one example that i think is incredibly simple and i love 
 we want to get people to be more energy efficient why
  cuts fuel poverty  it cuts their bills  and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time  how do you do it well we 've had government information campaigns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home  we even had one government minister once told us to
 brush our teeth in the dark i don 't think they lasted very long look at what this does
  this is a simple piece of behavioral economics the best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill is to show them their own spending 
 to show them what their neighbors are spending  
 and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending 
 that sort of behavioral economics can transform people 's behavior in a way that all the bullying and all the information and all the badgering from a government
 cannot possibly achieve other examples are recycling we all know we need to recycle more how do
  we make it happen
 all the proof from america is that actually if you pay people to recycle if you give them a carrot rather than a stick you can transform their behavior  
 so what does all this
 add up to here are my two
 favorite u s speeches of of the last fifty
  here we have jfk with that
 incredibly simple and powerful formulation 
 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country an incredibly noble sentiment 
 but when he made that speech what could you do to build the stronger better society  you could fight for your country you could die for your country  you could serve in your country 's civil service but you didn 't really
  and the knowledge and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now  and i think an even more
 wonderful speech which i 'm going to
 read a big chunk of 
 which sums up what i said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money  and more that we should try and measure than money  
 and it is robert kennedy 's beautiful description of why gross national product captures so little 
 it does not allow for the health of our
  children the quality of their education or the joy of their play  
 it does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages  the intelligence of our public debate  
 it measures neither our wit nor our courage  neither our wisdom nor our learning neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country  it measures everything in short  except
  a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put forty years ago  and a beautiful dream forty years ago  but now with the huge advances in information
  technology  with the massive changes in behavioral economics with all that we know about how you advance well being that if we combine those insights
  and using information to make that possible  
 and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature  while at the same time understanding why people behave in the way they do it is a dream more easy to realize today
 than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech forty years ago
