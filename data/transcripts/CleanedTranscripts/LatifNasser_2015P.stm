  this is a story about how we know what we know  
 it 's a story about this woman natalia rybczynski  she 's a 
  and i think she 's particularly interesting because of where she digs that stuff up way above the arctic circle in the remote canadian tundra  
 now one summer day in two thousand and six she was at a dig site called the 
  fyles leaf bed which is less than ten degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole
  because it was a day of walking with your backpack and your gps and notebook and just picking up anything that might be a fossil ln and at some point she noticed something nr 
 rusty kind of 
  the size of the palm of my hand  it was just lying on the surface ln and at first she thought it was just a
 splinter of wood because that 's the sort of thing people had found at the  fyles leaf bed before prehistoric plant parts but
 that night  back at camp nr 
 i get out the hand lens i 'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing it doesn 't quite look like this has tree rings
 maybe it 's a preservation thing but it looks really like 
 bone ln huh so over the next four years she went to that spot over and over and eventually collected thirty
 fragments of that exact same bone  most of them really tiny nr it 's not a whole lot it
 fits in a small ziploc bag ln and she tried to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle  
 but it was challenging nr it 's broken up into so many little tiny pieces i 'm trying to use sand and
  kind of magical when it all fits together ln how certain were you that you had it right that you had put it together in the right way was there a potential that you 'd put it together a different way and have like a
 parakeet or
  what she had she discovered was a tibia a leg bone and specifically one that belonged to
 a cloven hoofed mammal  so something like a cow or a sheep but it couldn 't have been either of those it was just too big nr 
 the size of this thing it was huge it 's a really big
  so what animal could it be having hit a wall she showed one of the fragments to some colleagues of hers in colorado  and they had an idea nr 
 we took
 a saw and we nicked just the edge of it  and there was this really interesting smell
 that comes from it ln it smelled kind of like
  it was a smell that natalia recognized from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab 
 collagen collagen is what gives structure to our bones and usually after so many years it breaks down but in this case the arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it 
 then a year or two later natalia was at a conference in bristol and she saw that
  turns out that different species have slightly different structures of collagen so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone you can compare it to those of known species and 
 who knows  maybe you get a match  
 so she
 shipped him one of the fragments
  and he processed it and compared it to
  known and modern day mammal species  and he found a match  it turns out that the three point five 
  bone that natalia had dug out of the high arctic belonged to
  and i 'm thinking what that 's amazing if it 's true ln so they tested a bunch of the fragments and they got the same result for each one
  yeah natalia had found a giant arctic camel 
 now  when you hear the word camel what may come to mind is one of these 
 the bactrian camel of east and central asia but chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these
 the dromedary  quintessential desert creature
 hangs out in sandy hot places like the middle east and the sahara  has a big old hump on its back for storing water for those long desert treks has big broad feet to help it tromp over sand dunes  
 so how on earth would one of these guys end up in the high arctic 
 well
  have known for a long time turns out even before natalia 's discovery that camels are actually originally
 american 
 they started here for nearly forty
  million years that camels have been around you could only find them in north america  around twenty different species  maybe more ln 
 if i put them all in a lineup would they look different nr yeah you 're going to have different body sizes you 'll have some with really long necks so they 're actually
 functionally like giraffes ln some had snouts like crocodiles nr the really primitive early
  and then about three to seven million years ago one branch of camels went down to south america where they became llamas and alpacas and another branch crossed over the bering land bridge into asia and africa  and then
  around the end of the last ice age north american camels
 went extinct 
 so 
 scientists knew all of that already  but it still doesn 't fully explain how natalia found one so far north like this is temperature wise the polar opposite of the sahara
  now to be fair three and a half million years ago it was on average
  degrees celsius warmer than it is now  so it would have been
 boreal forest so
 more like the yukon or siberia today but still 
 like they would have six month long winters where the ponds would freeze over you 'd have blizzards you 'd have twenty four hours a day of straight darkness
  it that one of these saharan superstars could ever have survived those arctic conditions 
 laughter natalia and her colleagues
 think they have an answer and it 's kind of brilliant what if
 the very features that we imagine make the camel so well suited to places like the sahara
 actually evolved to help it get through the winter 
 what if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand but over snow like a pair of snowshoes 
 what if that hump which huge news to me  does not contain water it contains fat 
 was there to help the camel get through that  six month long winter when food was scarce
  and then only later long after it crossed over the land bridge
 did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment like for instance the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes because having all your fat in one place like a you know fat backpack 
 means that you don 't have to have that insulation all over the rest of your body  so it helps heat dissipate easier
  this crazy idea that what seems like proof of the camel 's quintessential desert nature
 could actually be proof of its high arctic past 
 now  
 i 'm not the first person to tell this story others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or as a keyhole into the future of climate change
 but i love it for a totally different reason 
 for me it 's a story about us about how we see the world and about how that changes  so
 i was trained as a historian  and i 've learned that actually a lot of scientists are historians too they make sense of the past they tell the history of our universe of our planet of life on
  this planet  
 and as a historian you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes nr 
 we make up stories and we stick with it like the camel in the desert right that 's a great story it 's totally adapted for that clearly it always lived there ln 
 but at any moment  you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence you could learn some tiny thing that forces you to
  reframe everything you thought you knew like in this case this one scientist finds this one shard of what she thought was wood  and because of that science 
  has a totally new and totally counterintuitive theory about why this absurd  dr seuss looking creature looks the way it does
  completely upended the way i think of the camel  it went from being this
 ridiculously niche creature suited only to this one specific environment to being this this world traveler
 that that just happens to be in the sahara and could
 end up virtually anywhere
  on a break from her regular gig
  's not even a joke anyway
 but really azuri is here as a living reminder
 that the story of our world is a dynamic one it requires our willingness to readjust to
  we 're all just one shard of bone away from seeing the world anew
