  digital activist in the world today  and you wouldn 't know it by looking at him hazare is a
  he was running a big campaign to address everyday corruption in india a topic that indian elites love to ignore  
 so as part of this campaign he was using all of the traditional tactics that a good gandhian organizer would use so he was on a hunger strike and hazare realized through his hunger
 that actually maybe this time in the 21st century a hunger strike wouldn 't be enough
  so he started playing around with
 mobile activism
 so the first thing he did is he said to people okay 
 why don 't you send me a text message if you support my campaign against corruption so he does this he gives people a short code and
 about eighty thousand people do it okay that 's pretty respectable but then he decides let me tweak my tactics a little bit
 now for those of you who have lived in the global south you 'll know that missed calls are a really critical part of global mobile culture i see people nodding 
  people leave missed calls all the time if you 're running late for a meeting and you just want to let them know that you 're on the way you leave them a missed call  
  i miss you you leave them a missed call  so a note for a dating tip here in some cultures if you want to please your lover you call them and hang up 
 so why do people leave missed calls well the reason of course is that they 're trying to avoid charges associated with making calls and sending texts so when hazare asked people to leave him a missed call
  a little guess how many people actually did this
 million  
 so this is one of the largest coordinated actions in human history  it 's remarkable  and this reflects the extraordinary strength of the emerging indian middle class and the power that their mobile phones bring  
 but he used that hazare ended up with this massive csv file of mobile phone numbers
  that to deploy real people power on the ground to get hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets in delhi to make a national point of everyday corruption in india  it 's a really striking story  
 so this is me when i was twelve years old i hope you see the resemblance  and
 i was also an activist and i have been an activist all my life  i had this really funny childhood where i traipsed around the world
  meeting world leaders and noble prize winners  talking about third world debt as it was then called and demilitarization i was a very very serious child 
 and back then in the early  ' 90s i had a very cutting edge tech tool of my own the
  the fax was the tool of my activism  and at that time it was the best way to get a message to a lot of people
 all at once
  i 'll give you one example of a fax campaign that i ran it was the eve of the gulf war and i organized a global campaign to flood the hotel the intercontinental in geneva 
 where james baker and tariq aziz were meeting on the eve of the war and i thought if i could flood them with faxes we
  there are lots of reasons for that but there 's no doubt that one sputtering fax machine in geneva was a little bit of a bandwidth constraint
 in terms of the ability to get a message to lots of people and so 
 i went on to discover some better tools i cofounded avaaz which uses the internet to mobilize people and now has almost forty million members  and i now run purpose which is a home for these kinds of
  technology powered movements
  so what 's the moral of this story is the moral of this story
  you know what 
 the fax is kind of eclipsed by the mobile phone  this is another story of tech determinism well i would argue that there 's actually more to it than that 
 i 'd argue that in the last twenty years something more fundamental has changed
  than just new tech  
 i would argue that there has been a fundamental shift in the balance of power in the world you ask any activist how to understand the world and they 'll say look at where the power is  who has it 
 how it 's shifting and i think we all sense that something big is happening 
 so henry timms and i henry 's a fellow movement builder got talking one day and we started to think how can we make
 sense of this new world how can we describe it and give it a framework that makes it more useful because we realized that many of the lessons that we were discovering in movements actually applied all over the world in many sectors of our society 
 so i want to introduce you to this framework old power  meet new power  and i want to talk to you about what new power is today  
 new power is the deployment of mass participation
 and peer coordination these are the two key elements to create change and shift outcomes
 and we see new power all around us 
 this is beppe grillo he was a populist italian blogger who with a minimal political apparatus and only some online tools won more than twenty five percent of the vote in recent italian elections 
 this is airbnb  which in just a few years has radically disrupted the hotel
  industry without owning a single square foot of real estate 
 this is kickstarter which we know has raised over a billion dollars from more than five million people 
 now we 're familiar with all of these models but what 's striking is the commonalities the structural features of these new models and how they differ from old power  let 's look a little bit at this 
 old power is held like a currency  new power works like a current old power is held by a few new power
  by a few it 's made by many 
 old power is all about download  and new power uploads and you see a whole set of characteristics that you can trace whether it 's in media or politics or education  
 so we 've talked a little bit about what new power is let 's for a second talk about what new power isn 't 
 new power is not your facebook page
  i assure you that having a social media strategy can enable you to do just as much download as you used to do when you had the radio 
 just ask syrian dictator bashar al assad i assure you that his facebook page has not embraced the power of participation 
 new power is not inherently positive in fact this isn 't an normative argument that we 're making there are many good things about new power  but it can produce bad outcomes more participation more peer
  coordination sometimes distorts outcomes and there are some things like things for example in the medical profession that we want new power to get nowhere near  
 and thirdly  new power is not the inevitable victor  in fact  unsurprisingly as many of these new power models get to scale what you see is this massive pushback
  from the forces of old power just look at this really interesting epic struggle going on right now between edward snowden
  snowden
 and the nsa you 'll note that only one of the two people on this slide is currently in exile  
 and so  it 's not at all clear that new power will be the inevitable victor that said  keep one thing in mind we 're at the beginning of a very steep curve  so you think about some of these new power models right these were just like someone 's
 garage idea a few years ago  and now they 're disrupting entire industries
  so what 's interesting about new power is the way it feeds on itself once you have an experience of new power  you tend to expect and want more of it  so let 's say you 've used a peer to peer lending platform like
 lending tree or prosper  then you 've figured out that you don 't need the bank  and who wants the bank  right  and so that experience tends to embolden you it tends to make you want more participation across more
  of your life and what this gives rise to is a set of values we talked about the models that new power has engendered the 
 what about the values and this is an early sketch at what new power values look like new power values prize transparency above all else it 's almost a religious 
  belief in transparency a belief that if you shine a light on something it will be better and remember that in the
  century this was not at all true people thought that gentlemen should sit behind closed doors and make comfortable agreements 
 new power values of informal  networked governance new power folks would never have invented the u n today  for better or worse
  new power values participation and new power is all about 
 in fact what 's interesting about new power is that it eschews some of the professionalization and
  specialization that was all the rage in the 20th century  
 so what 's interesting about these new power values and these new power models is what they mean for organizations so we 've spent a bit of time thinking   how can we plot organizations
 on a two by two where essentially we look at new power values and new power models and see where different people sit we started with a u s analysis and let me show you some
  interesting findings  so the first is apple 
 in this framework we actually described apple as an old power company 
 that 's because the ideology the governing ideology of apple is the ideology of the perfectionist product designer in cupertino it 's absolutely about that beautiful perfect thing descending
  and it does not value as a company transparency in fact it 's very secretive 
 now apple is one of the most succesful companies in the world so this shows that you can still pursue a successful old power strategy but one can argue that there 's real vulnerabilites in that model 
 i think another interesting comparison is that of the obama campaign versus the obama presidency
  i like president obama but he ran
 with new power at his back right  and he said to people we are the ones we 've been waiting for and he used crowdfunding to power a campaign 
 but when he got into office he governed like more or less all the other presidents did and this is a really interesting
 trend is when new power gets powerful what happens  so this is a framework you should look at
  and think about where your own organization sits on it and think about where it should be in five or ten years  so what do you do if you 're old power well if you 're there thinking
 in old power this won 't happen to us then just look at the wikipedia entry for encyclopdia britannica 
 let me tell you it 's a very sad
  but if you are old power the most important thing you can do is to occupy yourself before others occupy you before you are occupied  imagine that a group 
  of your biggest skeptics are camped in the heart of your organization asking the toughest questions and they can see everything inside of your organization and ask them would they like what they see and should our model change 
  no  i would argue that there are some very real challenges to new power in this nascent phase  
 let 's stick with the occupy wall street example for a moment occupy was this incredible example of new power the purest example of new power  
 and yet  it failed to consolidate  so the energy that it created was great for the meme phase  but they were so committed to participation that they never got anything done  
 and in fact that model means
  that the challenge for new power is  how do you use institutional power without being institutionalized 
 one the other end of the spectra is uber uber is an amazing  highly scalable new power model that network is getting denser and denser by the day  
 but what 's really interesting about uber is it hasn
  really adopted new power values this is a real quote from the uber ceo recently he says 
 once we get rid of the dude in the car he means drivers uber will be cheaper 
 now new power models live and die by the strength of their networks by whether the drivers and the consumers who use the service actually believe in it because they
  not an exercise of top down perfectionism they are about the network  
 and so the challenge  and this is why it 's in no way surprising is that uber 's drivers are now unionizing  
 it 's extraordinary 
 uber 's drivers are turning on uber and the the challenge for uber this isn 't an easy situation for them is that they are locked into a broader  superstrcuture that is really old 
  power  they 've raised more than a billion dollars in the capital markets those markets expect a financial
  return and they way you get a financial return is by squeezing and squeezing your
 your users and your drivers for more and more value and giving that value to your investors  so the big question about the future of new power in my view is 
 will that old power just emerge so will new power elites just become old power and
  or will that new power base bite back will the next big uber be  co owned by uber drivers and i think this going to be a very interesting
 structural question
  of mass participation and peer coordination these
  about new power is that
