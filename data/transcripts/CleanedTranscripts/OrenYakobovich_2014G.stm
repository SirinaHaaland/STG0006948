  i would like to start with the story of mary a woman from an african village 
 her first memories are of her family fleeing violent riots orchestrated by the ruling political party 
 her brother was murdered by
 state sponsored militia  and she was raped more than once just because she belonged to the wrong party 
 one morning a month before the election  mary 's village was called to another intimidation meeting 
 in this meeting there is a man standing in front of them telling them we know who you
  we know who you will vote for and if you 're not going to drop the right paper  we 're going to take revenge 
 but for mary this meeting is different she feels different 
 this time she 's waiting for this meeting  
 because this time she 's carrying a small hidden camera in her dress a camera that nobody else can see 
 nobody is allowed to film in these
  you risk your life if you do mary knows that but she also knows that the only way to stop them
 and to protect herself
 and her community is to expose their intimidation to make sure they understand somebody is following them 
 to break the impunity they feel  
 mary and her friends were filming for months undercover the
  of the ruling political party
 the
  images were broadcast all over the world  but more importantly they have been broadcast back to the community the perpetrators saw them
 they understood somebody is following them they got scared impunity was broken 
 mary and her friends forced the ruling political party not to use violence during the election  and saved hundreds of lives 
 mary is just one of hundreds of people that my organization had helped to document human rights violations using cameras
  my background should have led me to a different direction  
 i was born in israel to a right wing family  and as long as i remember myself  i wanted to join the israeli army
 to serve my country and prove what i believed was our right for the whole land  i joined the israeli army just after
 the first intifada the first palestinian uprising  and i served in
 hard minded toughest  aggressive infantry units and i got the biggest gun in my platoon  
 quite fast i became an officer
 and got soldiers under my command  and as time passed i started serving in the west bank and i saw these
 images
  i didn 't like what i saw  it took me a while  but eventually i refused to serve in the west bank
 and had to spend time in jail  it was a bit 
 it was not that bad i have to say it was a bit like being in a hotel but with
  in jail i kept thinking that i need people to know  
 i need people to understand what the reality in the west bank looks like i need them to hear what i heard  
 i need them to see what i saw  but i also understood we need the palestinians themselves the people that are suffering to be able to tell their own stories not journalists 
 or filmmakers that are coming outside of the situation  
  organization an israeli human rights organization called 
  we analyzed the west bank and picked one hundred families that are living in the most risky places close to checkpoints  near army bases
 side by side with settlers  we gave them cameras and training  
 quite fast we started getting very disturbing images
 about how the settlers and the soldiers are abusing them  
 i would like to share with you two clips from this project both of them were broadcast in israel and it created a massive debate  and i have to warn you  some of you might find them quite explicit  
 the masked men you will see in the first clips are jewish
  minutes before the camera was turned on they approached a palestinian family that was working their land and told them that they have to leave the land because this land belongs to the jewish settlers  the palestinians refused 
 let 's see what happened  
 the masked men
 that are approaching are jewish settlers  they are approaching the palestinian family
  demonstration in the west bank  the guy in green is palestinian he will be arrested in a second here
  he regrets he came to this demonstration
  he 's been shot in the foot with a rubber bullet he
 is okay 
 not all the settlers and the soldiers are acting this way  we 're talking about a tiny minority  but they have to be brought to justice these clips
  and others like them forced the army and the police to start investigations they 've been shown in israel of course and the israeli public was exposed to them also 
 this project redefined the struggle for human rights in the occupied territories  and we managed to reduce the number of violent attacks in the west bank  
 the success of this project got me thinking how i can
  take the same methodology to other places in the world  
 now we tend to believe that today with all of the technology the smartphones and the internet we are able to see and understand most of what 's happening in the world  and people are able to tell their story
 but it 's only partly true  still today with all the technology we have less than half of
 world 's population has access to the internet  
 and more than three billion people i 'm repeating the number three billion people are consuming news that is censored by those in power 
 more or less around the same time i 'm approached by a great guy named uri 
  and an activist we understood we were thinking along the
  been traveling undercover to places where a community was suffering from abuses  where mass atrocities were happening  and there was a lack of reporting 
 we tried to understand how we can help  
 there were four things that i
  the first thing is that we have to engage with communities that are living in rural areas  where violations are happening far from the public eye 
 we need to partner with them 
 and we need to understand which images are not making it out there and help them to document them 
 the second thing i learned
 is that we have to enable them to film in a safe way  
  where i used to work before in the west bank one can take a camera out most likely not going to get shot 
 but in places we wanted to work just try to pull a phone out and you 're dead literally dead 
 this is why we decided to take the operation undercover when necessary and use mostly hidden cameras  
 unfortunately i can 't show you the hidden cameras we 're using today for obvious reasons
  used before you can buy them off the shelf  today we 
 hidden camera like the one that mary was wearing in her dress to film the intimidation meeting of the ruling political party  
 it 's a camera that nobody can see that blends into the environment into the surroundings now
  filming securities go beyond using hidden cameras  being secure starts way before the activist is turning the camera on 
 to keep our partners safe we work to understand the risk of every location and of every shot before it 's happened  
 building a backup plan if something goes wrong and making sure we have everything in place before our operations start 
 the third thing i
 i learned is the importance of verification you can have an amazing shot of atrocity  but if you can 't verify it it 's worth nothing 
 recently like in the ongoing war in syria or the war in gaza  we 've seen images that are staged or brought from a different conflict 
 this misinformation destroyed the credibility of the source  and it 's harmed the credibility of other reliable and trustworthy sources  
 we use a variety of ways to make sure we can verify the information
  and we can trust the material it starts with vetting the partners understanding who they are and working with them very intensively how do you film a location 
 you film road signs you film watches you film newspapers 
 we are checking maps  looking at maps double checking the information and looking also at the metadata
  the fourth and the most important thing i learned is how you use images to create a positive change 
 to have an effect  the key thing is how you use the material  
 today we 're working with hundreds of activists filming undercover  we work with them both to understand the situation on the ground and which images are missing
 to describe it
  that are influencing the situation and when to release the material to advance the struggle  
 sometimes it 's about putting it in the media  mostly local ones to create awareness  sometimes it 's working with decision makers to change laws  sometimes it 's working with lawyers to use as evidence in court  
  more than often the most effective way
 to create a social change is to work within the community i want to give you one example
 is part of a network of women that are fighting abuses in kenya  
 women in her community have been harassed constantly on their way to school and on their way to work they are trying to change the behavior of the community from inside 
 in the next clip
  journey to work her voice is superimposed on images that she filmed herself using hidden cameras
  the men inside
 the way they look at me
 touch my body rub against me grab me and
 now as i sit in my seat i only wish my mind was full of thoughts for my day my dreams my children at school but instead i worry about the moment when
  i used to carry a big gun now i am carrying this this is a much more powerful
 and much much more effective weapon but we have to use its power wisely 
 by putting the right images
 in the right hands
  the right time we can truly create an impact
