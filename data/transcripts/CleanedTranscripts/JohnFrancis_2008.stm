  i
  thank you for being here and i say thank you for being here because
 i was silent for seventeen years and the first words that i spoke were in
  of earth day and my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak  and
 i said  thank you for being here my mother out in the audience she jumped up hallelujah johnnys talking 
 imagine if you were quiet for seventeen years and your your mother was out in the audience say  my
  i turned around because i didnt recognize where my voice was coming from 
 i hadnt heard my voice in seventeen years so i turned around and i looked and i said god who 's saying what im thinking 
 and then i realized it was me you know  and i kind of laughed  and i could see my father
 take you on this journey and the journey i believe is a metaphor for all of our journeys 
  even though this one is kind of unusual i want you to think about
 your own journey  my journey began
 in 
 when i witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the golden
  gate and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay 
 it disturbed me so much that i decided that i was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles
 thats a big thing in california  and it was a big thing in my little community of point reyes station in inverness california
  because there were only about three hundred and fifty people there in the winter this was back in ' seventy one now 
 and so when i came in and i i started walking around 
 people
 they just knew what was going on and people would drive up next to me and say john what are you doing
  bad right youre walking to make us feel bad and maybe there was some truth to that because i thought that if i started walking everyone would
 follow because of the oil everybody talked about the polllution  and so
 i argued with people about that i argued and i argued i called my
  ive given up riding and driving in cars my dad said why didnt you do that when you were sixteen 
 i didnt know about the environment then theyre back in philadelphia  and so
 i told my mother im happy though im really happy she said if you were happy son you wouldnt have to say it mothers are like that 
 and so on my my 27th birthday i decided because i argued so much and i talk so much
 that i was going to stop speaking for just one day one day
 to give it a rest  
 and so i did  i got up in the morning and i didnt say a word  and i have to tell you it was a very moving experience because
 for the first time
  and what i heard 
 it kind of disturbed me because what i used to do when i thought i was listening was i would listen just enough to hear what people had to say and think that i could
 i knew what they were going to say  and so i stopped listening  and in my mind i just kind of raced ahead
 and thought of what i was going to say back while they were still finishing up  and then i would
  launch in well  that just ended communication  
 so on this first day i actually listened and it was very sad for me because i realized that for those many years i had not been learning i 
  was twenty seven i thought i knew everything 
  and so
 i decided id better do this for another day  
 and another day  and another day until finally i promised myself for a year i would keep quiet because i started learning more and more and i needed to learn more so for 
  a year i said i would keep quiet and then on my birthday i would reassess what i had learned and maybe i would talk again well that lasted seventeen years 
 now during that time
 those seventeen years i walked and i i played the banjo and i painted and i wrote in my journal and
 i tried to study the environment
 by reading books and i decided that i was going to go to school  
 so i did i walked up to ashland oregon where they were offering
 an environmental studies degree
 its only five hundred miles and i went into the registrars office and what what 
 what i had a newspaper clipping oh 
 so you really want to go to school here you dont we have a special program for you they did  and in those two years
 i graduated
 with my first degree a bachelors degree and my father came out he was so proud he said listen were really proud of you son  
 but what are you going to do with a bachelors degree  you dont ride in cars you dont talk youre going to have to do those things 
 i hunched my shoulder i picked my backpack up again and i started walking 
 i walked
  all the way up to port townsend washington  where i built a wooden boat  rode it across puget sound 
 and walked across washington [ to ] idaho and down to missoula montana
  i had written the university of montana two years earlier
 and said i 'd like to go to school there i said i 'd be there in
  and i was there i showed up in two years and
 they i tell this story because they really helped me there are two stories in montana the first story is
 i didnt have any money thats a sign i used a lot  and they said don 't worry about that the
 director of the program said come back tomorrow he gave me one hundred and fifty dollars  and he said register for one one credit  youre going to go to south america
 said
 rivers and lakes the hydrological systems south america  
 so i did that he
 came back he said to me ok john now that you 've registered for that one credit  you can have a key to an office you can matriculate youre matriculating so you can use the library  and what were going to do is were going to have
 all of the professors allow you to go to class
  theyre going to save your grade  
 and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money then you can register for that class and theyll give you the grade wow 
 they dont do that in graduate schools i dont think but i use that story because they really wanted to help me  they saw that i was
  they really wanted to help me along the way and during that time i actually taught classes without speaking
 i had thirteen students when i first walked into the class i explained with a friend who could
 interpret my sign language that i was john francis i was walking around the world i didnt talk and this was the last time this persons going to be here interpreting for me  
 all the students sat around and they
  i could see they were looking for the schedule to see when they could get out 
 they had to take that class with me two weeks later everyone was trying to get into our class and i learned in that class because i would do things like this
  i think hes talking about selective forestry now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion 
 i just backed out of that you know and i just kind of kept the fists from flying  but what i learned was that sometimes i would make a sign and
 they said things that i absolutely did not mean
 but i should have  
 and so what what came to me is if you were a teacher and you were teaching  if you werent learning you probably werent teaching very well  
 and so i went on my dad came out to see me graduate and you know i did the deal and my father said were really proud of you son but you know what went on he said youve got to start riding and driving and
 start talking what are you going to do
  a masters degree i hunched my shoulder i got my backpack and i went on to the university of wisconsin
  i spent two years there writing on oil spills  no one was interested in oil spills  but
 something happened
 exxon valdez  and i was the only one in the united states writing on oil spills  my dad came out
  again
 he said i don 't know how you do this son i mean you  don 't ride in cars you dont talk my sister said maybe i should leave you alone because you seem to be doing
 a lot better when youre not saying anything 
 well  i put on my backpack again  
 i put my banjo on and i walked all the way to the east coast put my foot in the atlantic ocean it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across
  united states and
 on earth day one thousand nine hundred
 and ninety the 20th anniversary of earth day thats when i began to speak  and thats why i said thank you for being here because it 's sort of like that tree in the forest
 falling and if there 's no one there to hear does it really make a sound and im thanking you and i 'm thanking my family because they had come to hear me speak
  communication and they also taught me about listening
 that they listened to me and its one of those things that came out of the silence the listening to each other 
 really very important we need to listen to each other well  my journey kept going on my dad said
  let that go i worked for the coastguard was made a u n goodwill ambassador  i wrote regulations for the united states i mean i wrote
 oil spill regulations  twenty years ago if someone had
 said to me john do you really want to make a difference 
 yeah i want to make a difference he said you just start walking east get out of your car and just start walking east and as i walked off a little bit
  they 'd say yeah and shut up too 
 youre going to make a difference buddy 
 how could that be how could that be how could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference
  well  my time at the coast guard was a really good time and after that i only worked one year i said that 's enough
  one year 's enough for me to do that i got on a sailboat and i sailed down to the caribbean and
 walked through all of the islands and to venezuela and
 you know i forgot the the most important thing which is why i started talking  which i have to tell you 
 i started talking because i had studied environment
 id studied environment at this
 formal level  but there was this informal level  and the informal level i learned about
 people and what we do and how we are and
 environment changed from just being about trees and birds and endangered species to being about how we treated each other
  because if we are the environment then all we need to do is look around us and see
 how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other  
 and so thats the message that i had and i said well i 'm going to have to spread that message and i got in my sailboat sailed all the way through the caribbean
 it wasn 't really my sailboat
  kind of worked on that boat
 got to venezuela and i started walking 
 this is the last part of this story because its how i got here because i still didn 't ride in motorized vehicles  
 i was walking through el dorado
 it 's a prison town famous prison or infamous prison in venezuela 
 and i dont know what possessed me because this was not like me  
 there i am walking past the guard
  gate and
 the guard stops and says 
 pasaporte  pasaporte 
 and with an m16 pointed at me and i looked at him and i said   passport huh 
 i don 't need to show you my passport its in the back of my pack  i 'm dr francis i 'm a u n ambassador and i 'm walking around the world 
 and i started walking off what possessed me to say this
 the road turned into the jungle  i didnt get shot  
 and i got to i start saying free at last thank god almighty  im free at last 
 what was that about
  what was that about it took me one hundred miles to figure out
 that in my heart in me  i
 had become a prisoner i was a prisoner and i needed to escape the prison that i was in
 was the fact that i did not drive
 or use motorized vehicles  now how could that be  because when i started it seemed very appropriate to
  me
 not to use motorized vehicles  but the thing that was different was that every birthday i asked myself about silence  but i never asked myself about
 my decision to just use my feet 
 i had no idea i was going to become a u n ambassador i had no idea i would
  and so i realized that i had a responsibility to more than just me  
 and that i was going to have to change  you know we can do it 
 i was going to have to change  and i was afraid to change because i was so used to the guy who only just walked 
 i was so used to that person
 that i didnt want to stop i didnt know who i would be if i
  changed  
 but i know i needed to 
 i know i needed to change because it would be the only way that i could be here today  
 and i know that
 a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where  weve gotten to but theres another place for us to go and we
 kind of have to leave behind
  the security of who weve become and go to the place of who we are becoming  
 and so i want to encourage you
 to go to that next place to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in as comfortable as it may be
  because
 we have to do something
 now we have to change now 
 as our former vice president said  we have to become activists  
 so if my voice can touch
  you if my actions can touch you if my being here can touch you please let it be  and i know that all of you
 have touched me
 while ive been here 
 so lets go out into the world and take this caring this love this respect that weve shown each other
  here at ted and take this out into the world because
 we are the environment and how we treat each other
 is really how were going to treat the environment so i want to thank you for being here
 and i want to end this in five seconds of
