  my work is play  and i play when i design i even looked it up in the dictionary to make sure that i actually do that and
 the definition of play number one was engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor and number two was gambling
  realize i do both when i 'm designing i 'm
 both a kid and i 'm gambling all the time  
 and i think that if you 're not there 's probably something inherently wrong with the structure or the situation you 're in if you 're a designer
  but the serious part is what threw me and i couldn 't quite get a handle
 on it until i remembered an essay  and it 's an essay i read thirty
  years ago it was written by russell baker who used to write an observer column in the new york times  he 's a wonderful humorist  and i 'm going to read you
 this
 essay or an excerpt from it because it it really hit home for me 
 here is a letter of friendly advice be serious it says what it means of course is be solemn  
 being solemn is easy
 being serious is hard 
 children almost always begin by being serious which is what makes them so entertaining when compared with adults as a class adults on the whole are solemn  
 in politics  the rare candidate who is serious like adlai stevenson is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn like eisenhower
  that 's because it is hard for most people to recognize seriousness which is rare  but more comfortable to endorse solemnity which is commonplace  
 jogging which is commonplace  and widely accepted as good for you is solemn  poker is serious  
 washington d c is solemn new york is serious going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the
  taking a long walk by yourself during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing tiffany 's is serious 
 now when i apply russell baker 's definition of solemnity or seriousness to design it doesn 't necessarily make any particular point about quality 
 solemn design is often important and very effective design solemn design is also socially correct  and is accepted by appropriate
  designers and all the clients are striving for 
 serious design serious play is something else 
 for one thing it often happens spontaneously  intuitively  accidentally or incidentally it can be achieved out of innocence or arrogance or out of selfishness sometimes out of carelessness 
 but mostly it 's achieved through all those kind of crazy
 parts of human behavior that don 't really make any sense serious design
  imperfect it 's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind serious design is also often
 quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view 
 that 's because the art of serious play is about invention change rebellion not perfection perfection happens during solemn play  
 now  i always saw design careers like surreal staircases  if you
  look at the staircase you 'll see that in your 20s the risers are very high
 and the steps are very short and you make huge discoveries you sort of
 leap up very quickly in your youth that 's because you don 't know anything and you have a lot to learn and so that anything you do is a learning experience and you 're just jumping right up there as you get older  the
 risers get shallower and the steps get wider
  start moving along at a slower pace because you 're making fewer discoveries  and as you get older and more decrepit you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing long staircase leading you into oblivion 
 i find it 's actually getting really hard to be serious  i 'm hired to be
  but i find more and more that i 'm solemn when i don 't have to be 
 and in my thirty five years of working experience i think i was really serious four times  
 and i 'm going to show them to you now because they came out of very specific conditions  
 it 's great to be a kid  now  when i was in my early 20s i worked in the record business  designing record covers for cbs records and i had no idea what a great job i had i thought everybody had a job like that 
 and what
  way i looked at design and the way i looked at the world was what was going on around me and the things that came at the time i walked into design were the enemy 
 i really really really hated the typeface helvetica  
 i thought the typeface helvetica was the cleanest most boring most fascistic 
 really repressive typeface and i hated everything that was designed in helvetica
  when i was in
 my college days 
 this was the sort of design that was fashionable and popular this is actually quite a lovely book jacket by rudy de harak but i just hated it because it was designed with helvetica and i made parodies about it 
 i just thought it was you know completely boring 
  my goal in life was to do stuff that wasn 't made out of helvetica  and to do stuff that wasn 't made out of helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find it  
 and there weren 't a lot of books about the history of design in the early 70s there weren 't there wasn 't a plethora of design publishing you actually had to go to antique stores you had to go to europe you had to go places and find the stuff  
 and what i responded to was you know
  or victorian typography or things that were just completely not helvetica  
 and i taught myself design this way and this was sort of my early years and i used these things
 in really goofy ways on record covers and in my design i wasn 't educated i just sort of put these things together i mixed up victorian
  designs with pop and i mixed up art nouveau with something else  and i made these very lush  very elaborate record covers not because i was being a 
 or a historicist because i didn 't know what those things were i just hated helvetica 
 and that kind of passion
 drove me into very serious play  a kind of play i could never do now because i 'm too well educated 
 and there 's something wonderful about
  that form of youth  where you can let yourself grow and play  and be
 really a brat  and then accomplish things by the end of the ' 70s actually the stuff became known i mean these covers appeared all over the world and they started winning awards and
 people knew
  and i was suddenly a 
  and i began a career as in my own business and first i was praised for it then criticized for it but the fact of the matter was i had become solemn  
 i didn 't do what i think was a piece of serious work again for about fourteen years i spent most of the ' 80s being quite solemn  turning out these sorts of designs 
  that i was expected to do because that 's who i was and i was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead
 and getting rediscovered all over again so here was the second condition
 for which i
 i think i accomplished some serious play  
 there 's a paul newman movie that i love called the verdict i don 't know how many of you have seen it  but it 's a beaut and in the movie he plays
  lawyer who 's become an ambulance chaser  and
 he 's
 taken on he 's given actually a malpractice suit to handle that 's sort of an easy deal  
 and in the midst of trying to connect the deal he starts to empathize and identify with his client  and he regains his morality and purpose  and he goes on to win the case  
 and in the depth of despair
  in the midst of the movie when it looks like he can 't pull this thing off and he needs this case he needs to win this case so badly there
 's a shot of paul newman alone in his office  saying this is the case there are no other cases  this is the case there are no other cases 
 and in that moment moment of desire and focus 
  a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play  and i had that moment in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four when i met
 a theater director named george wolfe who was going to have me
 design an identity for the new york shakespeare festival then known and then became the public theater  and i began getting
  immersed in this project in a way i never was before  this is what theater advertising looked like at that time  this is what was in the newspapers and in the new york times so this is sort of a comment on the time 
 and the public theater actually had much better advertising than this they had no logo and no identity but they had these very iconic posters painted by paul davis 
 and george wolf had taken over from another director and he wanted to change the theater  and he wanted to make it urban and
  loud and a place that was inclusive 
 so drawing on my love of typography i immersed myself into this project and what was different about it was the totality of it was that 
  i really became the voice the visual voice of a place in a way i had never done before where every aspect the smallest ad the ticket whatever it was was designed by me
  there was no format there was no in house department that these things were pushed to i literally for three years made everything
 every scrap of paper everything online that this theater did  
 and it was the only job even though i was doing other jobs i lived and breathed it in a way i haven 't with a client since
  it enabled me to really express myself and grow and i think that you know when you 're going to be given this position  and it 's rare  but when you get it and you have this opportunity it 's the moment of serious play 
 i did these things and i still do them  i still work for the public theater i 'm on their board  and
 i still am involved with it  the high point of the public
  two years after i designed it which was the bring in ' da noise bring in ' da funk campaign that was all over new york 
 but something happened to it and what happened to it was it became very popular  
 and that is a kiss of death for something serious because it makes it solemn  
 and what happened was that new york city to a degree  ate my identity
 because people began to copy it
  here 's an ad in the new york times somebody did for a play called mind games 
 then chicago came out used similar graphics and the public theater 's identity was just totally eaten and taken away  which meant i had to change it 
 so i changed it so that every season was different  and i continued to do these
  but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual and they didn 't have that heft of everything being the same thing 
 now and i think
 since the public theater i must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions  and i don 't think i ever i ever grasped that seriousness again i do them for very big important institutions in new york
  the institutions are solemn  
 and so is the design they 're better crafted than the public theater was and they spend more money on them  but i think that that moment comes and goes  
 the best way to accomplish serious design which i think we all have the opportunity to do is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job 
 that doesn 't happen very often but it happened to me in the year two thousand when for some reason or another a whole pile of different architects
  to ask me to design
 the insides of theaters with them  where i would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings i 'd never done this kind of work before i didn 't know how to read
 an architectural plan  i didn 't know what they were talking about  and i really couldn 't handle the fact that a job a single job could go on for four years because i was used to immediacy in graphic design and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me
  with add so it was a rough it was a rough go  but i fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture 
 because i didn 't know what i was doing i said why can 't the signage be on the floor new yorkers look at their feet  
  sense  
 they integrated with the building in really peculiar ways they ran around corners  they went up sides of buildings  
 and they melded into the architecture this is symphony space on  90th street and broadway and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and
 backlit with fiber optics
  and the architect jim polshek essentially gave me a canvas to play typography out on  and it was serious play  
 this is the children 's museum in pittsburgh pennsylvania made out of completely inexpensive materials  extruded typography that 's backlit with neon things i never did before 
  built before i just thought they 'd be kind of fun to do donors ' walls made out of lucite  
  i think my favorite of these was this little job in newark new jersey it 's a
 performing arts school  this is the building that they had no money  and they had to recast it  and they said  if we give you one hundred thousand dollars what can you do with it and 
 i did a little photoshop job on it and i said well i think we can paint it  and we did
  and it was play  
 and there 's the building everything was painted typography over the whole damn thing  including the air conditioning ducts  
 i hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building and they loved it they got into it they took the job incredibly seriously they used to climb up on the building
 call me and tell me that they had to correct my typography that my spacing was wrong and they
 moved it and they did wonderful things with it they were pretty serious too it was quite wonderful by the time i i did bloomberg 's headquarters
 my work had begun to become accepted people wanted it in big expensive places and that began to make it solemn  
 bloomberg was all about numbers  and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular
  that my partner lisa strausfeld programmed  
 but it became the end of the seriousness of the play and it started to once again become solemn  this is a current project
 in pittsburgh  pennsylvania  where i got to be goofy i was invited to design a logo for this neighborhood
  called the north side 
 and i thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo i think that 's rather creepy actually why would a neighborhood have a logo a neighborhood has a thing it 's got a landmark it 's got a place it 's got a restaurant it doesn 't have a logo i mean what would that be  
 so i had to actually give a presentation to to
 a city council and neighborhood constituents and i went to pittsburgh and i said you
 know really what you have here are all these underpasses that separate the neighborhood from the center of town
  don 't you celebrate them and make the underpasses landmarks so i began doing this crazy presentation of these installations
 potential installations on
 these underpass bridges and stood up in front of the city council and was a little bit scared  i have to admit  
 but i was so utterly unqualified for this project and so utterly ridiculous
 and ignored the brief
 so desperately that i think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness just
 completely because it was so goofy to begin with and this is the bridge they 're actually
 painting up and preparing as we speak it will change every six months and it will become an art installation in the north side of
  and it will probably become a landmark in the area  john hockenberry told you
 a bit about
 my travail with citibank
  that is now a 10 year relationship and i still work with them and i actually am amused by them and like them and think that as a very very very very very big corporation they actually
 keep their graphics very nice  i drew the logo for citibank on a napkin in the first meeting that was the play part of the job  and then i spent
  year going to long tedious  boring meetings  trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the to the point 
  of tears i thought i was going to go crazy at the end of this year we made idiotic presentations showing how the citi logo made sense and how it was really derived from an umbrella and we made
  animations of these things and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and
 it was worth it because they bought this thing and it played out on such a grand scale and it 's so internationally recognizable  
 but for me it was actually a very very depressing year as a matter of fact they actually never bought onto the logo until fallon put it on its very good live richly campaign and then everybody accepted it all
  during this time i needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy crazy existence of going to these long idiotic meetings  
 and i was up in my country house and for some reason i began painting these very big very involved laborious complicated maps 
  of the entire world and listing every place on the planet and putting them in and misspelling them and putting things in the wrong spot and completely controlling the information  and going
  totally and completely nuts with it  
 they would take me about six months initially but then i started getting faster at it here 's the united states every single city of the united states is on here  and
  it hung for about eight months at the  cooper hewitt and people walked up to it and they would point to a part of the map and they 'd say oh i 've been here 
  i liked about it was i was controlling my own idiotic information  and i was creating my own palette of information  and i was totally and completely at play 
 one of my favorites was this painting i did of florida after the two thousand election that has the election results rolling around in
 the water i keep that for evidence
  up at my house and saw the paintings and recommended them to a gallery  and i had a first show about two and a half years ago and i showed these paintings that that
 i 'm showing you now and then a funny thing happened they sold and they they sold
 quickly and
 became rather popular we started making prints from them  this is manhattan
 one from the series  
 this is a print from the united states which we did in red white and blue we began doing these big silkscreen prints  and they started selling too so the gallery wanted me to have another show in two years 
 which meant that i really had to paint these paintings much faster than i had ever done them and i they started to become more political and i
 areas that sort of were in the news or that i had some feeling about  and i began doing these things and then this funny thing happened i found that i was no 
  longer at play i was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation for a show which is not where i started
  these things so while they became successful i know how to make them so i 'm not a neophyte  
 and they 're no longer serious they have become solemn  
 and that 's a terrifying factor when you start something and it turns that way because it means that all that 's left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is
  that you can push  that you can invent that you can be ignorant about that you can be arrogant about 
 that you can fail with  and that you can be a fool with because in the end that 's how you grow and that 's all that matters
