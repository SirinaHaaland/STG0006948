  my investigations into what technology means in our lives not just
 our immediate life but in the cosmic sense in the kind of long history
  our place in the world what is this stuff what is the significance and so  i want to kind of go through
 my little story of what i found out and one of the first things that i started to investigate was the history of the name of technology and
 in the united states there is a state of the union address given by every president
 since one thousand seven hundred and ninety and each one of those is really kind of summing up the most important things for the united states at that time
  if you search for the word technology it was not used until one thousand nine hundred and fifty two 
 so  technology was sort of absent from everybody 's thinking until one thousand nine hundred and fifty two which happened to be the year of my birth and obviously technology had existed before then but we weren 't aware of it and so it was sort of an awakening of
 this force
  was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum a course bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts and industry and he called it technology and that 's the very first use of the word 
 so what is this stuff
 that we 're all consumed by  and bothered
  alan kay calls it technology is anything that was invented after you were born which is sort of the
 idea that we normally have about what technology is it 's all that new stuff  it 's not roads or penicillin or
 factory tires it 's the new stuff my friend danny hillis says kind of a similar one he says technology is anything that doesn 't work yet which
  sense that it 's all new but we know that it 's just not new it actually goes way back and what i want to suggest is it goes a
 long way back  
 so  another way to think about technology what it means is to imagine a world without technology if we were to eliminate every single bit of technology in the world today and i mean everything from blades to scrapers to cloth
 we as a species would not live very long  we would die by the billions and very quickly the wolves would get us
  we would be defenseless  we would be unable to grow enough food or find enough food  even the hunter gatherers used some elementary tools  
 and so they had minimal technology  but they had some technology 
 and if we study those hunter gatherer tribes and the neanderthal which are very similar to
 early man we
  a very curious thing about this world without technology  and this is a kind of a curve of their average age there are no neanderthal fossils that are older than forty years old that we 've ever found  
 and the average age of most of these hunter gatherer tribes is twenty to thirty  there are very few young infants because they die high mortality rate and there 's very few old people and so the profile is sort of for your average san francisco
  tribes and early man is is that you didn 't live beyond the age of thirty so it was a world without grandparents 
 and grandparents are very important because they are the transmitter of cultural evolution and information imagine a world and basically everybody was twenty to thirty years old how much learning can you do you can 't do very much learning in your own life  
 it 's so short and there 's nobody to pass on
  what you do learn  so  that 's one aspect it was a very short life  but at the same time anthropologists know that
 most hunter gatherer tribes of the world with that very little technology actually did not spend a very long time gathering the food that they needed three to six hours a day some anthropologists call that the original
  because they had banker hours basically 
 so it was possible to to get enough food but when the scarcity came when the highs and lows and the droughts came then
 people went into starvation and that 's why they didn 't live very long so what technology brought through the very simple tools like these stone tools here
 even something as small as this the early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction
 about two hundred and fifty megafauna animals in north america when they first arrived ten thousand years ago  
 so  long before the industrial age we we 've been affecting the planet on a global scale with just a small amount of technology  
 the other thing that the early man invented was fire  and fire was used to clear out and again affected the ecology of grass and whole continents and
 was used in cooking it enabled us to actually eat all kinds of things it was sort of in a certain sense in a mcluhan sense an external stomach in the sense that
 it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise and if we don 't have fire we actually could not live our bodies have adapted to these new diets our bodies have changed in the last ten
  that little bit of technology  
 humans went from a small band of ten thousand or so the same number as neanderthals everywhere and we suddenly exploded with the invention of language around fifty thousand years ago  the number of humans exploded 
  and very quickly became the dominant species on the planet and they migrated into the rest of the world at two kilometers per year until within several tens of thousands of years 
 we occupied every single watershed on the planet and became the most dominant species with a very small amount of technology
 and even at that time with the introduction of agriculture 
 eight thousand ten thousand years ago we started to see climate change  so climate change is not a new thing what 's new is just the degree of it even during the agricultural age there was climate change  
  and so  already small amounts of technology were transforming the world and what this means and where i 'm going
  is that technology has become the most powerful force in the world all the things that we see today that are changing our lives we can always trace back to the introduction of some new technology so 
 it 's a force that is the most powerful force that has been unleashed on this planet and
  and everything that we think about ourselves is something that we 've invented so we 've invented ourselves of all the animals that we have domesticated the most important animal that we 've domesticated has been us 
 okay so  humanity is our greatest invention but of course we 're not done yet we 're still inventing and this is what technology is allowing us to do it 's continually to reinvent ourselves  it 's a very very strong force i call this
 entire thing us humans as our technology everything that we 've made gadgets in our lives we call that the technium  that 's this world my working definition of technology is anything useful 
 that a human mind makes it 's not just hammers and gadgets like laptops  but it 's also law and of course cities are ways to make things more useful to us 
  of technology go back to the big bang in this way  in that they are part of this
  thread that starts at the big bang and goes through
 galaxies and stars into life into us and the three major phases of the early universe was energy when the dominant force was energy then it became the dominant force as it cooled became
  with the invention of life  
 four billion years ago the dominant force in our neighborhood became information that 's what life is it 's an information process that was restructuring and making new order  so  
 those energy matter einstein show were equivalent and now new sciences of quantum computing show that entropy and information and matter and energy are all interrelated so it 's one long continuum  
 you put energy into the right kind of system
  comes wasted heat entropy and extropy  which is
 order  it 's the increased order where does this order come from its roots go way back we actually don 't know  but we do know that the 
 trend throughout the universe is long and it began with things like galaxies they maintained their order for
  themselves for billions of years this order against the entropy of the world and flowers and
 plants are the same thing extended and
 technology is basically an extension of life 
 one trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this is actually increasing the amount of energy
  energy is
 increasing through this little sequence  and that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through life is actually greater than a star because of the star 's long lifespan 
 the energy density in life is actually higher than a star and the energy density
 that we see in the greatest of anywhere in the universe is actually in a pc chip there is more energy flowing through per gram per second
 than anything that we have any other experience with  what i would suggest is that if you want to see where technology is going  we continue that trajectory and we say well what 's
  going to become more energy dense that 's where it 's going and so what i 've done is i 've taken the same kinds of things and looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say 
 what are the general trends in evolutionary life and there are things moving towards greater complexity moving towards greater diversity moving towards greater specialization 
 sentience  ubiquity and most important evolvability  those very same things are also present
 in technology  that 's where technology is going  in fact technology is accelerating all the
 aspects of life and we can see that happening just as there 's diversity in life there 's more diversity in things we make
  things in life start out being general cell and they become specialized you have tissue cells you have muscle brain cells and same things happens with say a hammer which is general at first and becomes more specific  
 so  i would like to say that while there is six kingdoms of life  we can think of technology basically as a seventh kingdom of life  it 's a branching off from the human form 
 but technology has its own agenda like anything like life itself for instance right now
  of the energy that we use is actually used to feed the technium itself in transportation it 's not to move us it 's to move the stuff that we make or buy i use the word want technology wants this is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power 
 your cat wants more food
  a bacterium which has no consciousness at all wants to move towards light it has an
  technology has an urge at the same time it wants to give us things and what it gives us is basically progress  
 you can take all kinds of curves  and they 're all pointing up there 's really no dispute about progress  if we discount the cost of that and that 's
 the thing that bothers most people is that progress
 is really real  but we wonder and question what are the environmental costs of it  i did a survey of a number of species of artifacts in my house and there 's six thousand other people have come up with ten thousand
 when king henry of england died  he had eighteen thousand things in his house  but that was the entire wealth of england 
 and with that entire wealth of england king henry could not buy any antibiotics he could not buy refrigeration he could not buy a trip of a thousand miles whereas
  this rickshaw wale in india could save up and buy antibiotics and he could buy refrigeration
  he could buy things that king henry in all his wealth could never buy  that 's what progress is about 
 so technology is selfish  technology is generous  that conflict that tension will be with us forever  
 that sometimes it wants to do what it wants to do and sometimes it 's going to do things for us 
 we have confusion about what we should think about a new technology  right now the default position about when a new technology comes along is we
 people talk about the precautionary principle
  which is very common in europe  which says basically don 't do anything when you meet a new technology  stop until it can be proven
 that there 's no harm i think that really leads nowhere but a better way is to what i call proactionary principle which is you engage with technology  you try it out 
 you obviously do what the precautionary principle suggests you try to anticipate it but after
  anticipating it  you constantly asses it not just once but eternally and when it diverts from what you want  we prioritize risk we evaluate not just the new 
  stuff but the old stuff  we fix it  but most importantly we relocate it and what i mean by that is that we find a new job for it  nuclear energy fission is 
  really bad idea for bombs  but it may be a pretty good idea relocated into
 sustainable nuclear energy for electricity  instead of burning coal when we have a bad idea  the response to a bad idea is not no ideas it 's not to stop thinking 
 the response to a bad idea like say a tungsten light bulb
 is a better idea ok so  better ideas is really always the response to technology that we don 't like is basically
  and actually in a certain sense  technology is a kind of
 a method for generating better ideas if you can think about it that way  
 so  maybe spraying ddt on crops is a really bad idea but ddt sprayed on local homes  there 's nothing better to eliminate malaria
  besides
 mosquito nets but that 's a really good idea that 's a good job for technology
  as humans is to parent our our mind children to find them good friends to find them a good job  and so  every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job that 's actually my son right here 
 there are no bad technologies just as there are no bad children we don 't say children are neutral children are positive we just have to find them the right
 place and so what
  technology gives us  over the long term  over the sort of extended evolution from the beginning of time through the invention of
 of the plants and animals and the evolution of life the evolution of brains what that is constantly giving us is increasing differences  it 's increasing diversity it 's increasing options it 's
  possibilities and freedoms  
 that 's what we get from technology all the time that 's why people leave villages and go into cities is because they are always gravitating towards increased choices and possibilities 
 and we are aware of the price we pay a price for that but we are aware of it and generally we will pay the price for increased freedoms choices and opportunities
  even
  wants clean water is technology diametrically opposed to nature because technology is an extension of life it 's in parallel and aligned with the same things that life wants 
 so that i think technology loves biology  if we allow it to 
 great movement that is
 starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go and our
  so to speak in technology is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves
