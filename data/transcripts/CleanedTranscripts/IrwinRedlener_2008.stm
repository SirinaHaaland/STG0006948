  a big question that we 're facing now and have been for quite a number of years now are we at risk of a nuclear attack 
 now there 's a bigger question that 's probably actually more
  the notion of permanently eliminating the possibility
 of a nuclear attack eliminating the threat altogether  and i would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry  until 
  this very moment we 've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that 's characterized by two phases which i 'm going to go through with you right now 
  united states had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the manhattan project and the idea was very straightforward we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror 
 of this unending world war ii that we 'd been involved in in europe and in the pacific 
 we were the only nuclear power
 we had a few nuclear weapons two of which we dropped on japan in hiroshima a few days later in nagasaki in august 
 killing about two hundred and fifty thousand people between those two and for a few years  we were the only nuclear power on earth 
 but by one thousand nine hundred and forty nine the soviet union had decided it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power  and they began to match what the united states
  was an extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagined back in the 1940s so by 
  each of those red bombs up here is equivalent of a thousands warheads the world had
 thousand nuclear warheads and seven members of something that came to be known as the
 and it was an extraordinary time and i am going to go through some of the mentality that we that americans and the rest of the world were experiencing but i want to just point out to you that ninety five percent
  of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since one thousand nine hundred and eighty five going forward of course were part of the arsenals of the
  and before the break up of the soviet union we began to disarm from a nuclear point of view we began to
 and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world to about a total of twenty one thousand it 's a very difficult number to deal with because
 what we 've done is we 've quote unquote decommissioned some of the warheads  they 're still probably usable they could be re commissioned but the way they count things which is very complicated
  we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before but we also in that period of time  added two more members to the nuclear club  pakistan and north korea  
 so we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal
 among many countries around the world but a very different set of circumstances so i 'm going to talk about a nuclear threat story in two chapters chapter one is
  point and through those years was a superpowers ' nuclear arms race it was characterized by a 
 very fragile standoff  and basically we lived for all those years and some might argue that we still do 
 in a situation of
 being on the brink
  's incredible that we actually lived through all that 
 we were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym which is mad it stands for mutually assured destruction so it meant if
 you if you attacked us  we would attack you virtually simultaneously and the end result would be a destruction of your country and
  so the threat of my own destruction kept me from launching a nuclear attack on you that 's the way we lived and the danger of that of course is that a misreading 
  of a radar screen could actually cause a counter launch even though the first country had not actually launched anything during this chapter one  there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear
  an indelible image was implanted in our collective minds that in fact a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could in some ways mean the end of civilization as we know it  so this was chapter one  
 now the odd thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization obliteration we engaged in america in a
  the soviet union in a series of response planning it was absolutely incredible so premise one is we 'd be destroying the world  and then premise two is why don 't we get prepared for it  
 so what we
 what we offered ourselves was a collection of things i 'm just going to go skim through a few things just to
 jog your memories if you 're born after one thousand nine hundred and fifty this is just consider this entertainment otherwise it 's memory lane this was bert the
  cover that was the principle  you there would be a nuclear conflagration about to hit us  and if you get under your desk things would be ok 
 i didn 't do all that well in psychiatry in medical school but i was interested and i think this was seriously delusional 
 laughter secondly  we told people
 to go down in their basements and build a fallout shelter
 would be a study when we weren 't having an atomic war or you could use it as a tv room or as many teenagers found out a very very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend and actually 
 so there are multiple uses of the of the bomb shelters or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground now 
  a few hundred dollars maybe up to five hundred if you got a fancy one  yet  what percentage of americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house what percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter  
 less than two percent about one point four percent
 of the population as far as anyone knows  did anything  either making a space in their basement or actually
 building a bomb shelter 
 many buildings public buildings around the country this is new york city had these little civil defense signs and the idea was that you would run into one of these shelters
 from the nuclear weaponry and one of the greatest
 governmental delusions of all time was something that happened in the early days of the federal emergency management agency fema as we now know  and are well aware of their behaviors from katrina 
 here is their first big public
  there were about six volumes written on this a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the united states having three to four days warning
 that the soviets were going to attack us so the the goal was to evacuate the target cities we would move people out of the target cities into the countryside  
 and i 'm telling you i actually testified at the senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate and actually have three or four days
  was just completely off the wall  turns out
 that they had another idea
 behind it even though this was they were telling the public it was to save us the idea was that we would force the soviets to re target their nuclear weapons very expensive and potentially double their arsenal to not only take out the original site  but take out sites where people were
  it turns out was behind all this it was just
 really really frightening  the main point here is we were dealing with
 a complete disconnect from reality  the civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we 'd see in  all out nuclear war so organizations like physicians for social 
 social responsibility around one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine started saying this a lot publicly  they would do a bombing run they 'd go to your city  and they 'd say here 's a map of your city here 's what 's going to happen if we
  get a nuclear hit so no possibility of medical response to or meaningful preparedness for  all out nuclear war  
 so we had to prevent nuclear war if we expected to survive  this disconnect was never actually resolved  
 and what happened was
 when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear
  when the soviet union broke up
  instead
  although the scenario has changed very considerably 
 the fact is that we haven 't changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means so i 'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second 
 so what is a nuclear terror threat and there 's four key ingredients to
 describing that  first thing is that the global nuclear weapons in the stockpiles that i showed you in those original maps happen to be not uniformly
  secure and it 's particularly not secure
 in the former soviet union now in russia  there are many many sites where warheads are stored
 and in fact  lots of sites where fissionable materials like highly enriched uranium and plutonium are absolutely not safe 
 they 're available to be bought stolen whatever  they 're
  two thousand and six the international atomic energy agency documented one hundred and seventy five cases of nuclear theft 
 eighteen of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium  the key ingredients to make
 a nuclear weapon  the global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about one thousand three hundred at the low end to about two thousand one hundred metric
  more than one hundred megatons of this is stored in particularly insecure russian facilities 
 how much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10 kiloton bomb  well you need about seventy five pounds of it  
 so what i 'd like to show you
 is
 what it would take to hold  seventy five pounds of highly enriched uranium  this is not a product placement it 's just
  fact  if i was coca cola i 'd be pretty distressed about this
 basically  this is it  this is what you would need to steal or buy
 out of that  100 metric ton stockpile that 's relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that was used in
  now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb that you 'd need ten to thirteen pounds of plutonium 
 now plutonium ten to thirteen pounds 
 this this is enough plutonium to create a 
 atomic weapon  now this situation already i you know i don 't really
  like thinking about this although somehow i got myself a job where i have to think about it so
 the point is that we 're very very insecure in terms of developing this material 
 the second thing is what about the know how and there 's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know how to actually
 make a nuclear weapon  well  there 's a lot of know how out there there 's an unbelievable amount of know how
  there 's detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts  there 's books about how to build a nuclear bomb  
 there are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it  
 all of this information is relatively available  if you have an undergraduate degree in physics i would suggest
 although i don 't so maybe it 's not even true but something close to that would allow you with the information that 's currently
  available to actually build a nuclear weapon  
 the third element of the nuclear terror threat is that  who would actually do such a thing  well what we 're seeing now is a level of terrorism 
 that involves individuals who are highly organized they are very dedicated and committed  they are
  somebody once said  al qaeda does not have a return address  so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon  what 's the response and to whom is the response 
 and they 're retaliation proof 
 since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference since there are people willing to actually give up their lives
 in order to do a lot of damage to us it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work here is sulaiman abu ghaith
  and sulaiman was a key lieutenant of osama bin laden  he wrote many many times statements to this effect we have the right to kill four million americans two million of whom should be children 
 and we don 't have to go overseas to find people willing to do harm for whatever their reasons mcveigh and nichols and the oklahoma city attack in the  1990s was a good example of homegrown
  what if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon  the fourth element is that the 
  targets are accessible  soft and plentiful  this would be a talk for another day but the level of the preparedness that the united states has achieved since nine eleven of ' one is unbelievably inadequate 
 what you saw after katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the united states is for any
 kind of major attack seven million ship cargo containers come into the united states every year five to seven percent only are inspected
 five to seven percent  
 this is alexander lebed 
 who was a general that worked with yeltsin who talked about and presented to congress 
 this idea that the russians had developed these suitcase bombs they were very low
  point one to one kiloton hiroshima was around thirteen kilotons but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage  and lebed came to the united states
 and told us that many many more than eighty of the suitcase bombs were actually not accountable  and they look like this they 're basically very simple arrangements  you put the elements into a suitcase it becomes very portable 
 the suitcase can be conveniently dropped in your trunk of your car you take it wherever you want to take it and you can detonate it
 you don 't want to build a suitcase bomb  and you happen to get one of those insecure
 nuclear warheads that exist this is the size of the little boy bomb that was dropped at hiroshima  it was nine point eight feet long weighed eight thousand eight hundred pounds  you go down to your local rent a truck
 and
 for fifty bucks or so
  you rent a truck that 's got the right capacity  and you take your bomb  you put it in the truck and you 're ready to go it could happen but what it would mean and
 who would survive  you can 't get an exact number for that kind of probability  but
 what i 'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening  anybody who dismisses the thought
 of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves  i think there 's a lot of people in the intelligence community a lot of people who deal with this
 work in general think it 's
  inevitable  
 unless we do certain things to to really try to defuse the risk like better interdiction better prevention better fixing you know better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth 
 there 's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer at this particular moment  
 we actually could end up seeing a nuclear
 detonation in one of our cities 
 i don 't think we would see an all out nuclear war any time soon  although even that is not completely off the table there 's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers
 to destroy the earth many many times over there are flash points in india and pakistan in the middle east  in north korea  other places where
 the use of nuclear weapons  while initially locally
  back in my truck and we drove over the brooklyn bridge we 're coming down  and we bring
 that truck that you just saw somewhere in here in the financial district
  slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima  and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information i think news you could use kind of concept here 
 so first of all this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine this is the ultimate
  're in the half mile radius of where this bomb went off you have a ninety percent chance of not making it  if you 're right where the bomb
 went off you will be vaporized  and that 's i 'm just telling you this is not good 
 you assume that
 two mile radius you have a fifty percent chance of being killed and up to about eight miles away now i 'm talking about killed instantly
 somewhere between a
  ten and twenty percent
 chance of getting killed  
 the thing about this is that the experience of the nuclear detonation is first of all  tens of millions of degrees fahrenheit at the core here where it goes off 
 and
 an extraordinary amount of energy in the form of heat  acute radiation and blast effects
  and destruction of buildings almost totally within this
 yellow circle here  
 and what i 'm going to focus on as i come to conclusion here is that  what happens to you if you 're in here  
 well if we 're talking about the old days of an all out nuclear attack you up here  are as dead as the people here  so it was a moot point 
 my point now though is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here  if you 've survived the initial blast you have when the
  blast goes off and by the way if it ever comes up don 't look at it 
 laughter if you look at it  you 're going to be blind  either temporarily or permanently so if there 's any way that you can avoid like avert your eyes that would be a good thing
  if you find yourself alive  but you 're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon 
 you have that 's gone off you have ten to twenty minutes depending on the size and exactly where it went off to get
 out of the way
 before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the from the mushroom cloud that goes up 
 in that ten to fifteen minutes all you have to do and i mean this seriously is go about a mile
 away from the blast  and what happens is this is i 'm going to show you now some fallout plumes  within twenty minutes  it comes straight
  lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds and it 's mostly in this particular direction it 's going
 northeast  and if you 're in this vicinity you 've got to get away so you 're feeling the wind
 and there 's tremendous wind now that you 're going to be feeling and you want to go perpendicular to the wind [ not upwind or downwind ] if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you you 've got to get out of there if you don 't get out of there you 're going to be exposed to lethal radiation 
 in very short order  if you can 't get out of there  we want you to go into a shelter and stay there now
  shelter in an urban area means you
 you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible or you have to be on a floor on a high floor if it 's a ground burst explosion  which it would be 
 higher than the ninth floor so you have to be tenth floor or higher or in the basement
  but basically you 've got to get out of town as quickly as possible
  if you do that you actually can survive a nuclear
 blast over the next few days to a week there will be a radiation cloud  again going with the wind and settling down for another fifteen or twenty miles out in this case 
 over long island  and if you 're in the direct fallout zone here  you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there and that that 's clear but if you are sheltered you can actually survive  
  and not knowing information can save your life  and it could mean the difference between one hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand fatalities from something like this
 and half a million to seven hundred thousand fatalities 
 so response planning in the twenty first century is both possible and is essential  but in two thousand and eight there isn 't one single american city
 that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear
  detonation disaster 
 part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves  personally are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe  they are paralyzed  you say nuclear 
 to them  and they 're thinking oh my god we 're all gone what 's the point it 's futile 
  so the goal here is to minimize fatalities  and i just want to leave you with the personal points that i think you might be interested in 
 the key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out 
 and not going into harm 's way 
 that 's basically all we 're going to be talking about here  
 and the farther you are away in distance 
 the longer it is in time from the initial blast and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere the
  better so separation hopefully with dirt or concrete or being in a basement
 distance and time is what will save you so here 's what you do 
 first of all as i said don 't stare at the light flash if you can i don 't know you could possibly resist doing that but let 's assume  theoretically you want to do that you want to keep your mouth open so your eardrums don 't burst from the from the pressures 
 if you 're very close to what happened you actually do have to duck and cover like bert told you bert the turtle
  and you want to get under something so that you 're not injured or killed by objects if that 's at all possible you want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud i said in just a few minutes  and shelter and place 
 you want to move [ only ] crosswind for one point two miles you know  if you 're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed and down in that direction less destroyed here  then you know that it was over there the blast and you 're going this way 
 once you 're out and evacuating you want to keep as much of your skin your mouth and nose covered as long as that covering doesn 't impede you moving and getting out of there and finally you 
  want to get decontaminated as soon as possible and if you 're wearing clothing you 've taken off your clothing you 're going to get showered down some place and and remove the radiation that would be
  minimum  but you 're going to wait hopefully you 'll have your little 
 radio  and you 'll be waiting for people to tell you when it 's safe to go outside that 's what you need to do in conclusion 
 nuclear war is less likely than before but by no means out of the question and it 's not survivable nuclear terrorism is possible it may be probable but is survivable 
 and this is jack geiger who 's one of the heroes
  community and jack said the only way to deal with nuclear anything whether it 's war or terrorism is abolition of nuclear weapons  and you want something to work on once you 've fixed global warming  
 i urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable inhumane reality of nuclear weapons
