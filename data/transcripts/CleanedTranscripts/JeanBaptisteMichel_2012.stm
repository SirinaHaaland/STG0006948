  that mathematics is a very powerful language  it has generated considerable insight in physics in biology and economics  but not that much in the humanities and in history  
 i think there 's a belief that it 's just impossible that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind that you cannot measure history
 but i don 't think that 's right i want to show you a couple of examples why  
 so my collaborator erez and i were considering the following fact that two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language 
 that 's a powerful historical force  so the king of england alfred the great  will use a vocabulary and and grammar that is quite different from the king of hip hop
  changes over time and it 's a powerful force  so erez and i wanted to know more about that so we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule past tense conjugation  
 so you just add ed to a verb at the end to signify the past today i walk yesterday i walked 
 but some verbs are irregular yesterday i thought 
 now what 's interesting about that is irregular verbs between alfred and
  have become more regular like the verb to wed that you see here has become regular  
 so erez and i followed the fate of over one hundred irregular verbs through twelve centuries of english language 
 and we saw that there 's actually a very simple mathematical pattern that captures this complex historical change  
 namely if a verb is one hundred times more frequent than another it regularizes ten times slower 
 that 's a piece of history  but it comes in a
  in some cases math can even help explain or propose explanations for historical forces  
 so here steve pinker and i were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries there 's actually a well known regularity to them
 where the number of wars that are one hundred times deadlier is ten times smaller  
 so there are thirty wars that are about as deadly as the six days war but there 's only four wars that are one hundred times deadlier like world war i so what kind of
  historical mechanism can produce that what 's the origin of this  
 so steve and i through mathematical analysis 
 propose that there 's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this which lies in our brains this is a very well known feature in which we perceive quantities in relative ways
 quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a
  committing ten thousand soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot it 's relatively enormous if you 've already committed one thousand soldiers previously  
 but it doesn 't sound so much  it 's not relatively enough it won 't make a difference if you 've already committed one hundred thousand soldiers previously  
 so you see that because of the way we perceive quantities as the war drags on the number of soldiers committed to
  and the casualties will increase not linearly like ten thousand eleven thousand twelve thousand
 but exponentially ten thousand later twenty thousand later forty thousand  and so that explains this pattern that we 've seen before  so here mathematics is able to link
 a well known feature of the individual mind
 historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents  so these types of
  few of them  
 but i think in the next decade they will become commonplace the reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace  
 so there 's about one hundred and thirty million books that have been written since the dawn of time  
 companies like google have digitized many of them above twenty million actually 
 and when the stuff of history is available in digital form 
 it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently review trends in our history and our culture
  so i think in the next decade the sciences and the humanities will come closer together
 to be able to answer deep questions about mankind 
 and i think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that 
 it will be able to reveal new trends in our history  sometimes to explain them and maybe even in the future to predict what 's going to happen
