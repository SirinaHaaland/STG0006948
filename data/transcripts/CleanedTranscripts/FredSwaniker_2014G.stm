  at the age of four because of the coup d 'tat my family had to leave
 my native home of ghana and move to the gambia as luck would have it six months after we arrived  they too had a military coup
  i vividly remember being woken up in the middle of the night and gathering the few belongings we could and walking for about two hours
 to a safe house for a week we slept under our beds
 because we were worried that bullets might fly through the window  
 then at the age of eight  we moved to botswana this time it was different
  coups  everything worked great education they had such good infrastructure that even at the time they had
 a fiber optic telephone system long before it had reached western countries  
 the only thing they didn 't have is that they didn 't have their own national television station 
  and so i remember watching
 tv from neighboring south africa and watching nelson mandela in jail
 being offered a chance to come out
 if he would give up the apartheid struggle  but he didn 't he refused to do that until he actually achieved his objective of freeing south africa from apartheid 
 and i remember feeling how
 just one good leader
 could make such a big difference in africa  
 then at the age of twelve
  family sent me to high school in zimbabwe  
 initially this too was amazing growing economy excellent infrastructure  
 and
 it seemed like it was a model for economic development in africa  
 i graduated from high school in zimbabwe  and i went off to college six years later i returned to the country  
 everything was
  different  it had shattered into pieces  
 millions of people had emigrated  
 the economy was in a shambles  and it seemed all of a sudden that thirty years of development had been wiped out 
 how could a country go so bad so fast most people would agree
 that it 's all because of leadership
  responsible for having destroyed this country  
 now all these experiences of living in different parts of africa growing up
 did two things to me the first is it made me fall in love with africa  
 everywhere i went i experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent and saw the
  and the spirit of our people and at the time i realized that i wanted to dedicate the rest of my life
 to making this continent great  
 but i also realized that making africa great would require addressing this issue of leadership  
 you see all these countries i lived in the coups d 'tat and the corruption i 'd seen in ghana and gambia
 and in zimbabwe  contrasted with the wonderful examples i had seen
 in botswana
 and in south africa
 of good leadership it made me realize that africa would rise or fall because of the quality of our leaders  
 now one might think of course leadership matters everywhere  
 but if there 's one thing you take away from my talk today  it is this 
  more than anywhere else in the world  the difference that just one good leader can make
 is much greater than anywhere else and here 's why it
 's because in africa we have weak institutions like the judiciary  the constitution  civil society
 and so forth  so here 's a general rule of thumb that i believe in 
 when societies have strong institutions  the difference that one good leader can make is limited  but when you have weak
  institutions  then just one good leader
 can make or break that country  let me make it a bit more concrete 
 you become the president of the united states  you think wow  i 've arrived i 'm the most powerful man in the world 
 so you decide perhaps let me pass a law 
  let me try this way the senate comes and says uh uh we don 't think you can do that 
 you say perhaps let me print some money  i think the economy needs a stimulus 
 the central bank governor will think you 're crazy you might get impeached for that  
 but if you become the president of zimbabwe and you say you know i really like this job  i think i 'd like to stay in it forever
 well you just can you decide
 you want to print money you call the central bank governor and you say please double the money supply he 'll say 
 okay yes sir is there anything else i can do for you 
 this is the power that african leaders have 
 and this is why they make the most difference on the continent
  the good news
 is that the quality of leadership in africa has been improving  we 've had three generations of leaders in my mind generation one
 are those who appeared in the ' 50s and ' 60s these are people like kwame nkrumah of ghana and julius nyerere of tanzania  the legacy they left is that they brought independence to
  they freed us from colonialism and let 's give them credit for that they were followed by generation two 
 these are people that brought nothing but havoc to africa  
 think warfare  corruption human rights abuses 
 this is the stereotype of the typical african leader that we typically think of mobutu sese seko from zaire  sani abacha from nigeria  
 the good news is that most of these leaders have moved on  and they were replaced by generation three these are people like the late nelson mandela
 and most of the leaders that we see in africa today 
 and so forth  now these leaders are by no means perfect  
 but the one thing they have done is that they have cleaned up much of the mess of generation two  they 've stopped the fighting  and i call them
 the stabilizer generation they 're much more accountable to their people they 've improved macroeconomic
  and we are seeing for the first time africa 's growing and in fact it 's the second fastest growing economic region in the world  
 so these leaders are by no means perfect  but they are by and large the best leaders we 've seen in the last fifty years 
 so where to from here  
 i believe that the next generation to come after this generation four has a unique opportunity
 to transform the continent
  they can do two things that previous generations have not done  the first thing they need to do
 is they need to create prosperity for the continent  why is prosperity so important because none of the previous generations have been able to tackle this issue of poverty 
 africa today has the fastest growing population in the world  
 but also is the poorest
  africa will have a larger workforce than china  and by two thousand and fifty it will have the largest workforce in the world 
 one billion people will need jobs in africa  so if we don 't grow our economies fast enough 
 we 're sitting on a ticking time bomb not just for africa but for the entire world  
 let me show you an example
 of one person who is living up to this legacy of creating prosperity  
  laetitia 's a young woman from kenya
 who at the age of thirteen had to drop out of school because her family couldn 't afford to pay fees for her 
 so she started her own business rearing rabbits which happen to be a delicacy in this part of kenya that she 's from 
 this business did so well that within a year she was employing fifteen women
 and was able to generate enough income that she was able to send herself to school  and through these women fund another sixty five children to go to school  
 the profits that she generated she used that to build a school  and today
 she educates four hundred children in her community and she 's just turned eighteen 
 another example
 is erick rajaonary erick comes from the island of madagascar now erick realized that agriculture
 would be the key to creating jobs in the rural areas of madagascar
  but he also realized that fertilizer was a very expensive input for most farmers in madagascar
 madagascar has these very special bats
 that produce these droppings that are very high in nutrients in two thousand and six erick
 quit his job as a chartered accountant and started a company to manufacture fertilizer from the bat droppings
  erick has built a business that generates several million dollars of revenue  and he employs seventy people full time
 and another eight hundred people during the season when the bats drop their droppings the most now what i like about this story
 is that
 it shows that opportunities to create prosperity can be found almost anywhere  erick is known as the batman 
 and who would have thought that you would have been able to build a
 employing so many people just from bat poo 
 the second thing that this generation needs to do
 is to create our institutions  they need to build these institutions such that we are never held to ransom again
 by a few individuals like robert mugabe  now all of this sounds great
 but where are we going to get this generation four from 
 do we just sit and hope that they emerge by chance or that god gives them to us no  
 i don 't think so it 's too important an issue for us to leave it to chance  i believe
 that we need to create african institutions
  that will identify and develop these leaders in a systematic practical way  
 we 've been doing this for the last ten years through the african leadership academy  
 laetitia is one of our young leaders 
 today we have seven hundred of them that are being groomed for the african continent and over the next fifty years we expect to create six thousand of them  
 but one thing has been troubling me we would get about four thousand applications a year for one hundred young leaders that we could take into this academy
  and so i saw the tremendous hunger that existed for this leadership training that we 're offering  but we couldn 't satisfy it 
 so today  i 'm announcing for the first time in public
 an extension to this vision for the african leadership academy  we 're building twenty five brand new universities in africa
 that are going to cultivate this next generation of african leaders
  each campus will have ten thousand leaders at a time
 so we 'll be educating and developing two hundred and fifty thousand leaders at any given time 
 over the next fifty years this institution will create three million transformative leaders for the continent  
 my hope is that half of them will become the
  entrepreneurs that we need who will create these jobs that we need and the other half will go into government
 and the nonprofit sector  and they will build the institutions that we need  
 but they won 't just learn academics  
 they will also learn how to become leaders and they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs so think of this as africa 's ivy league  
 but instead of getting admitted because of
  scores
 or because of how much money you have or which family you come from the main criteria for getting into this university
 will be what is the potential that you have for transforming africa 
 but what we 're doing is just one group of institutions  we cannot transform africa
 by ourselves my hope
 is that many many other
  will blossom  and these institutions will all come together with a common vision
 of developing this next generation of african leaders generation four 
 and they will teach them this common message create jobs build our institutions  
 nelson mandela once said every now and then a generation is called upon to be great
  you can be that great generation i believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate
 the next generation of african leaders  then this generation four that is coming up
 will be the greatest generation that africa and indeed the entire world has ever seen  thank you
