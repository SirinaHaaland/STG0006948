  i had
 maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life i was in the third year of my seven year undergraduate degree 
 i took a couple victory laps in there and i was on a college choir tour up in northern california
  and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus and we we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains 
 and there were crickets and and birds and frogs making noise and as we sat there 
 over the mountains coming in from the north were these steven spielbergian clouds
 rolling toward us  and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley  so help me god every single animal in that
  place stopped making noise at the same time 
 this electric hush as if they could sense what was about to happen  and then the clouds came over us  and then  boom this massive thunderclap and
 sheets of rain it was just extraordinary and when i came back home i found a poem by the mexican poet octavio paz
  decided to set it to music a piece for choir called cloudburst which is the piece that we 'll perform for you in just a moment now
 fast forward to just three years ago 
 and we released to youtube this the virtual choir project one hundred and eighty five singers from twelve different countries  you can see my little video there
 conducting these people  
  alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home two years ago on this very stage  we premiered
 virtual choir two 
 two thousand and fifty two singers from fifty eight different countries
  this time performing a piece that i had written called sleep and then just last spring we released virtual choir three 
  had written this time nearly four thousand singers from seventy three different countries 
 and when i was speaking to chris about the future of virtual choir and where we might be able to take this 
 he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could could we do this
  in real time could we have people singing
 together in real time and with the help of skype that is what we are going to attempt today  
 now we 'll perform cloudburst for you the first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage  i 'm joined by
 singers from cal state long beach cal state fullerton
 and riverside community college some of the best amateur choirs in the country and
  and in the second half of the piece the virtual choir will join us  thirty different singers from thirty different countries  now  we 've pushed the technology as far as it can go but there 's still 
 less than a second of latency but in musical terms that 's a lifetime we deal in milliseconds  so what i 've done is i 've adapted cloudburst so that it embraces the
  performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together so with deep humility and for your approval we present
 so
 the
  no
  in real time
  no
  so
  far
  into
 the
  time
