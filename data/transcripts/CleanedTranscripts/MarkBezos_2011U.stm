  back in new york i am the head of development for a non profit called robin hood when i 'm not fighting poverty i 'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company 
 now in our town where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on
  any action  i remember my first fire i was the second volunteer on the scene so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get in 
 but still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be 
 when i found the captain he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner who was surely having one of the worst days of her life  
 here it was
  the middle of the night she was standing outside in the pouring rain  under an umbrella in her pajamas  barefoot  while her house was in flames 
 the other volunteer who had arrived just before me let 's call him
 lex luther 
 got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner 's dog
  dog
 i was stunned with jealousy  here was some lawyer or money manager who for the rest of his life gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature 
 just because he beat me by five seconds well i was next the captain waved me over he said bezos  i need
  to go into the house i need you to go upstairs past the fire and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes 
 i swear  so not exactly what i was hoping for but off i went
 up the stairs down the hall past the ' real ' firefighters who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point into the master bedroom
 to get a pair of shoes now i know what you 're thinking
  but i 'm no hero 
 i carried my payload
 back downstairs where i met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door  
 we took our treasures outside to the homeowner where not surprisingly his received much more attention than did mine 
 a few weeks later the department received a letter from the
  homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home the act of kindness she noted above all others  
 someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes
 in both my vocation at robin hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter  i am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental
  but i 'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis and you know what i 've learned  they all matter  
 so as i look around this room at people who either have achieved or are on their way to achieving remarkable levels of success  
 i would offer this reminder  
 don 't wait 
 don 't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody 's life
  if you have something to give give it now 
 serve food at a soup kitchen  clean up a neighborhood park be a mentor 
 not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody 's life  but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one so get in the game 
 save the shoes  thank you
