  start by posing a little bit of a challenge the challenge of dealing with data  data that we have to deal with in medical
 situations  it 's really a huge challenge for us  and this is our beast of burden this is a computer tomography machine
 a ct machine it 's a fantastic device it uses 
  beams that are rotating very fast around the human body  it takes about thirty seconds to go through the whole machine
 and is generating enormous amounts of information that comes out of the machine  so this is a fantastic machine that we can use for
 improving health care
 but as i said it 's also a challenge for us
 and the challenge is really found in this picture here it 's the the medical data explosion that we 're having right now we 're facing this problem  and
 let me step back in time let 's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then these machines that came out they started coming in the 1970s
 they would scan human bodies and they would generate about one hundred images of the human body  and i 've taken the liberty just for clarity to translate that to data
  slices that would correspond to about fifty megabytes of data  which is small
 when you think about the data we can handle today just on normal mobile devices  
 if you translate that to phone books  it 's about one meter of phone books in the pile  
 looking at what we 're doing today with these machines that we have we can just in a few seconds get twenty four thousand images out of a body  and that would correspond to about
  twenty gigabytes of data or eight hundred phone books and the pile would then be two hundred meters of phone books what 's about to happen
 and we 're seeing this it 's beginning a technology trend that 's happening right now is that we 're starting to look at time resolved situations as well  so we 're getting the dynamics out of the body as well  and just assume that we will be collecting data
 during five seconds and that would correspond to one terabyte of data
 that 's eight hundred thousand books and sixteen kilometers of phone books  that 's one patient one data set  and this is what we have to deal with  
 so this is really the enormous challenge that we have and already today this is twenty five thousand images
  imagine the the days when we had radiologists doing this  they would put up
  that 's impossible  so we have to do something that 's a little bit more intelligent than doing this  
 so what we do is that we put all these slices together imagine that you slice your body in all these directions  
 and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data into a block of data  so this is really what we 're doing so this gigabyte or terabyte of data we 're putting it into this
  but of course the block of data just contains the amount of x ray that 's been absorbed in each point in the human body  
 so what we need to do is to figure out a way of looking at the things we do want to look at and make things transparent that we don 't want to look at  
 so transforming the data set into something that looks like this  
 and this is a challenge this is a huge challenge for us to do that 
 using computers even though they 're getting faster and better
  all the time  it 's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data terabytes of data
 and extracting the relevant information i want to look at the heart i want to look at the blood vessels  
 i want to look at the liver maybe even find a tumor in some cases
  so this is where this little dear comes into play this is my daughter  this is as of nine a m this morning
 she 's playing a computer game she 's only two years old
 and she 's having a blast  so she 's really
  the driving force behind the development of graphics processing units 
 as long as kids are playing computer games graphics is getting better and better and better so please go back home tell your kids to play more games because that 's what i need  
 so what 's inside of this machine is what enables me to do the things that i 'm doing with the medical data
  so really what i 'm doing is using these fantastic little devices  and you know going back maybe
  ten years in time when i got the funding to buy my first graphics computer it was a huge machine  it was cabinets of processors and storage and everything 
 i paid about one million dollars for that machine 
 that machine is today about as fast as my iphone  so
 every month there are new graphics cards coming out and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors
  intel is out there as well  and you know for a few hundred bucks you can get these
 things and put them into your computer and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards  so this is really what 's enabling us to deal with the explosion of data in medicine 
 together with some really nifty work in terms of algorithms compressing data extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on  so
 i 'm going to show you a few examples
  of what we can do this is a data set that was captured using a ct scanner  you can see that this is
 a full data [ set ] it 's a woman you can see the hair you can see the individual structures of the woman 
 you can see that there is [ a ] scattering of x rays on the teeth the metal in the teeth that 's
 where those artifacts are coming from but
 fully interactively on standard graphics
 on a normal computer i can just put in a clip plane and of course all the data is inside  so i can start rotating i can look at it from different angles
 and i can see that this woman had a problem she had a bleeding up in the brain 
 and that 's been fixed with a little stent a metal clamp that 's tightening up the vessel  and just by changing the functions then i can decide what 's going to be transparent
 and what 's going to be visible  i can look at
  the skull structure  and i can see that okay this is where they opened up the skull on this woman  and that 's where they went in so these are fantastic images they 're really high resolution
 and they 're really showing us what we can do with
 with standard graphics cards today now we have really made use of this and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data
  into the system  and one of the applications that we 've been working on and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide
 is the application of virtual autopsies 
 so again looking at very very large data sets and you saw those full body scans that we can do we 're just pushing the body through the whole ct scanner
  and just in a few seconds we can get a full body data set  so this is from a virtual autopsy  and you can see how i 'm gradually peeling off
 first you saw the body bag that the body came in then i 'm peeling off the skin you can see the muscles and eventually you can see the bone structure
 of this woman  
 now at this point i would also like to emphasize that with the greatest respect for the people that i 'm now going to show i 'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies
 so it 's with great respect for the people that have died under violent circumstances that i 'm showing these pictures to you 
  in the forensic case and this is something that there 's been approximately four hundred cases so far
 just in the part of sweden that i come from
 that has been undergoing virtual autopsies in the past four years  
 so this will be the typical workflow situation the police will decide in the evening when there 's a case coming in they will decide okay is this a case where we need to do an autopsy  so in the morning in between six and seven in the
  the body is then transported inside of the body bag to our center and is being scanned through one of the ct scanners  
 and then the radiologist together with the pathologist and sometimes the forensic scientist looks at the data that 's coming out and they have a joint session and then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that 
 now looking at a few cases here 's one of the first cases that we had you can really see the
  our algorithms that allow us to zoom in on all the details
 and again it 's fully interactive so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here  
 without saying too much about this case this is a traffic accident a drunk driver hit a woman  
 and it 's very very easy to see the damages on the bone structure  and the cause of death is the broken neck  
 and this women also ended up under the car  so she 's quite badly beaten up by this
 here 's another case 
 a knifing and this is also again showing us what we can do  it 's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body 
 you can also see some of the artifacts from from the teeth that 's actually the filling of the teeth but because i 've set the functions to show me metal and make everything
  here 's another violent case this really didn 't kill the person the person was killed by stabs in the heart  but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs 
 here 's another case it 's very very interesting for us to be able to look at things like knife stabbings  here you can see that knife went through the heart  
 it 's very easy to see how air has been leaking from one part to another part which is difficult to do in a normal
  the criminal investigation to establish the cause of death and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction to find out who the killer really was 
 here 's another case that i think is interesting here you can see a bullet that has lodged just next to the spine
 on this person 
 and what we 've done is that we 've turned the bullet into a light source so that bullet is actually shining and it makes it really easy to find these fragments  during a physical autopsy  if you actually have to dig through the
  body to find these fragments that 's actually quite hard to do 
 one of the things that i 'm really really happy
 to be able to show you here today is our virtual autopsy table  
 it 's a touch device that we have developed based on these algorithms using standard graphics gpus 
 it actually looks like this just to give you a feeling for what it looks like
  it really just works like a huge iphone
  so we 've implemented all the gestures you can do on on the table
  and you can think of it as an as an enormous touch interface  so if you were thinking of buying an ipad forget about it this is what you want instead
  steve i hope you 're listening to this all
 right so it 's a very nice little device so if you have the opportunity please try it out it 's really
 so it gained some traction  and we 're trying to roll this out and trying to use it for educational purposes but also perhaps in the future in a more clinical
 situation  there 's a youtube video that you can download and look at this if you want to convey the information to other people about virtual autopsies  
 okay now that we 're talking about touch  let me move on to really
  and this is a bit of science fiction now so we 're moving into really the future  this is not really what the medical doctors are using right now but i hope they will in the future  
 so what you 're seeing on the left is
 a touch device  it 's a little mechanical pen that has very very fast step motors inside of the pen and
 so i can generate a force feedback so when i virtually touch data  it will generate forces in the pen  
 i get a feedback
  so in this particular situation  it 's a scan of a living person  
 i have this pen  and i look at the data and i move the pen towards the head  and all of a sudden i feel resistance 
 so i can feel the skin  
 if i push a little bit harder i 'll go through the skin and i can feel the bone structure inside  
 if i push even harder i 'll go through the bone structure especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft  and then i can
  the brain inside and this will be the slushy like this  
 so this is really nice and to take that even further this is a heart  
 and this is also due to these fantastic new scanners that just in in zero point three seconds i can scan the whole heart  
 and i can do that with time resolution  so just looking at this heart
  i can play back a video here  and this is karljohan one of my graduate students who 's been working on this project and he 's sitting there in front of the haptic
  the force feedback system  and he 's moving his pen
 towards the heart  and the heart is now beating in front of him so he can see how the heart is beating he
 's taken the pen  and he 's moving it towards the heart  and he 's putting it on the heart and then he feels the heartbeats
 from the real living patient  then he can examine how the heart is moving  he can go inside push inside of the heart  and really feel how the valves are moving 
 and this i think is really the
  for heart surgeons i mean it 's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon
 to be able to to go inside of the patient 's heart before you actually do surgery and do that with high quality resolution data
 so this is really neat  now we 're going
 even further into science fiction  and we heard a little bit about functional mri now
 this is really an interesting project  mri is using magnetic fields and radio frequencies to scan the brain or any part of the body
  so what we 're really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain but we can also measure the difference
 in magnetic properties of blood that 's oxygenated and blood that 's depleted of oxygen
 that means that it 's possible to map out
 the activity of the brain  
 so this is something that we 've been working on and you just saw motts the research engineer there going into the mri system  and he was wearing goggles
  so he could actually see things in the goggles so i could present things to him while he 's in the scanner and this is a little bit freaky  
 because what motts is seeing is actually this he 's seeing his own brain  
 so motts is doing something here and probably he is going like this with his right hand because the left side is is activated
 on the motor cortex
  and then he can see that at the same time 
 these visualizations are brand new  and this is something that we 've been researching for a little while  
 this is another sequence of motts ' brain and here we asked motts to calculate backwards from one hundred so he 's going one hundred 
  and then he 's going backwards  and you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain
 and is lighting up the whole brain well this is fantastic we can do this in real time we can investigate things we can tell him to do things you can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head
 because that 's where he 's seeing he 's seeing his own brain and he 's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things 
 the signal is really deep inside of the brain as well and it 's shining through because all of the data is inside this volume  
 and in just a second here you will see okay here motts now move your left foot   so he 's going like this
 for twenty seconds he 's going like that and all of a sudden it lights up up here  so we 've got motor cortex activation up there
  this is really really nice and
 i think this is a great tool and connecting also with the previous talk here 
 this is something that we could use as a tool to to really understand how the neurons are working how the brain is working and we can do this with very very high visual quality and very fast resolution  
 now we 're also having a bit of fun at the center so this is a cat scan
 computer aided tomography  so this is a lion from
  the local zoo outside of norrkoping in kolmarden
 elsa  so she came to the center and
 they sedated her and then put her straight into the scanner and then of course i get the whole data set from the lion  
 and i can do very nice images like this  i can peel off the layer of the lion i can look inside of it 
 and we 've been experimenting with this and i think this is a great application for the future of this technology because there 's very
  little known about the animal anatomy what 's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information  we can scan all sorts of things all sorts of animals 
 the only problem is to fit it into the machine 
 so here 's a bear
 it was kind of hard to get it in  and the bear is a cuddly friendly animal  
  the nose of the bear
 and you might want to cuddle this one until you change the functions and look at this so be aware of the bear  so
 with that i 'd like to
 to thank all the people who have helped me to generate these images
 it 's a huge effort that goes into doing this  gathering the data and developing the algorithms  writing all the software so some very talented people 
 my motto is always i only hire people that are smarter than i am and most of these are smarter than i am so thank you very much
