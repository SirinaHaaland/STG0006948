  when i saw a piece of technology called kinect it was called natal
 i was inspired and i thought for a moment  maybe it 's possible to address that one problem
  to create a character which seemed alive which noticed me that could look me in the eyes
 and feel real  and sculpt a story about our relationship  and so
 a year ago  i showed this off at a computer show called
 e3 and this was a piece of technology with someone called claire interacting with this boy  and there was a huge row
  online
 about hey this can 't be real and so i waited till now
 to have an actual demo of the real tech now this tech
 incorporates three big elements the first is a kinect camera which will be out in november  some incredible
 ai that was hidden in the dusty vaults
  collecting dust in microsoft 
 plus our quite crude attempts at ai at a company called lionhead 
 mixing all those things together just to get to this one simple idea 
 to create
 a real  living being in a computer
  be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick  
 but it 's a trick that actually works  so why don 't we go over and have a look at
 the demo now this is dimitri dimitri just waggle your
 arm around now you notice he 's sitting there are no controllers no keyboards
  just going to use his hand his body and his voice just like humans interact with their hands body and voice  so let 's move forward  
 you 're going to meet milo for the first time 
 we had to give him a problem
 because when we first created milo we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat to be honest with you he was quite a know it all and he wanted to kind of make you laugh
  laugh  so the problem we introduced to him was this he 's just moved house  he 's moved from london
 to new england over in america his parents are too busy
 to listen to his problems  and that 's when he starts almost conjuring you up  so here he is walking through
  and you 're able to interact with his world the cool thing is what we 're doing is we 're changing the mind of milo constantly 
 that means no two people 's milos can be the same you 're actually sculpting a human being here  
 so he 's discovering the garden you 're helping him discover the garden by
 just
 pointing out these snails
  at the start by the way if you are a boy  it 's snails if you 're a girl it 's butterflies because what we found was that
 girls hate snails 
 so remember this is the first time you 've met him and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious 
  by the way is fully ai driven we have complete control over his blush responses
 the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress 
 we actually do something called body matching if you 're leaning forward  he will try and slightly change the neuro linguistic nature of his of his face 
 because we went out with this strong idea how can we make you believe that something 's real
 now we 've used the hand the other thing to use is your body
  why not just instead of
 pushing left and right with a mouse or with a joypad why not use your body just to lean on the chair again  relaxed  you can lean back 
 but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way
  so dimitri 's now going to use he 's used his hand he 's used his body he 's now going to use the other thing which is essential and that 's his voice now 
 the thing about voice is  our experience with voice recognition is pretty awful isn 't it 
 it never works you order an airline ticket you end up in timbuktu
 so we 've tackled
  squashing a snail may not seem important but remember  even this choice will affect how milo develops 
 do you want milo to squash it when you see the microphone
  we 're using there is we 're using something a piece of technology called tellme it 's a company that microsoft acquired some years ago  we 've got a database of words which we recognize we pick those words out 
 we also reference that with the tonation database that we build up of
 of dimitri 's voice or the user 's voice
  now we need to have a bit more engagement and again  what we can do is we can look at the body
 very very interesting that that men more than women tend to be more competitive here
  they 're fine with teaching milo for the first few throws but then they want to beat milo  where women
  they 're more nurturing about this
  this is skimming stones  how do you skim 
 stones  you stand up  and you
 skim the stone it 's that simple 
 just recognizing your body recognizing the body 's motions the tech  understanding that you 've gone from sitting down to standing up
  again all of this is done in the way us humans do things and that 's crucially important
 if we want milo to appear real
  see if you to do any better
  milo 's being called back in by his parents giving us time to be alone
 and to help him out basically the bit that we missed at the start his parents had asked him to clean up his room and we 're going to help him with this now but this is going to be an introduction 
 and this is all about the deep psychology that we 're trying to use we 're trying to introduce you
 to what i believe is the most wonderful part  you being able to talk in your natural voice to milo 
 now to do that we needed a set up like a magician 
  we did was we needed to give milo this big problem
  just spilled
 a plate of sausages on the floor on the brand new carpet we 've all done it as parents we 've all done it as children 
 now 's a chance for dimitri to kind of reassure and calm milo down it 's all been too much for him he 's just moved house he 's got no friends 
 now is the time when we open
  that portal and allow you to talk to milo female voice why
 don 't you try saying something encouraging to cheer milo up dimitri 
 come on milo you know what parents are like they 're always getting stressed milo 
 what do they want to come here for anyway  we don 't know
  you 've got a new school to go to you 're going to meet loads of cool new friends milo i
 just really miss my old house that 's all dimitri well this
 is a pretty awesome house milo you 've got a cool garden to play in and a pond
  he recognizes you and i promise you if you 're sitting in front of this screen that is a truly wonderful moment 
  and we 're ready now to tell a story about his childhood and his life and it goes on  and he has you know 
 many adventures some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging he 's got to go to school 
 the cool thing is that we 're doing as well  as you interact with him you 're able to put things into his world he recognizes objects 
 his mind is based in a cloud 
 that means milo 's mind
 millions of people use it will get smarter and cleverer he 'll recognize more objects and thus understand more words  
 but for me this is a wonderful opportunity where technology at last can be connected with  
 where i am no longer restrained by the finger i hold in my hand as far as a computer game 's concerned
 or by the blandness of not being noticed if you 're watching a film
  or a book and i love those revolutions and i love the future that milo brings  thank you very much
