  like to talk about their relationship
  despite their middle age if you 've been following the themes of this conference or the entertainment industry it 's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other
 so it 's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces that lead to 
  the writers strike and it 's not just what these are doing to each other but it 's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter
  recently talked to a bunch of tweeners i wrote on
 cards television radio myspace internet pc and i said just arrange these from what 's important to you and what 's not and then tell me why
 let 's listen to what happens when they get to the portion of the discussion on television well i think it 's important
 but like not necessary because you can do a lot of other
 stuff with your free time than watch programs which is more fun internet or tv internet
 i think we the reasons one of the reasons we put computer before tv is because
 nowadays like we have tv shows on the computer oh yes and then you can download onto your ipod would you like to be the president of a tv network
  they 're going to lose all their money eventually like the stock market it goes up and down and stuff i think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff
 there 's been an
 uneasy relationship
 between the tv business and the tech business really ever since they both turned about thirty we go through periods of enthrallment
 followed by reactions in boardrooms in the finance community best characterized as what 's the finance term ick pooey
 let me give you an example of this the year is nineteen seventy six and warner buys atari because video games are on the rise the next year they march forward and they introduce qube the first interactive cable tv system
 and the new york times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home convergence great things are
  happening everybody in the east coast gets in the pictures citicorp penney rca all getting into this big vision
 by the way this is about when i enter the picture i 'm going to do a summer internship at time warner that summer i 'm all i 'm at warner that summer i 'm all excited to work on convergence
 and then the bottom falls out doesn 't work out too well for them they lose money and i
 i had a happy brush with convergence until kind of warner
 basically has to liquidate the whole thing that 's when i leave graduate school
 and i can 't work in new york on kind of entertainment and technology because i have to be exiled to california
 where the remaining jobs are almost to the sea to go to work for apple computer
 warner of course writes off more than four hundred million dollars four hundred million dollars
  real money back in the seventys but they were onto something and they got better at it
 by the year two thousand the process was perfected they merged with aol and in just four years managed to shed
 about two hundred billion dollars of market capitalization
 showing that they 'd actually mastered the art of applying moore 's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet
 now i think that one reason that the media and the entertainment
  communities or the media community is driven so
 crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently you know for fifty years we 've talked about changing the world about total transformation for fifty years it 's been about hopes and fears and and promises of a better world and i got to thinking
 you know who else talks that way and the answer is pretty clearly it 's people in religion and and in politics
 and so i realized that actually the tech world is best understood not as a business cycle but as a messianic movement we promise something great we evangelize it we 're going to change the world
 it doesn 't work out too well and so
 we actually go back to the well and start all over again as the people in new york and l a l a look on in absolute morbid astonishment but it 's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing so
 what i 'd like to ask is if the computer is becoming a principal tool of media and entertainment
 how did we get here i mean how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media of course the first computer was built just after world war ii to solve military problems
 but things got really interesting just a couple of years later nineteen forty nine with whirlwind
 built at mit 's lincoln lab
 jay forester was building this for the navy but you can 't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind
 a machine that might actually be a potential media star so take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers and the computer begins to express itself
  but i have an idea mister forrester since this computer was made in conjunction with the office of naval research why don 't we switch down to the pentagon in washington and let the navy
  admiral bolster give whirlwind the workout well ed this problem concerns the navy 's viking rocket
 this rocket goes up one hundred and thirty five miles into the sky
 now at the standard rate of fuel consumption i would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket
 and see how it can determine at any instant
 say at the end of forty
  we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out
  the mit lab
 you know so much was worked out the first real time interaction the video display
 pointing a gun it lead to the micro computer but unfortunately
  it was too pricey for the navy and all of this would have been lost if it weren 't for a happy coincidence enter the atomic bomb
 we 're threatened by the greatest weapon ever and knowing a good thing when it sees it the air force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us
 they adapt whirlwind to a massive air defense system deploy it all across the frozen north north and spend nearly three times as much on this
  as was spent on the manhattan project building the a bomb in the first place
 talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry and you can imagine the air force became a pretty good salesman here 's their marketing video in a mass
 raid high speed bombers could
  in on us before we could determine their tracks and then it would be too late to act
 we cannot afford to take that chance
 it is to meet this threat that the air force has been developing sage
 the semi automatic ground environment system to strengthen our air defenses
 this new computer built to become the nerve center of a
  defense network is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid
 it is provided with its own powerhouse containing large diesel driven generators
 air conditioning equipment
 and cooling towers required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer
 you know that one computer was huge
 an interesting marketing lesson from it which is basically when you market a product you can either say this is going to be wonderful it will make you feel better and enliven you
 or there 's one other marketing proposition if you don 't use our product you 'll die
 this is a really good example of that this had the first pointing device it was distributed so it worked out distributed computing and
  all these things could talk to each other
 about twenty percent of all the nation 's programmers were wrapped up in this thing and it led to an awful lot of what what we have today
 it also used vacuum tubes you saw how huge it was and to give you a sense for this because we 've talked a lot about moore 's law and making things small at this conference so let 's talk about making things large
 if we took whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know say century city it would fit beautifully you 'd kind of have to take century city out but it could fit in
  but like let 's imagine we took the latest pentium processor the latest core two extreme which is a four core processor that that intel 's working on it will be our laptop tomorrow
 to to build that what we 'd do with whirlwind technology is we 'd have to take up roughly from the ten to mulholland
 and from the four hundred and five to la cienega just with those whirlwinds and then the ninety two nuclear power plants that
  it would take to provide
 the power would fill up the rest of los angeles that 's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of france creates so the next time they tell you they 're on to something
 clearly they 're not so
 and we haven 't even worked out the cooling needs but it gives you the kind of power that people have that the audience has and the reasons these transformations are happening all of this stuff starts moving into industry dec kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini computer it
 shows up at places like mit
 and then a mutation happens spacewar is built the first computer game and all of a sudden interactivity and involvement and and passion is worked out actually 
  many mit students stayed up all night long working on this thing and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out dec knew a good think about wasting time it shipped every one of its computers with that game
 meanwhile as all of this is happening by the mid fiftys the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely
 a new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls
 and they 're quite certain that television is about to do them in in fact despair is in the air
 and a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything i 've been reading all week
  sarnoff who basically commercialized radio said this i don 't say that radio networks must die every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new 
  pattern new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues
  in the emerging tv business actually hit on the same idea and they fake it
  kits out put out your magic window and your erasing glove and rub it like this that 's the way we get some of the magic into it boys and girls then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set
 and rub it out from the center to the corners like this
 make sure you keep your magic crayons handy your winky dink crayons and your erasing glove because you 'll be using them during the show to draw like that you all set ok let 's get right to the first story about dusty man come on into the secret lab
  interactive tv and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the winky dink kits those are the winky dink crayons i know what you 're saying pete i could use any ordinary open source crayon
 why do i have to buy theirs i assure you that 's not the case
 turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your winky dink magic window other crayons may discolor or hurt the window this
  proprietary principle of vendor lock in
 would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere
 it led to lawsuits
 federal investigations and lots of repercussions and that 's a scandal we won 't discuss today
 but we will discuss this scandal because this man jack berry the host of winky dink
  went on to become the host of twenty one
 one of the most important quiz shows ever and it was rigged and it became unraveled when this man charles van doren was outed after an unnatural winning streak ending berry 's career and actually ending the career of a lot of people at cbs
 it turns out there was a lot to learn
 about how this new medium worked and fifty years ago if you 'd been at a meeting like this and were trying to understand the
  media there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from professor marshall mcluhan
 he actually understood something about a theme that we 've been discussing all week it 's the role of the audience in an era of pervasive electronic communications here he is talking from the one thousand nine hundred and sixtys
 if the audience can become involved
 in the actual process of making the ad then it 's happy
  's like the old quiz shows they were great tv because it gave the audience a role something to do
 they were horrified when they discovered they 'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged
 now then this was a horrible misunderstanding of tv on the part of the programmers you know mcluhan talked about the global village if you substitute the word
 blogosphere of the internet today it is very true that his understanding is probably very enlightening now let 's listen in to him the global village is a world in which
 you don 't necessarily have harmony you have extreme concern with everybody else 's business
 and much involvement in everybody else 's life it 's a sort of anne landers column writ large and it
 doesn 't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else
  else 's affairs and so the global village is as big as a planet and as small as a
 village post office we 'll talk a little bit more about him later we 're now right into the 
  's the era of big business and data centers for computing but all that was about to change
 you know the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in and when i say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations
  it 's not just a joke about messianism it 's actually what we do but for this part of the story i 'd actually like to throw it to america 's leading technology correspondent john markoff
 do you want to know what the counter culture in drugs sex rock 'n roll and the anti war movement had to do with computing everything
 it all happened within five miles of where i 'm standing at stanford university
  seventy five
 in the midst of revolution in the streets and rock and roll concerts in the parks
 a group of researchers led by people like john mccarthy a computer scientist at the stanford artificial intelligence lab and doug engelbart a computer scientist at sri changed the 
  world engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture but while he was beginning to do his work all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid peninsula there was lsd leaking out
  of keasey 's
 veterans hospital experiments and other areas around the campus
 and there was music literally in the streets the grateful dead was playing in the pizza parlors people were leaving to go back to the land there was the vietnam war there was black liberation there was women 's liberation
 this was a remarkable place at a remarkable time and into that ferment came the microprocessor i think it was that
  interaction that led to personal computing they saw
 these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build
 and most importantly they had this ethos of sharing information i think these ideas are difficult to understand because when you 're trapped in one paradigm the next paradigm is always like a
 science fiction
  universe it makes no sense the stories were so compelling that i decided to write a book about them the title
 of the book is what the dormouse said how the sixtys counterculture shaped the personal computer industry
 the title was taken from the lyrics to a jefferson airplane song the lyrics go remember what the dormouse said feed your head feed your head feed your head
  by this time computing had kind of leapt into media territory and in short order much of what we 're doing today was imagined in cambridge and silicon valley here 's
  the architecture machine group the predecessor of the media lab in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one
 meanwhile in california we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff hypercard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks where you could randomly hook to any kind 
  of picture or piece of text or data across a file system and we had no way of explaining it there was no metaphor was it a database a prototyping tool a scripted language
 heck it was everything so we ended up writing a marketing brochure we asked a question about how the mind works and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant
 a few years later we
 we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of how do you get the content you want the way you want it
 and the easy way here 's the apple marketing video you 'll be
  to know i 'm sure that there are several ways to create a hypercard interactive video
 the most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own hypercard stacks
 by far the simplest method is to buy a pre made videodisc and hypercard stacks from a commercial supplier
 the method we illustrate in this video uses a pre made videodisc but creates custom hypercard stacks this method allows
  you to use existing videodisc materials
 in ways which suit your specific needs and interests i hope you realize how subversive that is that 's like a dick cheney speech you think he 's a nice balding guy but he 's just declared war
 on the content business find the commercial stuff mash it up tell the story your way now as long as we confine this to the education
  personal matter between the computer and the file system that 's fine but as you can see it was about to leap out and upset jack valenti and a lot of other people
 by the way speaking of the filing system it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network
 a few years later tim berners lee worked that out it became a killer app of links and today of course we call that the world wide web
 now not only was i instrumental in helping apple miss the internet but a couple of years later i helped bill gates do the same thing
 the year is one thousand nine hundred and ninety three and
 he was working on a book and i was working on a video to help him kind of explain
 where we were all heading and how to popularize all this we were plenty aware that we were messing with media and on the surface it looks like we
  the role of the audience
  audience a role something to do
  this is going to be
