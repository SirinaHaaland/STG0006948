  and saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs as a marine biologist turned photographer  i 've spent most of my career looking for places as magical as those i used to dream about when i was little 
 as you can see i began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age but the first time i truly went underwater  i was about ten years old  and i can still vividly remember furiously finning to reach this old encrusted cannon on a shallow
  when i finally managed to grab hold of it i looked up  
 and i was instantly surrounded by fish in all colors of the rainbow 
 that was the day i fell in love with the ocean thomas peschak conservation photographer
 in my forty years on this planet  i 've had the great privilege to explore some of its most incredible seascapes for national geographic magazine
 and the save our seas foundation i 've photographed everything from really really big sharks to dainty ones that fit in the palm of
  hand  i 've smelled the fishy fishy breath of humpback whales feeding just feet away from me in the cold seas off canada 's great bear rainforest  and i 've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles in the mozambique channel
  everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean 
 and the pristine seas i used to dream of as a child are becoming harder and harder to find  they are becoming more compressed
 and more threatened
 as we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on
 earth  i 've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand 
 for a long time i thought i had to shock my audience out of their indifference with disturbing images and while this approach has merits  i have come full circle  
 i believe that the best way for me to effect change is to sell love 
 i guess i 'm a matchmaker
  of sorts and as a photographer  i have the rare opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems that lie hidden beneath the ocean 's surface  
 you can 't love something and become a champion for it if you don 't know it exists  uncovering this
 that is the power of conservation photography 
 i 've visited hundreds of marine locations
  but there are a handful of seascapes that have touched me incredibly deeply 
 the first time i experienced that kind of high was about ten years ago  off south africa 's rugged wild coast and
 every june and july  enormous shoals of sardines travel northwards in a mass migration we call the sardine run  and boy do those fish have good reason to run  in hot pursuit
 are hoards of hungry and agile
  predators  common dolphins hunt together and they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal and they create bait balls they drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface
 and then they rush in to dine on this pulsating and movable feast  
 close behind are sharks now most people believe that sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies but during the sardine run  they actually coexist in fact dolphins
 actually help sharks feed more effectively  without dolphins the bait balls are more dispersed
 and sharks often end up with what i call a sardine donut 
 or a mouth full of water now while i 've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run  i know they don 't see me as prey however i get bumped and tail slapped just like any other guest at this rowdy rowdy banquet
  the shores of africa we travel east across the vastness that is the indian ocean to the maldives an archipelago of coral islands  
 and during the stormy southwest monsoon manta rays from all across the archipelago travel to a tiny speck in baa atoll called hanifaru armies of crustaceans most no bigger than the size of your pupils
  are the mainstay of the manta ray 's diet  
 when plankton concentrations become patchy 
 manta rays feed alone and they somersault themselves backwards again and again very much like a puppy chasing its own tail 
 however when plankton densities increase the mantas line up head to tail to form these long feeding chains  
 and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line is surely to be gobbled up by the next
  after 
 as plankton levels peak in the bay  the mantas swim closer and closer together in a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding 
 and as they swirl in tight formation this multi step column of mantas creates its own vortex  sucking in
 and delivering the plankton right into the mantas ' cavernous mouths the experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays is truly
  the site enjoyed no protection and was threatened by development  and working with ngos like the manta trust my images eventually helped hanifaru become a marine protected area 
 now fisherman from neighboring islands  they once hunted these manta rays to make traditional drums from their skins  today  
 they are the most ardent conservation champions and manta rays earn the maldivian economy in excess of eight
  dollars every single year
 i have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read there be dragons and today the closest i 've come is visiting remote atolls
 in the western indian ocean  far far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets diving into these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like 
 very few
  people have heard of bassas da india a
 tiny speck of coral in the mozambique channel its reef forms a protective outer barrier
 and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground for galapagos sharks these sharks are anything but shy even during the day 
 i had a bit of a hunch that they 'd be even
  never before have i encountered so many sharks on a single coral outcrop capturing and sharing moments like this
 that reminds me why i chose my path  earlier this year  i was on assignment for national geographic magazine in baja california
  and about halfway down the peninsula on the pacific side lies san ignacio lagoon 
 a critical calving ground for gray whales for one hundred years this coast was the scene of a wholesale slaughter where more than twenty thousand gray whales were killed  leaving only 
 a few hundred survivors  today the descendents of these same whales nudge their youngsters to the surface to play and even interact with
 this species truly
 has made a remarkable comeback 
 now on the other side of the peninsula lies cabo pulmo a sleepy fishing village  decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse in
  to proclaim their waters a marine reserve  but what happened next was
 nothing short of miraculous in two thousand and five 
 after only a single decade of protection  scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded  but don 't take my word for it come with me 
 on a single breath  swim with me in deep into one of the largest and densest schools of fish i have
 ever encountered
  we all have the ability to be creators of hope 
  too late for our oceans and particularly i want to focus on nature 's resilience in the face of seven point three billion people 
 my hope is that in the future  i will have to search much much harder to make photographs like this 
 while creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean 
 those will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me 
 to thrive and survive in my profession you really have to be a hopeless optimist
  and i always operate on the assumption that the next great picture that will effect change
 is right around the corner  behind the next coral head  inside the next lagoon or possibly in the one after
