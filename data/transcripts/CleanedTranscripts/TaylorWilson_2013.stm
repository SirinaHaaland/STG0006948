  have a big announcement to make today  and i 'm really excited about this  and this may be a little bit of a surprise to
 many of you who know my research and what i 've done well  i 've really tried to solve some some big problems
  terrorism and health care and diagnosing and treating cancer  but i started thinking about all these problems  and
 i realized that the really biggest problem we face what all these other problems come down to is energy is electricity the flow of electrons  
 and i decided that
 i was going to set out to try to to solve this
 probably is not what you 're expecting you 're probably expecting me to come up here and talk about fusion because that 's what i 've done most of my life  but this is actually a talk about
  okay 
 but this is actually a talk about fission it 's about perfecting something old and bringing something old into the
  let 's talk a little bit about
 how nuclear fission works 
 in a nuclear power plant you have a big pot of water that 's under high pressure and you have some fuel rods 
 and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium and they 're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel 
 and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level  and that reaction
 heats up water the water turns to
  steam turns the turbine  and you produce electricity from it this is the same way we 've been producing electricity the steam turbine idea for one hundred years 
 and nuclear was a really big advancement in a way to heat the water but you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine  
 and i thought  you know  is this the best way to do it is fission kind of played
  or is there something left to innovate here 
 and i realized that i had hit upon something that i think has this huge potential to change the world  and
 this is what it is this is a small modular reactor  so it 's not as big as
 the reactor you see in the diagram here this is between fifty and one hundred megawatts  but that 's a ton of
  that 's between 
 say at an average use that 's maybe twenty five thousand to one hundred thousand homes could run off that now the really interesting thing about these reactors is they 're built in a factory  
 so they 're modular reactors that are built essentially on an assembly line  
 and they 're trucked anywhere in the world you plop them down and they produce electricity 
 this region right here is the
  and this is buried below ground which is really important for someone who 's done a lot of counterterrorism work  i can 't
 extol to you how great having something buried below the ground is for for proliferation and security concerns  
 and inside this reactor
 is a molten salt  so anybody who 's a fan of
 thorium they 're going to be really excited about this 
  happen to be really good at breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle 
 but i 'm not really concerned about the fuel you can run these off
 they 're really hungry they really like
 down blended weapons pits so that 's highly enriched uranium and weapons grade plutonium that 's been down blended it 's made into a grade where it 's not usable for a nuclear weapon
 but they love this stuff  and we have a lot of it sitting around because this is
  big problem you know in the cold war we built up this huge arsenal of nuclear weapons  and that was great and
 we don 't need them anymore  and what are we doing with all the the waste essentially what are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons well we 're securing them and it would be great if we could burn them eat them up and this reactor loves this stuff  
 so it 's a molten salt reactor it has a core  and it has a heat exchanger
  the hot salt the radioactive salt to a cold salt which isn which isn 't radioactive it 's still thermally hot but it 's not radioactive  
 and then that 's a heat exchanger to what makes this design really really interesting 
 and that 's a heat exchanger to a gas so going back to what i was saying before about all power being produced well  other than photovoltaic being produced by this
 boiling of steam and turning a turbine
  turbine
  that 's actually not that efficient and in fact in a nuclear power plant like this it 's only roughly thirty to thirty five percent efficient that 's how much thermal 
  energy the reactor 's putting out to how much electricity it 's producing  and the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors operate at pretty low temperature they operate anywhere
  two hundred to three hundred degrees celsius  
 and these reactors run at six hundred to seven hundred degrees celsius  which means the higher the temperature you go to thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies  
 and this reactor doesn 't use water it uses gas so supercritical co2 or helium  
 and that goes into a turbine  and this is called the brayton cycle this is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity and this makes this almost fifty percent efficient between forty five and fifty percent
  efficiency  and i 'm really excited about this because
 it 's a very compact core molten salt reactors are very compact by nature  but what 's
 what 's also great is you get a lot more electricity out for how much uranium you 're fissioning not to mention the fact that these burn up their burn up is much higher so for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor a lot more of it 's
 being used
  traditional nuclear power plant like this is
  you 've got these these rods that are clad in zirconium  
 and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets well uranium dioxide 's a ceramic and ceramic doesn 't like releasing what 's inside of it  
 so you have what 's called the xenon pit and so some of these fission products love neutrons they love the neutrons that are going on and
  helping this reaction take place and they eat them up  which means
 that combined with the fact that the cladding doesn 't last very long you can only run one of these reactors for roughly say eighteen months without
 refueling it  
 so these reactors run for thirty years without refueling which is 
 in my opinion very very amazing  because it means it 's a sealed system no refueling means
 can seal them up and they 're not going to be a proliferation risk  
 and they 're not going to have either nuclear material or radiological material proliferated from their cores  
 but
 let 's go back to safety because everybody after fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear and one of the things when i set out to design a power reactor was it had to be passively and intrinsically safe  and i 'm really excited about this
  essentially two reasons 
 one it doesn 't operate at high pressure  
 so traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor or boiling water reactor they 're very very hot water at very high pressures  
 and this means essentially in the event of an accident if you had any kind of breach of this stainless steel
 pressure vessel the coolant would leave the core these reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure 
 so there 's no inclination for the fission
  products to leave the reactor in the event of an accident  
 also they operate at high temperatures  and the fuel is molten  so they can 't melt down  
 but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances 
 or you lost off site power in the case of something like fukushima there 's a dump tank because your fuel is
  and it 's combined with your coolant 
 you could actually just drain the core into
 what 's called a sub critical setting  basically a tank underneath the reactor that has some neutrons absorbers  and this is really important  
 because the reaction stops in this kind of reactor you can 't do that the fuel like i said is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods  and in the event of an accident in one of 
  these type of reactors fukushima and three mile island looking back at three mile island we didn 't really see this for a while
 these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods what happens is when they see high pressure water steam in an oxidizing environment they
 'll actually produce hydrogen and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fission products so the core of this reactor since it 's not under pressure and it doesn 't have this chemical reactivity 
 means that there 's no inclination for the fission products
 to leave this reactor
 so even in the event of an accident
  yeah  the reactor may be toast which is you
 know sorry for the power company  but we 're not going to contaminate large quantities of land so i i really think that in the 
 say twenty years it 's going to take us to get fusion and make fusion a reality this could be the source of
  it 's an amazing technology because not only does it combat climate change 
 but it 's an innovation it 's a way to bring power to the developing world because it 's produced in a factory and it 's cheap you can put them anywhere in the world you want to 
 and maybe something else  as a kid  i was
  was obsessed with nuclear science too to a point but
 before that i was obsessed with space  and i was really excited about you know being an astronaut and designing rockets which was something that was always exciting to me  but
 i think i get to come back to this because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket
 that produces fifty to one hundred megawatts  that is the rocket designer 's dream 
  that 's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet 's dream not only do you have fifty to one hundred megawatts to power whatever you want to
 provide propulsion to get you there  but you have power once you get there you know rocket designers
 who use solar panels or fuel cells  i mean a few watts or kilowatts wow that 's a lot of power i mean now we 're talking about one hundred megawatts that 's a ton of power that could power power a martian
  that could power a rocket there  and so i hope that
 maybe i 'll have an opportunity to kind of explore my rocketry passion at the same time that i explore my nuclear passion and
 people say oh well you 've launched this thing and it 's radioactive into space and what about accidents 
 but we launch plutonium batteries all the time everybody was really excited about curiosity and that had
 this big plutonium battery on board
  which actually has a higher specific activity than the low enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors  
 which means that the effects would be negligible  because you launch it cold and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor so i
 'm really excited i think that i 've designed this reactor here that can
 be an innovative source of energy provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications  and i 'm really prepared
  to do this i graduated high school in may  and 
 i graduated high school in may and i decided that i was going to start up a company to commercialize these technologies that i 've developed these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers and these systems to produce medical isotopes
  i want to do this  and i 've slowly been building up a team of some of the most incredible people i 've ever had the chance to work with  
 and i 'm really prepared to make this a reality and i think i think that looking at the technology this will be cheaper than cheaper than or the same price 
  as natural gas  and you don 't have to refuel it for thirty years which is an advantage for the developing world  
  something really poetic about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars  
 because the stars are giant fusion reactors they 're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky the energy that i 'm able to talk to you today  while it was converted to chemical energy in my food originally came from a nuclear reaction 
 and so there 's something poetic about in my opinion perfecting
  and using it as a future source of innovative energy  so thank you guys
