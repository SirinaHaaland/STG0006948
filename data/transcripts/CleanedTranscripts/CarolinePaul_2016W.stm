  when i was a kid i was obsessed with the guinness book of world records  and i really wanted to set a world record myself 
 but there was just one small problem 
 i had absolutely no
  i decided to set a world record in something that demanded absolutely no skill at all i decided to set a world record
 in crawling 
 laughter now the record at the time was twelve and a half miles
  and for some reason this seemed totally manageable
  recruited my friend anne and together we decided we didn 't even need to train 
 and on the day of our record attempt we put furniture pads on the outside of our good luck jeans and we set off 
 and right away we were in trouble
  because the denim was against our skin and it began to chafe  and soon our knees were being chewed up
 hours in it began to rain  then  anne dropped out  
 then it got dark 
 now by now my knees were bleeding through my jeans and i was hallucinating from the cold and the pain and the monotony  
 and to give you an idea of the suffer fest that i was undergoing
  the first lap around the high school track took ten minutes the last lap took almost thirty  after
 twelve hours of crawling  i stopped  and i had gone eight and a half miles  
 so i was short
  for many years i thought this was a story of abject failure  but today i see it differently  because
 when i was attempting the world record i was doing three things i was getting outside my comfort zone i was calling upon my resilience  and i was finding confidence in myself and my own decisions  
 i didn 't know it then but
  i became a san francisco firefighter  
 and i was the 15th woman in a department of one thousand five hundred men 
 and as you can imagine when i arrived there were many doubts about whether we could do the job  so even though i was a five
  ten 150 pound collegiate rower and someone who could endure twelve hours of searing knee pain 
 i knew i still had to prove my strength and fitness 
 so one day a call came in for a fire and sure enough when my engine group pulled up  there was black smoke billowing from a building off an alleyway
  and i was with a big guy named skip and he was on the nozzle and i was right behind and it was a typical sort of fire it was smoky it was hot  
 and all of a sudden  
 there was an explosion 
 and skip and i were blown backwards my mask was knocked sideways  and there was this moment of confusion  and then
 i picked myself up  i groped for the
  and i did what a firefighter was supposed to do i lunged forward  opened up the water and i tackled the fire myself 
 the explosion had been caused by a water heater so nobody was hurt and ultimately it was not a big deal but later skip came up to me and said 
 nice job caroline in this surprised sort of voice 
 and i was confused because the fire hadn 't been difficult physically so why was he looking
  at me with something like astonishment 
 and then it became clear skip  who was by the way a really nice guy and an excellent firefighter 
 not only thought that women could not be strong he thought that they could not be brave either  
 and he wasn 't the only one 
  and strangers men and women throughout my career ask me over and over caroline  all that fire all that danger aren 't you scared 
 honestly i never heard a male firefighter asked this  
 and i became curious 
 why wasn 't bravery expected of women 
 now the answer began to come when a friend of mine lamented to me that her young daughter was a big scaredy cat and so i began to
  notice and yes  the daughter was anxious  but more than that the parents were anxious 
 most of what they said to her when she was outside began with be careful watch out or no 
 now my friends were not bad parents they were just doing what most parents do which is cautioning their daughters much more than they caution their sons
 there was a study involving a playground fire pole ironically 
 in which researchers saw that little girls were very likely to be warned by both their moms and dads about the fire pole 's risk  
 and if the little girls still wanted to play on the fire pole 
 a parent was very likely to assist
 but the little boys 
 they were encouraged to play on the fire pole despite any trepidations that they might have and often the parents offered guidance on how to use it on their own  
 so what message does this send to both boys and girls well that girls are fragile and more in need of help 
 and that boys can and should master difficult tasks by themselves it says that girls
  should be fearful and boys should be gutsy
  now the irony is that at this young age girls and boys are actually very alike physically in fact girls are often stronger until puberty and more mature  
 and yet we adults act
 as if girls are more fragile and more in need of help
  and they can 't handle as much 
 this is the message that we absorb as kids and this is the message that fully permeates as we grow up we women believe it men believe it  and guess what 
 as we become parents we pass it on to our children and so it goes  well so now i had my answer this is why women even 
 were expected to be scared this is why women often are scared
  now i know some of you won 't believe me when i tell you this but i am not against fear 
 i know it 's an important emotion and it 's there to keep us safe  
 but the problem is when fear is the primary reaction that we teach and encourage in girls whenever they face something outside their comfort zone  
 so i was a paraglider pilot for many years
  paraglider is a parachute like wing and it does fly very well
 but to many people i realize it looks just like a bedsheet with strings attached 
 laughter and i spent a lot of time on mountaintops inflating this bedsheet running off and flying  and i know
  you 're thinking you 're like caroline a little fear would make sense here 
 and you 're right it does i assure you i did feel fear  
 but on that mountaintop waiting for the wind to come in just right i felt so many other things too exhilaration confidence  
 i knew i was a good pilot  i knew the conditions were good
 but i would take a good hard look at it assess just how relevant it was
 and then put it where it belonged  which was more often than not behind my exhilaration my anticipation and my confidence  
 so i 'm not against fear i 'm just
  not saying your girls must be firefighters or that they should be paragliders  
 but i am saying that we are raising our girls to be timid even helpless  
 and it begins when we caution them against physical risk  
 the fear we learn and the experiences we don 't stay with us as we become women and morphs into all those things that we face and try to shed 
 our hesitation in speaking out our deference so that we can be liked
  and our lack of confidence in our own decisions  
 so how do we become brave 
 well here 's the good news bravery is learned and like anything learned it just needs to be practiced  so first 
 we have to take a deep breath and encourage our girls to skateboard climb trees and clamber around on that playground
  fire pole 
 this is what my own mother did 
 she didn 't know it then  
 but researchers have a name for this they call it risky play 
 and studies show that risky play is really important for kids all kids because it teaches hazard assessment  it teaches delayed gratification  it teaches
  it teaches confidence 
 in other words when kids get outside and practice bravery  they learn valuable life lessons 
 second  we have to stop cautioning our girls willy nilly 
 so notice next time you say watch out you 're going to get hurt or don 't do that it 's dangerous and remember
 that often what you 're really telling her is that she shouldn 't be pushing herself
 that she 's really not good enough that she should be afraid  
 third 
 we women have to start practicing bravery too we cannot teach our girls until we teach ourselves  
 so here 's another thing fear and exhilaration
 feel very similar
 the shaky hands
  heightened heart rate  the nervous tension  and i 'm betting that for many of you the last time you thought you were scared out of your wits you may have been feeling mostly exhilaration  
 and now you 've missed an opportunity  
 so practice and while girls should be getting outside to learn to be gutsy i get that adults don 't want to get on
  we all should be practicing
 at home in the office and even right here getting up the guts to talk to someone that you really admire  
 finally 
 when your girl is let 's say  on her bike on the top of the steep hill that she insists she 's too scared to go down 
 guide her to access her bravery  
 ultimately maybe that hill
  really is too steep  but she 'll come to that conclusion through courage not fear  
 because this is not about the steep hill in front of her this is about the life ahead of her
 and that she has the tools to handle and assess
 all the dangers that we cannot protect her from all the challenges that we won 't be there to guide her through
  everything that our girls here and around the world face in their future  
 so by the way the world record for crawling today 
  point one eight miles  and i would really love to see a girl go break that
