  let me tell you a story about a little girl named naghma
 naghma lived in a refugee camp with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters 
 every morning her father would wake up in the hopes he 'd be picked for construction work and on a good month he would earn fifty dollars
 the winter was very harsh  and unfortunately  naghma 's brother died and her mother became very ill 
 in desperation her father went to a neighbor to borrow two thousand five hundred dollars  
 after several months of waiting the neighbor became very impatient and he demanded that he be paid back 
 unfortunately naghma 's father didn 't have the money  and so the two men agreed to a jirga so simply put a jirga
  jirga is a form of mediation that 's used in afghanistan 's informal justice system 
 it 's usually presided over by religious leaders and village elders and jirgas are often used in rural countries like afghanistan where there 's deep seated resentment against the formal system  
 at the jirga the men sat together and they decided that the best way to satisfy the debt would be if naghma married the neighbor 's
  21 year old son she was six 
 now stories like naghma 's unfortunately are all too common  
 and from the comforts of our home we may look at these stories as another crushing blow to women 's rights 
 and if you watched afghanistan on the news you may have this view that it 's a failed state 
  afghanistan does have a legal system  
 and while jirgas are built on long standing tribal customs  even in jirgas laws are supposed to be followed  and it goes without saying
 that giving a child to satisfy a debt is not only grossly immoral it 's illegal 
 in two thousand and eight i went to afghanistan for a justice funded program  
 and i went there originally on this nine month program to train afghan lawyers in that nine months
  i went around the country and i talked to hundreds of people that were locked up  and i talked to many businesses that were also operating in afghanistan 
 and within these conversations i started hearing the connections between the businesses and the people and how laws that were meant to protect them were being underused  while gross and illegal punitive measures
  and so this put me on a quest for justness and what justness means to me
 is using laws for their intended purpose  which is to protect  the role of laws is to protect 
 so as a result i decided to open up a private practice  and i became the first foreigner to litigate in afghan courts  
  throughout this time i also studied many laws i talked to many people i read up on many cases and i found that the lack of justness is not just a problem in afghanistan  but it 's a global problem 
 and while i originally shied away from representing human rights cases because i was really concerned about how it would affect me both professionally and personally  
 i decided that the need for justness was so great that i couldn 't continue to ignore it  and so i started representing people like
  now since i 've been in afghanistan and since i 've been an attorney for over ten years i 've represented from ceos of fortune five hundred companies to ambassadors to little girls like naghma and with much success 
 and the reason for my success is very simple  i work the system from the inside out and use the laws in the ways that they 're intended to be used
  i find that achieving justness in places like afghanistan
 is difficult and there 's three reasons 
 the first reason is that simply put people are very uneducated as to what their legal rights were  and i find that this is a global problem the second issue
 is that even with laws on the books it 's often superseded or ignored by tribal customs
  like in the first jirga that sold naghma off  
 and the third problem with achieving justness is that even with good existing laws on the books there aren 't people or lawyers that are willing to fight for those laws  and that 's what i do  i use existing laws 
 often unused laws  
 and i work those to the benefits of my clients  
 we all need to create a global culture
 of human rights and be investors in a global human rights economy and by working in this mindset we can
  significantly improve justice globally now let 's get back to naghma 
 several people heard about this story and so they contacted me because they wanted to pay the $ two thousand five hundred debt 
 and it 's not just that simple you can 't just throw money at this problem and think that it 's going to disappear that 's not how it works in afghanistan  
 so
  i told them i 'd get involved  but in order to get involved what needed to happen
 is a second jirga needed to be called a jirga of appeals  
 and so in order for that to happen  we needed to get the village elders together we needed to get the tribal leaders together the religious leaders
 naghma 's father needed to agree  the neighbor needed to agree and also his son needed to agree  
 and
 i thought if i 'm going to get involved in this thing  then they also need to agree that i preside over it
 so after hours of talking
 and tracking them down and about thirty cups of tea they finally agreed that we could sit down for a second jirga  and we did and
 what was different about the second jirga is this time we put the law at the center of it  and it was very important for me that they all
  had a right to be protected  and at the end of this jirga it was ordered by the judge
 that the first decision was erased  
 and that the $ two thousand five hundred debt was satisfied  
 and we all signed a written order where all the men acknowledged that what they did was illegal  and if they did it again that they would go to prison
  and her right to be free protects us  
 now with my job there 's above average amount of risks that are involved  
 i 've been temporarily detained  i 've been
  accused of running a brothel accused of being a spy  i 've had a grenade thrown at my office it didn 't go off though 
 but i find that with my job that the rewards far outweigh the risks  
 and as many risks as i take my clients take far greater risks because they have a lot more to lose if their cases go unheard or worse if they 're penalized for having me as their lawyer 
 with every case that i take i realize that as much as i 'm standing behind my clients that they 're also standing behind
  me  and that 's what keeps me going 
 law as a point of leverage is crucial in protecting all of us 
 journalists are very vital in making sure that that information is given to the public  
 too often we receive information from journalists but we forget how that information was given
  this picture is a picture of the british press corps in afghanistan it was taken a couple of years ago by my friend david gill  according to the committee to protect journalists since two thousand 
  and ten there have been thousands of journalists who have been threatened  injured  killed detained  
 and it 's important that we never forget that because what they 're protecting is not only our right to receive that information but also the freedom of the press which is vital to a democratic society  
 matt rosenberg is a journalist in afghanistan  
 he works for the new york times and unfortunately a few months ago he wrote an article that displeased people in the government as a result he was temporarily detained
  detained and he was illegally exiled out of the country 
 i represent matt 
 and after dealing with the government i was able to get legal acknowledgment that in fact he was illegally exiled  
 and that freedom of the press does exist in afghanistan and there 's consequences if that 's not followed  
 i 'm happy to say that as of a few days ago 
 the afghan government formally invited him back into the country and they reversed their exile order of him 
 if you censor one journalist then it intimidates others and soon nations are 
  silenced it 's important that we protect our journalists and freedom of the press because that makes governments more accountable to us and more transparent 
 and our right to receive information protects us 
 our world is changing we live in a different world now  and what were once individual problems are really now global problems for all of us
 two weeks ago afghanistan had its first democratic transfer of power and elected
  which is huge and i 'm very optimistic about him  and i 'm hopeful that he 'll give afghanistan the changes that it needs especially within the legal sector  
 we live in a different world  we live in a world where my  eight year old daughter only knows a black president 
 there 's a great possibility that our next president will be a woman  and as she gets older she may question can a white guy be
  our world is changing  and we need to change with it and what were once individual problems are problems for all of us  
 according to unicef  there are currently over two hundred and eighty million
 boys and girls who are married under the age of fifteen two hundred and eighty million child marriages prolong the vicious cycle
  poverty  poor health  lack of education at the age of twelve sahar was married 
 she was forced into this marriage and sold by her brother when she went to her in laws ' house  they forced her into prostitution 
 because she refused  she was tortured 
 she was severely beaten with metal rods
  they burned her body they tied her up in a basement and starved her they used pliers to take out her fingernails 
 at one point she managed to escape
 from this torture chamber to a neighbor 's house  
 and when she went there instead of protecting her they dragged her back to her husband 's house
 and she was tortured even worse  
 when i met first sahar  
 thankfully women for afghan women gave her a safe haven to go to
 as a lawyer  i try to be very strong
 for all my clients  because that 's very important to me 
 but seeing her
  how broken and very weak as she was was very difficult 
 it took weeks for us to really get to what happened to her
 when she was in that house  but finally she started opening up to me 
 and when she opened up what i heard was
 she didn 't know what her rights were
  but she did know she had a certain level of protection by her government that failed her  and so we were able to talk about what her legal options were  
 and so we decided to take this case to the supreme court 
 now this is extremely significant because this is the first time that a victim of domestic violence in afghanistan was being represented by a lawyer 
 a law that 's been on the books for years and years
 but until sahar had never been used 
 in addition to this we also decided to sue for civil damages  again using a law that 's never been used  
 but we used it for her case 
 so there we were at the supreme court
 arguing in front of twelve afghan justices me as an american
  and sahar a young woman who when i met her couldn 't speak above a whisper 
 she stood up she found her voice  
 and my girl told them that she wanted justice and she got it 
 at the end of it all the court unanimously agreed
 that her in laws should be arrested for what
  her fucking brother should also be arrested for selling her 
 and they agreed that she did have a right to civil compensation 
 what sahar has shown us is that we can attack existing bad practices by using the laws in the ways that they 're intended to be used  
 and by protecting sahar we are protecting ourselves
  worked in afghanistan for over six years now a lot of my family and friends think that what i do looks like this 
 but in all actuality  what i do looks like this 
 now we can all do something 
 i 'm not saying we should all buy a plane ticket and go to afghanistan  but we can all be contributors to a global human rights economy
  can create a culture of transparency and accountability to the laws  and make governments more accountable to us as we are to them 
 a few months ago a south african lawyer visited me in my office
 and he said i wanted to meet you  i wanted to see what a crazy person looked like 
 the laws are ours  and no matter what your ethnicity
  race they belong to us and fighting for justice is not an act of insanity 
 businesses also need to get with the program a corporate investment in human rights is a capital gain on your businesses and whether you 're a business an ngo or a private citizen rule of law benefits all of us 
 and by working together with a concerted mindset through the people public and private sector
  we can create a global human rights economy and all become global investors in human rights 
 and by doing this  we can achieve justness together  thank you
