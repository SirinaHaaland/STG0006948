  there was no job no food children most of them became very malnourished like this
 deqo mohamed so
 as you know always in a civil war the ones affected most are the women and children so our
 patients are women and children
 and they are in our backyard it 's our home we welcome them that 's the camp that we have in now ninety thousand people where seventy five percent of them are women and children pat mitchell and this is your hospital
  this is the inside ha we are doing c sections and different operations because people need some help
 there is no government to protect them dm every morning we have about four hundred patients maybe more or less but sometimes we are only five doctors
 and sixteen nurses and
  we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them but we take the severe ones and we reschedule the other ones the next day
 it is very tough and as you can see it 's the women who are carrying the children it 's the women who come into the hospitals it 's the women are building the houses that 's their house
 and we have a school this is our bright
 we opened in the last two years an elementary
  where we have eight hundred and fifty children and the majority are women and girls applause pm and the
 doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic would you explain the rules for admission ha the people who
 are coming to us we are welcoming
 we are sharing with them
 whatever we have but there are only two rules
  first rule there is no clan distinguished and political division in somali society
  things we throw out the second no man can beat his wife
 if he beat we will put him in jail
 and we will call the eldest people until they identify this case we 'll never
  never release him that 's our two rules applause the
 other thing that i have realized
 that the woman is the most strong
 person all over the world because the last twenty years the somali
 woman has stood up
 they were the leaders and we are the leaders of our community
 and the hope of our future generations we are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war we can 
 we can do everything applause dm as
 my mother said we are the future hope and the men are only killing in somalia so we came up with these two
  rules in a camp with ninety thousand people you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights so there is no clan division
 and no man can beat his wife
 and we have a little storage room where we converted a jail so if you beat your wife you 're going to be there applause so
 empowering the women and giving the opportunity we are there for them they are not alone for this
  you 're running a medical clinic it brought much much needed medical care to people who wouldn 't get it you 're also running a civil society you 've created
  your own rules in which women and children are getting a different sense of security
  mother in these circumstances ha my age because i was born in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven
  we were having at that time government law and order but
 one day i went to the hospital my mother was sick and i saw the hospital
  the doctors how they are committed
 to help the sick people i admired them and i decided to become a doctor
 my mother died unfortunately when i was twelve years old then
 my father allowed me
 to to proceed with my hope
 my mother died in a gynecology complication so i decided to become a gynecology specialist
 that 's why i became a doctor
 so dr deqo
 has to explain dm for me my mother was preparing me when i was a child to become a doctor but i really didn 't want to maybe i should become an historian 
 or maybe a reporter i loved it but it didn 't work when the war broke out civil war i saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help and
  how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in somalia and help the women and children and i thought maybe i can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist laughter
 so i went to russia and my mother also during the time of the soviet union so some of our character maybe we will come with a strong soviet background of training
 so that 's how i decided
 same my sister was different she 's here she 's also a doctor she graduated in russia also applause and
 to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war when i was sixteen and my sister was eleven when the civil war broke out
 so it was the need and the people we
  early ninety s that 's what made us go back and work
 for them pm
 so what is the biggest challenge working mother and daughter in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations ha yes i was working in a tough situation
 very dangerous
 and when i saw the people who needed me i was staying with them to help because i
  something for them
 most people fled
 abroad but i remained with those people and
 i was trying to do something any little thing i could do i succeeded in my place
 now my place is ninety thousand
  not fighting
 but we try to stand on our feet to do something little things we can for our people
 and i 'm thankful for my daughters when they come to me they help me to treat the people to help
 they do everything for them they have done what i desire to to do for them
  the best part of working with your mother and the most challenging part for you dm
 she 's very tough it 's most challenging she always expects us to do more
 and really when you think you cannot do it she will push you and i can do it that 's the best part she shows us trains us how to do and how to be better people and how to do long hours in surgery
 three hundred patients per day ten twenty surgeries and still you have to manage the camp that 's how she trains us it
 is not like beautiful offices here twenty patients you 're tired you see three hundred patients twenty surgeries and ninety thousand people to manage pm
