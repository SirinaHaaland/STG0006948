  tell you about a project being carried out by scientists all over the world
 to paint a neural portrait of the human mind and the central idea of this work is that the human mind and
  but a collection of highly specialized components each solving a different specific problem 
 and yet collectively making up who we are as human beings and thinkers 
 to give you a feel for this idea  imagine the following scenario  you walk into your child 's day care center
  as usual there 's a dozen kids there waiting to get picked up  
 but this time  the children 's faces look weirdly
  similar and you can 't figure out which child is yours 
 do you need new glasses are you losing your mind  
 you run through a quick mental checklist no you seem to be thinking clearly  and your vision is perfectly sharp  
 and everything looks normal except the children 's faces 
 you can see the faces but they don 't look distinctive  and none of them looks familiar  and it 's only by spotting
  an orange hair ribbon that you find your daughter 
 this sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces actually happens to people it
 's called prosopagnosia  and it results from damage to a particular part of the brain
 the striking thing about it is that only face recognition is impaired  everything else is just fine
  prosopagnosia is one of
 many surprisingly specific mental deficits that can happen after brain damage 
 these syndromes collectively have suggested for a long time that the mind is divvied up into distinct components  
 but the effort to discover those components has jumped to warp speed with the invention of brain imaging technology  especially mri 
 so mri enables you to see internal anatomy at high resolution
 so i 'm going to show you in a second a set of mri cross sectional images through a familiar object and we 're going to fly through them and you 're going to try to figure out what the object is here we go it 's
 not that easy  it 's an artichoke  okay let 's try another one  starting from the bottom and going through the top
  i love that okay here 's another one it 's
 a brain of course in fact it 's my brain we 're going through slices through my head like that that 's my nose over on the right and now we 're going over here 
 right there  so this picture 's nice if i do say so myself
  but it shows only anatomy  the really cool advance with functional imaging
 happened when scientists figured out how to make pictures that show not just anatomy but
  activity that is where neurons are firing  
 so here 's how this works  brains are like muscles when they get active they need increased blood flow to supply that activity  
 and lucky for us blood flow control to the brain is local  
 so if a bunch of neurons say right there get active and start firing  then blood flow increases just right there  
 so functional mri picks up on that blood flow increase producing a higher
  mri response where neural activity goes up  
 so to give you a concrete feel for how a functional mri experiment goes and what you can learn from it and what you can 't 
 let me describe one of the first studies i ever did  
 we wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces and there was already reason to think there might be such a thing
 based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia that i described a moment ago
  but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain in a normal person so we set out to look for it 
 so i was the first subject  i went into the scanner  i lay on my back i held my head as still as i could
 while staring at pictures of faces
 like these
 and objects like these
  so as somebody who has pretty close to the world record of total number of hours spent inside an mri scanner  
 i can tell you that one of the skills that 's really important for mri research
 is bladder control 
 when i got out of the scanner  i did a quick analysis of the data 
 looking for any parts of my brain that produced a higher response when i was looking at faces than when i was looking at objects
  and here 's what i saw now this image looks just awful by today 's standards  but at the time i thought it was beautiful  
 what it shows is that region right there that little blob  it 's about the size of an olive and it 's on the bottom surface of my brain about an inch straight in from right there
 and what that part of my brain is doing is producing a higher mri response 
  higher neural activity when i was looking at faces than when i was looking at objects  so that 's pretty cool but how do we know this isn 't a fluke 
 well the easiest way is to just do the experiment again  
 so i got back in the scanner  i looked at more faces and i looked at more objects and i got a similar blob  
 and then i did it again
 and i did it again and again and again
  and around about then i decided to believe it was for real  
 but still  
 maybe this is something weird about my brain and no one else has one of these things in there  
 so to find out we scanned a bunch of other people and found that pretty much everyone has that little face processing region in a similar neighborhood of the brain  
 so the next question was what does this thing really do is it really specialized just
  for face recognition 
 well maybe not right maybe it responds not only to faces but to any body part  maybe it responds to anything human
 or anything alive or anything round the only way to be really sure that that region is specialized for face recognition
 is to rule out all of those hypotheses
  so we spent much of the next couple of years scanning subjects while they looked at lots of different kinds of images  and we showed that that part of the brain responds strongly when you look at any images that are faces of any kind  
 and it responds much less strongly to any image you show that isn 't a face like some of these 
 so have we finally nailed the case that this region is necessary for face
  brain imaging can never tell you if a region is necessary for anything all you can do with brain imaging is watch regions turn on and off as people think different thoughts 
 to tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function you need to mess with it and see what happens  and normally we don 't get to do that 
 but an amazing opportunity came about very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine
 tested this man who has epilepsy and who is shown here
  in his hospital bed where he 's just had electrodes placed on the surface of his brain to identify the source of his seizures  
 so it turned out by total chance that two of the electrodes happened to be right on top of his face area  
 so with the patient 's consent  the doctors asked him what happened when they electrically stimulated that part of his brain
 doesn 't know where those electrodes are and he 's never heard of the face area  
 so let 's watch what happens  it 's going to start with a control condition that will say sham nearly invisibly in red in the lower left 
 when no current is delivered 
 and you 'll hear the neurologist speaking to the patient first so let 's watch
  look at my face 
  this experiment finally nails the case that this region of the brain is not only
  selectively responsive to faces but causally involved in face perception  
 so i went through all of these details about the face region to show you what it takes to really establish that a part of the brain is selectively involved in a specific mental process  
 next i 'll go through much more quickly some of the other specialized regions of the brain that we and others have found  
 so to do this i 've spent a lot of time in the scanner over the
  last month
 so i can show you these things in my brain  so let 's get started 
 here 's my right hemisphere  so we 're oriented like that you 're looking at my head this way imagine taking the skull off and looking at the surface of the brain like that okay
 now as you can see the surface of the brain is all folded up  so that 's not good stuff could be hidden in there we want to see the whole thing  so let 's inflate it so we can see the whole thing  
 next let 's find that face area i 've been talking about
  that responds to images like these to see that let 's turn the brain around and look on the inside surface on the bottom and there it is that 's my face area 
 just to the right of that is another region that is shown in purple that responds when you process color information  
 and near those regions are other regions that are involved in perceiving places
  like right now i 'm seeing this layout of space around me and these regions in green right there are really active  
 there 's another one out on the outside surface again where there 's a couple more face regions as well  
 also in this vicinity is a region that 's selectively involved in processing visual motion like these moving dots here  
 and that 's in yellow at the bottom of the brain  
 and near that is a region that responds when you look at images of bodies and body parts like these and that region is shown in lime
  green at the bottom of the brain  
 now all these regions i 've shown you so far are involved in specific aspects of visual perception 
 do we also have specialized brain regions
 for other senses  like hearing  yes we do  so if we turn the brain around a little bit 
 here 's a region in dark blue that we reported just a couple of months ago  and this region responds strongly when you hear
  sounds with pitch like these 
 music in contrast that same region does not respond strongly when you hear perfectly familiar sounds that don 't have a clear pitch  like these
 pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech okay 
 now let 's look at these same regions in my left hemisphere there 's a similar arrangement not identical but similar and most of the same regions are in here  albeit sometimes different 
  in size  now everything i 've shown you so far are regions that are involved in different aspects of perception  vision and hearing  
  really fancy complicated mental processes 
 yes we do 
 so here in pink are my language regions 
 so it 's been known for a very long time that that general vicinity of the brain is involved in processing language  but we showed very recently that these pink regions respond extremely selectively 
 they respond when you understand the meaning of a sentence  but not when you do other complex mental things
 like mental arithmetic or holding information in memory or appreciating the complex structure in a piece of music  
 the most amazing region that 's been found yet is this one right here
 in turquoise this region responds when you think about what another person is thinking  so that may seem crazy
  crazy  but actually we humans do this all the time you
 're doing this when you realize that your partner is going to be worried if you don 't call home to say you 're running late  
 i 'm doing this with that region of my brain right now when i realize that you guys are probably now wondering about all that gray  uncharted territory in the brain and what 's up with that 
 well i 'm wondering about that too  and we 're running a
  bunch of experiments in my lab right now to try to find a number of other possible specializations in the brain for other very specific mental functions  
 but importantly  i don 't think we have specializations in the brain for every important mental function 
 even mental functions that may be critical for survival 
 in fact a few years ago there was a scientist in my lab who became quite convinced that he 'd found
  a brain region
 for detecting food  and it responded really strongly in the scanner when people looked at images like this 
 and further he found a similar response in more or less the same location in ten out of twelve subjects 
 so he was pretty stoked  and he was running around the lab telling everyone that he was going to go on oprah
 with his big discovery  but then he devised the critical test he showed subjects
 images of food like this and compared them to images with very similar color and shape  but that weren 't food like these 
 and his region responded the same to both sets of images  
 so it wasn 't a food area  it was just a region that liked colors and shapes  so much for oprah 
 but then the question of course
  process all this other stuff that we don 't have specialized brain regions for well i
 think the answer is that in addition to these highly specialized components that i 've been describing we also have a lot of very general purpose machinery in our heads that enables us to tackle whatever problem comes along 
 in fact we 've shown recently that
  regions here in white respond whenever you do any difficult mental task at all well of the seven that we 've tested  
 so each of the brain regions that i 've described to you today
 is present in approximately the same location in every normal subject i could take any of you pop you in the scanner  and find each of those regions in your brain and it would look a lot like my brain  
 although the regions would be slightly different in their exact location and in their size
  what 's important to me about this work
 is not the particular locations of these brain regions  but the simple fact that we have selective specific components of mind and brain in the first place 
 i mean it could have been otherwise 
 the brain could have been a single general purpose processor more like a kitchen knife than a swiss army knife instead what brain imaging has delivered
 rich and interesting picture of the human mind  so we have this picture of very general purpose machinery in our heads
 in addition to this surprising array of very specialized components it
 's early days in this enterprise we 've painted only the first brushstrokes in our neural portrait of the human mind  
 the most fundamental questions remain unanswered 
  example what does each of these regions do exactly  why do we need three face areas and three place areas and what 's the division of labor between them 
 second  how are all these things connected in the brain  
 with diffusion imaging you can trace bundles of neurons that connect to different parts of the brain  
 and with this method shown here you can trace the connections of individual neurons
  in the brain  potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram of the entire human brain  
 third how does all of this very systematic structure get built  
 both over development in childhood
 and over the evolution of our species to address questions like that scientists are now scanning other species of animals  
 and they 're also scanning human infants
 many people justify the high cost of neuroscience research by pointing out that it may help us someday to treat brain disorders like alzheimer 's and autism 
 that 's a hugely important goal and i 'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it 
 but fixing things that are broken in the world is not the only thing that 's worth doing
  the effort to understand the human mind and brain is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment of a single disease 
 what could be more thrilling than to understand the fundamental mechanisms that underlie human experience 
 to understand in essence who we are 
 this is i think the greatest scientific quest of all time
