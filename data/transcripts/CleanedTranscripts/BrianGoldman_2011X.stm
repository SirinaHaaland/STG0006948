  and i think it starts with one physician and that 's me and maybe i 've been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that
  before i actually begin the meat of my talk let 's begin with a bit of baseball hey why not we 're near the end we 're getting close to to the world series we all love baseball 
 baseball is filled with some amazing statistics and
 there 's hundreds of them moneyball is about to come out and it 's all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball
 i 'm going to focus on one stat that i hope a lot of you have heard of it 's called batting average
 so we talk about a three hundred a batter who bats three hundred that means that that ballplayer batted safely hit safely three times out of ten at bats that means hit the ball into the outfield it dropped it didn
  first base didn 't get there in time and the runner was safe three times out of ten
 do you know what they call a three hundred hitter in major league baseball
 good really good maybe an all star
 do you know what they call a four hundred baseball hitter that 's somebody who hit by the way four times safely out of every ten
 legendary
 as in ted williams legendary the last major league baseball player to hit over four hundred during a regular season
 now let 's take this back into my world of medicine where i 'm a lot more comfortable or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i 'm going to talk to you about
 suppose you have appendicitis and you 're referred to a surgeon who 's batting four hundred on appendectomies
 somehow this isn 't working out is it
 now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries
 and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who 's batting two hundred on angioplasties
 but but you know what she 's doing a lot better this year she 's on the comeback trail
 hundred and fifty seven
 somehow this isn 't working but i 'm going to ask you a question
 what do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or
 an orthopedic surgeon an obgyn a paramedic is supposed to be
 one thousand very good
  truth of the matter is nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat
 what we do though is we send each one of them including myself out into the world with the admonition be perfect never ever ever make a mistake but you worry about the details
 about how that 's going to happen
 and that was the message that i absorbed when i was in med school i was an obsessive compulsive student in high school
 a classmate once said that brian goldman would study for a blood test laughter
 and so i did and
 i studied in my little garret at the nurses residence at toronto general hospital not far from here and i memorized everything i memorized in my anatomy class 
  the origins and exertions of every muscle every branch of every artery that came off the aorta
 obscure and common i even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis and all the while i was amassing more and more knowledge and and i did well i graduated with honors
 cum laude
 and i came out of medical school with the impression that if i memorized everything and knew everything or as much as possible as close to everything as possible
  would immunize me against making mistakes and it worked for a while
 until i met mrs drucker
 i was a resident at a teaching hospital here in toronto when mrs drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where i was working
 at the time i was assigned to the cardiology
  cardiology rotation and it was my job when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult to see that patient in emerg and to report back to my attending
 and i saw mrs drucker and she was breathless and when i listened to her she was making a wheezy sound and when i listened to to her chest with a stethoscope i could hear crackly sounds 
  on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure this is a condition in which the heart fails and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward some of the blood
  backs up into the lung the lungs fill up with blood and that 's why you have shortness of breath and that wasn 't a difficult diagnosis to make i made it
 and i set to work treating her i gave her aspirin i gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart i gave her medications that we call diuretics water pills
 to get her to pee out the access fluid and over the course of the next hour and a half or two she started to feel better
 and i felt really good
 and that 's when i made my first mistake
 i sent her home
 actually i made two more mistakes i sent her home without speaking to my attending
 i didn 't pick up the phone and do what i was supposed to do which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her
 for himself and he knew her he would have been able to furnish additional information about her
 maybe i did it for a good reason
 maybe i didn 't want to be a high maintenance resident maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my attending 's patients without even having to contact him
 the second mistake that i made was worse
  in sending her home i disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me goldman not a good idea don 't do this
 in fact so lacking in confidence was i that i actually asked the nurse who was looking after mrs drucker do you think it it 's okay if she goes home
 and the nurse thought about it and said very matter of factly yeah i think she 'll do okay i can remember that like it was yesterday
 so i signed the discharge papers and an ambulance came paramedics came
  take her home and i went back to my work on the wards
 all the rest of that day that afternoon i had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach
 but i carried on with my work and at the end of the day i packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home
 when i did something that i don 't usually do i walked through the emergency
  department on my way home
 and it was there that another nurse not the nurse who was looking after mrs drucker before but another nurse said three words to me
 that are the three words that most emergency physicians i know dread
 others in medicine dread them as well but there 's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly
 the three words are do
  do you remember
 do you remember that patient you sent home the other nurse asked matter of factly
 well she 's back in just that tone of voice
 well she was back all right she was back and near death
 about an hour after she had arrived home after i 'd sent her home she collapsed and her family called nine
  paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of fifty which is in severe shock and she was barely breathing and she was blue and
 the emerg staff pulled out all the stops they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure they put her on a ventilator
 and i was shocked and shaken to the core and i went through this roller coaster because after they
 stabilized her she went to the intensive care unit and i hoped against hope that she would recover
 and over the next two or three days it was clear that she was never going to wake up she had irreversible brain damage
 and the family gathered and over the course of the next eight or nine days they resigned themselves to what was happening and at about the nine day mark they let her go
 mrs drucker a wife
 a mother and a grandmother
 they say you never forget the names of those who die and that was my first time to be acquainted with that
 over the next few weeks i beat myself 
  and i experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine where i felt alone isolated not
  feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel because you can 't talk about it with your colleagues you know that healthy kind when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then
 your
 best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say i 'll never make that mistake again and you make amends and you never make that mistake again that 's the kind of shame that
 a teacher
 the unhealthy shame i 'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside it 's the one that says not that what you did was bad
 but that you are bad
 and and it was what i was feeling
 and it wasn 't because of my attending he was a doll he talked to the family and i 'm quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that i didn 't get sued
 and i
  kept asking myself these questions why didn 't i ask my attending why did i send her home and then at my worst moments why
 why did i make such a stupid mistake why did i go into medicine
 slowly but surely it lifted
 i began to feel a bit better and on a cloudy day there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered
 maybe i could feel better
  again and i made myself a bargain that if only i redouble my efforts to be perfect
 and never make another mistake again please make the voices stop and they did and i went back to work
 and then it happened again two years later i was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of toronto
 and i saw a twenty five year old man with a sore throat it was busy i was in a bit of a hurry he kept pointing here
 i looked at his throat it was a little bit pink and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way
 and even as he was walking out the door he was still sort of pointing to his throat
 and two days later i came to do my next emergency shift and that 's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office and
  said the three words do you remember
 do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat
 well it turns out he didn 't have a strep throat he had a potentially life threatening condition called epiglottitis you can google it but it 's an infection not of the throat but of the upper airway and it
  actually cause the airway to close
 and fortunately he didn 't die he was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he
 recovered after a few days and i went through the same period of shame and recriminations
 and felt cleansed and went back to work until it happened again and again
 and again twice in one emergency shift i missed appendicitis now that takes some doing
  especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but fourteen people a night
 now in both cases i didn 't send them home and i don 't think there was any gap in their care one i thought had a kidney stone i ordered a kidney x ray when it turned out to be normal my colleague who 
  was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons the other one had a lot of diarrhea i ordered some fluids to rehydrate him
  and asked my colleague to reassess him and he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant called the surgeons in both cases
 they had their operations and they did okay but each time they were gnawing at me eating at me
 and i 'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say which is total b s
  some of my doozies have been in the last five years
 alone ashamed and unsupported here 's the problem
 if i can 't come clean and and talk about my mistakes if i can 't find the still small voice that tells me what really happened how can i share it with my colleagues
 how can i teach them
  about what i did so that they don 't do the same thing
 if i were to walk into a room like right now i have no idea what you think of me
 when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure
 oh yeah you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor but you 're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes
 if i were to walk into a room filled with my
  ask for their support right now and start to tell what i 've just told you right now i probably wouldn 't get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable somebody would crack a joke they 'd change the subject and we would move on
 and in fact if i knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic
  colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital believe me i 'd have trouble making eye contact with that person
 that 's the system that we have it 's a complete denial of mistakes it 's a system in which
 there are two kinds of physicians those who make mistakes and those who don 't
 those who can 't handle sleep deprivation and those who can
  those who have lousy outcomes and
 those who have great outcomes and it 's almost like an ideological reaction like the antibodies begin to attack that person
 and and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine
 what will we be left with but a safe system
 but there are two problems with that in my twenty years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism i 've made a personal
  study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything i can from one of the first articles i wrote for the toronto star to to my show white coat black art
 and what i 've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous
 we work in a system where errors happen every day where one in ten medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage
 where hospital acquired infections
 are getting more and more numerous causing havoc and death
 in this country as many as twenty four
 thousand canadians die of preventable medical errors in the united states the institute of medicine pegged it at one hundred thousand in both cases these are gross underestimates because we really aren 't ferreting out the problem as we should
 and here 's the thing
 in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling
 every two or three years we can 't keep up with it sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive we can 't get rid of it
 we have our cognitive biases so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with with chest pain now take the same patient with chest pain make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath and suddenly my history
  laced with contempt
 i don 't take the same history
 i 'm not a robot i don 't do things the same way each time and my patients aren 't cars they don 't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time given all of that mistakes are inevitable 
 so if you take the system as i was taught and weed out all the error
 prone health professionals well there won 't be anybody left
 and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their
 their worst cases on my show on white coat black art i made it a habit of saying here 's my worst mistake i would say to everybody from paramedics to the
 chief of cardiac surgery here 's my worst mistake blah blah blah blah blah what about yours and i would point the microphone towards them and their pupils would dilate
 they would recoil
 then they would look down and swallow hard
 and start to tell me their stories
 they want to tell their stories they want to share their stories they want to be able to say look don 't make the same mistake i did what they need is an environment to be able to do that what they need is a redefined medical culture
 and it starts with one physician at a time the
  redefined physician is human knows she 's human accepts it isn 't proud of making mistakes but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else
 she shares her experience with others she 's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes
 and she points out other people 's mistakes not in a gotcha way but in a loving supportive way so that everybody can benefit
 and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system and when human beings run the system they will make mistakes from time to time so the system is
 evolving to create
 backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in
  a loving supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded 
  for doing so and especially people like me when we do make mistakes we 're rewarded for coming clean
  mistakes i 'm sorry about that but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people
 i still don 't know what you think of me but i can live with that
 and let me close with three words of my own i do remember applause
