  i want you guys to imagine that you 're a soldier running through the battlefield  
 now you 're shot in the leg with a bullet  which severs your femoral artery now this bleed is extremely traumatic and can kill you in less than three minutes  
 unfortunately by the time that a medic actually gets to you
 what the medic has on his or her belt can take five minutes or more with the application of pressure to stop that type of bleed 
 now this problem is not only a huge problem for the military  but it 's also a huge problem that 's epidemic throughout the entire medical field which is how do we actually look 
  at wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body  
  years is to develop
 smart biomaterials  which are actually materials that will work with the body helping it to heal and helping it to allow the wounds to heal normally  
 so now  before we do this we have to take a much closer look at actually how does the body work
 so now everybody here knows that the body is
  made up of cells so the cell is the most basic unit of life but not many people know what else 
 but it actually turns out that your cells sit in this mesh of complicated fibers  proteins and sugars known as the extracellular matrix  so now the ecm
 is actually this mesh that holds the cells in place provides structure for your tissues but it also gives the cells a home it allows them to feel what they 're doing where they are and tells them how to act and how to behave
 and it actually turns out that the extracellular matrix is different from every single part of the body  so the ecm in my skin is different than the ecm in my liver  
 and the ecm in different parts of the same organ actually vary  so it 's very difficult to be able to have a product that will react to the local extracellular matrix  which is exactly what we 're trying to do
 so now  for example think of the rainforest you have the canopy
 you have the understory  and you have the forest floor now  all of these parts of the forest are made up of different plants  
 and different animals call them home  so just like that the extracellular matrix is incredibly diverse in three dimensions 
 on top of that the extracellular matrix is responsible for all wound healing  so if you imagine cutting the body  you actually have to rebuild this very complex
 in order to get it to form again  and a scar in fact is actually poorly formed extracellular matrix  
 so now behind me is an animation of the extracellular matrix  so as you see your cells sit in this complicated mesh
 and as you move throughout the tissue the extracellular matrix changes  
 so now every other piece of technology on the market can only manage a two dimensional approximation of
  extracellular matrix  which means that it doesn 't fit in with the tissue itself  
 so when i was a freshman at nyu what i discovered was you could actually take small pieces of  plant derived polymers and reassemble them onto the wound so if you have 
  a bleeding wound like the one behind me you can actually put our material onto this and just like lego
  it 'll reassemble into the local tissue so that means if you put it onto liver  it turns into something that looks like liver  and if you put it onto skin it turns into something that looks just like skin
 so when you put the gel on it actually reassembles into this local tissue  so now this has a whole bunch of applications
 but basically the idea is wherever you put this product you 're able to reassemble into it immediately now this is a simulated arterial bleed blood warning
 at twice human artery pressure
  so now this type of bleed is incredibly traumatic and like i said before would actually take five minutes or more with pressure to be able to stop 
 now in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself our material is able to stop that bleed and it 's because it actually goes on and works with the body to heal so it reassembles into this piece of meat 
 and then the blood actually recognizes that that that 's happening and produces fibrin
 producing a very fast clot in less than ten seconds  so now this technology thank you applause
 so now this technology  by january will be in the hands of veterinarians and we 're working very diligently to try to get it into the hands of
  hopefully within the next year
 but really  once again i want you guys to imagine that you are a soldier running through a battlefield now you get hit in the leg with a bullet  
 and instead of bleeding out in three minutes you pull a small pack of gel out of your belt and with the press of a button you 're able to stop your own bleed and you 're on your way to recovery 
 thank you very much
