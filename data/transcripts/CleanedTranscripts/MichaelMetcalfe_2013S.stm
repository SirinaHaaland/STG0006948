  set ourselves a goal to end poverty  after some success  we 've hit a big
  the aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments which have fallen
 for two consecutive years my question
 is whether the lessons learned from saving the financial system
 can be used to help us overcome that hurdle and help
  i can 't do the accent  but i am serious  thanks to these
  two children who  as you 'll learn are very much at the heart
 of my talk on the left we have pia she lives in england she has
 two loving parents one of whom is
 standing right here dorothy on the right lives in rural kenya
  she 's one of thirteen thousand orphans and vulnerable children who are assisted by a charity
 that i support i do that
 because i believe that dorothy like pia  deserves
 the best life chances that we can afford to give her you 'll all agree with me i 'm sure the
  agrees too their overriding aim for international aid
 is to strive for a life of dignity for all 
 but and here 's that hurdle can we afford our aid aspirations 
  set themselves a target
 to increase overseas aid payments to zero point seven percent
 of their national income as you can see a big gap opens up
 between actual aid and that target but then come the millennium development goals
  ambitious targets to be met by two thousand and fifteen if i tell you that just one of those targets
 is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty you get a sense of the ambition there 's also been
 some success  the number of people living on less than $ one point two five a day has halved
 but a lot remains to be done in two years  one in eight
 remain hungry in
 the context of this auditorium the front two rows aren 't going to get any food 
 we can 't settle for that which is why
 the concern about the eighth goal which relates to funding
  beginning is falling is so troubling 
 so what can be done  well  i work in financial markets not development 
 i study the behavior of investors how they react to policy
  gives me a different angle on the aid issue  but it took an innocent question from my 
 daughter to make me appreciate that 
 pia and i were on the way to a local cafe and we passed a man collecting for charity i didn 't have any change
  and she was disappointed once in the cafe pia takes out her
 coloring book and starts scribbling  after a little while  i ask her what she 's doing  and she shows me a drawing
 of a five note to give to the man outside it 's so sweet and more generous than dad would have been 
  now i 'm excited because i actually think i can answer this time  so i launch into an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money
 chasing a limited number of goods sends
  something about that exchange stuck with me 
 not because of the look of relief on pia 's face when i finally finished but because
 it related to the sanctity
 of the money supply a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned by the reaction
 of central banks to the financial crisis to reassure investors central banks began
 buying assets
 to try and encourage investors to do the same 
 they funded these purchases with money they created themselves the money wasn 't actually
  physically printed it 's still sort of locked away in the banking system today  but the amount created was
 unprecedented  together  the central banks of the 
 and japan increased the stock of money in their economies by three point seven trillion dollars that 's three times
 in fact that 's more than three times  the total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation three times  
 before the crisis this would have been utterly unthinkable  
 yet it was accepted remarkably quickly
 the price of gold an asset thought to protect against inflation did jump  
 but
 investors bought other assets that offered little protection from inflation they bought fixed income securities  bonds 
 they bought equities too 
 for all the scare stories the actual actions of investors
 spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence 
 that confidence
 was based on two pillars  
 the first was that  after years of keeping inflation under control central banks
 were trusted
 inflation became a threat  
 secondly inflation
 simply never became a threat  as you can see in the united states inflation for most of this period remained below average 
 it was the same elsewhere  
 so how does all this relate
  is where dorothy
 and the mango tree charity
 that supports her comes in i was at one of their fundraising events earlier this year and i was inspired to give
 a one off donation
 when i remembered
 that my firm offers to match the charitable contributions its employees make so think of this
  instead of just being able to help dorothy and four of her classmates
 to go through secondary school for a few years  i was able to double my contribution  brilliant  
 so
 following that conversation with my daughter and seeing the absence of inflation in the face of
 and knowing that international aid payments were falling at just the wrong time this made me wonder 
 could we match but just on a much grander scale 
 let 's call this
  and here 's how it might work provided it saw
 little inflation risk from doing so  the central bank would be mandated to match the government 's overseas aid payments
 up to a certain limit 
 governments have been aiming to get aid to zero point seven percent for years so let 's set the limit at half of that zero point three five percent
 of their income
  so it would work like this if in a given year the government gave zero point two percent of its income to overseas aid  the central bank would simply top it up with a further zero point two percent 
 so far so good 
 how risky is this  well this involves the creation of money
  but there are two important mitigating factors here  the first
 is that by definition this money printed would be spent
 overseas  so it 's not obvious
 how it leads to inflation in the country doing the actual printing
 unless
  leads to a currency depreciation of that country that is unlikely for the second reason  
 the scale of the money that would be printed under this scheme  
 so
 let 's think of an example where print aid was in place in the
  payments made by those governments over the last four years print aid would have generated two hundred billion dollars ' worth of extra aid 
 what would that look like
 in the context of the increase in the money stock that had already happened in those countries to save the financial system
  you read for this 
 you might struggle to see that at the back because the gap is quite small  so what we 're saying here
 is that we took a $ three point seven trillion gamble to save our financial systems 
 and you know what it paid off there was no inflation 
 are we really saying
 that it 's not worth the risk to print an extra two hundred billion
 for aid
  would the risks really be that different to me it 's not that clear what is clear
 is the impact on aid  even though this is the printing of just three central banks the global aid that 's given
 over this period is up by almost forty percent aid as a proportion of national income all of a sudden is
 40 year high  now we don 't get to zero point seven percent 
 governments are still incentivized to give but you know what that 's the point of a matching scheme
  so i think what we 've learned is that the risks from this money creation scheme
  but the benefits
 are potentially huge  imagine what we could do with forty percent more funding  we might be able to feed the front row
 the thing that i fear  the only thing that i fear  apart from the fact that i 've run out of time 
 is that the window of opportunity for this idea
 is a short one 
 today
  money creation by central banks is an accepted policy tool that may not always be the case  today
 there are universally agreed aims for international aid that
 may not always be the case  today might be the only time that these two things coincide such that
  afford the aid that we 've always aspired to give so 
 can we print money for international aid  
 i seriously believe the question should be why not
