 i
  yet came
 i
  's a distinct privilege to be here 
 a few weeks ago i saw a video on youtube of congresswoman gabrielle giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful
  this one entered her left hemisphere and
 knocked out her broca 's area the speech center of her brain  and in this this session 
 gabby 's working with a speech therapist and she 's struggling to produce some of the most basic words  and you can see her growing more and more devastated  until she ultimately breaks 
  down into sobbing tears and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist
  and after a few moments her therapist tries a new tack and they start singing together and gabby starts to sing through her tears  
 and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels and she sings 
 in one descending scale she sings let it shine  let it shine  let it shine 
 and it 's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words
  in this case literally speak 
 seeing this video of gabby giffords reminded me of the work of dr gottfried schlaug 
 one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at harvard  and schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called melodic intonation therapy which has become very popular in music therapy now 
 schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic could not
  but they could still sing the lyrics to a song  
 whether it was happy birthday to you or their favorite song by the eagles or the rolling stones  
 and after seventy hours of intensive singing lessons he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere 's damage
  when i was seventeen i visited dr schlaug 's lab and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain
 how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non musicians how music and listening to music could just light up the entire brain from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum 
 how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and
  depression how deeply parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music 
 and how late stage alzheimer 's patients whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family could still pick out a tune by chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children  
 but i had an ulterior motive of visiting gottfried schlaug and it was this that i was at a
  crossroads in my life  trying to choose between music and medicine  
 i had just completed my undergraduate  and i was working as a research assistant at the lab of dennis selkoe studying parkinson 's disease at harvard  
 and i had fallen in love with neuroscience i wanted to become a surgeon  i wanted to become a doctor like paul farmer or rick
  these kind of fearless men who go into places like haiti or ethiopia and work with aids patients with 
  tuberculosis or with children with disfiguring cancers  i wanted to become that kind of red cross doctor that doctor without borders 
 on the other hand i had played the violin my entire life 
 music for me was more than a passion it was obsession it was oxygen i was lucky enough to have studied
 at the juilliard school in manhattan and to have played my
  debut with zubin mehta and the israeli philharmonic orchestra in tel aviv  and it turned out that gottfried schlaug
 had studied as an organist at the vienna conservatory but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine  
 and that afternoon i had to ask him how was it for you making that decision 
 and he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to and that for me medical school could
  wait  but that the violin simply would not  
 and after two more years of studying music i decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the mcat and applying to medical school like a good indian son to become the next dr gupta 
 laughter and i decided to to shoot for the impossible and i took an audition for the esteemed los angeles philharmonic
  it was my first audition and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week i was offered the position  
 and it was a dream 
 it was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra to perform in the iconic walt disney concert hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous gustavo dudamel  but much 
  more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family my new musical
  but a year later  i met another musician who had also studied at juilliard  one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity
 as a musician 
 nathaniel ayers was a double bassist at juilliard but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s 
 was treated with thorazine at bellevue and ended up living homeless on the streets of skid row in downtown los angeles thirty years later  
 nathaniel 's story has
  become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the united states 
 as told through the book and the movie the soloist but i became his friend  and i became his violin teacher  and i told him that wherever he had his violin and
 wherever i had mine i would play a lesson with him 
 and on the many times i saw nathaniel on skid row i witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments from what seemed to me in my untrained eye
  eye to be
 the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode 
 playing for nathaniel the music took on a deeper meaning because now it was about communication 
 a communication where words failed a communication of a message that went deeper than words that registered at a fundamentally primal level in nathaniel 's psyche yet came as a true musical offering from me
  i found myself growing outraged
 that someone like nathaniel could have ever
 been homeless on skid row because of his mental illness  yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on skid row alone who had stories as tragic as his but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off
  at the very core of this crisis of mine i felt somehow the life of music had chosen me 
 where somehow  perhaps possibly in a very naive sense i felt what skid row really needed was somebody like paul farmer
 and not another classical musician playing on bunker hill  
 but in the end it was nathaniel who showed me that if i was truly passionate about change if i wanted to make
  i already had the perfect instrument to do it that music was the bridge that connected my world and his there
 's a beautiful quote by the romantic german composer robert schumann who said to send light
 into the darkness of men 's hearts such is the duty of the artist 
 and this is a particularly poignant quote because schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum 
 and inspired by what i learned from nathaniel
  started an organization on skid row of musicians called street symphony  
 bringing the light of music into the very darkest places  performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on skid row 
 performing for combat veterans
 with  post traumatic stress disorder  and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally
  after one of our events at the patton state hospital in san bernardino a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face  and she had a palsy she was shaking  
 and she had this gorgeous smile  and she said that she had never heard classical music before she didn 't think she was going to like it she had never heard a violin before but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine  
 and that nobody ever came to visit them and that for the first time in six years when she heard us play she stopped shaking without medication
 suddenly what we 're finding with these concerts  away from the stage  away from the footlights out of the tuxedo tails  
 the musicians become the conduit
 for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room 
 would never have access to the kind of music that we make 
  as medicine serves to heal more
 than the building blocks of the body alone  the power and beauty of music transcends the e in the middle of our beloved acronym 
 music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone  the synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear
 an opera by wagner or a symphony by brahms or chamber music by beethoven
  us to remember our shared common humanity  the deeply communal connected consciousness the empathic consciousness
 that neuropsychiatrist iain mcgilchrist says is 
 into our brain 's right hemisphere  and for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within
  and incarceration the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them 
 to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them 
 and the spark of that beauty the spark of that humanity transforms into hope  
 and we know whether we choose the path of music or of medicine
  the very first thing we must instill within our communities within our audiences if we want to inspire healing from within
