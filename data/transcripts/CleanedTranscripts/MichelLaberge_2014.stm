  use a lot of power  
 well flying you all in here must have cost a bit of energy too  
 so the whole planet needs a lot of energy and so far we 've been running mostly on fossil fuel we 've been burning gas
  been a good run it got us to where we are but we have to stop we can 't do that anymore  
 so we are trying different types of energy now alternative energy  
 but it proved quite difficult to find something that 's as convenient and as cost effective as oil gas and coal 
 my personal favorite is nuclear energy
  produces solid  reliable power  and it doesn 't make any co2 now we know of two ways of making
 nuclear energy  fission and fusion  
 now in fission you take a big nucleus  you break it in part in two and it makes lots of energy and this is how the nuclear reactor today works it works pretty good  
 and then there 's fusion  now i like fusion fusion 's much better
  so you take two small nuclei you put it together  and you make helium  and that 's very nice it makes lots of energy 
 this is nature 's way of producing energy  the sun and all the stars in the universe run on fusion  
 now a fusion plant would actually be quite cost effective and it also would be quite safe  it only
 produces short term radioactive waste
  it cannot melt down 
 now the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean in
 the ocean you can extract the fuel for about one thousandth of a cent per  kilowatt hour so that 's very very cheap  
 and if the whole planet would run on fusion we could extract the fuel from the ocean it would run for billions and billions of years 
 now if fusion is so great why don 't we have it  where is it  well there 's always a bit of a
  catch fusion is really really hard to do  
 so the problem is those two nuclei they are both positively charged  so they don 't want to fuse  they go like this they go like that  so in order to make them fuse you have to throw 
  them at each other with great speed  and if they have enough speed they will go against the repulsion they will touch and they will make energy  
  is a measure of the temperature  so the temperature required for fusion is one hundred and fifty billion degrees c this is rather warm  
 and this is why fusion is so hard to do now i caught my little fusion bug when i did my ph d here at the university of british columbia  
 and then i got a big job in a laser printer place making printing for the printing industry
  little bit bored  
 and then i was forty and i got a mid life crisis  you know the usual thing who am i what should i do what should i do what can i do  
 and then i was looking at my good work and what i was doing is i was cutting the forests around here in b c and burying you all of you in millions of tons of junk mail 
 now that was not very satisfactory so some people buy a porsche
  get a mistress  but i 've decided to get my bit to solve global warming and make fusion happen now
 so the first thing i did is i looked into the literature and i see how does fusion work  
 so the physicists have been working on fusion for a while and one of the ways they do it is with
  it 's a big ring of magnetic coil  superconducting coil and it makes a magnetic field in a
 ring like this 
 and the hot gas in the middle which is called a plasma is trapped  the particles go round and round and round the circle at the wall then they throw a huge amount of heat in there to try to cook that to fusion temperature  
 so this is the inside of one of those donuts and on the right side you can see the fusion plasma in there 
  a second way of doing this is by using laser fusion  
 now in laser fusion you have a little ping pong ball  you put the fusion fuel in the center  and you zap that with a whole bunch of laser around it the lasers are very strong and it squashes the ping pong ball really really quick  
 and if you squeeze something hard enough it gets hotter  
 and if it gets really really fast and they do that in one billionth of a second  it makes enough energy and enough heat to make fusion  
 so this is the inside of one such machine you see the laser beam and the pellet in the center
 now most people think that fusion is going nowhere  they always think that the physicists are in their lab and they 're working hard but nothing is happening that 's actually not quite true 
 this is a curve of the gain in fusion over the last thirty years or so and you can see that we 're making now about ten thousand times more fusion than we used to when we started  that 's a pretty good gain
  as a matter of fact it 's as fast as the fabled moore 's law that defined the amount of transistors they can put on a chip  
 now this dot here is called jet the joint european torus it 's a big tokamak donut in europe  and this machine in 
 produced sixteen megawatts of fusion power with seventeen megawatts of heat now you say that 's not much use  but it 's actually pretty close considering we can get about ten thousand times more than we started
  the second dot here
 is the nif it 's the national ignition facility  it 's a big laser machine in the u s and last month they announced with quite a bit of noise that they had managed to make more fusion 
  energy from the fusion than the energy that they put in the center of the ping pong ball now that 's not quite good enough because the laser to put that
  so this is a big collaboration of different countries that are building a huge magnetic donut in the south of france  
 and this machine when it 's finished will produce five hundred megawatts of fusion power with only fifty megawatts to make it so this one is the real one it 's going to work  that 's the kind of machine that makes energy 
 now if you look at the graph you will notice that those two dots are a little bit on the
  right of the curve we kind of have fallen off the progress actually the science to make those machines was really in time to produce
 fusion during that curve  however there has been a bit of politics going on and the will to do it was not there  so it drifted to the right iter for example could have been built 
  in two thousand or two thousand and five but because it 's a big international collaboration the politics got in and it delayed it a bit for example
  them about three years to decide where to put it  
 now  fusion is often criticized for being a little too expensive  yes it did cost a billion dollars or two billion dollars a year to make this progress  but you have to compare 
  that to the cost of making moore 's law that cost way more than that the result of moore 's law is this cell phone here in my pocket 
  i can take a selfie and put it on facebook then when my dad sees that he 'll be very proud
 we also spend about six hundred and fifty billion dollars a year in subsidies for oil and gas and renewable energy 
 now we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion  
 so me  personally i don 't think it 's too expensive
  think it 's actually been shortchanged considering it can solve all 
  our energy problems cleanly for the next couple of billions of years 
 now i can say that but i 'm a little bit biased  because i started a fusion company and i don 't even have a facebook account 
 so when i started this fusion company in two thousand and two i knew
  i couldn 't fight with the big lads they had much more resources than me  so i decided i would need to find a solution that is cheaper and faster 
 now magnetic and laser fusion are pretty good machines they are awesome pieces of technology  wonderful machines and they have shown that fusion can be done  
 however  as a power plant i don 't think they 're very good they 're way too big way too complicated way too expensive  and also they don 't deal very much with the fusion
  when you make fusion the energy comes out as neutrons fast neutrons comes out of the plasma those neutrons hit the wall of the machine  it damages it 
 and also you have to catch the heat from those neutrons and run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere and on those machines it was all a bit of an afterthought  
 so i decided that surely there is a better way of doing that so back to the literature and i read about the fusion everywhere 
 one way in particular attracted my attention and it 's called magnetized target fusion or mtf for short
 now in mtf what you want to do
 is you take a big vat and you fill that with liquid metal
 and you spin the liquid metal to open a vortex in the center  a bit like your sink when you pull the plug on a sink it makes a vortex 
 and then you have some pistons driven by pressure that goes on the outside  and this compresses the liquid metal around the plasma and it compresses it it gets hotter like a laser and then it makes fusion so it 's a bit of a
  between a magnetized fusion and the laser fusion 
 so those have a couple of very good advantages the liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons and no neutrons hit the wall and therefore there 's no damage to the machine 
 the liquid metal gets hot  so you can pump that in a heat exchanger make some steam spin a turbine  so that 's a very convenient way of doing this part of the
  all the energy to make the fusion happen comes from 
 which is way cheaper than lasers or superconducting coils now this was all very good except for the problem that it didn 't quite work there
 's always a catch  
 so when you compress that the plasma cools down faster than the compression speed  so you 're trying to compress it but the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down and then it did absolutely nothing  
 so when i saw that
  it 's a very very good idea so hopefully i can improve on that  
 so i thought about it for a minute and i said okay how can we make that work better  so then i thought about impact  what about if we use a big hammer and we swing it and we hit the nail like this in the place of putting the hammer on the nail and pushing and try to put it in that won 't work  
 so what the idea is is to use the idea of an impact  so we accelerate the pistons with steam that takes a little bit of time but then
  bang you hit the piston and baff all the energy is done instantly down instantly to the liquid and that compresses the plasma much faster  
 so i decided okay this is good let 's make that  so we built this machine
 in this garage here we made a small machine that we managed to squeeze a little bit of neutrons out of that and those are my marketing
  and with those marketing neutrons then i raised about fifty million dollars 
 and i hired sixty five people that 's my team here  and this is what we want to build  so it 's going to be a big machine about three meters in diameter liquid lead spinning around 
 big vortex in the center put the plasma on the top and on the bottom piston hits on the side  bang it compresses it  and it will make some energy and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal going to go in a
 steam engine and make the turbine  and some of the steam will go back to fire the piston we 're going to run that about one time per second  and it will produce one hundred megawatts of electricity  
 okay we also built this injector so this injector makes the plasma to start with it makes the plasma at about a lukewarm temperature of three million degrees 
  last quite long enough  so we need to extend the life of the plasma a little bit but last month it got a lot better so i think we have the plasma
  compressing now then we built a small sphere about this big fourteen pistons around it  
 and this will compress the liquid however plasma is difficult to compress when you compress it it tends to go a little bit crooked like that  
 so you need the timing of the piston to be very good and for that we use
 several control systems  which was not possible in
  so finally  most people think that fusion is in the future and will never happen  but as a matter of fact fusion is getting very close  we are almost there the big labs have shown that 
  fusion is doable and now there are small companies that are thinking about that and they say it 's not that it cannot be done but it 's how to make it cost effectively general fusion is one of those small
  will crack that nut and perhaps it will be general fusion  thank you very much
