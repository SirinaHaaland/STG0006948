  i 'm an industrial engineer the goal in my life has always been to make more and more products in the least amount of time and resources  
 while working at toyota all i knew was how to make cars
  came to our factory to make a forest in it in order to make it carbon neutral i was so fascinated
 that i decided to learn this methodology by joining his team as a volunteer  
 soon  i started making a forest in the backyard of my own house  and this is how it looks after three years 
 these forests compared to a conventional plantation  grow ten times faster
 thirty times more dense and one hundred times more biodiverse  
 within two years of having this forest in our backyard 
 i could observe that the groundwater didn 't dry during summers the number of bird species i spotted in this area doubled  
 quality of air became better and we started harvesting seasonal fruits growing effortlessly
 right in the backyard of our house
  i wanted to make more of these forests i was so moved by these results that i wanted to make these forests with the same acumen
 with which we make cars or write software or do any mainstream business 
 so i founded a company which is an end to end service provider to create these native natural forests  
 but to make afforestation as a mainstream business or an industry we had to standardize the process of
 forest making so we benchmarked the toyota production system known for its quality and efficiency
 for the process of forest making for an example  the core of tps toyota production system lies in heijunka 
 which is making manufacturing of different models of cars on a single assembly
  replaced these cars with trees  using which now we can make  multi layered forests 
 these forests utilize one hundred percent vertical space  they are so dense that one can 't even walk into them  
 for an example we can make a 
  forest in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars in order to reduce cost and our own carbon
  we started utilizing local biomass as soil amender and fertilizers 
 for example coconut shells crushed in a machine mixed with rice straw  
 powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure
 is finally dumped in soil on which our forest is planted  
 once planted we use grass or rice straw to cover the soil so that all the water which goes into irrigation doesn 't get evaporated back into the atmosphere
  and using these simple improvisations today we can make a forest for a cost as low as the cost of an iphone  
 today we are making forests in houses in schools  even in factories with the corporates but that 's not enough 
 there is a huge number of people who want to take matters into their own hands
  so we let it happen today we are working on
 an internet based platform
 where we are going to share our methodology on an open source using which anyone and everyone can make their own forest without our physical presence being there 
 using our methodology at the click of a button  they can get to know all the native species of their place 
 by installing
  we can monitor the growth of this forest
 without being on site 
 this methodology i believe has a potential by sharing we can actually bring back our native forests 
 now when you go back home  if you see a barren piece of land do remember that it can be a potential forest thank you very much
