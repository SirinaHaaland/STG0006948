  about four years ago the new yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of mauritius 
 now the island of mauritius is a small island off the east coast of madagascar in the
  indian ocean and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered
 and extinguished all within about one hundred and fifty years  everyone was very excited about this
 archaeological find because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton see while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection nobody not even the actual natural history museum on the island of mauritius has a skeleton that 's made from the
  of a single dodo well this isn 't exactly true
 the fact is is that the british museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the 18th century it was actually mummified skin and all but in a fit of
 space saving zeal they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire if you go look at their website today they 'll actually list these specimens saying the rest was lost in a fire 
 and i 'm one of the people that thinks that tina brown was great for bringing photos to the new yorker because this photo completely rocked my world i became obsessed with the object not just the beautiful photograph 
  itself and the color the shallow depth of field the detail that 's visible the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together there 's an entire
  and i thought to myself  wouldn 't it be great if i had my own dodo skeleton  
 i want to point out here at this point that i 've spent my life obsessed by by objects and the stories that they tell  
 and this was the very latest one so i began looking around for to see if anyone sold a kit
  some kind of model that i could get and i found lots of reference material lots of lovely pictures  no dice no dodo skeleton for me  but the damage had been done i had saved a few hundred photos 
  of dodo skeletons into my creative projects folder it 's a repository for my brain everything that i could possibly be interested in any time i have an internet connection  there 's a sluice of stuff moving into there
  russian nuclear launch key the one on the top is the picture of the one i found on ebay the one on the bottom is the one i made for myself  because i couldn 't afford the one on ebay  
 storm trooper costumes maps of middle earth that 's one i hand drew myself there 's the dodo skeleton folder this folder has seventeen thousand photos over twenty gigabytes of information and it 's growing constantly 
 and one day a couple of weeks later it might have been
 maybe a year later i was in the art store with my kids
  buying some clay tools we were going to have a craft day i bought some super sculpeys some armature wire some various materials  and i looked down at this sculpey and i thought maybe yeah
 maybe i could make my own dodo
 skull  i should point out at this time i 'm not a sculptor  i 'm a hard edged model maker you give me a drawing you give me a prop to replicate you
  give me a crane 
 scaffolding  parts from star wars especially parts from star wars i can do this stuff all day long  it 's exactly how i made my living for fifteen years  
 but you give me
 something like this my friend mike murnane sculpted this it 's a maquette for star wars episode two this is not my thing this is something other people do dragons soft things  however  
 i felt like i had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it
  mean it couldn 't be that difficult so 
 i started looking at the best photos i could find  i grabbed all the reference  and i found this lovely piece of reference this is someone selling this on ebay  it was clearly 
  a womans hand hopefully a woman 's hand  assuming it was roughly the size of my wife 's hand i made some measurements of her thumb and i scaled them out to the size of the skull i blew it up to the actual size and i began using that along with all the other reference that i had comparing it to it as size
  reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be exactly how long  etc  and over a few hours i eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull and i didn 't mean to continue 
 i it 's kind of like you know you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time you can 't think about the totality i wasn 't thinking about a dodo skeleton i just noticed that as i finished this skull the armature wire that i had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be and one of the
  other things i 'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons having collected a couple of hundred 
 i actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them and so button by button vertebrae by vertebrae i built my way down 
 and
 actually by the end of the day i had a reasonable skull a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis  and again  i kept on going looking for more reference
  every bit of reference i could find drawings beautiful photos this guy i love this guy he put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler  
 this is the kind of accuracy that i wanted
 i replicated every last bone and put it in and after about six weeks i finished painted mounted
 my own dodo skeleton
  that i even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo and tap plastics made me although
 i didn 't photograph it a museum vitrine i don 't have the room for this in my house  
 but i had to finish what i had started  and this actually represented kind of a sea change to me
  again like i said my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories
  that they tell and also making them for myself  obtaining them appreciating them
 and diving into them and in this folder creative projects there are tons of projects that i 'm currently working on projects that i 've already worked on things that i might want to work on some day  and things that i may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch  
 but now there was potentially this new category of things that i could sculpt
 that was different that
  but that 's honestly relative to sculpting to me that 's easy  and so i went back and looked through my creative projects folder  and i happened across the maltese falcon  
 now  
 this is funny for me 
 to fall in love with an object from a hammett novel because if it 's true that the world is divided into two types of people chandler people and hammett people i am absolutely a chandler person but in this case
  it 's not about the author it 's not about the book or the movie or the story it 's about the object in and of itself  and in this case  this object is plays on
 a host of levels first of all there 's the object in the world  this is the kniphausen hawk it is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around one thousand seven hundred for a swedish count  
 and it is very likely the object from which hammett drew his inspiration for the maltese falcon  then there is the fictional bird the one that hammett
  created for the book built out of words  it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie  in which another object is created a prop that has to represent the thing that hammett 
  created out of words inspired by the kniphausen hawk  and this represents the falcon in the movie and then there is this fourth level which is a whole new object in the world  the prop made 
  for the movie the representative of the thing becomes in its own right a whole other
  thing a whole new object of desire  
 and so now it was time to do some research  i actually had done some research a few years before it 's why the folder was there i 'd bought a replica a really crappy replica of the maltese falcon on ebay
 and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference but i discovered in
  one of the original lead birds had been sold at christie 's in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four 
 and so i contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original christie 's catalogue and in it i found this magnificent picture which included a size reference i was able to scan 
  the picture blow it up to exactly full size i found other reference avi [ ara ] chekmayan a new jersey editor actually
  although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to to the auctioneers ' specifications because there was a lot of controversy about it it was made out of resin which wasn 't a common material for 
  movie props about the time the movie was made it 's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it because i can see it compared to this thing and i can tell you it 's real it 's the real thing it 's made from the exact same mold that this one is in this one because the auction was actually so controversial profiles in history the
  auction house that sold this i think in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five for about one hundred thousand dollars they actually included you can see here on the bottom not just a front elevation but also a side rear 
 and other side elevation so now i had all the topology i needed to replicate the maltese falcon what do they do how do you start something like that i really don 't know so what i did was again  like i did with the dodo skull i blew all my reference up to full size
  and then i began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references so i took sculpey and i built a big block of it and i passed it through until you know i got the right profiles and then slowly 
  feather by feather detail by detail i worked out and achieved working in front of the television and super sculpey here 's me sitting next to my wife
  took of the entire process as i moved through i achieved
 a very reasonable facsimile of the maltese falcon but again i am not a sculptor and so i don 't know a lot of the tricks like 
 i don 't know how my friend mike gets beautiful shiny surfaces with his sculpey i certainly wasn 't able to get it 
 so i went down to my shop  and i molded it and i cast it in resin  because in the resin then i could absolutely get the glass smooth finished now there 's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish my preference is about seventy coats of this matte black
  auto primer i spray it on for about three or four days it drips to hell but it allows me a really really nice gentle sanding surface and i can get it glass smooth oh 
 finishing up with triple zero steel wool now the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie when they finally bring out the bird at the end and they place it on the table they actually spin it so i was able
  to make sure and i 'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as i 'm holding the light in the same position i 'm getting the same type of reflection on it that 's the level of detail i 'm going into this thing 
 i ended up with this 
 my maltese falcon  and it 's beautiful and i can state with authority at this point in time when i 'd finished it of all of the replicas out there and there is a few this is by far the 
  most accurate representation of the original maltese falcon than anyone has sculpted now the original one i should tell
  you is sculpted by a guy named fred sexton this is where
 it gets weird 
 fred sexton was a friend of this guy george hodel  terrifying guy agreed by many to be the killer of the black dahlia now  james ellroy believes that fred sexton the sculptor of the maltese falcon  killed james elroy 's mother i 'll
 go you one stranger
  during the production of a weird comedy sequel to the maltese falcon called the black bird starring george segal  the los angeles county museum of art had a plaster original of the maltese falcon one 
  of the original six plasters i think made for the movie stolen out of the museum a lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie  
  his original plasters of the maltese falcon and they had it in their cabinet for about fifteen years until it got stolen in january of two thousand and seven 
 it would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly so here i had this falcon and it was lovely it looked really
  the light worked on it really well it was better than anything that i could achieve or obtain out in the world but there was a problem and the problem was was that 
 i wanted the entirety of the object i wanted the weight behind the object 
 this thing was made of resin and it was too light there 's this group online that i frequent it 's a group of prop crazies just like me called the replica props forum and it 's people who trade make and
  travel in information about movie props and it turned out that one of the guys there a friend of mine that i
 never actually met but befriended through some prop deals was the manager of a local foundry he took my master falcon pattern he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for 
  me  and this is the bronze i got back and this is after some acid etching the one that i ended up with  and this thing  it 's deeply deeply satisfying to me here 
  i want you to pick it up and handle it you want to know
 how obsessed i am this project 's only for me and yet i went so far as to buy on ebay a one thousand nine hundred and forty one chinese san francisco based newspaper in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped 
 like it is in the movie
  there you can see it 's weighing in at twenty seven and a half pounds that 's half the weight of my dog huxley  
 but there 's a problem
  now here 's the most recent progression of falcons on the far left is a piece of crap a replica i bought on ebay there 's my somewhat ruined sculpey falcon because i had to
  get it back out of the mold there 's my first casting there 's my master and there 's my bronze there 's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin you lose a little bit 
  of volume  you lose a little bit of size and when i held my bronze one up against my sculpey one it was shorter by three quarters of an inch
 why didn 't i remember this why didn 't i
  start and make it bigger
  so what do i do i figure i have two options one 
 i can fire a freaking laser at it which i have already done to do a 3d scan there 's a 3d scan of this falcon i had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage i achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a 3d lithography
  master of this which i will polish  then i will send to the mold maker and then i will have it done in bronze or
