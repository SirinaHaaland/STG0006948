  a few words about how i got started
 and it has a lot to do with happiness  actually  when i was a very young child i was extremely introverted
 and very much to myself and kind of as a way of surviving i would go into my own very personal
  space  and i would make things  i would make things for people as a way of you know giving showing them my my love 
 i would go into these private places and i would put my ideas
 and my passions into objects and sort of learning how to speak with my hands 
 so the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected
 with
 not only the idea realm  but also with very much the feeling realm  and the
 the ideas are
 are very disparate i 'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces and there 's no real connection between one or the other except that they sort of come out of my brain
 and they 're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered by by looking at life and seeing
  nature and seeing objects and just having having kind of playful random thoughts about things
 when i was a child i started to explore
 motion i fell in love with the way things moved  so i started to explore motion by
 by making little flipbooks  and this is one that i did probably like when i was around seventh grade
  and i remember when i was doing this  i was thinking about that that little rock there  and the pathway
 of the vehicles as they would fly through the air  and how the 
 would come shooting out of the car  so  on my mind i was thinking about the the trajectory of
 the vehicles and of course when you 're a little kid
 so it has to end with this gratuitous violence  
 so that was how i i first started to explore the way things moved and expressed it now when i went to
  and this really came about from having many different kinds of interests when i was in high school i loved to program computers  so i sort of liked
 the the logical flow of events
  i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery
 and becoming a surgeon because it meant working with my hands in a very focused intense way
 so i started taking art courses and i found a way to make sculpture that that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands
 with
 coming up with different kinds of logical
 flows of energy through a system 
  was both
 a visual and a mechanical engineering decision at the same time  
 so i was able to sort of exercise all of that now  this kind of machine is as close as i can get to painting 
 and it 's full of
 many little trivial end points like there 's a little foot here that just drags
  around in circles and it doesn 't really mean anything it 's really just just for the sort of joy of its own
 triviality the connection i have with engineering is the same as
 any other engineer  in that i love to solve problems i love to figure things out but the end result of what i 'm doing is really completely ambiguous
 that 's pretty ambiguous
  the next piece that is going to come up is
 an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex
  i gave myself the problem since i 'm always liking to solve problems i gave myself the problem of
 turning a crank
 in one direction  and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth 
 so when i started this i didn 't have an overall plan for the machine  but i did have a sense of the gesture and
  a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space  and then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point 
 that little gear there switches back and forth to change direction  and that 's a little found object 
 so a lot of the pieces that i 've made they involve found objects
  like doing visual puns all the time when i see objects i imagine them
 in motion i imagine what can be said with them this next one here machine with wishbone 
 it came about from
 from playing with this wishbone after dinner you know they say never play with your food but i always play with things
  i had this wishbone and i thought  it 's kind of like a cowboy who 's been on his horse for too long and
 i started to make him walk across the table and i thought oh i can make a little machine that will do that 
 so i made this device linked it up and the wishbone walks and because the wishbone
  it 's sort of a point where i think we we can enter into it
 and that 's the whole piece 
 that 's about that big
 this kind of work is also very much like puppetry 
  the found object is in a sense the puppet  and i 'm the puppeteer at first because i 'm playing with an object  
 but then i make the machine which is sort of the stand in for me and it is able to achieve the action that i want  
 the next piece i 'll show you is a much more conceptual thought  and it 's a little piece
  cory 's yellow chair 
 i had this image in my mind when i saw my son 's little chair  and i saw it explode
 up and out and
 so the way i saw this in my mind at first was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed and the pieces would move
  and then they would begin to be pulled back with a kind of a gravitational feel 
 to the point where they would they would approach infinite speed back to the center  and they would coalesce for just a moment
  so you could you could perceive that there was a chair there 
 for me it 's kind of a feeling
 about the fleetingness of the present moment and i wanted to express that now  the
  machine is in this case it 's a real approximation of that because obviously you can 't move physical matter
 infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously  this whole thing is about four feet
 wide and the chair itself is only about a few inches 
 now this is a funny sort of conceptual
  and yesterday we were talking about
 danny hillis ' 
 ten thousand year clock so we have a motor here on the left  
 and it goes through a gear train there are twelve pairs of fifty one reductions 
 so that means that the the final speed of that gear on the end is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once  
 so i 've invented it in concrete because it doesn 't really matter 
 because it could run all the time
 now a completely different thought  i 'm always imagining myself
 in different situations
 i 'm imagining myself as a machine what would i love i would love to be bathed in oil 
 so this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in
  it 's really just sort of
 for me it was just really about the lusciousness of oil and then i got a call from a friend
 who wanted to have a show of erotic art  and i didn 't have any pieces but when she suggested
 to be in the show this piece came to mind so it 's sort of related but you can see it 's much more overtly erotic
  and this one i call machine with grease it 's just continually ejaculating and it 's 
 this is a happy machine i 'll tell you it
 's definitely happy 
 from an engineering point of view  this is just a
  and then again this is a found object a little fan that i that i found and i thought 
 what about the gesture of opening the fan and how how simply could i state something and in a case like this
  i 'm trying to make something which
 which is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or
  is very important because i 'm inventing machines but i 'm also inventing tools to make machines and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning 
 so this is a little wire bending tool after many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers i made that tool  and then i made this other tool for sort of
 centering gears very quickly
 sort of developing my own little world of technology my life completely changed
 when i found a spot welder 
 and that was that tool  it completely changed what i could do 
 now here i 'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering  
 this is not the way they teach you to silver solder
 when you 're in school  i just like throw it in i mean real jewelers put
  little bits of solder in 
 so that 's a finished gear when i moved to boston  i joined a group
 called the world sculpture racing society and
 the idea their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street  and there 'd be no subjective
 decision about what was the best it would be whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner
 so i made this is my first racing sculpture  and i thought oh  i 'm going to make a cart  and i 'm going to have it i 'm going to have my hand writing ' faster '
 so as i run down the street the cart 's going to talk to me and it 's going to go
  in the end what i decided
 was every time you finish writing the word i would stop and i would give the card to somebody on the side of the road so i would never win the race because i 'm always stopping but
 i had a lot of fun 
 now i only have two and
  half minutes i 'm going to play this this this is a piece that for me is
 in some ways the most complete kind of piece because when i was a kid i also played a lot of guitar  and when i had this thought  
 i was imagining that i would make
 i would have a whole machine theater evening where i would you would have an audience  the curtain would open and you 'd be entertained
 by machines on stage  so i imagined a very simple gestural dance that that would
 be between
 a machine and just a very simple chair
  and 
 when i 'm making these pieces i 'm always trying to find
  a point where i  where i 'm saying something very clearly and
 it
 's very simple  but also at the same time it 's very ambiguous
 and i think there 's a point between simplicity and ambiguity which can allow a viewer to
 perhaps take something from it
 and that leads me to the thought that
 all of these pieces start off in my own mind in my heart  and i do my best at
 at
 finding ways to express them with materials  and it always feels really crude it 's always a struggle  but somehow i manage
  to sort of get this thought
 out into an object  and then it 's there ok  it means nothing at all the object itself just means nothing once it 's perceived  
 and
 someone brings it into their own mind then there 's a cycle that has been completed
  and to me that 's the most important thing because 
 ever since being a kid i 've wanted to communicate my passion and love  and that means the complete cycle of coming from inside out to the physical
 to
 someone perceiving it 
 so i 'll just let this chair come down
