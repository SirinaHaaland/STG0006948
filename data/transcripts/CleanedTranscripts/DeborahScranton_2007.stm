  three years ago i got a phone call based on an earlier film i had made with an offer to embed the new hampshire national guard 
 my idea and literally i woke up in the middle of the night and we 've all have those moments you know you go to
  was excited with this phone call i was thinking i just finished making another film about world war ii vets and i realized
 i 'd gotten to know their stories and i realized this was a once in a lifetime opportunity
 to tell a warrior 's story as it unfolded so i went to bed that night pretty excited not sure of all the details but
 excited  it wasn 't at four in the morning  but it was closer to midnight woke straight up
  as could be and i had this idea what if i could in effect  virtually embed 
 and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers to tell the story from the inside out versus the outside in 
 so i called back major heilshorn who 's the public affairs officer of the new hampshire national guard  and
 he knew me so i was like greg he 's like yes deborah 
 told him my idea and you know he is one of the bravest men in the world as is general blair who in the end gave me permission to try this experiment
  within ten days i was down at fort dix he gave me my pick of units i picked
 one unit charlie company third of the 172nd they 're mountain infantry for two reasons one they 're infantry 
 number two they were going to be based  at lsa anaconda so i knew they would have internet access the caveat for my access was i had to get the soldiers to volunteer this was a big thing that i think when
  totally gathering what that would mean so what that meant was when i went down to fort dix i had to hop out in front of one hundred and eighty guys
 and tell them of my vision you can imagine the hailstorm of questions i got the opening one was what the fuck do you know about the national guard 
 i started with the one thousand six hundred and seven massachusetts bay colony pequot indian wars gave them about a nine minute response
  every soldier eventually wants to go in combat it 's natural
  if you let fear get to you then you 're not going to be doing your job
  for him to not have his dad
  one of the things i 'd like to talk to you about is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about and i 'd like to relate an experience i had here at ted 
 i don 't know how many of you might imagine it but there 's actually a tedster who recently got back from iraq  paul come on  stand up
  were one of the lucky ones to get in the in the class with the sony cameras and the vista software right and we started talking people will see my tag and they 'll see the war tapes and then we 'll start talking about war we got in a conversation with
 some other people in the class  and it went on and on i mean we were there for an hour talking and it really highlighted something that i would like to ask
 you guys to think about and
  hopefully to help with which is i think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war and about politics and really because maybe we 're going to disagree maybe it 's going to get uncomfortable how do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation 
 and you know paul
 was talking  and he then turned to
  i wouldn 't have this conversation if she weren 't here because i know she has my back 
 and i want to say i was nervous because i 'm used to doing q & as i really related to what james was saying yesterday because i 'm behind the camera you
 know i can answer questions about my movie but for me to come up and talk for eighteen minutes is a really long time so i wanted to say paul i 'm happy you 're here because i know you have my back 
 this film was not about the internet but it could not have been made without it
  average took two weeks to get from iraq to me  in the meantime the soldiers
 we would email and im i didn 't save all of them because i didn 't realize at the beginning
 that it would be something that i would want to keep track of but
 there were three thousand two hundred and eleven emails and ims and text messages that
 i was able to to save the reason i quantify
  that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey
 to really get inside of it so i wanted to show you a clip and then i was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together if we could roll the clip
  be advised we 're leaving taji right now we believe that
 the blast was right outside the gate
 of
  there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds everything was cauterized and it was just like there was a void going going through the body
  this is the scene north  they just removed a burnt body or half a body from here
 think there was anything left from his abdominal down
  of a sandbag wall shaking and screaming medics who were terrified and couldn 't perform 
 i later heard that iraqi casualties
 were not to be treated in taji they can work on the post for pennies  but can 't die there they 've got to die outside
 if one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment
  i would 've slit his throat right there twenty one 
 zero hours and it 's
 just our squad going through today 's events in our heads  
 whether we want to or not
  twin suicide car bombings killed eight iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of baghdad sp we made the news i feel exploited and proud at the same time
 i 've lost all faith in the media
 a hapless joke i would much rather laugh at than become a part of 
 i should really thank god for saving my lucky ass i 'll do that then i 'm gonna jerk off because these pages smell like
  when i said earlier to try and tell a story from the inside out versus the outside in part of what chris said so
 eloquently in his introduction is this melding it 's a new way of trying to make a
  when i met the guys and
 ten of them agreed to take cameras in total twenty one ended up filming five soldiers filmed the entire time there are three featured in the film 
 the way i learned about taji was
 steve pink sent me an email and in it attached a photo of that burned body out at the car  and the tone from the email was you know it had been a very bad day obviously  
 and i saw in my im window that mike moriarty was at the base so i
  said mike can you please go get that interview with pink because the thing that very often is missing is in the military what they call hot wash it 's that immediate interview after something immediately happens 
 you know and if you let time go by it kind of softens and smooths the edges and for me i really wanted that so in order to get the intimacy to share that experience with you 
 the gun turret and then on the dashboard of the humvee most of the
 humvees we ended up mounting two cameras in them  so you get to experience that in real time right the
 interview that you see is the one that mike went and did within twenty four hours of that episode happening steve pink reading his journal happened five months after he came home i knew about that journal  but it was very very private
 and you know you earn someone 's trust especially
 in doc filmmaking through your relationship so it wasn 't until five months after he was home that he would read that journal 
 now  the news footage i put in there
 to try to show
 you know i think mainstream media tries to do the best they can in the format that they have but the thing that i know you all have heard a lot of times american soldiers saying
  don 't they talk about the good stuff that we do ok this is a perfect example 
 pink 's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire they didn 't have to go outside the wire there were not americans hurt out there 
 they spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save iraqi lives the iraqis who work on the post 
 so when you may hear soldiers complaining that 's what they 're talking about you know and i think
  's such an amazing gift that they would share this as as a way of bridging  and
 when i talk about that polarity i get at so many different q & as and people are really
 opinionated but it seems like people don 't want to hear so much or listen or try to have an exchange and i 'm as fiery as the next person but i really think
  different speakers have talked about their concern for the world and my concern is that we have to have these conversations and we have to be able to go into scary places where we may you know
 we think we know but we just have to leave that little bit of openness to know
 there 's such a disconnect  and for me it 's trying to bridge that disconnect  i 'll share one
  i get i 'm often asked you know for me what have been some of the special moments from having
 worked on this film  
 and at screenings inevitably you know  as i 'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff usually you you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions and usually 
 the first questions are oh what kind of cameras did you use or you know these things but there 's always a few guys almost always
  the last ones  and i 've learned over time that those are always the soldiers  
 and they wait until pretty much everybody 's gone  and
 for me one of the most
 profound stories someone shared with me that then became my story was for those of you who haven 't seen the film
  it 's not a spoiler it 's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents where people get in front of humvees and and they get killed 
 in this film there is a scene where an iraqi woman is killed 
 a soldier came up to me and
 stood  you know really pretty close a foot away from me he 's a big guy  and he looked at me and i smiled  and
  i saw the tears start
 welling up in his eyes and he wasn 't going to blink  and he said my gunner was throwing candy 
 and i knew what he was going to say  the gunner was throwing candy  they used to throw candy to the kids 
 kids got too close very often  
 and he said i killed a child  
  i 'm a father i have children i haven 't
 been able to tell my wife i 'm afraid she 's going to think i 'm a monster 
 i hugged him of course  
 and i said you know it 's going to be ok and he said i 'm going to bring her to see your film  
 and then i 'm going to tell her
  when i talk about a disconnect  
 it 's not only for maybe those people who don 't know a soldier which there obviously are 
 you know these days it 's not like world war ii where there was a war front and a home front and everybody seemed involved you can go for days here and not feel like there 's a war going on 
 and often i 'll hear people say  who maybe know that i did this film and they say oh you know  i 'm against the war but i support the
 and
 i 've started
 to ask them well 
 that 's nice what are you doing  are you volunteering at a va you go and see anybody do you if you find out
 your neighbor 's been do you
 spend some time not necessarily ask questions but see if they want to talk do you give
  money to any of the charities you know obviously like dean kamen 's working on that amazing thing but there 's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers
