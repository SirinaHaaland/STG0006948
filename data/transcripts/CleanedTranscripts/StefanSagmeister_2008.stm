  i showed a list under that title i learned very few
  things in addition since
 but
 made a whole number of them into projects since
 these are inflatable monkeys in every city in scotland
 everybody always thinks they
 are right
 they were combined in the
 doctorugs are fun in the beginning
 but become a drag later on
 we 're doing changing media
 this is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by you can 't help but actually
 ripping that spider web apart
 all of these things are pieces of graphic design we do them for our clients they are commissioned
 i would never have the money to actually pay for the installment or pay for all the billboards or the production of these
 so there 's always a client attached to them
  these are sixty five thousand coat hangers in a street that 's lined with fashion stores
 worrying solves nothing
 money does not make me happy appeared first as double page spreads in a magazine
 the printer lost the file didn 't tell us
  magazine actually when i got the subscription it was twelve following pages it said money does does make me happy
 and a friend of mine in austria was so felt so sorry for me
 that he talked
 the largest casino owner in linz into letting us wrap his building so this is the big pedestrian zone in linz and it just says money and if you
  down the side street it says does not make me happy
 we had a show just came down
 last week in new york we steamed up the windows permanently and every hour we had a different designer come in and write
 these things that they 've learned into the steam in the window everybody participated milton glaser
  massimo vignelli
 singapore was quite in discussion
 this is a little spot that we filmed there that 's to be displayed on the large jumbotrons in
 singapore
 and of course one that 's dear to my heart because all of these sentiments
 some banal some a bit more profound
 all originally had come out of my diary
  and i do go often into the diary and check
  the situation if it 's see it for a long enough time i actually do
 something about it and the very last one is a
 a billboard
 this is our roof in new york the roof of the studio this is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint we let that lie around in the
  sun as you all know newsprint yellows significantly in the sun
 after a week we took the stencils and the leaves off shipped the newsprints to lisbon to a very sunny spot so on day one the billboard said complaining is silly either act or forget
 three days later it faded and a week later no more complaining anywhere
 thank you
