  there really is only one place to go 
 and that is the dark net anonymous markets now you can 't get to these sites with a normal browser
 chrome or
 firefox
 because they 're on this hidden part of the internet  
 known as tor hidden services where urls are a string of meaningless numbers and letters that end in onion and which you access with a special browser called the tor browser now 
 the tor browser was originally a u s naval intelligence project it then became open source  and it allows anybody to browse
  the net without giving away their location  and it does this
 by encrypting your ip address and then routing it via several other computers around the world that use the same software  
 you can use it on the normal internet  but it 's also your key
 to the dark
  and because of this fiendishly clever encryption system the twenty or thirty we don 't know exactly thousand sites
 that operate there are incredibly difficult to shut down  it is a
  world visited by anonymous users little wonder then that it 's it 's a natural place to go for
  anybody with something to hide and that something of course  need not be
 illegal 
 on the dark net you will find whistle blower sites the new yorker  
 you will find political activism blogs you will find libraries of pirated books  but you 'll also find
 the drugs markets illegal pornography commercial hacking services  and much
  the dark net is one of the most interesting  exciting
 places
 anywhere on the net  and the reason is because although innovation of course  takes place in big businesses  
 takes place in world class universities it also takes place in the fringes because those on the fringes the pariahs the outcasts
 they 're often the
  they have to be 
 in this part of the internet  you will not find a single lolcat a single pop up advert anywhere
  and that 's one of the reasons why i think
 many of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon 
 not that i 'm suggesting anyone in this audience would use it to go and procure high quality narcotics but let 's say for a moment that you were
  bear with me  the first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites
 is how familiar it looks every single product
 thousands of products has a glossy  high res image a detailed
  you browse through the site  you make your choice you pay with 
 bitcoin  you enter an address preferably not your home address and you wait for your product to arrive in the
  and the reason it does
 is not because of the clever encryption that 's important something far simpler than that it
 's the user reviews 
 you see  every single vendor on these sites uses a pseudonym  naturally enough  but they keep the same pseudonym to build
  a reputation and because it 's easy for the buyer
 to change allegiance whenever they want  the only way
 of trusting a vendor is if they have a good history of positive feedback from other users of the site
  and this introduction
 of competition and choice does exactly what the economists
  prices tend to go down product quality tends to go up  
 and the vendors are attentive they 're polite they 're consumer centric offering you all manner of special deals
 marijuana at a reasonable price  he had
 a very generous refund policy  
 detailed t 's and c 's and good shipping times dear drugsheaven i wrote  via the internal
 emailing system that 's also encrypted of course i 'm new here do you mind if i buy just
  couple of hours later i get a reply  they always reply hi there thanks for your email  
 starting small is a wise thing to do i would too if i were you 
 so no problem if you 'd like to start with just one gram i do hope we can do business together  best wishes
  now this kind of
 attitude is the reason why when i reviewed one hundred and twenty thousand
 pieces of feedback that had been left on one of these sites over a three month period ninety five percent of them were five out of five 
 the customer  you see is king  but what does that mean
  the one hand that means there are more drugs more available more easily to more people 
 and by my reckoning that is not a good thing 
 but on the other hand if you are going to take drugs you have a reasonably good way
 of guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality which is incredibly important if you 're taking
  drugs and you can do so from the comfort of your own home without the risks associated with buying on the streets 
 now as i said you 've got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace
  and the twenty or so sites that are currently in operation by the way they don 't always work they 're not always perfect 
 the site that i showed you was shut down eighteen months ago
  before it had turned over over a billion dollars ' worth of trade 
 but these markets because of the difficult conditions in which they are operating the inhospitable conditions are always innovating always thinking of ways of getting smarter more decentralized  harder to censor and more
  's take the payment system  you don 't pay with your credit card of course that would lead directly back to you so you use the crypto currency bitcoin which is easily
 exchanged for real world currencies
 and gives quite a high degree of anonymity to its users  
 but at the beginning of these sites people noticed a flaw  some of the unscrupulous dealers were running away with peoples ' bitcoin before they 'd mailed the drugs out the
 community came up
  with a solution called
 escrow payments  so
 on
 purchasing my item i would send my bitcoin to a neutral secure third digital wallet
  the vendor who would see that i 'd sent it would be confident that they could then send the product to me  and then when i
  received it at least two of the three people engaged in the transaction vendor buyer site administrator would have to sign the transaction off
 with a unique digital signature  and then the money would be transferred brilliant  elegant it works 
 but then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin because every bitcoin transaction is actually recorded publicly in a public ledger so if you
 if you 're clever you can try and work out who 's behind them so they came up with a
 tumbling service hundreds of people send their bitcoin into one address they 're tumbled and jumbled up and then the right amount is sent on
 to the right recipients but they 're different bitcoins
  now on the dark net markets  check grams the search engine  you can even buy some advertising space 
 are you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing 
 yeah one vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine 
 that 's not being sourced from colombian druglords but guatemalan farmers
  they even promised to reinvest twenty percent of any profits into local education
 programs there 's even a mystery shopper  
 now whatever you think about the morality of these sites and i submit that it 's not actually an easy question
 the creation of functioning competitive anonymous
  where nobody knows who anybody else is 
 constantly at risk of being shut down by the authorities is a staggering achievement a phenomenal achievement  
 and it 's that kind of
 innovation
 that 's why those on the fringes are often the harbingers of what is to come it 's easy to forget
 that because
  the internet has actually changed many times
 over the last thirty years or so it started in the ' 70s as a military project morphed
 in the 1980s to an academic network co opted by commercial companies in the ' 90s and then invaded by all of us via social media in the noughties 
 but i think it 's going to change again  
 and i think things like the dark net markets
  difficult to censor
 i think that 's the future  and the reason it 's the future
 is because we 're all worried about our privacy  
 surveys consistently show concerns about privacy the more time we spend online the more we worry about them  and those surveys show our worries are growing  
  we 're worried about what happens to our data we 're worried about who might be watching us since the revelations from edward snowden 
  using various 
  tools there are now between two and three million daily users of the tor browser the majority of which
  use is perfectly legitimate sometimes even mundane 
 and there are hundreds of activists around the world working on techniques and tools to keep you private online
  default encrypted messaging services  ethereum which is a project
 which tries to link up
 the connected but unused hard drives of millions of computers around the world to create a sort of distributed internet
 that no one really controls now we 've had distributed computing before of course  
 we use it for everything from skype to the search for extraterrestrial life  but you add distributed computing
 and powerful encryption that 's very very hard
 to to censor and control  another called maidsafe works on similar principles  another called twister  and so on and so on and here
 's the thing the
 more of us join  the more interesting those sites become  and then the more of us join  and so on and i think that 's what 's going to happen in fact
  already happening  the dark net is no longer
 a den for dealers and a hideout for whistle blowers it 's already going mainstream 
 just recently  the musician aphex twin released his album
 as a dark net site  facebook
 has started
  a group of london architects have opened a dark net site for people worried about regeneration projects 
 yes the dark net is going mainstream  and i predict that fairly soon  
 every social media company every major news outlet and therefore most of you in this audience will be using the dark net too 
 so the internet is about to get more interesting more exciting more innovative more terrible
  destructive 
 that 's good news if you care about liberty it 's good news if you care about freedom it 's good news if you care about democracy it
 's also good news if you want to browse for illegal pornography and if you want to buy and sell drugs
 with impunity 
 neither entirely dark nor entirely light  it 's not one side or the other that 's going to win out  but both
 thank you very much
