  what would be a good end of life  and i 'm talking about the very end i 'm talking about dying 
 we all think a lot about how to live well
  i 'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well  
 i 'm not a geriatrician  i design reading programs for preschoolers  
 what i know about this topic comes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two 
 in the last few years i helped two friends have the end of life they wanted  jim and shirley modini spent their sixty eight years of marriage living off
  in the mountains of sonoma county they kept just enough livestock to make ends meet
 so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge for the bears and lions and so many other things that lived there  this was their dream  
 i met jim and shirley
 in their 80s they were both only children who chose not to have kids
  as we became friends i became their trustee and their medical advocate but more importantly
  i became the person who managed their end of life experiences  
 and we learned a few things about how to have a good end  
 in their final years  jim and shirley faced cancers fractures  infections neurological illness it 's true 
 at the end our bodily functions and independence are declining to zero  
 what we found is that with a plan and the right people quality of life can remain
  high the beginning of the end is triggered by a mortality awareness event  and during this time jim and shirley
 chose acr nature preserves
 to take their ranch over when they were gone this gave them the peace of mind to move forward  it might be a diagnosis  it might be your intuition 
  this thing is going to get me jim and shirley spent this time letting friends know that their end was near and that they were okay with that  
 dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness are different 
 in both cases last days are about quiet reassurance 
 jim died first he was conscious until the very end but on his last day he couldn 't talk through his eyes we knew when he needed to hear again it is all set jim
 we 're going to take care of shirley right here at the ranch and acr 's going to take care of your wildlife forever 
 from this experience i 'm going to share five practices i 've put worksheets online so if you 'd like you can plan your own end  
 it starts with a plan 
 most people say i 'd like to die at home eighty percent of americans die in a hospital or a nursing home  saying we 'd like to die at home is not a plan
 a lot of people say if i get like that just shoot me this is not a plan either this is illegal 
 laughter a plan involves
 answering straightforward questions about the end you want where do you want to be when you 're no longer independent  
 what do you want in terms of medical intervention and who 's going to make sure your plan is followed  you will need advocates
  having more than one increases your chance of getting the end you want  
 don 't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child  you want someone who has the time and proximity to do this job well  and you want someone who can work with people under the pressure of an ever changing situation
  hospital readiness is critical you are likely to be headed to the emergency room and you want to get this right  prepare a one page summary of your medical history medications
  and physician information  put this in a really bright envelope with copies of your insurance cards your power of attorney and your do not resuscitate order 
 have advocates keep a set in their car tape a set to your refrigerator when you show up in the e r with this packet 
 your admission is streamlined in a material way you
 're going to need
  to assess your personality and financial situation to determine whether an elder care community or staying at home is your best choice 
 in either case do not settle  we went through a number of not quite right caregivers
 before we found the perfect team
 led by marsha who won 't let you win at bingo just because you 're dying
 but will go out and take videos of your ranch
  for you when you can 't get out there
  and caitlin who won 't let you skip your morning exercises but knows when you need to hear that your wife is in good hands  
 finally  last words  what do you want to hear at the very end and from whom would you like to hear it in my experience you 'll want to hear
 that whatever you 're worried about is going to be fine when you believe it 's okay to
  let go you will so this is a topic that normally inspires
 fear and denial  what i 've learned
 is if we put some time into planning our end of life we have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life  
 here are jim and shirley just after deciding who would take care of their ranch 
 here 's jim just a few weeks before he died
 celebrating a birthday he didn 't expect to see  and here 's shirley just a few days before she died
 being read an article in that day 's paper about the significance of the wildlife refuge at the modini ranch
  jim and shirley had a good end of life  and by sharing their story with you 
 i hope to increase our chances of doing the same
