  in two thousand and twelve when i painted the minaret of jara mosque in my hometown of gabs in the south of tunisia  
 i never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention
 to a city  at the beginning i was just looking for a wall in my hometown and it happened
  that the minaret was built in ' ninety four and for eighteen years those 
 of concrete stayed grey 
 when i met the imam for the first time  and i told him what i wanted to do he was like thank god you finally came and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody
 to do something on it the most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn 't ask me anything
 neither a sketch
 or what i was going to write 
 in every work that i create  i write messages with my style of calligraffiti a mix of calligraphy and graffiti 
 i use quotes or poetry for the minaret i thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mosque should come from the quran so i picked this verse 
  oh humankind we have created you from a male and a female  and made you people and tribe so you may know each other 
 it was a universal call for peace  tolerance  and acceptance coming from the side that
 we don 't usually portray in a good way in the media  i was amazed
 to see how the local community reacted to the painting  and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention from international press all around the
  for the imam it was not just the painting it was really deeper than that 
 he hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city  and attract people to this forgotten place of tunisia 
 the universality of the message the political context of tunisia at this time  and the fact that i was writing quran
 in a graffiti way were not insignificant it reunited the community  
  together through arabic calligraphy is what i do writing messages is the essence of my artwork what is funny actually is that
 people really need to focus a lot to decipher what i 'm writing 
 you don 't need to know the meaning to feel the piece  i think that arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes  there is a beauty in it that you don 't need to translate
  arabic script speaks to anyone i believe to you to you to you to anybody  and then when you get the meaning 
 you feel connected to it i always make sure to write messages that are relevant to the place where i 'm painting  but messages that have
 a universal dimension so anybody around the world can connect to it i was born and raised in france in paris  and i started learning
  how to write and read arabic when i was eighteen  today i only
 write messages in arabic  one of the reasons this is so important to me 
 is because of all the reaction that i 've experienced all around the world 
 in rio de janeiro  i translated this portuguese poem from gabriela trres barbosa who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela
  and then i painted it on the rooftop 
 the local community were really intrigued by what i was doing  
 but as soon as i gave them the meaning of the of the calligraphy they thanked me as they felt connected to the piece  
 in south africa in cape town the local community of philippi offered me the only
  it seems impossible until it 's done 
 then this guy came to me and said man why you don 't write in english and i replied to him 
 i would consider your concern legit if you asked me why i didn 't write in zulu 
 in paris once there was this event and
 someone gave his wall to be painted and when he saw
  i was painting in arabic he got so mad actually hysterical and he asked for the wall to be erased  
 i was mad and disappointed but a week later the organizer of the event asked me to come back  and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy 's house 
 so this guy 
 like was forced to see it every
  i 'm really proud of my culture  and i 'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my through my artwork  and
 i hope that i can break the stereotypes we all know with the beauty of arabic script
  today i don 't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall i don 't want the poetry
 of the calligraphy to be broken as it 's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning as you can enjoy any music from other countries  
 some people see that as a rejection or a closed door  but for me it 's more
 an invitation to my language to my culture  and to my art  thank you
