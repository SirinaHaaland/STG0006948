  to tell you from the bottom of
  thank you so very very much do you know to date the als association has raised one hundred and 
 million dollars woo hoo 
 it takes me back to the summer of 
 my family my kids had all grown up we were officially empty nesters and we decided let 's go on a family vacation jenn my daughter
 and my son in law came down from new york my youngest andrew  he came down from his home in charlestown where he was working in boston  and my son pete  who had played at
  boston college baseball had played baseball professionally in europe  and had now come home and was selling group insurance he also joined us and one night i found myself having a beer with pete 
 you know mom  i don 't know selling group insurance is just not my passion he said 
 i just don 't feel i 'm living up to my potential  i don 't feel this is my mission in life 
 and he said you know  oh by the way mom  i have to leave early from vacation because my inter city league team that i play for
  made the playoffs  and i have to get back to boston because i can 't let my team down i 'm just not as passionate about my job
 as i am about baseball so off pete went and left the family vacation break a mother 's heart
 and he
 went and we followed four days later to see the next playoff game we 're at the playoff game pete
  plate and a fastball 's coming in and it hits him on the wrist oh pete 
 his wrist went completely limp like this  
 so for the next six months 
 pete went back to his home in southie kept working that unpassionate job 
 and was going to doctors to see what was wrong with this wrist that never came back  
 six months later in march
  called my husband and me and he said oh mom and dad we have a doctor that found a diagnosis for that wrist do
 you want to come with the doctor 's appointment with me i said sure we 'll come in 
 that morning pete  john and i all got up got dressed got in our cars
 three separate cars because we were going to go to work after the doctor 's appointment to find out what happened to the wrist we walked into the neurologist
  's office sat down four doctors walk in and the head neurologist sits down 
 and he says well pete we 've been looking at all the tests  and i have to tell you it 's not a sprained wrist it
 's not a broken wrist it 's not nerve damage in the wrist  it 's not an infection  it 's not lyme
  up and i was thinking to myself  where is he going with this 
 then he put his hands on his knees he looked right at my 27 year old kid and said i don 't know how to tell a
  at my husband he looked at me and then we looked at the doctor and we said als okay  what treatment let 's go what do we do 
 let 's go and he looked at us and he said 
 i 'm sorry to tell you this but there 's no treatment
 and there 's no cure we were the worst culprits we didn 't even understand that it had been
 seventy five years since lou gehrig and nothing had been done in the progress against als 
 so we all went home and jenn and dan flew home from wall street  andrew came home from charlestown 
 and pete went to b c to pick up his then girlfriend julie and brought her home and six hours later after diagnosis we 're sitting around having a family dinner
 and we 're having small chat  i don 't even remember cooking dinner that night  but then our leader  pete  
 set the vision 
 and talked to us just like we were his new team  he said there will be no wallowing people he goes we 're not looking
  looking forward what an amazing opportunity we have to change the world 
 i 'm going to change the face of this unacceptable situation of
  going to move the needle and i 'm going to get it in front of philanthropists like bill gates 
 and that was it we were given our directive so in the days and months
  that followed within a week we had
 our brothers and sisters and our family come to us that they were already creating team frate train  
 uncle dave he was the webmaster  uncle artie  he was the accountant  auntie dana she was the graphic artist  
 and my youngest son  andrew  quit his job  left his apartment in charlestown and says i 'm going to take care of pete and be his
  that pete had inspired throughout his whole life  
 the circles of pete all started intersecting with one another and made team frate train  
 six months after diagnosis pete was given an award at a research summit for advocacy
  got up and gave a very eloquent speech 
 and at the end of the speech there was a panel and on the panel were these pharmaceutical executives and biochemists and clinicians and
 i 'm sitting there and i 'm listening to them and most of the content
 went straight over my head i avoided every science class i ever could 
 but i was watching these people and i was listening to them and they were saying i i do this i do that and there was a
  unfamiliarity between them  
 so at the end of their talk the panel  they had questions and answers and boom my hand went right up  
 and i get the microphone  and i look at them and i say thank you thank you so much for working in als it means so very much to us i said but i do have to tell you that i 'm watching 
  your body language and i 'm listening to what you 're saying it just doesn 't seem like there 's a whole lot of collaboration going on here
  not only that where 's the flip chart with the action items and the  follow up and the accountability what are you going to do after you leave this room 
 and then i turned around
 and there was about two hundred pairs of eyes
 just staring at me  
  and it was that that point that i realized
 that i had talked about the elephant in the room  thus my mission had begun 
 so over the next couple of years
  pete we 've had our highs and our lows pete was put on a compassionate use drug it was hope in a bottle for the whole als community it was in a phase iii trial 
 then six months later the data comes back no efficacy
  were supposed to have therapies overseas  and the rug was pulled out from under us  
 so for the next two years  we just watched my son be taken away from me little by little every day
 two and a half years ago pete was hitting home runs at baseball fields 
  pete 's completely paralyzed  he can 't hold his head up any longer he 's confined to a motorized wheelchair  
 he can no longer swallow or eat  he has a feeding tube  
 he can 't speak  
 he talks with eye gaze technology and a speech generating device and we 're watching his lungs because his diaphragm
  eventually is going to give out
 and then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not als robs the human of all their physical
 parts but the brain stays intact  so july 
 fourteen 75th year of lou gehrig 's inspirational speech
  and pete is asked by mlb com to write an article in the bleacher report  
 and it was very significant because he wrote it using his eye gaze technology  
 twenty days later the ice started to fall 
 on july 
 pete 's roommate in new york city  wearing
  a quinn for the win shirt signifying pat quinn another als patient known in new york and b c shorts
 said i 'm taking the als ice bucket challenge 
 picked up the ice put it over his head and i 'm nominating and he sent it up to boston 
 and that was on july 
  the next couple of days our news feed was full of family and friends  if you haven 't gone back  the nice thing
  about facebook is that you have the dates you can go back you 've got to see uncle artie 's human bloody mary
  i 'm telling you it 's one of the best ones  and that was probably in day two 
 by about day four  uncle dave the webmaster  he isn 't on facebook  and i get a text from him
  what the hell is going on 
 uncle dave gets a hit every time pete 's website is gone onto and his phone was blowing up  
 so we all sat down and we realized money is coming in how amazing  so we knew awareness would lead to funding  we just didn 't know it would only take a couple of days  
 so we got together put our best five hundred and
  on pete 's website and off we went so week one boston media  
 week two national media it was during week two that our neighbor next door opened up our door and threw a pizza across the kitchen floor saying i think you people might need food in there
  my husband did japanese television it was interesting
  nuns of dublin  who 's seen that one
  it 's absolutely fantastic  j t justin timberlake that 's when we knew that was a real
 i go back on my texts and i i can see
  and the als patients you know what their favorite ones are and their families ' 
 all of them 
 because this misunderstood and underfunded rare disease  they just sat and watched people saying it over and over 
 it was
  and those naysayers let 's just talk a couple of stats  shall we 
 okay so the als association they think by year end it 'll be one hundred and sixty million dollars
  in cambridge they raised three million dollars well guess what they had a
 clinical trial for a drug that they 've been developing it was on a three year track for funding
  has reported that over one hundred and fifty countries have posted ice bucket challenges for als and facebook 
 two point five
 million videos  and i had
  the awesome
 adventure visiting the facebook campus last week and i said to them i know what it was like in my house i can 't imagine what it was like around here 
 all she said was 
 and my family 's favorite video  
  because the night pete was diagnosed  he told us
 that he was going to get als in front of philanthropists like bill gates  
 and he did it goal number one  check now on to the treatment and cure
  we know that it was much more than just pouring buckets of ice water over your head  and i really would like to leave you with a couple of things that i 'd like you to remember  
 the first thing is 
 every morning when you wake up you can choose to live your day in positivity
  would any of you blame me if i just was in the fetal position and pulled the
 covers over my head every day no i don 't think anybody would blame me  
 but pete has inspired us to wake up every morning and be positive and proactive i actually had to ditch support groups because everybody was in there saying that spraying their lawns with chemicals that 's
  i had to get away from the negativity  
 the second thing i want to leave you with is the person at the middle of the challenge has to be willing to have the mental toughness to put themselves out there 
 pete still goes to baseball games and he still sits with his teammates in the dugout  
 and he hangs his gravity feed bag right on the cages you 'll see the
  kids they 're up there hanging it up pete is that okay yup and then they put it right into his stomach  
 because he wants them to see what the reality of this is and how he 's never ever going to give up 
 and the third thing i want to leave you with if you ever come across a situation that you see
  i want you to dig down as deep as you can and find your best mother bear and go after it
  i know that i 'm running over but i 've got to leave you with this  the gifts that my son has given me  i have had twenty nine years
 of having the honor of being the mother of pete frates 
 pete frates has been inspiring and leading his whole life  he 's thrown out kindness and all that kindness has come back to him  
 he walks the face of the earth right
  now and knows why he 's here  what a gift  
 the second thing that my son has given me is he 's given me my mission in life 
 now i know why i 'm here i 'm going to save my son  
 and if it doesn 't happen in time for him i 'm going to work so that no other mother has to go through what i 'm going through
 and the third thing and last but not least gift that my son has given me as an exclamation point to the miraculous month of august two thousand and fourteen 
 that girlfriend that he went to get on the night of diagnosis is now his wife  
  and pete and julie have given me my granddaughter
  so let me leave you with pete 's words of inspiration that he would use to classmates  coworkers and teammates 
 be passionate 
 be genuine be hardworking  and don 't
 forget to be great
