  or maybe an owl out of the air 
 i was preaching in san jose some time ago
  and my friend mark kvamme who helped introduce me
 to this conference brought several ceos
 and leaders of some of the companies here in the silicon valley to have breakfast with me or i with them  
  to hear them talk
 about the world that is yet to come
 through technology and science 
 i know that we 're near the end of this conference  and some of you may be wondering
 why they have a speaker from the field of religion
 richard can answer that  because he made that decision
  but some years ago i was on an elevator in philadelphia coming
 down i was to address a conference
 at a hotel  
 and on that elevator a man said i hear billy graham is staying in this hotel and another man looked in my direction and said
  there he is he 's on this elevator with us 
 and this man looked me up and down for about ten seconds  and he said my what an anticlimax 
 i hope that you won 't feel that these few moments with me is not a is an anticlimax  after all these tremendous
  talks that you 've heard and addresses which i intend to listen to every one of them  but i was
 on an airplane in the east some years ago 
 and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of charlotte north carolina his name was john belk some of you will probably know him
  and there was a drunk man on there  and he got up out of his seat two or three times and he was making everybody upset by
 what he was trying to do and he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by and
 everybody was upset with him  and finally  john belk said do you know who 's sitting here and the man
  and he turned to me and he said put her there he said your sermons have certainly helped me 
 and i suppose that that that 's true with thousands of people
  i know that as you have been peering into the future  and as we 've heard some of it here tonight  
 i would like to live in that age
 and see what is going to be  
 but i won 't because i 'm eighty years old this is my eightieth year  and i know that my time is brief
  have phlebitis at the moment in both legs  
 and that 's the reason that i had to have a little help in getting up here because i have parkinson 's disease in addition to that and some other problems that i won 't talk about 
 laughter but
 this is not the first time that we 've had a technological revolution we 've had others  and there 's one that i want to talk about
 in one generation  the nation of the people of israel
 had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power
 in the near east 
 a man by the name of david came to the throne  and king david became one of the great leaders
 of his generation
 he was a man of tremendous leadership  he had the favor of god with him  
 he was a brilliant
 poet philosopher  writer  soldier with strategies in battle and conflict that people study
  but about two centuries before david the hittites
 had discovered the secret of smelting
 and processing of iron and slowly that skill spread  but they wouldn 't allow the israelis
 to look into it or to have any  but david changed all of that
  and he introduced the iron age to israel 
 and the bible says that david laid up great stores of iron 
 and which archaeologists have found that in present day palestine there are evidences of that generation  
 now instead of crude tools
 made of sticks and stones israel now had iron plows and sickles and hoes and
 military weapons
  and in the course of one generation  israel was completely changed 
 the introduction of iron in some ways had an impact
 a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation
 that there were many problems that technology could not solve there were many problems
 still left  and they 're still with us  and you haven 't solved them  and i haven 't heard anybody here speak
 to that  how do we solve these three problems that i 'd like to mention the first one
 that david saw was human evil
 where does it come from  how do we solve it over again
 and again in the psalms  which gladstone said was the greatest book in the world 
 david describes the evils of the human race  and yet he says he restores
  have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are 
 on one hand we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology 
 as this conference vividly
 demonstrates we 've seen under the sea three miles down or galaxies
 hundreds of billions of years out in the future  but on the other hand
 something is wrong 
 our battleships 
 our soldiers are on a frontier now  almost ready to go to war
 with iraq  now what causes this 
 why do we have these wars in every generation  and in every part of the world  and revolutions
  we can 't get along with other people even in our own families we find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self destructive habits we can 't break  
 racism
 and injustice and violence sweep our world bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death  
 even the most sophisticated among us
 seem powerless to break this cycle
 i would like to see oracle take up that or
 some other technological
 geniuses work on this how do we change man so that he doesn 't lie and cheat
  our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud
 in business or labor or athletics or wherever
  the bible says the problem is within us  within our hearts and our souls 
 our problem is that we are separated from our creator 
 which we call god and we need to have our souls restored 
 something only god
  do jesus said for out of the heart
 come evil thoughts  murders  sexual immorality  theft  false testimonies  slander 
 the british philosopher bertrand russell was not a religious man  but he said it 's in our hearts that the
  and it 's from our hearts that it must be plucked out albert einstein
 i was just talking to someone when i was speaking at princeton  
 and i met
 mr einstein he didn 't have a doctor 's degree because he said nobody was qualified to give him one 
 but he made this statement 
  it 's easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man and many of you i 'm sure have thought about that
 and puzzled over it you 've seen people
 take beneficial technological advances such as the internet we 've heard about tonight  and twist them into something
 corrupting you 've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems  the oklahoma city
  bombing was simple technology  horribly used  
 the problem is not technology  the problem is the person or persons using it 
 king david said
 that he knew the depths of his own soul he couldn 't free himself from personal problems and personal evils
 that included murder and adultery
 yet king david sought god 's forgiveness and said you can restore my soul you see the bible teaches
 that we 're more than a body and a mind 
 we are a soul  and there 's something inside of us that is beyond
 our understanding that 's the part of us that yearns
 for god or something more
 than we find
 in technology  
 your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life 
 and which seeks for something beyond this life  it 's the part of you that yearns really for god  i find [ that ] young people all over the world are searching for something 
  they don 't know what it is i speak at many universities  and i have many questions and answer periods and
 whether it 's cambridge or harvard or
 oxford i 've spoken at all of those universities i 'm going to harvard in about three or four no it 's about two months from now
 to give a lecture and i 'll be asked the same questions that i was asked the last few times i 've been there and it 'll be
 on
  where did i come from why am i here  where am i going what 's life all about why am i here 
 even if you have no religious belief there are times when you wonder that there 's something else  
 thomas edison also said when you see everything that happens in the world of science and in the working of the universe you cannot deny
 that there 's a captain on the bridge
  i remember once i sat beside mrs gorbachev
 at a white house dinner  i went to ambassador dobrynin whom i knew very well and i 'd been to russia several times
 under the communists  and they 'd given me marvelous freedom that i didn 't expect  
 and i knew mr dobrynin very well and i said i 'm going to sit beside
  what shall i talk to her about and he surprised me with the answer he said talk to her about religion
 and philosophy that 's what she 's really interested in i was a little bit surprised but that evening
 that 's what we talked about  and it was a stimulating conversation 
 and afterward she said you know i 'm an atheist  but i know that there 's something up there
  the second problem that king david realized he could not solve
 was the problem of human suffering 
 writing the oldest book in the world was job  and he said man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward 
 yes to be sure science has done much to push back certain types of human
  be eighty years of age i admit that i 'm very grateful for all the medical advances
 that have kept me in relatively good health all these years my doctors at the mayo clinic urged me not to take this trip out here to this
 to be here i haven 't given a talk in nearly
 four months  
 and when you speak as much as i do three or four times a day
  get rusty that 's the reason i 'm using this podium and using these notes 
 every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere i 'm ad libbing i
 'm not reading i never read an address  i never read a speech or a talk or a lecture 
 i talk ad
  but tonight i 've
 got some notes here so that if
 i begin to forget  which i do sometimes  
 i 've got something i can turn to but even here among us  
 most
 in the most advanced society in the world  we have poverty
  friends that betray us unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us  i 've never met a person in the world that didn 't have a problem
 or a worry  why do we suffer  it 's an age old question
 that we haven 't answered  yet david again and again said
 that he would turn to god he said the lord is my shepherd
  the final
 problem that david knew he could not solve was death 
 many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation  most people live as if
 they 're never going to die  technology projects the myth of control over our mortality
  see people on our screens  marilyn monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person  and our many young people think she 's still alive 
 they don 't know that she 's dead  or clark gable or whoever it is the old stars they come to life 
 and they 're
 they 're just as great on that screen as they were in person
 but death is inevitable  i spoke some time ago to
 a joint session of congress last year  
 and we were meeting in that room  the statue room about three hundred of them were there  
 and i said there 's one thing that we have in common in this room all of us together whether republican or democrat
  or whoever 
 i said we 're all going to die  and we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us 
 and it 's often difficult for young people to understand that it
 's difficult for them to understand that they 're going to die  as the ancient writer of ecclesiastes wrote he said
  there 's every activity under heaven there 's a time to be born and there 's a time to die  
 i 've stood at the deathbed
 of several famous people  whom you would know  
 i 've talked to them  i 've seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death  and yet a few years earlier
 death never crossed their mind  i talked to a woman this past week
 whose father
 was a famous doctor she said he
 never thought of god never talked about god didn 't believe in god he was an atheist  
  as he came to die  he sat up on the side of the bed one day and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain  
 and he said for the first time in his life he 'd thought about
 the inevitable and about god was there a god  
 a few years ago a university student asked me
  surprise in your life and i said the greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life it passes so fast 
 but it does not need to have to be that way  wernher von braun 
 in the aftermath of world war ii concluded quote science and religion are not antagonists on the contrary
 he put it on a personal basis i knew dr von braun very well
 and he said speaking for myself  i can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator 
 he also said 
 in our search to know god  i 've come to believe that the life of jesus christ
  should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration  the reality of this life and his resurrection is the hope of mankind 
 i 've done a lot of speaking in germany
 and in france  and in different parts of the world one hundred and five countries it 's been my privilege to speak in  
 and i was invited one day to visit chancellor adenauer
  who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern germany since the war  
 and he once and he said to me he said young man he said do you believe in the resurrection of jesus christ 
 and i said sir i do he said so do i he said when i leave
  i 'm going to spend my time writing a book
 on why jesus christ rose again and why it 's so important to believe that 
 in one of his plays  alexander solzhenitsyn
 depicts a man dying  who says to those gathered around his bed the moment when it 's terrible to
 feel regret is when one is dying how should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying  
 blaise pascal
 asked exactly that question in seventeenth century france  pascal has been called the architect of modern
 civilization he was a brilliant
 scientist at the frontiers of mathematics even as a teenager he is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory
  and a creator of the first model of a computer 
 and of course you are all familiar with the computer language named for him  
 pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas of evil suffering and death  
 he was astounded at the phenomenon we 've been considering
  that people can achieve extraordinary heights in science the arts and human enterprise  
 yet they also are full of anger hypocrisy and have and  self hatreds 
 pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and
  i submit myself  
 absolutely to jesus christ my redeemer a french historian said  
 two centuries later 
 seldom has so mighty an intellect
 submitted with such humility to
  pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of god could bring us back into harmony  
 but he believed
 that his own sins and failures could be forgiven and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven  
 he experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason
  it was he who penned the well known words the heart has its reasons  which reason knows not of 
 equally well known is pascal 's wager  essentially he said this if you bet on god 
 and open yourself to his love you lose nothing  even if you 're wrong  
 but if instead you bet that there is no god  then you can lose it all in this life and the life to come
  pascal scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of god  the knowledge of god was far beyond
 anything that ever crossed his mind  he was ready to face him
 when he died at the age of thirty nine king david
 lived to be seventy a long time in his era  yet he too had to face death  and he wrote these words
  words even though
 i walk through the valley of the shadow of death  i will fear no evil for you are with me 
 this was david 's answer to three dilemmas of evil  suffering and death  it can be yours 
 as well as you seek the living god
 and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the
  future 
 when i was seventeen years of age 
 i was born and reared on a farm in north carolina  i milked cows every morning and i had to milk the same cows every evening when i came home from school  
 and there were twenty of them that i had that i was responsible for  
 and i worked on the farm
 and tried to keep up with my studies
 i didn 't make good grades in high school  i didn 't make them in college until
 something happened in my heart one day i was faced
 with christ he said i am the way the truth and the life can you imagine
  the embodiment of all truth he was a liar  
 or he was insane  
 or he was what he claimed to be which was he 
 i had to make that decision  i couldn 't prove it  i couldn 't take it to a laboratory
 and experiment with it  but by
  i believe him  and he came into my heart
 and changed my life and now
 i 'm ready when i hear that call to go into the presence of god  thank you and god bless all of you
