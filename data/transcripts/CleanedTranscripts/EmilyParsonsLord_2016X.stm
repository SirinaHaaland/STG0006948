  if i asked you to picture the air  what do you imagine 
 most people think about either empty space or clear blue sky or sometimes trees dancing in the wind
  then i remember my high school chemistry teacher with really long socks at the blackboard  drawing diagrams of
 bubbles connected to other bubbles and describing how they vibrate and collide in a kind of frantic soup  
 but really we tend not to think about the air that much at all we notice it mostly
  when there 's some kind of unpleasant sensory intrusion upon it like a terrible smell or something visible like smoke or mist  
 but it 's always there it 's touching all of us right now  it 's even inside us 
 our air is immediate  vital and intimate  and yet  it 's so easily forgotten
  so what is the air  it 's the combination of the invisible gases that envelop the earth  attracted by the earth 's gravitational pull  
 and even though i 'm a visual artist  i 'm interested in the invisibility of the air  
 i 'm interested in how we imagine it how we experience it
 and how we all have an innate understanding of its materiality
 through breathing 
 all life on earth changes the air through gas exchange  
 and we 're all doing it right now
 actually why don 't we all right now together take one big collective
  that air that you just exhaled you enriched a hundred times in carbon dioxide  
 so roughly five liters of air per breath  seventeen breaths per minute of the five hundred and
  enriched one hundred times in carbon dioxide  just for you now that
 's equivalent to about eighteen olympic sized swimming pools 
 for me air is plural  it 's simultaneously as small as our breathing and as big as the planet
  it 's kind of hard to picture maybe it 's impossible  and maybe it doesn 't matter
 through my visual arts practice  
 i try to make air  not so much picture it but to make it visceral and tactile and haptic  
 i try to expand this notion of the aesthetic how things look  so that it can include things like how it feels on your skin and in your lungs
 and how your voice sounds as it passes through it 
 i explore the weight  density and smell but most importantly  i think a lot about the stories we attach to different kinds of air
 this is a work i made in two thousand and
  it 's called different kinds of air a plant 's diary 
 where i was recreating the air from different eras in earth 's evolution and inviting the audience to come in and breathe them with me 
 and it 's really surprising  so drastically different 
 now i 'm not a scientist  but atmospheric scientists will look for traces in the air chemistry in geology 
 a bit like how rocks can oxidize  and they 'll extrapolate that information and aggregate
  it such that they can pretty much form a recipe for the air at different times 
 then i come in as the artist and take that recipe and recreate it using the component gases 
 i was particularly interested in moments of time that are examples of life changing the air  
 but also the air that can influence how life will evolve
 like carboniferous air
 it 's from about three hundred to three hundred and fifty million years ago  it 's an era known as the time of the giants  
 so for the first time in the history of life lignin evolves that 's the hard stuff that trees are made of so trees effectively invent their own trunks at this time and they get really big bigger and bigger and pepper the earth
  oxygen releasing oxygen releasing oxygen such that the oxygen levels are about twice as high as what they are today  
 and this rich air supports
 massive insects huge spiders and dragonflies with a wingspan of about sixty five centimeters to breathe
  this air is really clean and really fresh it doesn 't so much have a flavor but it does give your body a really subtle kind of boost of energy  
 it 's really good for hangovers 
 or there 's the air of the great dying that 's about two hundred and fifty two point five million years ago  just before the dinosaurs evolve 
 it 's a really short time period geologically
  to two hundred thousand years really quick 
 this is the greatest extinction event in earth 's history even bigger than when the dinosaurs died out
 eighty five to ninety five percent of species at this time die out  
 and simultaneous to that is a huge dramatic spike in carbon dioxide  
 that a lot of scientists agree comes from a simultaneous eruption of volcanoes and a runaway greenhouse effect
  oxygen levels at this time go to below half of what they are today so about ten percent  so this air would definitely not support human life  but it 's ok to just have a breath 
 and to breathe it 's oddly comforting  
 it 's really calming it 's quite warm
 and it has a flavor a little bit like like soda water it has that kind of spritz quite pleasant
  with all this thinking about air of the past it 's quite natural to start thinking about the air of the future 
 and instead of being speculative with air and just making up what i think might be the future air  i discovered this
 air  that means that it doesn 't occur anywhere in
  but it 's made by humans in a laboratory for application in different industrial settings  
 why is it future air  well this air is a really stable molecule
 that will literally be part of the air once it 's released for the next three hundred to four hundred years before it 's broken down  
 so that 's about twelve to
  and this future air has some very sensual qualities  
 it 's very heavy  it 's about eight times heavier than the air we 're used to breathing  
 it 's so heavy in fact that when you breathe it in whatever words you speak are kind of literally heavy as well so they dribble down your chin and drop to the floor
  air that operates quite a lot like a liquid 
 now this air comes with an ethical dimension as well  
 humans made this air  but it 's also the most potent greenhouse gas that has ever been tested 
 its warming potential is twenty four thousand times that of carbon dioxide  and it has that longevity of twelve to sixteen generations
  so this ethical confrontation is really central to my work it
 has another quite
  it changes the sound of your voice quite dramatically 
 so when we start to think ooh it 's still there a bit 
 when we think about climate change 
 we probably don 't think about giant insects and erupting volcanoes
 or funny voices the images that more readily
  come to mind are things like retreating glaciers and polar bears adrift on icebergs 
 we think about pie charts and column graphs and endless politicians talking to scientists wearing cardigans  
 but perhaps it 's time we start thinking about climate change on the same visceral level that we experience the air
 air  climate change is simultaneously at the scale of the molecule the breath
 and the planet  
 it 's immediate  vital and intimate  
 as well as being amorphous and cumbersome  
 and yet  it 's so
  climate change is the collective self portrait of humanity it reflects our decisions as individuals as governments and as industries  
 and if there 's anything i 've learned from looking at air  it 's that even though it 's changing it persists  
 it may not support the kind of life that we 'd recognize but it will
  and if we humans are such a vital part of that change i think it 's important that we can feel the discussion  because
 even though it 's invisible humans are leaving a very vibrant trace in the air
