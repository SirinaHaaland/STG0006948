  a career in the art world i took a course in london and one of my supervisors was this irascible italian called
  drank too much  smoked too much and swore much too much  but he was a a passionate teacher  
 and i remember one of our earlier classes with him  he was projecting images on the wall  asking us to to think about them  
 and he put up an image of a painting it was a landscape
  there was a nude woman in the lower foreground  and on the hillside in the back there was a figure of the mythological god bacchus  
 and he said what is this 
 and i no one else did so i put up my hand  and i said it 's a bacchanal by titian 
 he said it 's a what 
 i thought maybe i 'd pronounced it
  as i said he swore too much
  there was an important lesson for me in that pietro was suspicious of formal art training art history training
  because he feared
 that it filled people up with jargon  and then they just classified things rather than looking at them  
 and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary  and he wanted us to use our eyes  
 and he was especially evangelical about this message because he was losing his sight
  he wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects what is it how is it made  why was it made  how is it used  
 and these were important lessons to me when i subsequently became a professional art historian my kind of eureka moment came a a few years
  when i was studying the art of the courts of northern europe  and of course it was very much
 discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day  
 but as i began to read historical documents and
 contemporary descriptions i found there was a kind of a missing component for everywhere i came across descriptions of tapestries
  tapestries were ubiquitous
 between the middle ages and really well into the  18th century  
 and it was pretty apparent why 
 tapestries were portable 
 you could roll them up send them ahead of you  
 and in the time it took to hang them up you could transform a cold  dank interior into a richly colored setting
  provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be associated 
 or even themselves  
 and in addition to that tapestries were hugely expensive 
 they required scores of highly skilled weavers working over extended periods of time
 with very expensive
  materials the wools the silks even gold and silver thread
 so all in all in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare 
 tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda well
 i became
  in due course i ended up as a curator at the metropolitan museum  because i saw the met as one of the few places
 where i could organize really big exhibitions about the subject
 i cared so passionately about and in about one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the then director philippe de montebello
  to organize an exhibition for two thousand and two we normally have these very long lead in times  
 it wasn 't straightforward  it 's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry
 in the back of a car 
 they have to be wound on huge rollers  shipped in oversized freighters  
 some of them are so big we had to get them into the museum we had to take them up the great steps at the front
 we thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience  
 the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded  
 the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread  the labeling you know
 we live in an age where we are so used to television images and photographs
 a one hit image these were big complex things
  almost like cartoons with multiple narratives  we had to draw our audience in get them to slow down to explore the objects 
 there was a lot of skepticism on the opening night 
 i overheard one of the senior members of staff saying this is going to be a bomb 
 but in reality in the course of the coming weeks and months  hundreds of thousands of people
 came to see the show  
 the exhibition was designed to be an experience  and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs 
 so i want you to use your imaginations thinking of these
 some of them ten meters wide  
 depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies who would look quite at home in the pages of of the fashion press today  
 thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boars and deer  
 violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism
 i remember taking my son 's school class he was eight at the time  and all the little boys  
 they kind of you know they were little boys and then the thing that caught their attention
 was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground kind of an in your face joke by the
  it brought it alive to them i think they suddenly saw that these these weren 't just old faded tapestries these were images of the world in the past  
 and that it was the same for our audience 
 and
 for me as a curator i felt proud  i felt i 'd shifted the needle a little through this experience that could
  only be created in a museum i 'd opened up the eyes of my audience
 historians  artists press the general public to the beauty of this of this lost medium 
 a few years later  i was invited to be the director of the museum  
 and after i got over that who me the tapestry geek  i don 't wear a
  i realized the fact  i believe passionately
 in that curated museum experience  
 we live in an age of ubiquitous information and sort of just add water expertise  
 but there 's nothing that compares with
 the presentation of significant objects in a well told narrative
  what the curator does  the interpretation
 of a complex esoteric subject 
 in a way that retains the integrity of the subject that makes it unpacks it for a general audience  
 and that to me today is now the challenge and the fun of my of my job supporting the vision of my curators  whether it 's an exhibition
  of samurai swords early byzantine artifacts  
 renaissance portraits or the show we heard mentioned earlier the mcqueen show 
 with which we enjoyed so much success last summer 
 that was an interesting case in the late spring early summer of of two thousand and ten shortly after mcqueen
  curator of costume andrew bolton came to see me  and said i 've been thinking of doing a show on mcqueen 
 and now is the moment we have to we have to do it fast 
 it wasn 't easy
  mcqueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers
 who were very protective of his legacy
  but andrew went to london and worked with them over the summer and won their confidence  
 and that of the designers who created his amazing fashion shows which were works of performance art in their own right  
 and we proceeded to do something at the museum i think we 've never done before  
 it wasn 't just your standard installation in fact we ripped down the galleries
 to recreate entirely different settings
 a recreation of his first studio a hall of mirrors a curiosity box 
 a sunken ship a burned out interior 
 with videos and soundtracks that ranged from operatic arias to pigs fornicating
  and in this
  were like actors and actresses or living sculptures it could have been a train wreck  it could have looked like
 shop windows on fifth avenue at christmas  
 but because of the way that andrew connected with the mcqueen team 
 he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of mcqueen and the show was quite transcendant and
  a phenomenon in its own right 
 by the end of the show we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show  
 but no one really complained  i heard over and over again wow that was worth it it was a such a visceral emotive experience now
 i 've described two very immersive exhibitions but i also believe
 that
  collections  individual objects can also have that same power 
 the met was set up not as a museum of american art but of an encyclopedic museum  and
 today one hundred and forty years later that vision is as prescient as ever  because of
  we live in a world of crisis of challenge and we 're exposed to it through the twenty four seven newsreels  
 it 's in our galleries
 that we can unpack the the civilizations the cultures 
 that we 're seeing the current manifestation of whether it 's libya  egypt  syria  it 's in our galleries that we can explain
  i mean our new islamic galleries are a case in point opened ten years  almost to the week after nine eleven  
 i think for most americans  knowledge of the
 islamic world was pretty slight before nine eleven  and then it was thrust upon us
 in one of america 's darkest hours and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event now
  now in our galleries we show fourteen centuries of the development
 of different islamic
 cultures across a vast geographic spread 
 and again hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last october  
 i 'm often asked
  replacing the museum and i think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion  
 i mean  don 't get me wrong  i 'm a huge advocate of the web 
 it gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe  but nothing replaces the authenticity
 of the object
 presented
  with passionate scholarship  
 bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people
 across time across space  whose lives may have been very different to our own  but who like
  had hopes and dreams  
 frustrations and achievements in their lives  
 and i think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves helps us make better decisions about where we 're going
  face to face with
  a dog pooping in the
