  i 've been fascinated for a lifetime
 by the beauty form and function of giant bluefin tuna bluefin are warmblooded like us they 're the largest
  fish in the sea bony fish  they actually are a fish that is endothermic
 powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal 
 that 's one of our bluefin at the monterey bay aquarium you can see in its shape and its streamlined design
 it 's powered for ocean swimming it flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins gets lift powers
  its movements with a lunate tail it 's actually got a naked skin for most of its body so it reduces friction
 with the water this is what one of nature 's finest machines now bluefin
 were revered by man
 for all
 of human history for four thousand years we fished sustainably for this animal 
 and it 's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago bluefin are in cave paintings in
  france they 're on coins that date back
 three thousand years this fish was revered by humankind it was fished sustainably till all
 of time except for our generation bluefin are pursued wherever they go
 there is a gold rush on earth and this is a gold rush for bluefin there are traps that fish sustainably up
  until recently  
 and yet the type of fishing going on today with pens 
 with enormous stakes 
 is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet now bluefin in general goes to one place japan 
 some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin
  they 're delectable muscle rich in fat
 absolutely taste delicious  and that 's their problem we 're eating them to death now in the atlantic the story is pretty simple 
 bluefin have two populations one large one small  the north american population is fished at about two thousand ton 
 the european population and north african the eastern bluefin tuna is fished at tremendous levels fifty thousand tons over the last decade almost every year
  result is whether you 're looking at the west or the eastern bluefin population there 's been tremendous decline on both sides as much as ninety percent if you go back
 with your baseline to one thousand nine hundred and fifty for that bluefin have been given
 a status equivalent to tigers to lions to certain african elephants
 and to pandas these fish have been proposed for an
  species listing in the past two months they were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago despite outstanding science
 that shows from two committees
 this fish meets the criteria of cites  i and if it 's tunas you don 't care about perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing
 chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks sharks
  marlin albatross these animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries the challenge we face
 is that we know very little about tuna and everyone in the room knows what it looks like
 when an african lion takes down its prey  i doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed this tuna symbolizes what
  's the problem for all of us in the room it
 's the 21st century  but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way 
 technology has come of age that 's allowing us to see the earth from space
 and go deep into the seas remotely  and we 've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better
 better understanding of how our ocean realm works 
 most of us from the ship even i look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea  
 we don 't know where the structure is we can 't tell where are the watering holes like we can
 on an african plain we can 't see the corridors  and we can 't see what it is that brings together a tuna a leatherback and an
  're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create
 a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot the reasons these challenges are great
 is that technically it 's difficult to go to sea it 's hard to study a bluefin on its turf  the entire pacific realm it 's
  really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it 
 and then imagine being bruce mate 's team from osu  getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays an engineering challenge we 've yet to really overcome  
 so the story of our team 
 a dedicated team is fish and chips  we basically are taking the same satellite phone parts or the same
 parts that are in your computer chips
  're putting them together in unusual ways  and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before  and for the first time we 're able to
 watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset 
 now i 've been working with tunas for over fifteen years  i have the privilege
  of being a partner with the monterey bay aquarium  
 we 've actually taken a sliver of the ocean put it behind glass  
 and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display 
 when the veil of bubbles lifts every morning  
 we can actually see a community from the pelagic ocean one of the only places on earth you can see giant bluefin swim by 
 we can see in their beauty of form and
  their ceaseless activity they 're flying through their space ocean space and we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish
 and show them
 its beauty 
 behind the scenes is a working lab at stanford university partnered with the monterey bay aquarium  
 here for over fourteen or fifteen years we 've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity we 'd been studying these fish 
 but first we had to learn how to husbandry them what do they like to eat
  what is it that they 're
 happy with 
 we go in the tanks with the tuna we touch their naked skin it 's pretty amazing it feels wonderful  
 and then better yet we 've got our own version of tuna whisperers our own chuck farwell  
 alex norton who can take a big tuna and in one motion put it into an envelope of water  
 so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not
  injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea  jeff and jason there are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent
 of a treadmill a flume  
 and that tuna thinks it 's going to japan but it 's staying in place we 're actually measuring its oxygen consumption its energy consumption  
 we 're taking this data and building better models  and when i see that tuna this is my favorite view
  i begin to wonder how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did so take a look at that animal that 's the closest you 'll probably ever get 
 now the activities from the lab
 have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean  so in a program called tag a giant
 we 've actually gone from ireland to canada from corsica to spain 
 with many nations around the world
 in an effort to basically put electronic computers
 inside giant tunas  
 we 've actually tagged one thousand one hundred tunas and i 'm going to show you three clips because i tagged one thousand one hundred tunas  
 it 's a very hard process but it 's a ballet
  we bring the tuna out we measure it a team of fishers captains scientists and technicians work together
 to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes  we put water over its gills give it oxygen and then with a lot of effort 
 after tagging putting in the computer  making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment we send this fish back into
  and when it goes  we 're always happy we see a flick of the tail  
 and from our data that gets collected when that tag comes back because a fisher returns it 
  reward  we can get tracks beneath the sea
 for up to five years now on a backboned animal now sometimes the tunas are really large such as this fish off nantucket
  but that 's about half the size of the biggest tuna we 've ever tagged it takes
 a human effort a team effort to bring the fish in in this case what we 're going to do is put a pop up satellite archival tag on the tuna 
 this tag
 rides on the tuna senses the environment around the tuna
 and actually will come off the fish  detach  float to the surface and send
  satellites position data estimated by math on the tag pressure data and temperature data 
 and so what we get then from the pop up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag 
 both the electronic tags i 'm talking about are expensive these tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in north america they are some of our finest
  our new technology in the ocean today  
 one community in general has given more to help us than any other community  and that 's the fisheries off the state of north carolina there
 are two villages harris and morehead city every winter for over a decade held a party called tag a giant 
 and together fishers worked with us to tag
 eight hundred to nine hundred fish in this case  we 're actually going to measure the fish we 're going to do something that in recent years we 've started
  take a mucus sample watch how shiny the skin is you can see my reflection there 
 and from that mucus we can get gene profiles  we can get information on gender  checking the pop up tag one more time  and then it 's out in the ocean 
 and this is my favorite with the help of my former postdoc gareth lawson 
 this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna this tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean the warm
  is the gulf stream  the cold up there in the gulf of maine that 's where the tuna wants to go it wants to forage on schools of herring but it can 't get there 
 it 's too cold but then it warms up and the tuna pops in gets some fish maybe comes back to home base 
 goes in again
 and then comes back to winter
 down there in north carolina and then on to the bahamas
  and my favorite scene three tunas going into the gulf of mexico three tunas tagged astronomically we 're calculating positions they 're coming together that could be tuna sex
 and there it is that is where the tuna spawn  
 so from data like this we 're able now to put the map up and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a
  of tagging and now we 're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side  so two populations of tunas
 that is we have a gulf population one that we can tag they go to the gulf of mexico i showed you that and a second population  
 living amongst our tunas our north american tunas are european tunas that go back to the med 
 on the hot spots the hope spots they 're mixed populations and so what we 've done with the science is we 're showing the international commission building new models
  model to this day  used to reject the cites treaty
 that model isn 't the right model this model a model of overlap is the way to move forward  
 so we can then predict where management places should be 
 places like the gulf of mexico and the mediterranean are places where the single species the single population can be captured these
  become forthright in places we need to protect the center of the atlantic where the mixing is i could imagine a policy that lets canada and america fish because they manage their fisheries well they 're doing a good job 
 but in the international realm where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild these are the places that we have to make hope spots in that 's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna 
 now in a second project
 called tagging of
  pacific pelagics we took on the planet
 as a team  those of us in the census of marine life and funded primarily through sloan foundation and others  
 we were able to actually go in in our project we 're one of seventeen field programs
 and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators not just tunas  so what we 've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in alaska
  salmon shark on their home territory  followed them catching salmon
 and then went in and figured out that if we take a salmon and put it on a line  we can actually take up a salmon shark this is the cousin of the white shark
 and very carefully note i say very carefully we can actually keep it calm put a hose in its
  keep it off the deck
 and then
 tag it with a satellite tag that satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message  and that shark leaping there if you look carefully has an antenna 
 it 's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon sending home its data 
 salmon sharks aren 't the only sharks we tag but there goes salmon sharks with this meter level resolution
 on an ocean of temperature warm colors are warmer salmon
  sharks go down to the tropics to pup
 and come into monterey  now right next door in monterey and up at the farallones are a white shark team led by scott anderson there and sal jorgensen they can throw out a target it 's a carpet
 shaped like a seal and in will come a white shark a curious critter that will come right
  or something like that acoustically with a ping 
 and then we 'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the  long distance journeys with the light based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that 's on the fish  
  sal 's looking at two tags there and there they are the white sharks of california going off to the white shark cafe and coming back  
 we also tag makos with our noaa colleagues blue sharks 
 and now together what we can see on this ocean of color that 's temperature we can see  ten day worms of makos and salmon sharks 
 we have
 white sharks and blue sharks for the first time an ecoscape as large as
  the tuna team from topp has done the unthinkable three teams tagged one thousand seven hundred tunas bluefin yellowfin and albacore all at the same time
 carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out pick up juvenile tunas put in the tags that actually have the sensors  stick out the tuna
  and then let them go 
 they get returned and when they get returned 
 here on a nasa numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor  returning to the western pacific 
 our team from ucsc has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads that come off when they slough 
 these elephant seals cover half an ocean take data down to one thousand eight hundred feet amazing data and then there 's scott shaffer and our
  wearing tuna tags light based tags that now are going to take you from new zealand to monterey and back 
 journeys of thirty five thousand nautical miles we had never seen before  
 but now with light based geolocation tags that are very small  we can actually see these journeys 
 same thing with laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes 
 up to the same zone the tunas use you can
  why they might be caught 
 then there 's george schillinger and our leatherback team out of playa grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are 
 and scott benson 's team that showed that leatherbacks go from indonesia all the way to monterey  
 so what we can see on this moving ocean
 is we can finally see where the predators are we can actually see how they 're using
  ecospaces as large as an ocean 
 and from this information we can begin to map the hope spots so this is just three years of data right here and there 's a decade of this data  we see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going
 on so what we 're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots four thousand deployments
  huge herculean task 
 two thousand tags
 in an area shown here for the first time off the california coast that appears to be a gathering place  
 and then for sort of an encore from these animals they 're helping us 
 they 're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to two thousand meters  they 're taking information from our planet at very
  critical places like antarctica and the poles those are seals from many countries
 being released
 who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles  
 this data when visualized is captivating to watch we still haven 't figured out best how to visualize the data 
  as these animals swim and give us the information that 's
 important to climate issues  we also think it 's critical to get this information to the public to engage the public with this kind of data we did this with the great turtle race
 tagged turtles brought in four million hits  and now with google 's oceans  
 we can actually put a white shark in that ocean 
 and when we do and it swims  we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from california to hawaii
  but maybe mission blue can fill in that ocean that we can 't see we 've got the capacity nasa has the ocean  we just need to put it together  
 so in conclusion 
 we know where yellowstone is for north america it 's off our coast  
 we have the technology that 's shown us where it is what we need to think about perhaps for mission blue is increasing the biologging capacity
  how is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere  and then finally to basically get the message home
 maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks 
 make killer apps if you will 
 a lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the golden gate bridge let 's connect the public to this activity right on their iphone 
 that way we do away with a few internet myths
 so
 we can save the bluefin tuna we can save the white shark we have the science and technology 
 hope is here yes we can we need just to apply this capacity
 further in the oceans  thank you
