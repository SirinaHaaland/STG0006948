  that i got to write it i would have never imagined that not in my wildest dreams did i think i don 't even consider myself to be an author 
 i 'm often asked why do you think so many people have read this this thing 's selling
 still about a million copies a month and
 i think it 's because spiritual emptiness is
 a universal disease i think inside at some point we put our heads down on the pillow and we
  's got to be more to life than this 
 get up in the morning go to work come home and watch tv go to bed get up in the morning go to work come home watch tv go to bed  go to parties on weekends a
 lot of people say i 'm living no you 're not living that 's just existing 
 just existing i really think that there 's this inner desire i do believe what chris said i believe
  not an accident 
 your parents may not have planned you but i believe god did i think there are accidental parents there 's no doubt about that 
 i don 't think there are accidental kids  
 and i think you matter  
 i think you matter to god i think you matter to history i think you matter to this universe  
 and i think that
 the difference between
 what i call the survival level of living the success level of living and the significance level
  of living is  do you figure out what on earth am i here for i meet a lot of people
 who are very smart and say but why can 't i figure out my problems 
 and i meet a lot of people who are very successful who say why don 't i feel more fulfilled why do i feel like a fake 
 why do i feel like
 i 've got to pretend that i 'm more than i really am
 i think that comes down to this issue of meaning of significance of purpose i
 think it comes down to this issue of why am i here what am i here for where am i going these are not religious issues 
 they 're human issues  
 i wanted to tell michael before he spoke that i really appreciate what he does because it makes my life work a whole lot easier as
  as a pastor i do see a lot of kooks  and i have learned that there are kooks in every area of life  religion doesn 't have a
 a
 monopoly on that but there are plenty of religious kooks  there are secular kooks  there are smart kooks dumb kooks there are people a lady came up to me the other day and she
  when the book became the best selling book in the world for the last three years 
  i kind of had my little crisis  and that was what is the purpose of this  
 because it brought in enormous amounts of money when you write the best selling book in the world it 's tons and tons of money 
 and it brought in a lot of attention neither of which i wanted when i started saddleback church i was twenty five years old i started it with one other family
  and i decided that i was never going to go on tv because i didn 't want to be a celebrity i didn 't want to be a quote evangelist televangelist that 's not my my thing 
 and
 all of the sudden it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention  i don 't think
 now this is a worldview and i will tell you everybody 's got a worldview  
 everybody 's betting their life on something  you 're betting your life on something you just better know why you 're betting what you 're betting
  so everybody 's betting their life on something and
 when i  you know made a bet i happened to believe that jesus was who he said he was
 and i believe in a pluralistic society everybody 's betting on something 
 and when i started the church you know i had no plans to do what it 's doing now
  and then when i wrote this book and all of a sudden it just
 took off  and i started saying now what 's the purpose of this because as i started to say i don 't think
 you 're given money or fame for your own ego ever i just don 't believe that  and when you write a book that the first
  it 's not about you then when all of a sudden it becomes the best selling book in history  you 've got to figure well i guess it 's not about me 
 that 's kind of a no brainer 
 so  what is it for  
 and i began to think about what i call the stewardship of affluence and the stewardship of influence 
 so i believe essentially leadership is stewardship 
 that if you are a leader in any area in business in politics
  sports in art in academics in any area you don 't own it 
 you are a steward of it 
 for instance that 's why i believe in protecting the environment this is not my planet  
 it wasn 't mine before i was born it 's not going to be mine after i die i 'm just here for eighty years and
 then that 's it i was debating the other day on a talk show and
  was challenging me and he 'd go what 's a pastor doing on protecting the environment and i asked this guy i said well do you believe
 that
 human beings are responsible
 to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation do you think we have a stewardship here to take the environment seriously
  let me make this clear again do you believe that
 as human beings i 'm not talking about religion
 do you believe that as human beings it is our responsibility to take care of this planet and make it just a little bit better for the next generation 
 and he said no not any more than any other species 
 when he said the word species he was revealing his
  and he was saying i 'm no more responsible to take care of this environment than a duck is 
 well now  i know a lot of times we act like ducks but you 're not a duck you
 're not a duck 
 and you are responsible that 's my worldview  
 and so  you need to understand what your worldview is the problem is most people never really
  codify it or qualify it or quantify it and say this is what i believe in this is why i believe what i believe 
 i don 't personally have enough faith to be an atheist  
 but you may you may your worldview  though does determine everything else in your life  because it determines
  it determines your relationships  it determines your level of confidence  
 it determines really everything in your life what we believe obviously and
 you know this determines our behavior and our behavior determines what we become in life  
 so all of this money started pouring in and all of this fame started pouring
  what do i do with this 
 my wife and i first made five decisions on what to do with the money
  we said first we
 're not going to use it on ourselves i didn 't go out and buy a bigger house  
 i don 't own a guesthouse i still drive the same four year old ford that i 've driven 
 we just said we 're not going to use it on us 
 the second thing was  
 i stopped taking a salary
  from the church that i pastor third thing is i added up all that the church had paid me over the last twenty five years and i gave it back  
 and i gave it back because i didn 't want anybody thinking that i do what i do for money i don 't in fact  personally i 've never met
 a priest or a pastor or a minister who does it for money i know that 's the stereotype i 've never met one of them believe me there 's a whole
  lot easier ways to make money  pastors are like on 
  call they 're like doctors  
 i left late today i 'd hoped to be here yesterday because my father in law is in his last probably forty eight hours before he dies of cancer  
 and i 'm watching a guy who 's lived his life he 's now in his mid 80s
  and he 's dying with peace you know the test of your worldview
 is not how you act in the good times  the test of your worldview is how you act at the funeral 
 and having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals
 it makes a difference it makes a difference what you believe so we gave it all back
  and then we set up three foundations  working on some of the major problems of the world illiteracy  poverty
  pandemic diseases particularly hiv aids
 and set up these three foundations and put the money into that the last thing we did is we became what i call reverse tithers 
 and that is when my wife and i got married
  that 's a
 principle in the bible that says give ten percent of what you get back to charity give it away to help other people 
 so we started doing that and each year we would raise our tithe one percent so our first year of marriage we went to eleven percent  
 second year we went to twelve percent and the third year we went to
 to thirteen percent and on and on and on
  why did i do that because every time i give it breaks the grip of materialism in my life  materialism is all about getting
 get get get get all you can can all you get sit on the can and spoil the rest  
 it 's all about more having more and we think that the good life is actually looking good
 that 's most important of all looking good  feeling good and having the goods
 but that 's not the good life  
 i meet people all the time who have those and they 're not necessarily happy  
 if money actually made you happy then the wealthiest people in the world would be the happiest and that i know  personally  i know  is not true 
 it 's just not true 
 so the good life is not about looking good feeling good or having the goods  it 's about being good and doing good giving your
  life away significance in life doesn 't come from status 
 because you can always find somebody who 's got more than you it doesn 't come from sex it doesn 't come from salary 
 it comes from serving  it is in giving our lives away that we find meaning we find significance
 that 's the way we were wired i believe by god  and so
 we began to give away and now after thirty years my wife and i are reverse tithers we give away ninety percent and live on ten 
 that actually was the easy part the hard part is what do i do with all this attention  because i started getting
 all kinds of invitations i just came off a
 nearly
  speaking tour on three different continents  and
 i won 't go into that but it was an amazing thing  and i 'm going what do i do with this this notoriety
 that the book has brought and being a pastor i started reading
 the bible there 's a chapter in the bible called psalm seventy two and it
 it 's solomon 's prayer for more influence 
  i want you to make me famous that 's what he prays he said i want you to make me famous  i want you to spread the fame of my name through every land  i want you to
 give me power  
 i want you to make me famous i want you to give me influence and it just sounds like the most egotistical request you could make if you were going to pray  
 until you read the whole psalm the whole
  and then he says so that the king he was the king of israel at that time at its apex in power so that the king may
 care for the widow and orphan support the oppressed defend the defenseless care for the sick assist the poor speak up for the foreigner
  's talking about all the marginalized in society  
 and as i read that i looked at it and i thought you know what this is saying is that the purpose of influence is to speak up
 for those who have no influence  
 the purpose of influence is not to build your ego 
 or your net worth and by the way your net worth is not the same thing as your self worth your value is not based on your
 valuables it 's based on a whole different set of things  and
 so the purpose of influence is to speak up for those who have no influence  and i had to admit  
 i can 't think of the last time i thought of widows and orphans  they 're not on my radar 
 i pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of america a bunch of gated communities i have a church full of ceos and
  scientists  
 and i could go five years and never ever see a homeless person they 're just not in my pathway 
 now they 're thirteen miles up the road in santa ana  
 so i had to say ok  i would use whatever affluence and whatever influence i 've got
 to help those who don 't have either of those
  a story in the bible about moses whether you believe it 's true or not it really doesn 't matter to me  but
 moses if you saw the movie the ten commandments moses goes out and there 's this burning bush and god talks to him and god says moses  
 what 's in your hand 
 i think that 's one of the most important questions you 'll ever be
  what 's in your hand  moses says it 's a staff
  it 's a shepherd 's staff 
 and god says throw it down and if you saw the movie  you know he throws it down and it it becomes a snake
  and then god says pick it up and he picks it back up again and it becomes a
  know a couple of things  number one god never does a miracle to show off it 's not just 
 wow isn 't that cool and by the way my god doesn 't have to show up on cheese bread you know 
 if god 's going to show up he 's not going to show up on cheese bread 
 ok  i just this is why i love what michael does  because it 's like
  he 's debunking it then i don 't have to but god my god doesn 't show up on sprinkler images
 he 's got a few more powerful ways than that to do whatever he wants to do but he
 doesn 't do miracles just to show off second thing is if god ever asks you a question he already knows the answer
 obviously if he 's god then that would mean that when he asks the question it 's for your benefit
  was a shepherd 's staff now follow me on this 
 this staff represented three things about moses ' life  first it represented his identity  he was a shepherd it 's the symbol of his own
 occupation i am a shepherd
 it 's a symbol of his identity his career his job  second  it 's a symbol of not only his identity it 's a symbol of his income because all of his assets are tied up in sheep
 in those days nobody had bank accounts or american express cards or hedge funds  your assets are tied up in your flocks 
 so it 's a symbol of his identity  and it 's a symbol of his income and the third thing it 's a symbol of his influence  
 what do you do with a
 shepherd 's staff well  you know you
  move sheep from point a to point b with it  by hook or by crook you pull them or you poke them one or the other 
 so he 's saying 
 you 're going to lay down your identity what 's in your hand you 've got identity you 've got income you 've got influence what 's in your hand 
 and he 's saying if you lay it down i 'll make it come alive i 'll do some things you could never imagine possible and if you 've watched that
  all of those big miracles that happen in egypt are done through this staff 
 last year i was invited to speak at
 game  
 and so i 'm talking to to the players 
 because most of the nba teams nfl teams and all the other teams have done this forty days of purpose based on the book  
 and
 i asked them i said what 's in your hand  so what 's in
  your hand i said it 's a basketball 
 and that basketball represents your identity who you are you 're an nba player 
 it represents your income  you 're making a lot of money off that little ball 
 and it represents your influence  
 and even though you 're only going to be in in the nba for a few years you 're going to be an nba player for the rest of your life and that gives you enormous influence
  to do with what you 've been given and i guess
 that 's the main reason i came up here today 
 to all of you very bright people at ted it is to say what 's in your hand 
 what do you have that you 've been given
  are you doing with what you 've been given that to me is the primary question about life that to me is what being
 is all about in the book i talk about how you 're wired to do certain things
  ability personality and experiences these things shape you and if you want to know what you ought to be doing with your life you need to look at your shape what am i wired to do 
 why would god wire you to do something and then not have you do it if you 're wired to be an anthropologist you 'll be an anthropologist if you 're wired to be an undersea explorer you 'll be an undersea explorer
  if you 're wired to make deals you make deals if you 're wired to paint  you paint did you know that god smiles when you be you  
 when my little kids when my kids were little they 're all grown now i have grandkids
 i used to go in and sit on the side of their bed and i used to watch my kids sleep  
 and i just watched their little bodies rise and lower  rise and lower and i would look at them this is not an accident
  and i got joy out of just watching them sleep 
 some people have the misguided idea that god only gets excited when you 're doing quote spiritual things like going to church or helping the poor or 
 you know  confessing or doing something like that the bottom line is god gets pleasure watching you
 be you why he made you
  when you do what you were made to do he goes that 's my boy  
 that 's my girl you 're using the talent and ability that i gave you 
 so my advice to you is  look at what 's in your hand your identity  your influence  your income
 and say it 's not about me  it 's about making the world a better place
