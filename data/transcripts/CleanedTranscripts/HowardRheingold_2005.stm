  i 'm here to enlist you
 in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things
  here is the old story we 've already heard a little bit about it  biology
 is war
 in which only the fiercest survive businesses
 and nations succeed only
 by defeating  destroying and dominating
  is about your side winning
 at all costs  
 but i think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge 
 it 's a narrative spread across
 a number of different disciplines  
  survival of the fittest shrinks just a little bit to make room  
 i started thinking about the relationship between
 communication
 media and
 collective action when i wrote smart mobs and i found that when i finished the book i kept thinking about it  
 in fact  if you look back 
 human communication media and
 the ways in which we organize
  for quite a long time humans have lived for much much longer than the approximately ten thousand years of
 settled agricultural civilization
 in small family groups  nomadic hunters bring down rabbits gathering food 
 the form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive  
 but at some point
  they banded together to hunt bigger game and we don 't know exactly how they did this although
 they must have solved some collective action problems 
 it only makes sense that you can 't hunt mastodons while you 're fighting with the other groups  
 and again we have no way of knowing but it 's clear that a new form of wealth
  wealth must have emerged more protein than a hunter 's family could eat before it rotted  
 so that raised a social question that i believe must have driven new social forms 
 did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something to the hunters and their families  and
  how did they make arrangements again we can 't know but
 we can be pretty sure that some form of symbolic communication must have been involved of
 course with agriculture came the first big civilizations  the first cities built of mud and brick the first empires  and it was the administers of these empires
 who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine
 that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks marks on clay in that time
  not too much longer after that the alphabet was invented 
 and this powerful tool was really reserved for thousands of years for the elite
  who kept track
 of accounts for the empires  and then another communication technology enabled new media the printing press came along and within decades  
 millions of people became literate  
 and from literate populations new forms of collective action emerged in in the spheres of knowledge
 and politics we saw scientific revolutions  the protestant reformation  constitutional democracies
 possible where they had not been possible before not created by the printing press  but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy  
  new forms of wealth emerged  
 now commerce is ancient  markets are as old as the crossroads  
 but capitalism as we know it is only a few hundred years old 
 enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies such as the joint stock ownership company  shared liability insurance double entry bookkeeping  
 now of course  the enabling technologies
 are based
  on the internet and in the
 era every desktop is now a printing press a broadcasting station a community
 or a marketplace  
 evolution is speeding up 
 more recently that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops  and very very quickly
  to see a significant proportion if not the majority of the human race  walking around
 holding  
 carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today  
 now when i started looking into collective action the considerable literature on it
 is based on what sociologists call social dilemmas and there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas i 'm going to
 talk briefly about two of them the prisoner 's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons  
 now when i talked about this with kevin kelly he assured me that everybody in this audience
 pretty much knows the details of the prisoner 's dilemma
  so i 'm just going to go over that very very quickly if you have more questions about it ask kevin kelly later 
 laughter the prisoner 's dilemma is actually a story that 's overlaid on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory
 in the early years of thinking about nuclear war two players who couldn 't trust each other  
 let me just say that every unsecured transaction is a good example of a prisoner 's dilemma  person with the
  goods  person with the money because they can 't trust each other are not going to exchange neither one wants to be the first one
 or they 're going to get the sucker 's payoff but both lose of course  because they don 't get what they want if they could only agree if they could only turn a prisoner 's dilemma into
 a different payoff matrix called an assurance game they could proceed
  twenty years ago robert axelrod used the prisoner 's dilemma as a probe of the biological question 
 if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors how does cooperation exist at all he started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner
  's dilemma strategies and discovered much to his surprise that a very very simple strategy won
 it won the first tournament and even after everyone knew it won 
 it won the second tournament that 's known as tit for tat 
 another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner 's dilemma is the ultimatum game
  and it 's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about
 the way people make economic transactions here 's how the game is played 
 there are two players they 've never played the game before they will not play the game again  they don 't know each other  and they are in fact  in separate rooms first player is offered a hundred dollars
 and is asked to propose a split 
  that player wants to propose the second player
 either accepts the split both
 players are paid and the game is over
 or rejects the split neither player is paid and the game is over 
 now the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it 's irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don 't know in another room is
  going to get ninety nine yet in thousands of trials with american and european and japanese students 
 a significant percentage would reject any offer that 's not close to fifty fifty  and although
 they were screened and didn 't know about the game and had never played
  to innately know this because the average proposal was surprisingly close to fifty fifty  
 now the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures
 and discovered to their surprise that
  agriculturalists in the amazon or nomadic pastoralists in central asia or a dozen different cultures each had radically
  different ideas of what is fair which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness that somehow the basis of our economic transactions transactions
 can be influenced by
 our social institutions whether we know that or not the other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons
  garrett hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s he used the
 example of a common grazing area in which each person
 by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource  he had the rather gloomy conclusion that humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource
  in which people cannot be restrained from using it  
 now elinor ostrom a political scientist in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask  which is is
 it really true that humans will always despoil commons so she went out and looked at what data she could find she looked at thousands of
 of humans sharing watersheds  forestry resources  fisheries and discovered that yes  in case after case humans
  destroyed the commons that they depended on but she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner 's dilemma
  the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner 's dilemma and she said that people are only prisoners
 if they consider themselves to be 
 they escape by creating institutions for collective action and she discovered i think most interestingly that
 among those institutions that worked  there were a number of common design principles
  and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don 't work 
 i 'm moving very quickly over a number of disciplines  in biology the notions of symbiosis  
 group selection evolutionary psychology are contested to be sure 
 but there is really no longer any major debate
 over the fact that cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role in biology from the level
 of the cell to the level of the ecology  and again our notions of individuals as economic beings
 have been overturned  rational 
  not always the dominating factor  in fact people
 will act to punish cheaters even at a cost to themselves  and most recently
  neurophysiological measures have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games
 show activity in the reward centers of their brain which led one scientist
 to declare that altruistic punishment
 may be the glue that holds societies
  i 've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media in the past have helped create new economic forms  
 commerce is ancient  markets are very old capitalism is fairly recent socialism emerged as a reaction to that 
 and yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging
  jim surowiecki briefly mentioned yochai benkler 's paper about open source  pointing to a new form of production  peer to peer production  
  i simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past new forms of cooperation enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth we may be 
  moving into yet another economic form that is significantly different from previous ones 
  businesses ibm as you know hp sun some of the most
 fierce competitors in the it world are open sourcing
 their software are providing portfolios of patents for the commons  
 eli lilly in again the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world has created a market for solutions
 for pharmaceutical problems  
 toyota  
 instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace  treats them as a network and trains them to produce better even though they are also training them 
  to produce better for their competitors now none of these companies are doing this out of
  doing it because they 're learning that a certain kind of sharing is in their 
 open source production
 has shown us that world class software  like linux and mozilla 
 can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm
 nor the incentives of the marketplace as we 've known them  google enriches itself
  by enriching thousands of bloggers through adsense 
 amazon has opened its application programming interface to sixty thousand developers  
 countless amazon shops they 're enriching others not out of altruism but as a way of enriching 
 ebay solved the prisoner 's dilemma and created a market where none would have
  existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner 's dilemma game
 into an assurance game instead of neither of us can trust each other so we have to make suboptimal moves it 's you
 prove to me that you are trustworthy and i will cooperate 
 wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia
  with a million and a half articles in two hundred languages in just a couple of years 
 we 've seen that thinkcycle has enabled
 ngos
 in developing countries
 to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world including something that 's being used for tsunami relief right now it 's a mechanism for
  rehydrating cholera victims that 's so simple to use it  illiterates can be trained to use it  
 bittorrent turns every downloader into an uploader  making the system more efficient the more it is used 
 millions of people have contributed their desktop computers when they 're not using them
 to link together through the internet into supercomputing collectives
 that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers that 's folding @ home at stanford
 to crack codes to search for life in outer space  
 i don 't think we know enough yet i don 't think we 've even begun to discover what the basic principles are but i think we can begin to think about them  
 and i don 't have enough time to talk about all of them but think about
 this is all about self interest that adds up to more 
 in el salvador both sides that withdrew from their civil war took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner 's dilemma strategy 
 in the u s in the philippines  in kenya  
 around the world citizens have
  political protests and get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and sms 
 is an apollo project of cooperation possible a transdisciplinary study of cooperation i believe
 that the payoff would be very big i think we need to begin developing maps of this territory so that we can talk about it across disciplines
  and i am not saying that understanding cooperation is going to cause us to be better people
 and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things but i will remind you that a few hundred years ago people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought 
 were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits
