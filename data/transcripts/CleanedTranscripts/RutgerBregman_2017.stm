  like to start with a simple question  why do the poor make so many poor decisions  
 i know it 's a harsh question  but take a look at the data the poor borrow more save less  smoke more
  exercise less drink more
 and eat less healthfully why 
 well  the standard explanation was once summed up by the british prime minister margaret thatcher  and she called poverty a
 personality defect 
 a lack of character  basically now  i 'm sure not many of you would be so blunt  but the idea
  idea that there 's something wrong with the poor themselves is not restricted to mrs thatcher some of you may believe that the poor should be held responsible
 for their own mistakes  and others may argue that we should help them to make better decisions  but the underlying assumption
 is the same there 's
  if we could just change them if we could just teach them how to live their lives if they would only listen 
 and to be honest this was what i thought
 for a long time  it was only a few years ago that i discovered that everything i thought i knew about poverty
 was wrong it all started when i accidentally stumbled upon a paper by a few american psychologists they had traveled eight thousand miles all the way to india
 for a fascinating study  and it was an experiment with sugarcane farmers 
 you should know that these farmers collect about sixty percent of their annual income all at once right after the harvest  
 this means that they 're relatively poor one part of the year
 and rich the other the researchers
  asked them to do an iq test before and after the harvest  what they subsequently discovered
 completely blew my mind the farmers scored much worse on the test
 before the harvest  
 the effects of living in poverty it turns out correspond to losing fourteen points of iq now  to give you an idea 
 that 's comparable to losing a night 's sleep
 or the effects of alcoholism 
  later  i heard that eldar shafir a professor at princeton university and one of the authors of this study was coming over to holland where i live 
 so we met up in amsterdam to talk about his revolutionary new theory of poverty  
 and i can sum it up in just two words 
 scarcity mentality  
 it turns out that people behave differently when they perceive a thing to be scarce  and what that thing
  is doesn 't much matter
 whether it 's not enough time money or food 
 you all know this feeling when you 've got too much to do or when you 've put off breaking for lunch and your blood sugar takes a dive
 this narrows your focus to your immediate lack
 to the sandwich you 've got to have now the meeting that 's starting in five minutes or the bills that have to be paid tomorrow  so the
  goes out the window you could compare it to a new computer
 that 's running ten heavy programs at once  it gets slower and slower making errors  eventually it freezes
 not because it 's a bad computer but because it has too much to do at once the poor
 have the same problem they 're not making dumb decisions because they are dumb  but because
  living in a context in which anyone would make dumb decisions  so suddenly
 i understood
 why so many of our anti poverty programs don 't work 
 investments in education for example are often completely ineffective poverty is not a lack of knowledge 
 a recent analysis of two hundred and one studies on the effectiveness of
  training came to the conclusion that it has almost no effect at all now don 't get me wrong
 this is not to say the poor don 't learn anything they can come out wiser for sure  
 but it 's not enough or as professor shafir told me it 's like teaching someone to swim and then throwing them
 in a stormy sea i still remember sitting there perplexed
 and it struck me that we could have figured this all out decades ago i mean these psychologists didn 't need any complicated brain scans 
 they only had to measure the farmer 's iq and iq tests were invented more than one hundred years ago 
 actually i realized i had read about the psychology of poverty before george orwell one of the greatest
  how people take it for granted they have the right to preach at you and pray over you as soon as your income falls below a certain level now those words are every bit as resonant
 today  
 the big question is of course what can be
 modern economists have a few solutions up their sleeves 
 we could help the poor with their paperwork or send them a text message to remind them to pay their bills
 this type of solution is hugely popular with modern politicians  
 mostly because  well  they cost next to nothing 
 these solutions are i think a symbol of this era in which we so often treat the symptoms  but ignore the
  underlying cause  so i wonder why don 't we just change the context
 in which the poor live  
 or going back to our computer analogy why keep tinkering around with the software when we can easily solve the problem by installing some extra memory instead
 at that point professor shafir responded with a blank look 
 and after a few seconds he said
  i get it you mean you you want to just hand out more money to the poor
 to eradicate poverty uh sure that 'd be great 
 but i 'm afraid that brand of left wing politics you 've got in amsterdam
 it doesn 't exist in the states but is this really
  i remembered reading about an old plan something that has been proposed by some of history 's leading thinkers  
 the philosopher thomas more first hinted at it in his book utopia more than five hundred years ago  
 and its proponents have spanned the spectrum from the left to the right  from the civil rights campaigner  martin luther king to the economist
 milton friedman  and it 's an incredibly simple idea basic
  income
 guarantee 
 what it is well that 's easy  
 it 's a monthly grant enough to pay for your basic needs  food  shelter education 
 it 's completely unconditional so no one 's going to tell you what you have to do for it and no one 's going to tell you what you have to do with it the basic income is not a
  there 's absolutely no stigma attached  so as i learned about the true nature of poverty  i couldn 't stop wondering  is this the idea
 we 've all been waiting for could it really be that simple 
 and in the three years that followed i read everything i could find about basic income  
 i researched the dozens of experiments that have been conducted all over the globe  and it didn 't take long before i stumbled upon a story of a town that had done it had actually eradicated poverty
 but then nearly everyone forgot about it this story starts in dauphin  canada 
 everybody in this small town was guaranteed a basic income  ensuring that no one fell below the poverty line  at the start of the experiment an army of
  for four years all went well  
 but then a new government was voted into power 
 and the new canadian cabinet saw little point to the expensive experiment 
 so when it became clear there was no money left to analyze the results the researchers decided to pack their files away
 in some two thousand boxes twenty five
  went by 
 and then evelyn forget a canadian professor found the records for three years  she subjected the data to all manner of statistical analysis  and no matter what she tried the results were the same every time 
 the experiment
 had been a resounding success 
 evelyn forget discovered that the people in dauphin had not only become richer but also smarter and healthier the school performance of kids improved substantially
  the hospitalization rate decreased by as much as eight point five percent 
 domestic violence incidents were down as were mental health complaints  
 and people didn 't quit their jobs the only ones who worked a little less were new mothers and students
 who stayed in school longer  similar results have since been found in countless other experiments around the globe from the us
 to india
 so 
 here 's what i 've learned 
 when it comes to poverty  we the rich should stop pretending we know best 
 we should stop sending shoes and teddy bears to the poor to people we have never met 
 and we should get rid of the vast industry of paternalistic bureaucrats when we could simply hand over their salaries to the poor they 're supposed to help
 i mean the great thing about money is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that self appointed experts think they need
  just imagine how many brilliant scientists and entrepreneurs and writers like george orwell are now withering away in
  imagine how much energy and talent we would unleash if we got rid of poverty once and for all  i believe that a basic income would work like venture capital for the people 
 and we we can 't afford not to do it because poverty is hugely expensive 
 just look at the cost of child poverty in the us for example  
 it 's estimated at five hundred billion dollars each year in terms of higher health care spending  higher dropout rates and more crime
  this is an incredible waste of human potential  
 but let 's talk about the elephant in the room 
 how could we ever afford a basic income guarantee 
 well it 's actually a lot cheaper than you may think 
 what they did in dauphin is finance it with a negative income tax this means that your income is topped up as soon as you fall below the poverty line  and in that scenario
  to our economists ' best estimates for a net cost of one hundred and seventy five billion a quarter of us military spending one percent of gdp
 you could lift all impoverished americans above the poverty line  you could actually
 eradicate poverty  now  that should be our goal the time for small thoughts and little nudges is
  believe that the time has come for radical new ideas  and basic income is so much more than just another policy  it is also a complete rethink of what work actually is  
 and in that sense  
 it will not only free the poor 
 but also the rest of us 
 nowadays  millions of people feel that their jobs have little meaning or significance a recent poll among two hundred and thirty thousand
  employees in one hundred and forty two countries found that only thirteen percent of workers actually like their job 
 and another poll found that as much as thirty seven percent of british workers have a job that they think doesn 't even need to exist it
 's like brad pitt says in fight club too often we 're working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don 't need
  i 'm not talking about the teachers and the garbagemen and the care workers here if they stopped working we 'd be in trouble
  i 'm talking about all those well paid professionals with excellent rsums who earn their money doing  
 strategic  transactor peer to peer meetings while brainstorming the value add on of disruptive co creation in the network society 
 or something like that just imagine again how much
 talent we 're wasting simply because we tell our kids they 'll have to earn a living 
 or think of what a math whiz working at facebook lamented a few years ago 
 the best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads 
 i 'm a historian and if history teaches
  it is that things could be different 
 there is nothing inevitable about the way we structured our society and economy right now  ideas can and do change the world 
 and i think that especially in the past few years it has become abundantly clear that we cannot stick to the status quo that we need new ideas  
 i know that many of you may feel pessimistic
 about a future of rising inequality xenophobia and climate change but it 's not enough to know
  we 're against we also need to be for something martin luther king didn 't say i have a nightmare 
 he had a dream so 
 here 's my dream  
 i believe in a future where the value of your work is not determined by the size of your paycheck  
 but by the amount of happiness you spread and the amount of meaning you give  
 i believe in a future
  where the point of education is not to prepare you for another useless job but for a life well lived 
 i believe in a future where an existence without poverty is not a privilege but a right we all deserve  so here we are 
 here we are we 've got the research we 've got the evidence and we 've got the means now  more than five hundred
  years after thomas more first wrote about a basic income and one hundred years after george orwell discovered the true nature of poverty  we all need to change our worldview 
 because poverty
 is not a lack of character poverty is a lack of cash
