  father daniel berrigan once said that writing about prisoners is a little like writing about the dead 
 i think what he meant is that we treat prisoners as ghosts  they 're unseen and unheard
  it 's easy to simply ignore them and it 's even easier when the government goes to great lengths to keep them hidden 
 as a journalist i think these stories of what people in power do when no one is watching are precisely the stories that we need to tell 
 that 's why i began investigating the most secretive and experimental prison units in the united states for
  prisoners and guards call them little guantanamo 
 they are islands unto themselves  
 but unlike gitmo they exist right here at home  floating within larger federal prisons 
 one was opened inside the prison in terre haute indiana and the other is inside this prison in marion illinois  neither of them underwent the
  formal review process that is required by law when they were opened 
 cmu prisoners have all been convicted of crimes some of their cases are questionable and some involve threats and violence  
 i 'm not here to argue the guilt or innocence of any prisoner 
 i 'm here because as supreme court justice thurgood marshall said when the prisons and gates slam shut prisoners do not lose their human quality
 every prisoner i 've interviewed has said there are three flecks of light in the darkness of prison 
 phone calls letters and visits from family
 cmus aren 't solitary confinement but they radically restrict all of these to levels that meet or exceed the most extreme prisons in the united states  
 their phone calls can be limited to
  to the three hundred minutes other prisoners receive 
 their letters can be limited to six pieces of paper 
 their visits can be limited to four hours per month compared to the
 thirty five hours that people like olympic park bomber eric rudolph receive in the supermax 
 on top of that cmu visits are
  which means prisoners are not allowed to even hug their family  
 as one cmu prisoner said we 're not being tortured here  except psychologically 
 the government won 't say who is imprisoned here  
 but through court documents open records requests and interviews with current and former prisoners  some small windows into the cmus have opened
  there 's an estimated sixty to seventy prisoners here  and they 're overwhelmingly muslim they include people like
 who violated the economic sanctions on iraq by sending medical supplies for the children there 
 they 've included people like yassin aref 
 aref and his family fled to new york from saddam hussein 's iraq as refugees he was arrested in two thousand and four as part of an fbi sting
  is an imam
 and he was asked to bear witness to a loan which is a tradition in islamic culture 
 it turned out that one of the people involved in the loan was trying to enlist someone else in a fake attack 
 aref didn 't know 
 for that he was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist group
  meaning they help balance out the racial numbers in hopes of deflecting law suits 
 these balancers include animal rights and environmental activists like daniel mcgowan 
 mcgowan was convicted of participating in two arsons in the name of defending the environment as part of the earth liberation
  during his sentencing he was afraid that he would be sent to a rumored secret prison for terrorists  
 the judge dismissed all those fears saying that they weren 't supported by any facts  
 but that might be because the government hasn 't fully explained why some prisoners end up in a cmu and who is responsible for these decisions 
 when mcgowan was transferred he was told it 's because
  a term the fbi uses repeatedly when talking about environmental activists 
 now keep in mind there are about four hundred prisoners in us prisons who are classified as terrorists  and only a handful of them are in the cmus 
 in mcgowan 's case he was previously at a low security prison
 and he had no communications violations  
 so why was he moved like other cmu prisoners mcgowan repeatedly
  asked for an answer a hearing or some opportunity for an appeal 
 this example from another prisoner shows how those requests are viewed wants a transfer told him no at
 one point the prison warden himself recommended mcgowan 's transfer out of the cmu citing his good behavior  
 but the warden was overruled by the bureau of
  counterterrorism unit working with the joint terrorism task force of the fbi 
 later i found out that mcgowan was really sent to a cmu not because of what he did but what he has said 
 a memo from the counterterrorism unit cited mcgowan 's
  beliefs while imprisoned he continued writing
  about environmental issues saying that activists must reflect on their mistakes and listen to each other 
 now  in fairness if you 've spent any time at all in washington dc you know this is really a radical
 concept for the government 
 i actually asked to visit mcgowan in the cmu and i was approved 
 that came as quite a shock first because
 as i 've discussed on this stage before i
  that the fbi has been monitoring my work  second because it would make me the first and only journalist to visit a cmu  
 i had even learned through the bureau of prisons counterterrorism unit 
 that they had been monitoring my speeches about cmus like this one  
 so how could i possibly be approved to visit 
 a few days before i went out to the
  prison i got an answer 
 i was allowed to visit mcgowan as a friend not a journalist journalists are not allowed here 
 mcgowan was told by cmu officials that if i asked any questions or published any story that he would be punished for my reporting 
 when i arrived for our visit the guards reminded me that they knew who i was and knew about my work  and they said that if i
  to interview mcgowan the visit would be terminated 
 the bureau of prisons describes cmus as
 housing units but i think that 's an orwellian way of describing black holes  
 when you visit a cmu you go through all the security checkpoints that you would expect  but then the walk to the
  when a cmu prisoner has a visit  the rest of the prison is on lockdown 
 i was ushered into a small room  so small my outstretched arms could touch each wall 
 there was a  grapefruit sized orb in the ceiling for the visit to be live monitored by the counterterrorism unit in west virginia  
 the unit insists that all the visits have to be in english for cmu prisoners which is an additional hardship for many of the muslim families
 there is a thick sheet of foggy  bulletproof glass and on the other side was daniel mcgowan 
 we spoke through these handsets attached to the wall and talked about books and movies we did our best to find reasons to laugh 
 to fight boredom and amuse himself while in the cmu mcgowan had been spreading a rumor that i was secretly the president of a twilight
  fan club in washington dc 
 for the record  i 'm not but
 i kind of the hope the fbi now thinks that bella and edward are terrorist code names 
 during our visit mcgowan spoke most and at length about his niece lily his wife jenny
  and how torturous it feels to never be able to hug them to never be able to hold their hands 
 three months after our visit mcgowan was transferred out of the cmu and then without warning he was sent back again  
 i had published leaked cmu documents on my website and the counterterrorism unit said that mcgowan had called his wife and asked her to mail
 he wanted to see what the government was saying about him and for that he was sent back to the cmu 
 when he was finally released at the end of his sentence his story got even more kafkaesque 
 he wrote an article for the huffington post headlined court documents prove i was sent to a cmu for my political speech 
 the next day he was thrown back in jail
 for his political speech
 his attorneys quickly secured his release but the message was very clear don 't talk about this place  
 today  nine years after they were opened by the bush administration the government is codifying how and why cmus were created  
 according to the bureau of prisons they are for prisoners with
  very nice way of saying these are political prisons for political prisoners  
 prisoners are sent to a cmu because of their race their religion or their political beliefs  
 now if you think that characterization is too strong just look at some of the government 's own documents when some of mcgowan 's mail was rejected by the
  the sender was told it 's because the letters were intended for political prisoners 
 when another prisoner animal rights activist andy stepanian was sent to a cmu it was because of his 
  and  anti corporate views  
 now  i know all of this may be hard to believe that it 's happening right now  and in the united states  
 but the unknown reality is that the us has a dark history of disproportionately punishing people
 because of their political beliefs  in the 
 before marion was home to the cmu it was home to the notorious control unit 
 prisoners were locked down in solitary for twenty two hours a day the warden said the unit was to control revolutionary
  another experiment called the lexington high security unit held women connected to the weather underground black liberation and puerto rican independent struggles 
 the prison radically restricted communication and used sleep deprivation and constant light for so called ideological conversion 
 those prisons were eventually
  only through the campaigning of religious groups and human rights advocates like amnesty international  
 today civil rights lawyers with the center for constitutional rights are challenging cmus in court
 for depriving prisoners of their due process rights and for retaliating against them for their protected political and religious speech  
 many of these documents would have never
  to light without this lawsuit the message of these groups
 and my message for you today
 is that we must bear witness to what is being done to these prisoners  their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls 
 this story is not just about prisoners it is about us it is about our own commitment to human rights it is about whether we will choose to stop repeating the mistakes of our past
  if we don 't listen to what father berrigan described as the stories of the dead they will soon become the stories of ourselves  thank you
  constitution  freedom of speech  due process
 and about twenty five other laws and rights that seem to be violated by this 
 how could this possibly be happening will potter i think that 's the number one question i get
 throughout all of my work  and the short answer is that people don 't know  
 i think the solution to any of these types of situations any rights abuses
  really dependent on two things they 're dependent on knowledge that it 's actually happening and then a means and and efficacy to actually make a change  and unfortunately with these prisoners  
 one people don 't know what 's happening at all
 and then they 're already disenfranchised populations who don 't have access to attorneys not native english speakers 
 in some of these cases they have great representation that i mentioned but
 there 's just not a public
  awareness of what 's happening tr 
 isn 't it guaranteed in prison that you have right to council or access to council wp there 's a tendency in our culture to see when people have been convicted of a crime 
 no matter if that charge was bogus or legitimate that whatever happens to them after that is warranted  and i think that 's a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have that allows
 these types of things to happen  as the general public just kind of turns a
  eye to it tr all those documents
 on screen were all real documents word for word  unchanged at all right wp absolutely  i 've actually uploaded all of them to my website
 cmu
 and it 's a footnoted version of the talk  so you can see the documents for yourself
 without the little snippets you can see the full version i relied overwhelmingly on primary source documents or on primary
  interviews with former and current prisoners with people that are dealing with this situation every day and like i said i 've been there myself as well tr 
 you 're doing courageous work wp thank you very much  thank you
