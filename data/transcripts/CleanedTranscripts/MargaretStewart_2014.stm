  what do you think of when i say the word design 
 you probably think of things like this finely crafted objects that you can hold in your hand or maybe logos and posters and maps that visually explain things classic icons of timeless design
 but i 'm not here to talk about that kind of design i want to talk about the kind that you probably use every day and may not give much thought to 
 designs that change all the time and that live inside your pocket 
 i 'm talking about the design of digital experiences and specifically
 the design of systems that are so big that their scale can be hard to comprehend  consider the fact that google
  processes over one billion search queries every day 
 that every minute over one hundred hours of footage are uploaded to youtube that 's more in a single day than all three major u s networks broadcast in the last five years combined  
 and facebook transmitting the photos messages and stories of over one point two three billion people that 's almost half of the internet
  population and a sixth of humanity 
 these are some of the products that i 've helped design over the course of my career and their scale is so massive that they 've produced unprecedented design challenges  
 but what is really hard about designing at scale is this it
 's hard in part because it requires a combination of two things audacity and humility
 audacity to believe that the thing that you 're making is something that the entire world wants and needs 
 and humility to understand that as a designer it 's not about you or your portfolio  it 's about the people that you 're designing for and how your work just might help them live better lives  
  there 's no school that offers the course designing for humanity one hundred and one 
 i and the other designers who work on these kinds of products have had to invent it as we go along  and we are teaching ourselves the emerging best practices of designing at scale  
 and today i 'd like share some of the things that we 've learned over the years 
 now the first thing that you need to know about designing at scale is that the little things really matter here 's a really good example of how a very
  tiny design element can make a big impact  the team at facebook that manages the facebook like button
 decided that it needed to be redesigned the button had kind of gotten out of sync with the evolution of our brand and it needed to be modernized 
 now you might think well it 's a tiny little button it probably is a pretty straightforward
  turns out there were all kinds of constraints for the design of this button 
 you had to work within specific height and width parameters you had to be careful to make it work in a bunch of different languages and be careful about using fancy gradients or 
  borders because it has to degrade gracefully in old web browsers the truth is designing this tiny little button was a huge
 pain in the butt  
 now this is the new version of the button 
 and the designer who led this project estimates that he spent over two hundred and eighty hours redesigning this button
 over the course of months  now  why would we spend so much time on something so small 
 it 's because when you 're designing at scale there 's no such thing as a small detail 
 this innocent little button is seen on
  billion times a day and on over seven point five million websites  
 it 's one of the single most viewed design elements ever created 
 now that 's a lot of pressure for a little button and the designer behind it but with these kinds of products you need to get even the tiny things right  
 now the next thing that you need to understand is how to design with data  now when you 're working
  on products like this you have incredible amounts of information about how people are using your product that you can then use to influence your design decisions  
 but it 's not just as simple as following the numbers  let me give you an example so that you can understand what i mean 
 facebook has had a tool for a long time that allowed people to report photos that may be in violation of our community standards things like spam and abuse  
 and there were a ton of photos reported but as it turns out  only a small percentage were
  actually in violation of those community standards most of them were just your typical party photo now to give you a specific hypothetical example  let 's say my friend laura 
 hypothetically uploads a picture of me from a drunken night of karaoke 
  you know how some people are kind of worried that their boss or employee is going to discover embarrassing photos of them on facebook 
 do you know how hard that is to avoid when you actually work at facebook
  so anyway there are lots of these photos being erroneously reported as spam and abuse  and one of the engineers on the team had a hunch he really thought there was something else going on and he was
  because when he looked through a bunch of the cases he found that most of them were from people who were requesting the takedown of a photo of themselves  now this was a scenario 
  that the team never even took into account before  so they added a new feature that allowed people to message their friend to ask them to take the photo down  
 they even studied the universal principles of polite language  which i didn 't even actually know existed until this research happened 
 and they found something really interesting 
 they had to go beyond just helping people ask their friend to take the photo down they had to help people express to their friend how the photo made them feel  
  here 's how the experience works today  so i find this hypothetical photo of myself  and it 's not spam  it 's not abuse  but i really wish it weren 't on the site  
 so i report it and i say i 'm in this photo and i don 't like it 
 and then we dig deeper  
 why don 't you like this photo of yourself  and i select it 's embarrassing 
  i 'm encouraged to message my friend but here 's the critical difference i 'm provided specific suggested language that helps me communicate to laura how the photo makes me feel  
 now the team found that this relatively small change had a huge impact 
 before only twenty percent of people were sending the message and now sixty percent were 
 and surveys showed that people on both sides of the conversation felt better as a result that same survey showed that
 ninety percent of your friends want to know if they 've done something to upset you now i don 't
 know who the other ten percent are but maybe that 's where our unfriend feature can come in handy  
 so as you can see  these decisions are highly nuanced of course we use a lot of data to inform our decisions  but we also rely very heavily
  it 's both art and science  now  sometimes the designers who work on these products are called data driven which is a term that totally drives us bonkers 
 the fact is it would be irresponsible of us not to rigorously test our designs when so many people are counting on us to get it right  but
 data analytics will never be a substitute for design intuition data can help you
  make a good design great  but it will never made a bad design good 
 the next thing that you need to understand as a principle is that when you introduce change you need to do it extraordinarily carefully  now i often have joked that i spend almost 
  as much time designing the introduction of change as i do the change itself
  and i 'm sure that we can all relate to that when something that we use a lot changes and then we have to adjust 
 the fact is people can become very efficient at using bad design 
 and so even if the change is good for them in the long run  it 's still incredibly frustrating when it happens and this is particularly true with user generated content platforms because people can rightfully claim a sense of
  years ago when i was working at youtube we were looking for ways to encourage more people to rate videos  and it was interesting because when we looked into the data we found that almost everyone was exclusively using the highest five star rating 
 a handful of people were using the lowest one star and virtually no one was using two three or four stars  
 so we decided to simplify into an
  kind of voting binary model it 's going to be much easier for people to engage with but
 people were very attached to the five star rating system  video creators really loved their ratings millions and millions of people were accustomed to the old design so in order to help people prepare themselves for change and acclimate to the new design
  we actually published the data graph sharing with the community the rationale for what we were going to do 
 and it even engaged the larger industry in a conversation which resulted in my favorite techcrunch headline of all time 
 youtube comes to a 5 star realization  its ratings are useless 
 now  it 's impossible to completely avoid change aversion when you 're making changes to products that so many people use even though we tried to do all the right things
  we still received our customary flood of video protests and angry emails and even a package that had to be scanned by security  
 but we have to remember people care intensely about this stuff  and it 's because these products this work really really matters to them 
 now 
 we know that we have to be careful about paying attention to the details we have to be cognizant about how we use data in our design process  and we have to introduce change very very carefully  
 now these things are all really useful they 're good best practices for designing at scale  but they don 't mean anything if you don 't understand something much more fundamental  
 you have to understand who you are
  when you set a goal to design for the entire human race  and you start to engage in that goal in earnest 
 at some point you run into the walls of the bubble that you 're living in 
 now in san francisco we get a little miffed when we hit a dead cell zone because we can 't use our phones to navigate to the new hipster coffee shop  
 but what if you had to drive four hours to charge your phone because you had no reliable source of electricity what if you had no
  access to public libraries what if your country had no free press what would these products start to mean to you 
 this is what google youtube and facebook look like to most of the world  and it 's what they 'll look like to most of the next five billion people to come online 
 designing for low end cell
  is not glamorous design work but if you want to design for the whole world  you have to design for where people are and not where you are 
 so how do we keep this big big picture in mind we try to travel outside of our bubble to see hear and understand the people we 're designing for we use our products 
  in non english languages to make sure that they work just as well  and we try to use one of these phones from time to time to keep in touch with their reality  
  design at a global scale  it means difficult and sometimes exasperating work to try to improve and evolve products 
 finding the audacity and the humility to do right by them can be pretty exhausting  and the humility part it 's a little tough on the design ego 
 because these products are always changing
