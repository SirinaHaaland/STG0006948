  i got up this morning at six ten
 a m after going to sleep at twelve  forty five a m i was awakened once during the night my heart rate was  sixty one beats per minute my blood pressure
  rate during exercise wasn 't calculated i had about six hundred milligrams of caffeine zero of alcohol and my score on the narcissism personality index or the 
  is a reassuring zero point three one 
 we know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise manage govern  search i 'm going to talk about how they 're useful when we reflect
 and want to improve a few years ago kevin kelly my partner and i
 noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self tracking that went far beyond the ordinary familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day 
 people were
 tracking their food via twitter their kids ' diapers
  on their iphone they were making detailed journals of their spending their mood their symptoms their treatments 
 now  we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle the
 uptake and diffusion of mobile devices the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing 
 and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors  this
 little black dot there is a 3d accelerometer it tracks your movement through
  space 
 it is as you can see very small and also very cheap they 're now down to well under a dollar a piece and they 're going into all kinds of devices but what 's interesting is
 the incredible detailed information that you can get
 from just one sensor like this this kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device among early adopters at the moment the fitbit this tracks
  your activity and also your sleep it has just that sensor in it you 're probably familiar with the nike + system i just put it up because that little blue dot
 is the sensor it 's really just a pressure sensor like the kind that 's in
 a doorbell and nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor
 this is the
 strap that people use to transmit
 heart rate data to their nike + system  this is a beautiful new
 device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data not just whether you 're asleep or awake but also your phase of sleep deep sleep light sleep rem sleep 
 the sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there the rest of it is the bedside console
  just for reference this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago i mean really
 until now
  this is the sleep tracking system of today this just was presented at a health care conference in d c most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler  
 but the top is a very small gps transceiver which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident  
 giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors
  now  we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world
 these tiny sensors that gather data in nature the ubiquitous computing that allows that data to be
 understood and used and of course the social networks that allow people to collaborate and contribute
  but we think of these tools as pointing outward as
 windows
 and i 'd just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward
 and becoming mirrors  so that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement we also think about how they can be useful for
  apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation heart rate and body temperature via the earbuds  
 what is this for  
 what should it be for  some people will say it 's for biometric security some people will say it 's for public health research some people will say it 's for 
  avant garde marketing research  
 i 'd like to tell you that it 's also for
 and the self isn 't the only thing it 's not even most things the self is just our operation center 
 our consciousness  our moral compass  
 so if we want to act more effectively in the world we have to get to know ourselves better
