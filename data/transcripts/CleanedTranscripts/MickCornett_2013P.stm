  how many of you have not been to oklahoma city and have no idea who i am  
 most of you let me give you a little bit of background 
  oklahoma city started in the most unique way imaginable back on a spring day in one thousand eight hundred and eighty nine the federal government held what they called a land run 
 they literally lined up the settlers along an imaginary line  and they fired off a gun  and the settlers roared across the countryside and put down a stake  
 and wherever they put down that stake that was their new home  
 and at the end of the very first day  the population of oklahoma city had gone from zero to ten thousand
  and our planning department is still paying for that 
 the citizens got together on that first day and elected a mayor  and then they shot him 
 that 's not really all that funny
  but it allows me to see what type of audience i 'm dealing with so i
 appreciate the feedback 
 the  20th century was fairly kind to oklahoma city our economy was based on commodities so the price of cotton or the price of wheat 
 and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas 
 and along the way we became a city of innovation  
 the shopping cart was
  parking meter invented in oklahoma city  you 're welcome
  having an economy though that relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs and that was certainly the case in oklahoma city 's history 
  when it appeared that the price of energy would never retreat our economy was soaring  and then in the early
 1980s it cratered quickly 
 the price of energy dropped  our banks began to fail before the end of the decade one hundred banks had failed in the state of oklahoma 
 there was no bailout on the horizon  
 our banking industry  our oil and gas industry  our commercial real estate industry were all
  at the bottom of the economic scale  
 young people were leaving oklahoma city in droves for washington and dallas and houston and new york and tokyo  anywhere where they could find a job that measured up to their educational attainment because in oklahoma city the good jobs just weren 't there  
 but along at the end of the ' 80s came an enterprising businessman who became mayor named ron 
  norick eventually figured out that the secret to economic development wasn 't incentivizing companies up front it was about creating a place where businesses
  to locate and so he pushed an initiative called maps
 that basically was a penny on the dollar sales tax to build a bunch of stuff it built a new sports arena 
 a new canal downtown it fixed up our performing arts center 
 a new baseball stadium downtown a lot of things to improve the quality of life and the economy indeed seemed to start showing some signs of life the next mayor came
  along 
 he started maps for kids  rebuilt the entire inner city school system all seventy five buildings either built anew or refurbished  
 and then in two thousand and four in this rare
 collective lack of judgment
 bordering on civil disobedience
  the citizens elected me mayor now the city i inherited
 was just on the verge of coming out of its slumbering economy  
 and for the very first time we started showing up on the lists 
 now you know the lists i 'm talking about the media and the internet love to rank cities 
 and in oklahoma
  never really been on lists before 
 so i thought it was kind of cool when they came out with these positive lists and we were on there we weren 't anywhere close to the top but we were on the list we were somebody  
 best city to get a job  best city to start a business  best downtown
 oklahoma city  and then
 came the list
 of the most obese cities in the country
  there we were now i like to point out that we were on that list with a lot of really cool places 
 dallas and houston and new orleans and atlanta and miami you know these are cities that typically you 're not embarrassed to be associated with 
 but nonetheless  i didn 't like being on the list 
 and about that time  i got on the scales
  scales  
 and i weighed two hundred and twenty pounds  and then i went to this website sponsored by the federal government  and i typed in my height i typed in my weight
 and i pushed enter  and it came back and said
  obese 
 and then i started getting honest with myself about what had become my lifelong struggle with obesity  
 and i noticed this pattern 
 that i was gaining about two or three pounds a year  and then about every ten years i 'd drop twenty or thirty pounds  
 and then i 'd do it again  and i had this huge closet full of clothes  and i could only wear a third of it at any one time
  and only i knew which part of the closet i could wear but it all seemed fairly normal going through it  
 well  
 i finally decided i needed to lose weight and i knew i could because i 'd done it so many times before so i simply stopped eating as much i had always exercised that really wasn 't the part of the equation that i needed to work on 
 but i had been eating three thousand calories a day
 and i cut it to two thousand calories a day and the weight came off i lost about a pound a week for about forty weeks 
 along the way though  i started examining my city  
 its culture  its infrastructure  trying to figure out why our specific city seemed to have a problem with obesity
  and i came to the conclusion that we had built an incredible quality of life if you happen to be a car 
 laughter but if you happen to be a person you are combatting the car seemingly at every
  no traffic congestion in oklahoma city to speak of 
 and so people live far far away  our city limits are enormous  six hundred and twenty square miles but fifteen miles is less than fifteen minutes 
 you literally can get a speeding ticket during rush hour in oklahoma city  
 and as a result people tend to spread out land 's cheap
 we had also not required developers to build sidewalks on new developments for a long long time we had fixed that but it had been relatively recently and there were
 literally one hundred thousand or more homes into our inventory in neighborhoods that had virtually no level of walkability
  how we might deal with obesity and was taking all of these elements into my mind i decided that the first thing we need to do
 was have a conversation you see in oklahoma city  we weren 't talking about obesity  and so 
 on new year 's eve of two thousand and seven i went to the zoo  
 and i stood in front of the elephants  and i said
  city is going on a diet  and we 're going to lose a million pounds well that 's when all hell broke loose 
 the national media gravitated toward this story immediately  
 and they really could have gone with it one of two ways
  they could have said this city is so fat
 that the mayor had to put them on a diet 
 but fortunately  the consensus was look this is a problem in a lot of places this is a city that 's wanting to do something about it 
 and so they started helping us drive traffic to the website  now the web address was
  weekday morning to talk about the the initiative and on that day one hundred and fifty thousand visits were placed to our website people were signing up  
 and so the pounds started to add up and the conversation that i thought was so important to have was starting to take place it was taking place inside the
  mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids  it was taking place in churches 
 churches were starting their own running groups and their own support groups for people who were dealing with obesity  
 suddenly it was a topic worth discussing at schools and in the workplace  and the large companies they typically have wonderful wellness programs but the medium sized companies that typically fall between the cracks on issues like
  they started to get engaged and used our program as a model for their own employees to try and have contests to see who might be able to
 deal with their obesity situation in a way that could be proactively beneficial to others
  and then came the next stage of the equation 
 it was time to push what i called maps three now maps three
  like the other two programs had had an economic development motive behind it 
 but along with the traditional economic development tasks like building a new convention center  we added some health related infrastructure to the process  
 we added a new central park seventy acres in size to be right downtown in oklahoma city  
 we 're building a downtown streetcar to try and help the walkability formula for people who choose to live in the inner city and help us create the density there
  and wellness centers throughout the community
  we put some investments on the river that had originally been invested upon in the original maps and now we are currently in the final stages of developing the finest venue in the world for the sports of canoe kayak and rowing  
 we hosted the olympic trials last spring we have olympic caliber events coming to
  athletes from all over the world moving in 
 along with inner city programs to get kids more engaged in these types of of recreational activities that are a little bit nontraditional  
 we also with another initiative that was passed are building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks throughout the metro area we
 're even going back into some inner city situations where we had built neighborhoods and we had built schools but we had not connected the two
 we had built libraries and we had built neighborhoods  but we had never really connected the two with any sort of walkability  
 through yet another funding source we 're redesigning all of our inner city streets to be more pedestrian friendly our streets were really wide  
  and you 'd push the button to allow you to walk across  and you had to run in order to get there in time  
  really a redesign rethinking the way we build our infrastructure designing a city around people and not cars  
 we 're completing our bicycle trail master plan we 'll have over one hundred miles when we 're
 through building it out  and so you see this culture starting to shift in oklahoma city  and lo and behold the demographic
  changes that are coming with it are very inspiring  
 highly educated twentysomethings are moving to oklahoma city from all over the region and indeed even from further away in california 
 when we reached a million pounds in january of two thousand and twelve  i flew to new york with some
  participants who had lost over one hundred pounds whose lives had been changed  
 and we appeared on the rachael ray show  and then that afternoon i did a round of media in new york pushing
 the same messages that you 're accustomed to hearing about obesity and the dangers of it  
 and i went into the lobby of men 's fitness magazine 
 the same magazine that had put us on that list
  five years before  
 and as i 'm sitting in the lobby waiting to talk to the reporter  i notice there 's a magazine copy of the current issue right there on the table  
 and i pick it up and i look at the headline across the top and it says america 's fattest cities do you live in one 
 well  i knew i did so i picked up the magazine and i began to look  
 and we weren 't on it
 then i looked on the list of fittest cities  and we were on that list 
 we were on the list as the  22nd fittest city in the united states  our state health statistics are doing better  
 granted  we have a long way to go health is still not something that we should be proud of in oklahoma city but we seem to have turned the
  cultural shift
 of making health a greater priority  
 and we love the idea of the demographics of highly educated twentysomethings people with choices choosing oklahoma city in large numbers  
 we have the lowest unemployment in the united states  probably the strongest economy in the united states  
 and if you 're like me at some point in your educational career you were asked to read a book called the grapes of wrath
 oklahomans leaving for california in large numbers for a better future 
 when we look at the demographic shifts of people coming from the west it appears that what we 're seeing now is the wrath of grapes 
 the grandchildren are coming home
  you 've been a great audience and very attentive thank you very much for having
