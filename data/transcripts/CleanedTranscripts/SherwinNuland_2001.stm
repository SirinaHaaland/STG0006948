  like to do pretty much what i did the first time which is to choose a light hearted theme last time i talked about death and dying 
 this time i 'm going to talk about mental illness  
 but it has to be technological so i 'll talk about electroshock therapy
 you know ever since man had any notion that some of his other people his colleagues 
 could be different could be strange could be severely depressed or what we now recognize as schizophrenia  
 he was certain that this kind of illness had to come from evil spirits getting into the body so the way of treating
  these diseases in early times was to in some way or other exorcise those evil spirits and this is still going on as you know
  but it wasn 't enough to use the priests when medicine became somewhat scientific  
 in about four hundred and fifty bc with hippocrates and those boys they tried to look for herbs plants
 that would literally shake the bad spirits out so they found
  certain plants that could cause convulsions and the herbals the botanical books of up to the late middle ages the renaissance
 are filled with prescriptions for causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out 
 finally in about the sixteenth century a physician whose name was theophrastus
  bombastus aureolus von hohenheim called paracelsus a name probably familiar to some people here 
 good old paracelsus
 found that he could predict the degree of convulsion by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion can you imagine
  your closet pulling out a mothball and chewing on it if you 're feeling depressed it 's better than prozac but i wouldn 't recommend it 
 so what we see in the seventeenth eighteenth century is the continued search for medications other than camphor that 'll do the trick  
 well along comes benjamin franklin and he comes close to convulsing himself with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite  and so people
  italian psychiatrists 
 who were largely treating depression began to notice among their patients who were also epileptics that if they had an epileptic a series of epileptic fits a lot of them in a row the depression would very frequently lift not only would it
  we 've got electricity we 'll plug somebody into the wall that always makes
 hair stand up and people shake a lot so they tried it on a few pigs and none of the pigs were killed  
 so they went to the police and they said we know that at the rome railroad station there are all these lost souls wandering around muttering gibberish can you bring one of them to us
 someone who is as the italians say cagoots 
 so they found this cagoots guy a 39 year old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic who was known had been known for months 
 to be
 literally defecating on himself talking nothing that made any sense and they brought him into the hospital  
 so these three psychiatrists after about two or three weeks of observation  laid him down
 on a table connected his temples
 to a very small source of current they thought well we 'll
 try fifty five volts two tenths of a second that 's not going to do anything terrible to him so they did that 
 well i have the following from a firsthand observer who told me this about thirty five
  i was thinking about these things
 for some research project of mine 
 he said this fellow 
 remember he wasn 't even put to sleep 
 after this major grand mal convulsion sat right up 
 looked at these three fellas and said ' what the fuck are you assholes trying to do ' 
 if i could only say that in italian
  well  they were happy as could be because he hadn 't said a rational word in the weeks of observation  
 so they they plugged him in again and this time they used
 one hundred and ten volts for half a second 
 and to their amazement  after it was over he began speaking like he was perfectly well he relapsed a little bit they gave him a series of treatments
  and he was essentially cured but of course having schizophrenia  within a few months it returned
  but they wrote a paper about this and everybody in the western world began using electricity to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed 
  it didn 't work very well on the schizophrenics  but it was pretty clear in the ' 30s and by the middle of the
  therapy was very very effective in the treatment of depression and of course in those days there were no antidepressant drugs and it became very very popular
 they would anesthetize people 
 convulse them but the real difficulty was that there was no way to paralyze muscles so people would have a real grand mal seizure  
 bones were broken especially in old fragile people
  couldn 't use it 
 and then in the 1950s late 1950s the so called muscle relaxants were developed by pharmacologists  and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion an electroencephalographic convulsion you could see it on the brain waves
 without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes
  the first antidepressants came out tofranil was the first in the late 
 there were others and they were very effective and patients ' rights groups seemed to get very upset about the kinds of things that they would witness and so the whole idea of electroconvulsive electroshock therapy
 disappeared
  but has had a renaissance in the last ten years  and the reason that it has had a renaissance is that
 probably about ten percent of the people severe depressives do not respond regardless of what is done for them now
 why am i telling you this story at this meeting  i 'm telling you this story because actually ever since richard called
  me and asked me to talk about
 to talk about something
 that would be new to this audience that we had never talked about never written about i 've been planning this moment 
 this reason really is that i am a man who almost thirty years ago had his life saved
 by two long courses of electroshock
  therapy and let me tell you this story  i was
 in a marriage to use the word bad would be perhaps the understatement of the year  it was dreadful
  there are i 'm sure enough divorced people in this room to know about
  who knows what being someone who had had a very difficult childhood a very difficult adolescence it had to do
 with not quite poverty but close it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke
 english no one could read or write english it had to do with death and disease and lots of other things i was a little prone to depression
  as things got worse as we really began to hate each other  i became progressively depressed over a period of a couple of years  trying to save this marriage  
 which was inevitably not to be saved
  finally  
 i would schedule
 all my major surgical cases i was scheduling them for twelve one o 'clock in the afternoon because i couldn 't get out of bed before about eleven o 'clock and anybody who 's been depressed here
  knows what that 's like 
 i couldn 't even pull the covers off myself well you 're in a university medical center where everybody knows everybody and it 's perfectly clear to my colleagues 
 so my referrals began to decrease as my referrals began to decrease  i clearly became increasingly
 depressed until i thought my god
 i can 't work anymore and in fact it didn 't make any difference because i didn 't have any patients anymore 
 so 
 with the advice of my physician 
 i had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital 
 and my colleagues who had known me since medical school in that place said don 't worry chap six weeks you 're back in the operating room everything 's going to be great 
 well you know what bovine stercus is 
 that proved to be a lot of bovine stercus
 i know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that 
 so i was one of their failures  but it wasn 't that simple because by the time i got out of
  was not functional at all i could hardly see five feet in front of myself 
 i shuffled when i walked i was bowed over  i rarely bathed i sometimes didn 't shave it was dreadful  
 and it was clear not to me because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore
 that i would need long term hospitalization
 in that
  to the institute of living which used to be called the hartford retreat it was founded in the eighteenth century the largest psychiatric hospital
 in the state of connecticut other than the huge public hospitals that existed at that time
  and they tried everything they had they tried the usual psychotherapy they tried every medication available in those days and they did have tofranil and
 other things mellaril who knows what nothing happened except that i got jaundiced from one of these things  and finally  
 because
 i was well known in connecticut they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff all the senior staff got together and i later
  their heads together
 and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon
 who had essentially separated himself from the world who by that time
 had become so overwhelmed not just with depression
 and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy but with obsessional thinking 
 obsessional thinking about coincidences and there were particular numbers that every time i saw them
  just got me dreadfully upset
 all kinds of ritualistic observances  
 just awful awful stuff remember when you were a kid and you had to step on every line well i was a grown man who had all of these rituals  
 and it got so there was a throbbing there was a ferocious fear in my head you 've seen this painting by edvard munch the scream
  a scream it was impossible so they decided there was no therapy  there was no treatment  but there was one treatment  which actually had been pioneered at the hartford hospital
 and you can imagine what it was it was pre frontal lobotomy  
  know this again i found this out later that the only thing that could be done was for this
  man to have a pre frontal lobotomy  well  as in all hospitals there was a
 resident assigned to my case he was twenty seven years old and he would meet with me two or three times a week  and of course i had been there what three or four months at the time  
 and he asked to meet with the senior staff and they agreed to meet with him because he was very well thought of in that place they thought he
 really extraordinary future  
 and he dug in his heels and said no i know this man better than any of you i have met with him over and over again you 've just seen him from time to time you 've read reports and so forth  
 i really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it  
 and you know of course what 'll happen if you do a pre frontal lobotomy any of the results along
  the spectrum 
 from pretty bad to terrible terrible terrible is going to happen if he does the best he can 
 he will have no further obsessions probably no depression but his affect will be dulled he will never go back to surgery he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children his life will be changed
  if he has the usual result he will end up like ' one flew over the cuckoo 's nest ' and you know about that just
 essentially in a stupor the rest of his life 
 well  he said can 't we try a course of electroshock therapy and you know why they agreed they agreed to humor him 
 they just thought well we 'll give a course of ten  and so we 'll lose a little time big deal it doesn 't
  so they gave the course of ten and the first the usual course incidentally was six to eight and still is six to eight 
 plugged me into the wires put me to sleep gave me the muscle relaxant six didn 't work seven didn 't work eight didn 't work 
 at nine i noticed and it
 's wonderful that i could notice anything
 of them
 thought this would do any good they thought this was a temporary change but lo and behold by sixteen 
 by seventeen there were demonstrable differences in the way i felt by eighteen and nineteen i was sleeping through the night  and by twenty 
 i had the sense i really had the sense
  i was now strong enough that by an act of will i could blow the obsessional thinking away  i could blow the depression away  
 and i 've never forgotten i never will forget
  it was a sunday morning in january of 
 standing in the kitchen by myself and thinking i 've got the strength now to do
  it was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected and i could think clearly  
 but i need a formula i need some thing to say to myself when i begin thinking obsessionally obsessively 
 well 
 the gilbert and sullivan fans in this room will remember ruddigore and they will remember mad
  and they will remember that she was married to a fellow named sir despard murgatroyd and she used to go nuts  every five minutes or so in the play  
 and he said to her we must have a word to bring you back to reality  and the word my dear will be ' basingstoke ' 
 so every time she got a little nuts he would say
  better and it was very simple  it was ah fuck it 
 much better than basingstoke at least for me 
 and it worked my god it worked  every time i would begin thinking obsessionally again  once more after twenty
  things got better and better and within three or four months  
 i was discharged from that hospital and i joined a group of surgeons where i could work with other people
 in the community not in new haven but fairly close by i
 stayed there for three years at the end of three years i went back to new haven 
 had remarried by that time
  i brought my wife with me actually to make sure i could get through this  my children
 came back
 to live with us we had two more children after that resuscitated the career  even better than it had been before
  went right back into the university
 and began to write books well you know  
 it 's been a wonderful life it 's been as i said close to thirty years  
 i stopped doing surgery about six years ago and became a full time writer as many people know  
 but it 's been very exciting it 's been very happy every once in a while i have to say
  i 'm not free of all of this  
 but it 's worked  it 's always worked  
 why
 have i chosen  
 after never ever talking about this to talk about it now well  those of you who know some of these books know that
 one is about death and dying one is about the human body and the human
  spirit one is about the way mystical thoughts
 are constantly in our minds  and they have always to do
 with my own personal experiences one might think reading these books 
 by people who do think this that based on my life 's
 's history as i 've portrayed in the books my early life 's history i am someone
 who has overcome adversity that i am someone who has
 drunk drank drunk of the bitter dregs of
  in childhood and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened  i really have it figured out so that i can
 can advise people about death and dying so that i can talk about mysticism
 and the human spirit  and i 've always felt guilty about that 
 i 've always felt that somehow i was an impostor because my readers don 't know what i have just told you  
 it 's known by some people in new haven obviously but it is not generally known 
 so one of the reasons
 that i have come here to talk about this today
 is to frankly
 unburden myself
 and let it be known that this is not an untroubled mind that has written
 all of these books but more importantly i think 
 is the fact that a very significant proportion of people in this audience are under thirty  
 and there are many of course who are well over thirty 
  people under thirty  and it looks to me like almost
  all of you are either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career or right into a magnificent
 and exciting career 
 anything can happen to you things change  
 accidents happen something from childhood comes back to haunt you you can be thrown off the track i hope it happens to none of you
  it will probably happen to a small percentage of you to those to whom it doesn 't happen there will be adversities 
 if i with the bleakness of spirit  with no spirit  that i had in the 
 and no possibility of recovery  as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought if i can
  find my way back from this  
 believe me anybody can find their way back from any adversity that exists in their lives 
 and for those who are older who have lived through perhaps not something as bad as this  but who have lived through difficult times perhaps where they lost everything as i did and started out all over again 
 some of these things
 will seem very familiar
 there is
 recovery  there is
 redemption  and there is resurrection 
 there are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied  and it is because not just only do we fantasize about the possibility of resurrection and recovery  but it actually
  happens  and it happens a lot
