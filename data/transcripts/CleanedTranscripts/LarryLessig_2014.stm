  that there was a flaw at the core of their pentium chip  deep in the code of
  the srt algorithm to calculate intermediate quotients necessary for iterative floating points of divisions i don 't know what that means but it 's what it says on wikipedia there was a flaw
 and an error that meant that there was a certain probability that the result of the calculation would be an error  and the probability was one out of every three hundred and
  so intel said your average spreadsheet would be flawed once every twenty seven thousand years 
 they didn 't think it was significant but there was an outrage in the community  
 the community the techies said this flaw has to be addressed they were not going to stand by quietly as intel gave them these chips so there was a revolution across the world people marched to
  not really exactly like that but they rose up and they demanded that intel fix the flaw and intel set aside four hundred and seventy five million dollars
 to fund the replacement of millions of chips to fix the flaw so billions of dollars in our society was spent to address a problem which would come once out of every three hundred
  you 're familiar with his poetry around the height of the nazi period he started repeating the verse first they came for the communists and i did nothing 
 did not speak out because i was not a communist then they came for the socialists then they came for the trade unions  then they came for the jews and then they came for
  there was no one left to speak for me now niemller is offering a certain kind of insight this is an insight at the core
 of intelligence we could call it
 's a certain kind of test 
 can you recognize an underlying threat and respond can you save yourself or save your kind 
 turns out ants are pretty good at this cows not so much
  so can you see the pattern can you see a pattern and then recognize and do something about it 
 number two number three a boy this is my friend aaron swartz he 's tim 's friend he 's friends of many of you in this audience
 and seven years ago  aaron came to me with a question
  it was just before i was going to give my first ted talk i was so proud i was telling him about my talk laws that choke creativity 
 and aaron looked at me and was a little impatient and he said so how are you
 ever
 going to solve the problems you 're talking about copyright policy internet policy how are you ever going to address those problems
 so long as there 's this fundamental corruption in the way our government works
  off by this he wasn 't sharing in my celebration and i said to him you know aaron it 's not my field  not my field he said 
 you mean as an academic it 's not your field i said yeah as an academic it 's not my field he said what about as a citizen  
 as a citizen now 
 this is the way aaron was he didn 't tell  he asked questions
 but his questions spoke as clearly as my four year old 's hug  
 he was saying to me you 've got to get a clue  
 you have got to get a clue because there is a flaw at the core of the operating system of this democracy 
 and it 's not a flaw every one out of three hundred and sixty billion times our democracy tries to make a decision it is every time every single important
 issue  we 've got to end the bovinity of this political society we 've got to adopt it turns out the word is
 attitude that 's what the internet tells me the word is the ant 's appreciative attitude that gets us to recognize this flaw save our kind and save our demos  
 now if you know aaron swartz you know that we lost
  him
 just over a year ago  
 it was about six weeks before i gave my ted talk and i was so grateful to chris that he asked me to give this ted talk not because
 i had the chance to talk to you although that was great  
 but because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression i couldn 't begin to describe the sadness 
 because i had to focus
  had to focus on what was i going to say to you it saved me  
 but after the buzz the excitement the power that comes from this community  
 i began to yearn for a less sterile less academic way to address these issues the issues that i was talking about
  to focus on new hampshire as a target for this political movement  because the primary in new hampshire is so incredibly important it
 was a group called the new hampshire rebellion that was beginning to talk about how would we make this issue of this corruption central
 in two thousand and sixteen but it was another soul that caught my
 imagination a woman
 named doris haddock  
  granny d started a walk  she started in los angeles
 and began to walk to washington d c with a single sign on her chest that said campaign finance reform 
 eighteen months later at the age of ninety  she arrived in washington with hundreds following her including
  many congressmen who had gotten in a car and driven out about a mile outside of the city to walk in with her 
 now i don 't have thirteen months
 to walk across the country i 've got three kids who hate to walk  and a wife who it turns out 
 still hates when i 'm not there for mysterious reasons so this was not an option but the question i asked could we remix granny d a bit
 what about a walk not of three thousand two hundred miles but of one hundred and eighty five miles across new hampshire in january 
 so on january eleven  the anniversary of aaron 's death 
 we began a walk that ended on january 24th the day that
  two hundred people joined us across this walk as we went from the very top to the very bottom of new hampshire
 talking about this issue  
 and what was astonishing to me something i completely did not expect to find was the passion and anger that there was among
 everyone that we talked to
 about this issue we had found in a poll that
  americans
 believe it important to reduce the influence of money in politics 
 now politicians and pundits tell you there 's nothing we can do about this issue americans don 't care about it but the reason for that is
 that ninety one percent of americans think there 's nothing that can be done about this issue and
  that explains our politics of resignation i mean after all at least ninety six percent of us wish we could fly like superman  but because at least ninety one percent of us believe we can 't we don 't leap 
  off of tall buildings every time we have that urge that 's because we accept our limits  and so too with this reform  
  you begin to thaw
 that absolute sense of impossibility 
 as harvey milk said  if you give ' em hope  you give ' em a chance a way to think
 about how this change is possible hope  
 and hope is the one thing that we aaron 's friends failed him with because we let him lose
  like i love my son  
 but we failed him  
 and i love my country my country  and i 'm not going to fail that i 'm not going to fail that that sense
  we 're going to hold  and we 're going to fight for however impossible this battle looks
 what 's next well we started with this march with two hundred people and next year 
 there will be one thousand on different routes that march in the month of january and meet in concord
 to celebrate this cause  
  before the primary there will be ten thousand who march across that state  
 meeting in concord to celebrate this cause  and as we have marched people around the country have begun to say can we do the same thing in our state so we 've started a platform called g d walkers that is granny d walkers  
 and granny d walkers across the country will be marching for this reform number one number two 
 on this march one of the founders of thunderclap david
 and he said well what can we do 
 and so they developed a platform which we are announcing today 
 that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform regardless of where you are in new hampshire or outside of new hampshire you can sign up and directly 
  be informed where the candidates are are on this issue so you can decide who to vote for as a function of which is
  going to make this possibility real  
 and then finally number three the hardest we 're in the age of the super pac indeed yesterday merriam announced that
  will have super pac as a word it is now an official word in the dictionary  
  we 're going to try an experiment we 're going to try a launching of what we can think of as a super pac to end all super pacs and
 the basic way this works is this for the last year we have been working with
 analysts and political experts to calculate how much would it cost
 to win enough votes in the united states congress to make
  reform possible what is that number half a billion a billion what is that number  
 and then whatever that number is  
 we are going to kickstart  sort of because you can 't use kickstarter for political work but anyway kickstart sort of first a bottom up campaign
 where people will make small dollar commitments contingent on reaching very ambitious goals and when those goals have been
  reached we will turn to the large dollar contributors 
 to get them to contribute to make it possible for us to run the kind of super pac necessary to win this issue to change the way money 
 influences politics so that on november eight  
 on november eight  we will celebrate
 two hundred and eighteen representatives in the house and sixty senators in the united states senate
 who have committed to this idea of fundamental reform  so
 last night  we heard about wishes here 's my wish
  may the ideals of one boy
 unite one nation behind one critical idea that we are one people 
 we are the people who were promised a government a government that was promised to be dependent upon the people alone the people 
 who as madison told us meant not the rich more than
  the poor may one  
 and then may you 
 may you join this movement  not because you 're a politician not because you 're an expert not because this is your field  
 but because if you are you are
 a citizen  aaron asked me that now i 've asked you
