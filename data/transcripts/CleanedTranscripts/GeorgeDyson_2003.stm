  last year i told you the story in seven minutes of project orion  which was this very implausible technology that that
 technically could have worked but it had this one year political window
  where it could have happened so it didn 't happen it was a dream that did not happen this year i 'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing this was a perfect introduction  
 and it 's a story that did work it did happen and the machines are all around us  and
 it was a technology that
 was inevitable if the people i 'm going to tell you the story about if they hadn 't done it somebody else would have so it was sort of the right idea at the right time  
 this is barricelli 's universe this is the universe we live in now it 's the universe in which
  these machines are now
 doing all these things including changing biology i 'm
 starting the story with the first atomic bomb at trinity  
 which was the manhattan project it was a little bit like ted it brought a whole lot of very smart people together and three of the smartest people were stan
  richard feynman and john von neumann and it was von neumann who said after the bomb he was working on something much more important than bombs  
 he 's thinking about computers 
 so he wasn 't only thinking about them he built one this is the machine he built 
 he built this machine  and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works with these little
  and it 's an idea that goes way back the first person to really explain that was thomas hobbes who 
 explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic you can do it all with arithmetic he said you needed addition and subtraction  
 leibniz who came a little bit later this 
 showed that you didn 't even need subtraction you could do the whole thing with addition here we have all the
  arithmetic and logic that drove the computer revolution  and leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine he talked about doing it with marbles having gates and what 
  we now call shift registers where you shift the gates drop the marbles down the tracks and that 's what all these machines are doing except instead of doing it with marbles they 're doing it with electrons
  when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing and one thousand nine hundred and forty five after the war the electronics existed to actually try and build such a machine so june 
  the bomb hasn 't even been dropped yet and von neumann is is putting together all the theory to actually build build this thing which also goes back to turing who before that gave the idea that you could do all
 with a very brainless little finite state machine just reading a tape in and reading a tape out the other
 sort of genesis of what von neumann did was the
 difficulty of how you would predict the weather 
 lewis richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people giving them each a little chunk  and putting it together here we have an electrical model illustrating a mind
 having a will but capable
  and that 's really the simplest computer it 's basically
 why you need the qubit because it only has two ideas and you put lots of those together  you get the
 essentials of the modern computer the arithmetic unit the central control the memory  the recording medium the input and the output 
 but there 's one catch this is the fatal you know we saw it in
 starting these programs up the instructions which govern this operation must be given in
  absolutely exhaustive detail so the programming has to be perfect or it won 't work  if you look at the origins of this the classic history sort of takes it all back
 to the eniac here but actually the machine i 'm going to tell you about the institute for advanced study machine which is way up there really should be down there so i 'm trying to revise history and give some of these guys more credit than they 've had such a computer would open up
 universes which are at the present outside
  the range of any instruments so it opens up a whole new world and these people saw it the guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle vladimir zworykin from 
  probably one of the lousiest business decisions of all time decided not to go into computers  but the first meetings november
  computers the essentials were all there all the things that make
 these machines run 
 von neumann and a logician and a mathematician from the army put this together  then they needed a place to build it when rca said no  that 's when they decided to build it in princeton where freeman works at the institute 
 that 's where i grew up as a kid 
 that 's me that 's my sister esther who 's talked to you before
  so we we both go back to the birth of this thing that 's freeman a long time ago  
 and that was me  and this is von neumann and morgenstern  
 who wrote the theory of games all these forces came together there in princeton 
 oppenheimer  who had built the bomb the machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb
  and julian bigelow who took zworkykin 's place as the engineer to actually figure out using electronics how you would build this thing the whole gang of people
 who came to work on this and
 women in front who actually did most of the coding were the first programmers these were the prototype geeks the nerds  
 they didn 't fit in at the institute this is a letter from the director concerned
 about especially unfair on the matter of sugar
 this is hackers getting in trouble for the first time laughter
 these were not theoretical physicists they were real  soldering gun type guys  and they actually built
  we take it for granted now that each of these machines
 has billions of transistors doing billions of cycles per second without failing they were using vacuum tubes very narrow  sloppy
 techniques to get actually binary behavior out of these
 radio vacuum tubes they actually used 6j6 the common radio tube because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes 
 and what they did at the
  every step of the way reports were issued so that this machine was cloned at fifteen other places around the world  
 and it really was it was the original microprocessor all the computers now are copies of that machine the memory was in cathode ray tubes
 a whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube very very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances so there 's
  the input and the output was by teletype tape at first this is a wire drive using bicycle wheels this is the archetype of
 the hard disk that 's in your machine now  then they switched to a magnetic drum  this is modifying ibm equipment which is the origins of the whole
  next slide that 's the as far as i know the first digital bitmap display 
 so von neumann was already off in a theoretical cloud doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build reliable machines out of unreliable components 
 those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it were writing in their logbooks trying to get this thing to work with all these two thousand six hundred vacuum tubes that
  failed half the time  and that 's what i 've been doing this last six months is going through the logs 
 running time two minutes  input output ninety minutes this includes a large amount of human error  
 so they are always trying to figure out what 's machine error what 's human error what 's code what 's hardware  that 's an engineer gazing at tube number thirty six trying to figure out why the memory 's not in focus he had to focus the memory
 seems ok  so he had to focus
 each tube just to just to get the memory up and running let alone having you know  software problems no use went home 
 impossible to follow the damn thing where 's a directory so already they 're complaining about the manuals before closing down in disgust 
 the general arithmetic operating logs burning lots of midnight oil 
  became the acronym for the machine mathematical and numerical integrator and calculator lost its memory maniac regained its memory when the power went off machine or human 
 aha so they figured out it 's a code problem found trouble in code i hope code error machine not guilty 
 damn it i can be just as stubborn as this thing
  this thing was running mainly running bomb calculations 
 everything up to this point is wasted time what 's the use good night 
 master control off the hell with it way off 
 something 's wrong with the air conditioner smell of burning  v belts in the air a short do not turn the machine
  machine putting a tar like substance on the cards the tar is from the roof so they really were working under tough conditions 
 here a mouse has climbed into the blower behind the regulator rack set blower to vibrating result no more mouse
  marston mouse if you 're a mathematician you get that because marston was a mathematician who objected to the computer being there picked a lightning bug off the drum 
 running at two kilocycles that 's two thousand cycles per second yes i 'm chicken so two kilocycles was slow speed  
 the high speed was sixteen kilocycles i don 't know if you
 remember a mac that was sixteen megahertz
 that 's slow speed
  i have now duplicated both results how will i know which is right assuming one result is correct this now is the third different output i know when i 'm licked 
 we 've duplicated errors before machine run fine code isn 't only happens when the machine is running and
  were actually designing bombs they 're designing hydrogen bombs  but someone in the logbook late one night finally drew a bomb so that was the result it was mike the first thermonuclear
 bomb in one thousand nine hundred and fifty two that was designed on that machine in the woods behind the institute so von neumann invited a whole gang of
  from all over the world to work on
 all these problems  barricelli he came to do what we now call really artificial life  trying to see if in this artificial universe
 he was a viral geneticist way way  way ahead of his time he 's still ahead of some of the stuff that 's being done now trying to
 start an artificial genetic system running in the computer began his universe started march
  it 's fifty years ago next
 tuesday i guess
  and he saw everything in terms of he could read the binary code straight off the machine he had a wonderful rapport other people couldn 't get the machine running it always worked for him
  even errors were duplicated 
 dr barricelli claims machine is wrong code is right so
 he designed this universe and ran it when the bomb people went home
  was allowed in there he would run that thing all night long running these things if anybody remembers stephen wolfram who reinvented this stuff
 and he published it it wasn 't locked up and disappeared  it was published in the literature 
 if it 's that easy to create living organisms why not create a few yourself so he decided to give it a try to start
 this artificial biology going in the machines
  like a naturalist coming in and looking at this tiny
 universe and seeing all these things happening that that we see in the outside world in biology
 this is some of the generations of his universe
  but they 're just going to stay numbers they 're not going to become organisms  
 they have to have something you have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype they have to go out and do something  
 and he started doing that started giving these little numerical organisms
 things they could play with playing chess with other machines and so on  and they did start to evolve  and he went around the country after that every time there was a new fast machine he started using it 
 and saw exactly what 's happening now that the the programs  instead of
 being turned off when you when you quit the program you 'd keep running
  things like windows is doing running as a multi cellular organism on many machines he envisioned all that happening and he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process it wasn 't any sort of creator intelligence 
 but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation that would have some intelligence and he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was
  difference between what he was doing in the computer and what nature did billions of years ago
  and could you do it again now so when i went into these archives looking at this stuff lo and behold  the archivist came up one day saying i think we found another box that had been thrown out and it was his universe on punch cards  
 so there it is 
  sitting there sort of suspended animation
 that 's the instructions for running this is actually the source code
 for one of those universes with a note from the engineers saying they 're having some problems there must be something about this code that you haven 't explained yet 
 and i think that 's really the truth we still don 't understand how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing
  what 's the dividing line between when that is lifelike and when it really is alive 
 these cards now thanks to me showing up are being saved  and the question is should we run them or not you know could we get them running do you want to let it loose on the internet these machines would think they
 these organisms if they came back to life now whether they 've died and gone to heaven there 's a universe 
 my laptop is
 ten thousand million times the size of the universe that they lived in when
 when barricelli quit the project  he was thinking far ahead to how this would really grow into a new kind of life and that 's what 's happening when
 juan enriquez told us about these twelve trillion bits being transferred back and forth of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab  
 that 's
  what barricelli imagined that this digital code
 in these machines is actually starting to code it it already is coding from nucleic acids we 've been doing that since you know 
 since we started pcr and
 synthesizing
 small strings of dna  and real soon we 're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins and like steve showed us that just opens an
  entirely new world it 's a world that von neumann himself envisioned this was published after he died his sort of unfinished notes on 
  machines what it takes to get the machines sort of jump started to where they begin to reproduce 
 it took really three people  barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing 
 von neumann saw how you could build the machines that now 
 last count four million of these von neumann machines is built every twenty four hours and julian bigelow who died
  died
 ten days ago
 this is john markoff 's obituary for him
 he was the important missing link the engineer who came in and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work and all our computers
 have inside them the copies of the architecture that he had to just design one day sort of on pencil and paper
  and we owe a tremendous credit to that and he explained
  in a very generous way the spirit that brought all these different people to the institute for advanced study in the ' 40s to do this project  and make it freely available with no patents no restrictions 
 no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world that 's the last entry in the logbook when the machine was shut down july one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight and it 's julian bigelow who was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off
