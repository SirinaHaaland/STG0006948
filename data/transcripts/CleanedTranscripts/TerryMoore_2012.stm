  question that we 've all asked the question is why is it that the letter x represents the unknown 
 now i know we learned that in math class  but now it
  that come from 
 about six years ago i decided that i would learn arabic which turns out to be a supremely logical language 
 to write a word or a phrase or a sentence in arabic is like crafting an equation because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information 
  of the reasons so much of what we 've come to think of as western science and mathematics and engineering
 was really worked out in the first few centuries of the common era by the persians and the arabs and the turks this includes the little system in arabic called
  into english as algebra one example among many 
 the arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to europe which is to say spain
 and when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a european
  but there were problems one problem is
 there there are some sounds in arabic that just don 't make it through a european voice box without lots of practice  trust me on that one 
 also  those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in european languages 
 here 's one of the culprits this is the letter sheen and it makes the sound we think of as sh
  it 's also the very first letter of the word shalan 
 which means something just like the the english word something some undefined unknown thing  
 now in arabic we can make this definite by adding the definite article al so this is
 the unknown thing  and this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics such as this
  derivation of proofs 
 the problem for the medieval spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material
 is that the letter sheen and the word shalan can 't be rendered into spanish because spanish doesn 't have that sh that sh sound
  they created a rule in which they borrowed the ck sound ck 
 sound from the classical greek in the form of the letter kai 
 later when this material was translated into a common european language  which is to say latin  they simply replaced the greek kai with the latin x and once that
  once this material was in latin  
 it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost six hundred years 
 but now we have the answer to our question why is it that x is the unknown 
 x is the unknown because
 you can 't say sh in spanish 
 and i thought that was worth sharing
