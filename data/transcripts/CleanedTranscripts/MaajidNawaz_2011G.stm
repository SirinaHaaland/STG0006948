  have you ever wondered why extremism seems to have been on the rise in  muslim majority countries over the course of the last decade 
 have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around have you ever
  looked at the arab uprisings and thought how could we have predicted that or how could we have better prepared for that 
 well my personal story my personal journey what brings me to the ted stage here today 
 is a demonstration of exactly what 's been happening in  muslim majority countries over the course of the last decades at least and beyond 
 i want to share some of that story with you but also some of my ideas around change
 and the role of social
  so let me begin
 by first of all giving a very very brief history of time  if i may indulge  
 in medieval societies there were defined allegiances an identity was defined primarily
 by religion  and then we moved on into an era in the 19th century with the rise of a european  nation state where identities and allegiances were defined
  so identity was primarily defined by ethnicity and the nation state reflected that in the age of globalization we moved on i call it the era of citizenship
 where people could be from multi racial multi ethnic backgrounds  but all be equal as citizens in a state you could be american italian you could be 
 you could be british pakistani but i believe now that we 're moving into a new age  and that age the new york times dubbed
 recently as the age of behavior how i define the age of behavior
 is a period of transnational allegiances where identity is defined more so by ideas and narratives 
 and these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave  
 now this is not all necessarily good news  
 because it 's also my belief
 that hatred
 has gone global just as much
 as love  
 but actually it 's my belief that the people who 've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior  up until now up until recent times  
 up until the last six months the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior
 and the transnational
  digital activism and other sorts of of borderless technologies those who 've been benefiting from this have been extremists  
 and that 's something which i 'd like to elaborate on if we look at islamists 
 if we look at the phenomenon of far right fascists one thing they 've been very good at one thing that they 've actually been exceeding
  communicating across borders using technologies to organize themselves to propagate their message
 and to create truly global phenomena  now i should know 
 because for thirteen years of my life i was involved in an extreme islamist organization  
 and i was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders  and i witnessed the rise of islamist extremism as distinct from islam the faith  
 and the way in which it influenced
 my co religionists across the world  and my story my personal story is truly evidence for the age of behavior that i 'm attempting to elaborate upon here i was by the way i 'm an essex lad born and raised in essex in the u k anyone who 's from england knows the
 the reputation we have from essex  but
 having been born in essex at
  age of sixteen 
 i joined an organization at the age of seventeen i was recruiting people from cambridge university to this organization at the age of nineteen i was on the national leadership of this organization in the u k 
 at the age of twenty one i was co founding this organization in pakistan at the age of twenty two i was co founding this organization in denmark 
 by the age of twenty four i found myself convicted in prison in egypt
  being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments 
 being subjected to torture in egyptian jails and sentenced to five years
 as a prisoner of conscience  
 now that journey  and what took me from essex all the way across the world by the way we were laughing at democratic activists  
 we felt they were from the age of yesteryear  we felt that they were out of date i learned how to use email from the extremist organization that
  used  i learned how to effectively communicate across borders without being detected  eventually i was detected of course in egypt  
 but the way in which i learned to use technology to my advantage
 was because i was within an extremist organization that was forced to think beyond the confines of the nation state the age of
  where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior
 and identity and allegiances  
 so as i said we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it and it 's not just islamist extremists that did this but even if you look across the mood music in europe of late
 far right fascism is also on the rise a form of anti islam
 rhetoric is also on the rise and it 's transnational  
 and the consequences that this is having
 is that it 's affecting the
  political climate across europe 
 what 's actually happening is that what were previously localized parochialisms  
 individual or groupings of extremists who were isolated from one another have become interconnected
 in a globalized way and have thus become or are becoming mainstream  because the internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world
  if you look at the rise of far right fascism across europe of late you will see some things that are happening that are influencing domestic politics yet the phenomenon is transnational  
 in certain countries mosque minarets are being banned  in others headscarves are being banned  in others kosher and halal meat are being banned as we speak 
 and on the flip
  we have transnational islamist extremists doing the same thing across their own societies  and so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream now that never would have been possible before they would have felt isolated 
 until these sorts of technologies came around and connected them in a way that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon where does that leave democracy aspirants  
 well i believe they 're getting left far behind and i 'll give you
 an example here
  at this stage  if any of you remembers the christmas day bomb plot there 's a man called anwar al awlaki 
 as an american citizen  ethnically a yemeni  in hiding currently in yemen who inspired a nigerian son of the head of nigeria 's national bank this nigerian 
  student studied in london  trained in yemen  boarded a flight in amsterdam to attack america  
  was represented by his father the head of the nigerian bank 
 warning the cia that his own son was about to attack and this warning fell on deaf ears  
 the old mentality with a capital o as represented by the nation state 
 not yet fully into the age of behavior not recognizing the power of transnational social movements got left behind  and the christmas day bomber almost succeeded in attacking the united states of america
 again with the example of the far right that we find  ironically  
 xenophobic nationalists are utilizing the benefits of globalization  
 so why are they succeeding and why are democracy aspirants falling behind  
 well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this and a social movement is comprised  in my
  view it 's comprised of four main characteristics it 's comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders i 'll talk you through one example  
 and that 's the example that everyone here will be aware of and that 's the example of al qaeda 
 if i asked you to think of the ideas of al qaeda that 's something that comes to your mind immediately  if i ask you to think of their narratives the west being at war with islam the need to defend islam against the west these narratives
 they come to your mind immediately incidentally  the difference between ideas and narratives the idea is the cause
 that one believes in and the narrative is the way to sell that cause the propaganda if you like of the cause 
 so the ideas and the narratives of  al qaeda come to your mind immediately  if i ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders they come to your mind immediately one of their leaders was killed in pakistan recently  
 so these symbols and these leaders come to your mind
  immediately  
 and that 's the power of social movements they 're transnational and they bond around these ideas and narratives and these symbols and these leaders  
 however  
 if i ask your minds to focus currently on pakistan and i ask you to think of
 the symbols and the leaders for democracy in pakistan
  be hard pressed to think beyond
 perhaps the assassination of benazir bhutto which means by definition that particular leader no longer exists 
 one of the problems we 're facing is in my view that there are no globalized
 grassroots social movements advocating for democratic culture across muslim majority societies there is no equivalent of the al qaeda 
 without the terrorism for democracy across
  societies there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols advocating the democratic culture on the ground  
 so that begs the next question why is it
 that extremist organizations whether of the far right or of the islamist extremism islamism meaning those who wish to impose one version of islam over the rest of society why is it that they are succeeding in organizing in a globalized way  whereas those who aspire
  to democratic culture are falling behind  
 and i believe that 's for four reasons  i believe number one it 's complacency  because those who aspire to democratic culture
 are in power 
 or have societies that are leading globalized powerful societies  powerful countries  and that level of complacency means they don 't feel the need to advocate for that culture 
 the second i
  believe is political correctness 
 that we have
 a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that
 we associate believing in the universality of our values with extremists  yet actually whenever we talk about human rights we do say that human rights are universal
  out to propagate that view is associated with either neoconservativism or with islamist extremism to go around saying that i believe democratic culture
 is the best that we 've arrived at as a form of political organizing
 is associated with extremism and the third democratic choice in 
  societies has been relegated to a political choice  meaning political parties in many of these societies
 ask people to vote for them as the democratic party but then the other parties ask them to vote for them as the military party wanting to rule by military 
  dictatorship  and then you have a third party saying vote for us we 'll establish a theocracy so democracy has become merely one political choice among many other forms of political
 available in those societies  and what happens as a result of this is when those parties are elected 
 and inevitably they fail  or inevitably they make political mistakes democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes  
 and then people say we 've tried democracy it doesn 't really work  let 's bring the military back again and the fourth
  i believe is what i 've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance what i mean by that is if the world superpower today was a communist 
 it would be much easier for democracy activists to use democracy activism as a form of resistance against colonialism  than it is today with the world superpower being america  occupying 
  certain lands and also espousing democratic ideals  so roughly these four reasons make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread as a civilizational choice not merely as a political
  choice  when talking about those reasons let 's break down certain preconceptions is it just about grievances is it just about
 a lack of education  well statistically  the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated  
 statistically  they are educated on average above the education levels of
  we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor well bin laden is from one of the richest families in saudi arabia his deputy ayman al zawahiri was a pediatrician
 not an ill educated man 
 international aid and development has been going on for years but extremism in those societies in many of those societies has been on the rise and what i believe is missing
 is genuine grassroots activism
  in addition to international aid in addition to education in addition to health not exclusive to these things but in addition to them is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground  and this is where i believe neoconservatism had it 
  had the philosophy that you go in with a supply led approach to impose democratic values from the top down  whereas
  for decades have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots they 've been building civilizational demand for their values on the grassroots and we 've been seeing those societies slowly transition
 to societies that are increasingly asking for a form of islamism mass movements in pakistan have been represented after the arab uprisings mainly by organizations claiming 
  for some form of theocracy  rather than for a a democratic uprising because since pre partition they 've been building demand
  for their ideology on the ground  
 and what 's needed is a genuine transnational youth led movement that works to actively advocate for the democratic culture which is necessarily more than just elections  
 but without freedom of speech you can 't have free and fair elections  without human rights you don 't have the protection granted to you
  without freedom of belief you don 't have the right to join organizations  so what 's needed is those organizations on the ground advocating for the democratic culture itself
 to create the demand on the ground for this culture what that will do
 is avoid the problem i was talking about earlier  where currently we have political parties presenting democracy as merely a political choice in those societies
 alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy
 whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level  rather than merely on a political level a level above politics
 movements that are not political parties but are rather creating this civilizational demand for this democratic democratic culture  what we 'll have in the end is this ideal that you see on the slide here
 the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy not for a democracy
  but to get to that stage  where democracy builds the fabric of society and the political choices within that fabric 
 but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship
 i e you 're voting in a democracy in an existing democracy  and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box to get to that
  we genuinely need to start building demand in those societies on the ground  
 now to conclude how does that happen  well 
 egypt is a good starting point the arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning  but what happened in the arab uprisings and
 what happened in egypt was particularly cathartic for me 
 what happened there was a political coalition gathered together for a political goal  and that was to remove the leader
  need to move one step beyond that now we need to see how we can help those societies move from political coalitions loosely based political coalitions to civilizational coalitions that are working for the ideals and narratives of the democratic culture on the ground  
 because it 's not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator 
 that doesn 't guarantee that what comes next will be a society built on democratic values  
 but generally the trends that start in
  egypt have historically spread across the mena region the middle east and north africa region  so when arab socialism started in egypt it spread across the region  in the ' 80s and ' 90s when islamism started in the region 
 it spread across the the mena region as a whole and the aspiration that we have at the moment as young arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism
 that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that but that will require helping these societies transition from having merely political coalitions 
 to building genuinely grassroots based social movements that advocate for the democratic culture  and we 've made a start for that in pakistan with a movement called khudi
