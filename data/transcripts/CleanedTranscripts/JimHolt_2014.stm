  this is a cosmic mystery be solemn  why is there a world why are we in it and
 why is there something rather than nothing at all i mean this is the super ultimate
 question so i 'm going to talk about the mystery of existence the puzzle of existence  where we are now in addressing it
  and why you should care  
 and i hope you do care
  the philosopher arthur schopenhauer said that
 those who don 't wonder about the contingency of their existence of the contingency of the world 's existence  are mentally deficient  that 's a little
  harsh but still 
 laughter so this has been called the most sublime and awesome mystery the deepest and most far reaching question man can pose  it 's obsessed 
  great thinkers  ludwig wittgenstein perhaps the greatest philosopher of the 20th century 
  world that is the mystical  it 's that the world exists and if you don 't like taking your  epigrams from
 a philosopher try a scientist john archibald wheeler one of the great physicists of the 20th century  the teacher of richard feynman 
 the coiner of the term black hole 
 he said i want to know
 how come the quantum how come the universe how come existence
 and my friend martin amis sorry that i 'll be doing a lot of name dropping in this
 talk so get used to it my dear friend martin amis
 once said that we 're about five einsteins away from answering the mystery of where the universe came from and i 've no doubt there are five einsteins in the audience tonight 
  why is there something rather than nothing this sublime question was posed rather late in
 in intellectual history it was towards the end of the  17th century  the philosopher leibniz who asked it a very smart guy  leibniz who
 invented the calculus independently of isaac newton at about the same time  but for leibniz who asked why is there something rather than nothing  this was not a great mystery
 he either was or
  pretended to be an orthodox christian in his metaphysical outlook  and he said it 's obvious why the the world exists because god created it  
 and god created indeed 
 out of nothing at all that 's how powerful god is he doesn 't need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of he can make it out of sheer nothingness creation
  and by the way this is what most americans today believe there is no mystery of existence for them god made it so let 's put this in an equation
 i don 't have any slides so i 'm going to mime my visuals  so use your imaginations so it 's
 god + nothing = the world  okay  now that 's the equation  and so maybe
 don 't believe in god maybe you 're a scientific atheist or or an unscientific atheist and you don 't believe in god 
 and you 're not happy with it by the way  even if we have this equation god   + nothing = the world there 's already a problem why does god exist
  god doesn 't exist by logic alone unless you believe the ontological argument and i hope you don 't because it 's not a good argument  so
 it 's conceivable if god were to exist he might wonder  i 'm eternal i 'm all powerful but where did i
  come from whence then am i god speaks in a more formal english 
 and so one theory is that god was so bored with pondering the puzzle of his own existence that he created the world just to distract himself  but anyway let 's forget about god
  if you 're a buddhist you might want to stop right there because essentially what you 've got is nothing  = the world and by symmetry of identity that means the world  = nothing  okay and to a buddhist the world is just a whole lot of nothing it 's just a big
 cosmic vacuity  and we think there 's a lot of something out there but that 's because we 're enslaved by our desires if we let our desires melt away
  the world for what it truly is a vacuity nothingness and we 'll slip into this happy state of nirvana which has been defined as having just enough life to enjoy being dead  
 so that 's the buddhist  thinking but i 'm a westerner and i 'm still concerned concerned with the puzzle of existence so i 've got
  the world what are we going to put in that blank  well how about science science is our best guide to the nature of reality  and the most fundamental science is physics 
 that tells us what naked reality really is that reveals what i call  taufotu the true and ultimate furniture of the universe so maybe physics
  have purported to
 give a purely scientific explanation of how a
 universe like ours could have popped into existence out of sheer nothingness  a quantum fluctuation out of the void  
 stephen hawking is one of these physicists more recently
  and the whole thing has been popularized by another very fine physicist and friend of mine lawrence krauss who wrote a book called a universe from nothing and lawrence thinks that he 's given
 he 's a militant atheist by the way so he 's gotten god out of the picture the laws of quantum field theory the state of the art physics can show how out of sheer nothingness no space no time no matter nothing  a little
 nugget of false vacuum can fluctuate into existence  and then by the miracle of
  inflation  blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos we see around us  okay this is a really ingenious
 scenario it 's very speculative  it 's fascinating  but i 've got a big problem with it  and the problem is this
  it 's a pseudo religious point of view now lawrence thinks he 's an atheist  but he 's still
  in thrall to a religious worldview he sees physical laws as being like divine commands
  the laws of quantum field theory for him are like fiat lux let there be light
 the laws have some sort of ontological power or clout that they can form the abyss that it 's pregnant with being they can call a world into existence
 out of nothing  but that 's a very primitive view of what a physical
  we know that physical laws are actually
 generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities in the world  
 they don 't exist outside the world  they don 't have any ontic cloud of their own they can 't call a world into existence out of nothingness  
 that 's a very primitive view of what of what a scientific law is  and if you don 't believe me on this
  listen to stephen hawking who himself put forward a
 model of the cosmos that was
  any outside cause any creator and after proposing this hawking admitted that he was still puzzled
 this model is just equations what breathes fire into the equations and creates a world for them to describe he was puzzled by this so
 equations themselves can 't do the magic can 't resolve the puzzle of existence  and besides  even if the laws
  could do that why this set of laws why quantum field theory that describes a universe with a certain number of forces and particles and so forth  why not a completely different set of laws there are many many mathematically consistent sets of laws 
 why not no laws at all why not sheer nothingness  so this is a problem  believe it or not that reflective physicists really think a lot about 
 and at this point they tend to go metaphysical say
  well maybe the set of laws that describes our universe it 's just one set of laws and it describes one part of reality  but maybe every consistent set of laws
 describes another part of reality and in fact all possible physical worlds
 really exist they 're all out there we just see a little tiny part of reality
  that 's described by the laws of quantum field theory but there are many many other worlds parts of reality that are described by vastly different theories that are
 different from ours in ways we can 't imagine that are
 inconceivably exotic  steven weinberg  the father of the standard model of particle physics has actually
 flirted with this idea himself that all possible realities
 actually
  younger physicist max tegmark who believes that
 that all mathematical structures exist  and mathematical existence is the same thing as physical existence so we have this
 vastly rich multiverse that encompasses every logical possibility  
 now in taking this metaphysical way out these physicists and also philosophers are actually reaching back to a very old idea that goes back to plato it 's the principle of
 plenitude or fecundity or the great chain of being that reality is actually as full as possible it 's as far removed from nothingness as it could possibly be 
 so
 we have these two extremes now we have
 sheer nothingness on one side and we have this vision of a reality that encompasses every conceivable world at the other extreme the fullest possible
  reality  nothingness  the simplest possible reality  
 now what 's in between these two extremes 
 there are all kinds of intermediate realities that include some things and leave out others  so one of these intermediate realities is
  the most mathematically elegant reality that leaves out the
  are some physicists who will tell you that we 're actually living in the most elegant reality i think that brian greene is in the audience  and he has written a 
  book called the elegant universe he claims that the universe we live in mathematically is very elegant 
  it 's a pious hope i wish it were true  but i think the other day he admitted to me it 's really an ugly universe
  constructed it 's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants and and mass ratios and superfluous families of elementary particles and what the hell is dark energy 
 it 's a stick and bubble gum contraption it 's not an elegant universe 
 and then there 's the best of all possible worlds in an ethical sense you should get solemn now because a world
  in which sentient beings don 't suffer needlessly in which there aren 't things like
 like childhood cancer or the holocaust this is an ethical conception anyway so between nothingness and the fullest possible reality  various special realities nothingness is special it 's the simplest 
 then there 's the most elegant possible reality that 's special the fullest possible reality that 's special  but what are we leaving out here
 there 's also just the crummy  generic realities that aren 't special in any way that are sort of random  
 they 're infinitely removed from nothingness  but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness 
 they 're a mixture of chaos and order of mathematical elegance and
 and ugliness so  i would describe these realities as an
 an infinite  mediocre incomplete mess a generic reality a kind of cosmic junk shot and these realities 
 is there a deity in any of these realities  maybe but the deity isn 't perfect like the
 pretty
 much describes the the world we see around us i think so i would like to propose that the resolution to the mystery of existence
 is that that
 the reality we exist in is one of these generic realities  reality has to turn out some way  it can either turn out to be nothing or everything or something in between
  so if it has some special feature like being really elegant or really full or really simple like nothingness  that would require an explanation 
 but if it 's just one of these random generic realities there 's no further explanation for it  
 and indeed i would say that 's the reality we live in that 's what science is telling us 
  the beginning of the week we got the exciting information that the theory of inflation which predicts a big infinite messy  arbitrary pointless reality it 's like a big
 frothing
 champagne coming out out of a bottle endlessly 
 a vast universe  mostly a wasteland with little pockets of charm and order and peace
  this has been confirmed this inflationary scenario by the observations made by radio telescopes in antarctica that looked at the signature of the gravitational
 waves from just before the big bang i 'm sure you all know about this  
 so anyway i think there 's some evidence that this really is the reality that we 're stuck with now  why should you care
  intimate question  why do i exist  why do you exist you know our existence would seem to be amazingly improbable because 
  there 's an enormous number of genetically possible humans if you can compute it by looking at the number of the genes and the number of alleles and so forth  and a  back of the envelope calculation will tell you there are about ten to the 
  and the number of the actual humans that have existed is one hundred billion maybe fifty billion an infinitesimal fraction so all of us we 've won this amazing cosmic lottery  we 're here  
 okay  so what kind of reality do we want to live in do we want to live in a special reality  what if we were living in the most elegant possible reality 
 imagine
 imagine the existential pressure on us to live up to that to be elegant not to pull down the tone of it 
 or what if we were living in the fullest possible reality  well then our existence would be guaranteed because every possible thing
 exists in that reality  but our choices would be meaningless  if i really struggle morally and agonize and i decide to do the right thing
  what difference does it make because there are an infinite number of versions of me also doing the right thing and an infinite number doing the wrong thing so my choices are meaningless
  so we don 't want to live in that special reality  and as for the special reality of nothingness we wouldn 't be having this conversation
 so i think
 living in a generic reality that 's mediocre  there are nasty bits and nice bits and we could make the nice bits bigger and the nasty bits smaller
  and that gives us a kind of purpose
 in life the universe is absurd but we can still construct a purpose and that 's a pretty good one 
 and the overall mediocrity of reality kind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity we all feel in the core of our being and i know you feel it i know you 're all special but you 're still kind of secretly mediocre
 at the existence of the universe  and you 're in good company bertrand russell said 
 i should say the universe is just there and that 's all just a brute fact  and my professor at columbia sidney morgenbesser a great philosophical wag when i said to him professor morgenbesser why is there something rather than nothing 
  even if there was nothing you still wouldn 't be satisfied
