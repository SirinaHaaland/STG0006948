  there is an aspiring teacher who is working on a 60 page paper
 based on some age old education theory developed by some dead education professor wondering to
  herself what this task that she 's engaging in
 has to do with what she wants to do with her life  which is be an educator change lives  and spark magic  
 right now
 there is an aspiring teacher in a graduate school of education
 who is watching a professor babble on and on about engagement
 in the most
 disengaging way possible
  right now there 's a first year teacher at home
 who is pouring through lesson plans trying to make sense of standards 
 who is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately  while at the same time saying to herself over and over again don 't smile till november 
 because that 's what she was taught in her teacher education
  program  right now
 there 's a student
 who is coming up with a way to convince his mom or dad that he 's very very sick and can 't make it to school tomorrow 
 on the other hand  right now there are amazing educators that
  sharing information information that is shared in such a beautiful way that the students are sitting at the edge of their seats just waiting for a bead of sweat to drop off the face of this person so they can soak up all that knowledge  
 right now
 there is also a person who has an entire audience rapt with attention a person that is weaving a powerful narrative about a world
 that the people who are listening have never imagined or seen before
 but if they close their eyes tightly enough they can envision that world
 because the storytelling is so compelling  right now
 there 's a person who can tell an audience to put their hands up in the air and they will stay there till he says put them down 
 right now so people will then say well
  you describe the guy who is going through some awful training but you 're also describing these powerful educators if you 're thinking about the world of education or urban education in particular these guys will probably cancel each other out  and then we 'll be okay 
 the reality is the folks i described as the master teachers the master narrative builders the master storytellers are far removed from
  the folks who know the skills about how to teach and engage an audience don 't even know what teacher certification means they may not even have the degrees
 to be able to have anything to call an education 
 and that to me is sad it 's sad because the people who i described they were very disinterested in the learning process want to be effective teachers
  but they have no models i 'm going to paraphrase mark twain mark twain says that proper preparation or teaching 
 is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good  
 it can turn awful practices into powerful ones it can change men and transform them into angels 
 the folks who i described earlier got proper preparation in teaching 
 not in any college or university  but by virtue of just being in the same spaces of those who engage guess where those places are
 barber shops 
 rap concerts  and most importantly in the black church  and i 've been framing this idea called pentecostal pedagogy who here has been to a black church
  we got a couple of hands 
 you go to a black church their preacher starts off and he realizes that he has to engage the audience so he starts off with this sort of wordplay in the beginning oftentimes
 and then he takes a pause and he says oh my gosh they 're not quite paying attention so he says can i get an amen audience amen chris emdin so
 i can i get an amen audience amen ce and all of a sudden everybody 's reawoken 
 that preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention  he drops his voice at a very very low volume when he wants people to key into him and those things are
  the skills that we need for the most engaging teachers 
 so why does teacher education only give you theory and theory and and tell you about standards and tell you about all of these things that have nothing to do with the basic skills that magic that you need to engage an audience to engage a student 
 so i make the argument that we reframe teacher education that we could focus on content and that 's fine  and we could focus on theories and that 's
  but content and theories with the absence of the magic
 of teaching and learning
 means nothing now people oftentimes say well magic is just magic 
 there are teachers who despite all their challenges who have those skills get into those schools and are able to engage an audience and the administrator walks by and says wow he 's so good i wish all my teachers could be that good and when they try to describe what that is they just say he has that magic 
 but i 'm here to tell you that magic can be taught 
 magic can be taught 
 magic can be taught  now how do you teach it 
 you teach it by allowing people to go into those spaces where the magic is happening 
 if you want to be an aspiring teacher in urban education you 've got to leave the confines of that university and go into the hood  
 you 've got to go in there and hang out at the barbershop you 've got to attend that
 black church and you 've got to view those folks that have the power to engage and just take notes on what they do 
 at our teacher education classes at my university 
 i 've started a project where every single student that comes in there sits and watches rap concerts  
 they watch the way that the rappers move and talk with their hands they study the way that he walks proudly across that stage  they listen to his metaphors and analogies and they start learning these little things that if they practice enough becomes the key to magic
  they learn that if you just stare at a student and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch you don 't have to say a word because they know that that means that you want more  
 and if we could transform teacher education
 to focus on teaching teachers how to create that magic
 then poof we could make dead classes come alive we could reignite imaginations  and we can change education thank you
