  over our lifetimes we 've all contributed to climate change  actions  choices and behaviors
 will have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions
  and i think that that 's quite a powerful thought but it does have the potential to make us feel guilty
 when we think about decisions we might have made around where to travel to how often and how 
 about the energy that we choose to use in our homes or in our workplaces 
 or quite simply the lifestyles that we lead and enjoy  
 but we can also turn that thought on its head
  and think that if we 've had such a profound
 but a negative impact on our climate already  
 then we have an opportunity to influence the amount of future climate change that we will need to adapt to 
 so we have a choice we can either choose
 to start to take climate change seriously  and significantly cut and mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions
  then we will have to adapt to less of the climate change impacts in future  
 alternatively  we can continue to really ignore the climate change problem  
 but if we do that we are also choosing to adapt to very much more powerful climate impacts in future  
 and not only that as people who live in countries with high per capita emissions we 're making that choice on behalf
  of others as well  but the choice that we don 't have is a no climate change future 
 over the last two decades our government negotiators and policymakers have been coming together to discuss climate change  
 and they 've been focused on avoiding a two degree centigrade warming above pre industrial levels 
 that 's the temperature
  associated with dangerous impacts across a range of different indicators 
 to humans and to the environment so two degrees centigrade constitutes dangerous climate change  
 but dangerous climate change can be subjective  so if we think about an extreme weather event that might happen in some part of the world  
 and if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure where there are people that are
 well insured and so on 
 then that impact can be disruptive  it can cause upset it could cause cost it could even cause some deaths  
 but if that exact same weather event happens in a part of the world
 where there is poor infrastructure 
 or where people are not well insured or they 're not having good support networks then that same climate change impact could be devastating
 it could cause a significant loss of home but it could also cause significant amounts of death  
 so this is a graph of the co2 emissions at the left hand side from fossil fuel and industry  and time from before the industrial revolution out towards the present day  
 and what 's immediately striking about this is that emissions have been growing exponentially
  if we focus in on a shorter period of time from one thousand nine hundred and fifty we have established in 
 the intergovernmental panel on climate change  
 the rio earth summit in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two then rolling on a few years in two thousand and nine we had the copenhagen accord where it
  temperature rise in keeping with the science and on the basis of equity  
 and then in two thousand and twelve we had the rio + twenty event and all the way through during all of these meetings and many others as well 
 emissions have continued to rise  
 and if we focus on our historical emission trend in recent years  
 and we put that together with our understanding of the direction of travel in our global economy
 then we are much more on track for a four degree centigrade global warming than we are for the two degree centigrade 
 now let 's just pause for a moment and think about this  four degree global average temperature 
 most of our planet is actually made up of the sea 
 now because the sea has a greater thermal inertia than the land the average temperatures over land
  are actually going to be higher than they are over the sea  
 the second thing is that we as human beings don 't experience global average temperatures we experience hot days cold days  rainy days especially if you live in manchester like me 
 so now put yourself in a city center  imagine somewhere in the world
  's the hottest day that you 've ever experienced there 's sun beating down there 's concrete and glass all around you  
 now imagine that same day but it 's six eight  maybe ten to twelve degrees warmer
 on that day during that heat wave that 's the kind of thing we 're going to experience under a four degree global
  and the problem with these extremes and not just the temperature extremes but also the extremes in terms of storms and other climate impacts is our infrastructure is just not set 
  up to deal with these sorts of events  so our roads and our rail networks have been designed to last for a long time and withstand only certain amounts of impacts in different parts of the world  and this is going to be extremely
  our power stations are expected to be cooled by water to a certain temperature to remain effective and resilient  
 and our buildings are designed to be comfortable within a particular temperature range  
 and this is all going to be significantly challenged under a four degree type scenario our infrastructure has not been designed to cope with this  
 so if we go back also thinking about four degrees it 's not just the direct
  impacts but also some indirect impacts  so if we take food security for example  maize and wheat yields
 in some parts of the world are expected to be up to forty percent lower
 under a four degree scenario  rice up to thirty percent lower this will be absolutely devastating for global food security  
 so all in all the kinds of impacts
  anticipated under this four degree centigrade scenario are going to be incompatible with global organized living 
 so back to our trajectories and our graphs of four degrees and two degrees 
 is it reasonable still to focus on the two degree path there are quite a lot of my colleagues and other scientists who would say that it 's now too late to avoid
 warming 
 but i would just like to draw on my own research on energy systems on food systems  aviation and also shipping 
 just to say that i think there is still a small fighting chance of avoiding this two degree dangerous climate change but we really need to get to grips with the numbers to work out how to
  so if you focus in on this trajectory and these graphs the yellow circle there highlights that the departure from the red four degree pathway to the  two degree green pathway
 is immediate  
 and that 's because of cumulative emissions  or the carbon budget  
 so in other words  because of the lights and the projectors that are on in this room right now 
  that is going into our atmosphere as a result of that electricity consumption
 lasts a very long time some of it will be in our atmosphere for a century maybe much longer it will accumulate  and greenhouse gases tend to be cumulative  
 and that tells us something about these trajectories first of all it tells us that it 's the area under these curves that matter not where we reach at a particular date in future  and that 's important because it doesn 't matter if we come up with some amazing
  sort out our energy problem on the last day of 
  just in the nick of time to sort things out because in the meantime emissions will have accumulated  
 so if we continue on this red four degree centigrade scenario pathway 
 the longer we continue on it that will need to be made up for in later years to keep the same carbon budget to keep the same area under the curve
  which means that that trajectory the red one there becomes steeper  so in other words if we don 't reduce emissions in the short to medium term then we 'll have to make more significant year on year emission reductions 
 we also know that we have to decarbonize our energy system 
 but if we don 't start to cut emissions in the short to medium term  then we will have to do that even sooner  
 so this poses really big
  challenges for us 
 the other thing it does is tells us something about energy policy 
 if you live in a part of the world where per capita emissions are already high it points us towards reducing energy demand  
 and that 's because with all the will in the world the large scale engineering infrastructure that we need to roll out rapidly to decarbonize the supply side of our energy system
  is just simply not going to happen in time  
 so it doesn 't matter whether we choose nuclear power or carbon capture and storage  upscale our biofuel production or go for a much bigger roll out of wind turbines and wave turbines all of that will take time 
 so because it 's the area under the curve that matters we need to focus on energy efficiency  but also on energy conservation in other words  using less energy
  and if we do that that also means that as we continue to roll out the supply side technology 
 we will have less of a job to do if we 've actually managed to reduce our energy consumption because we will then need less infrastructure on the on the supply side 
 another issue that we really need to grapple with is the issue
  and equity there are many parts of the world where the standard of living needs to rise 
 bbut with energy systems currently currently reliant on fossil fuel as those economies grow so will emissions 
 and now if we 're all constrained by the same amount of carbon budget 
 that means that if some parts of the world 's emissions are needing to rise  then other parts of the world 's emissions need to reduce 
 so that poses very significant
  challenges for wealthy nations  
 because according to our research 
 if you 're in a country where per capita emissions are really high so north america europe australia
 emissions reductions of the order of ten percent per year and starting immediately will be required for a good chance
  let me just put that into context  the economist nicholas stern said that emission reductions of more than one percent per year had only ever been associated with economic recession or upheaval  
 so this poses huge challenges for the issue of economic growth  
 because if we have our high carbon infrastructure
  it means that if our economies grow  then so do our emissions  
 so i 'd just like to take a quote from a paper by myself and kevin anderson back in two thousand and eleven
 where we said that to avoid the two degree framing of dangerous climate change  economic growth
 needs to be exchanged at least temporarily for a period of planned austerity in wealthy nations 
 this is a really difficult
  message to take because what it suggests is that we really need to do things differently  this is not about
 just incremental change this is about
 doing things differently about whole system change and sometimes it 's about doing less things  and this applies to all of us 
 whatever sphere of influence we have
  so it could be from writing to our local politician
 to talking to our boss at work or being the boss at work or talking with our friends and family or quite simply changing our lifestyles  
 because we really need to make significant change 
 at the moment we 're choosing a four degree scenario if we really want to avoid the two degree scenario  there really is no time
 like the present to act  thank you bruno giussani alice
  basically what you 're saying the talk is unless wealthy nations start cutting ten percent per year the emissions now this year not in two thousand and
 scenario i
 am wondering what 's your take on the cut by seventy percent for two thousand and seventy alice bows larkin yeah it 's just nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees one of the things that often
 when there are these modeling studies that look at what we need to do is they tend to hugely overestimate how quickly other countries in the world can start to reduce emissions so
 they make kind of heroic assumptions about that
 the more we do that because it 's the cumulative emissions the short term stuff that really matters so it does make a huge difference if a big country like china for example continues to grow even for just a few extra 
  years that will make a big difference to when we need to decarbonize so i don 't think we can even say when it will be because it all depends on what we have to do in the short term  but i think we 've just got huge scope and we don 't pull those levers that
