  have something in common their interests in business lie on or near the earth 's surface  the odd one out is an
  my talk will be in two parts i 'll talk first as an astronomer  and then as a worried member of the human race  
 but let 's start off
 by remembering that darwin showed how we 're the outcome of four billion years of evolution  
 and what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before darwin 's simple beginning to set our earth in a cosmic context
  and let me just run through a few slides 
 this was the impact that happened last week on a comet
  if they 'd sent a nuke  it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last monday so that 's another project for nasa that 's
 mars from the european mars express
  this artist 's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on titan  saturn 's giant moon 
 it landed on the surface  this is pictures taken on the way down that looks like a coastline it is indeed but the ocean is liquid methane the temperature minus one hundred and seventy degrees centigrade 
 if we go beyond our solar system
  twinkly points of light each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it 
 and we can see places where stars are forming like the eagle nebula  
 we see stars dying in six billion years the sun will look like that 
 and some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion leaving remnants like that 
 on a still bigger
  we see entire galaxies of stars we see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled 
 and to the cosmologist these galaxies are just the atoms as it were of the large scale universe 
 this picture shows a patch of sky
 so small that it would take about one hundred patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky  through a small telescope this would look quite blank
  but you see here hundreds of of little faint smudges  
 each is a galaxy fully like ours or andromeda 
 which looks so small and faint because its light has taken ten billion light years to get to us 
 the stars in those galaxies probably don 't have
 planets around them there 's scant chance of life there that 's because there 's been no time for the
 nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron the building blocks of planets and
  of life we believe that all of this emerged from a big bang
 a hot dense state 
 so how did that amorphous big bang turn into our complex cosmos i 'm going to show you a movie simulation
 sixteen powers of ten faster than real time which shows a patch
  of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out  but you see 
 as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom you will see structures evolve as gravity feeds on small  dense irregularities and structures develop and we 'll end up after thirteen billion years with something looking rather like our
 own universe  
 and we compare simulated universes like that i 'll show you a better simulation at the end of my talk with what we
  actually see in the sky  well  we can trace things back
 to the
 earlier stages of the big bang but we still don 't know what banged and why it banged that 's a challenge for 21st century science 
 if my research group had a logo it would be this picture here
  an ouroboros where you see the micro world on the left
 the world of the quantum
 and on the right the large scale universe of
 planets stars and galaxies 
 we know our universes are united though links between left and right the everyday world is determined by atoms how they stick together to make molecules stars
 are fueled by how the
  nuclei in those atoms react together and as we 've learned in the last few years galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so called dark matter  
 particles in huge swarms far smaller even than atomic nuclei  but
 we 'd like to know
 the synthesis symbolized at the very top the micro world of the quantum is understood 
 on the right hand side gravity holds sway einstein explained that  but the unfinished business for
  science is to link together
 cosmos and micro world with a unified theory symbolized as it were gastronomically at the top of that picture 
 and until we have that synthesis we won 't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe because when our universe was itself the size of an atom 
 quantum effects could shake everything 
 and so we need a theory that unifies the very large and the very small which we don 't
  yet have 
 one idea incidentally and i had this hazard sign to say i 'm going to speculate from now on
 is that our big bang was not the only one one idea is that
 our three dimensional universe may be embedded in a high dimensional space just as you can imagine
 on these sheets of
  you can imagine ants on one of them thinking it 's a two dimensional universe not being aware of another population of ants on the other 
 so there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours  
 but we 're not aware of it because that millimeter is measured in some fourth spatial dimension  and we 're imprisoned in our three  
 and so
 we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality than what we 've normally called our universe the aftermath of our big bang  and here 's another picture bottom right depicts our universe
  is not beyond that but even that is just one bubble as it were in some vaster reality 
 many people suspect that just as we 've gone from believing in one solar system to zillions of solar systems one galaxy to many galaxies we have to go to
 many big bangs from one big bang perhaps these many big bangs displaying an immense variety of properties  well  let 's go back to this picture
  one challenge symbolized at the top  but there 's another challenge to science
 symbolized at the bottom you want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small  but we want to understand the very complex and the most complex things are ourselves 
 midway between atoms and stars we depend on stars to make the atoms we 're made of we depend on
 chemistry
 to determine our complex structure
  clearly have to be large compared to atoms 
 to have layer upon layer of complex structure  we clearly have to be small  compared to stars and planets otherwise we 'd be crushed by gravity and in fact we are midway  
 it would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us the geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is fifty kilograms within a factor of two of the mass of each person here
 the science
 of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right  
 and it 's this science which is not only
 enlightening our understanding of the biological world but also transforming our world faster than ever  
  more than that it 's engendering new kinds of change and i now move on to the second part of my talk and
 the book our final century was mentioned  if i was not
 a  self effacing brit i would mention the book myself  and i would add that it 's available in paperback 
 and in america it was called our
  in this century  not only has science changed the world faster than ever  but in new and different ways  
 targeted drugs genetic modification artificial intelligence 
 perhaps even implants into our brains may change human beings themselves and human beings their physique and character has not changed for thousands of years it may change this century  
 it 's new in our history
 and the human impact on the global environment greenhouse warming mass extinctions and so forth is unprecedented too and so this makes
 this coming century a challenge 
 bio and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign in that they offer marvelous prospects while nonetheless reducing pressure on energy and resources  
 but they will have a dark side
  in our interconnected world novel technology could empower just one fanatic 
 or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses to trigger some kind on disaster 
 indeed catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure
 error rather than terror and even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be
  of global consequence in fact some years ago  bill joy wrote an article
 expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over etc i don 't go along with all that but it 's interesting that he had a simple solution it was what he called 
  he wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science and keep the good bits now that 's absurdly naive for two reasons first
  any scientific discovery
 has benign consequences as well as dangerous ones  
 and also when a scientist makes a discovery he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be 
 and so what this means is that
 we have to accept the risks if we are going to enjoy the benefits of
  we have to accept that there will be hazards  and i think we have to
 go back to what happened in the
 post war era post world war ii when the nuclear scientists who 'd been involved in making the atomic bomb in many cases were concerned
 that they should do all they could to alert the world to the dangers and they were inspired not by the young einstein 
  who did the great
 work in relativity but by the old einstein the icon
 of poster and t shirt who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws he was premature but he was a moral compass an inspiration to scientists who were
 concerned with arms control and perhaps the greatest living person is someone i 'm privileged to know joe rothblatt  equally untidy office there as you can see
 and he founded the pugwash movement he persuaded einstein as his last act to sign the famous memorandum of bertrand russell  and he
 sets an example of the concerned scientist  and i think
 to harness science optimally to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed  we need  latter day counterparts of people like joseph rothblatt  
 we need not not just campaigning
  physicists but we need biologists computer experts and environmentalists as well  
 and i think academics and independent entrepreneurs have a special obligation because they have more freedom than those in government service or company employees subject to commercial pressure 
 i wrote my book our final century as a scientist 
 just a general scientist but there 's one respect i think in which being a cosmologist offered a
  special perspective  and that 's that it offers an awareness of the immense future  
 the stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past are now part of common culture
 outside the american bible belt anyway  but most people even those who are familiar with evolution 
  mindful that even more time lies ahead the sun has been shining for four and a half billion years  but it 'll be another six billion years
 before its fuel runs out on that schematic picture a sort of time lapse picture we 're halfway  and
 it 'll be another six billion before that happens and any remaining life on earth is
  an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there experiencing the sun 's demise  but any life and intelligence that exists then
 will be as different from us as we are from bacteria  the unfolding of intelligence and complexity
 still has immensely far to go here on earth and probably far beyond so we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity
  if you represent the earth 's lifetime by a single year  
 say from january when it was made to december the 21st century would be a quarter of a second
 in june
 a tiny fraction of the year  but even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective our century is very very
  the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet 
 as i should have shown this earlier  
 it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria  
 when einstein died 
 one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon by herblock in the washington post
  albert einstein lived here 
 and i 'd like to end with a vignette as it were inspired by this image  we 've been familiar for forty years
 with this image the fragile beauty of
 land ocean and clouds  contrasted with the sterile moonscape on which the astronauts left their footprints  
 but let 's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot in the cosmos
 from afar not
  just for forty years  but for the entire four point five billion year history of our earth 
 what would they have seen  over nearly all that immense time earth 's appearance would have changed very gradually 
 the only abrupt worldwide change would have been
 major asteroid impacts or volcanic
  apart from those brief traumas nothing happens suddenly  
 the continental landmasses drifted around ice cover waxed and waned successions of new species emerged evolved and became extinct  
 but in just a tiny sliver of the earth 's history 
 the last one millionth part a few thousand years  the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before 
 this signaled the start of agriculture change has accelerated as human
  populations rose 
 then other things happened even more abruptly  within just fifty years that 's one hundredth of one millionth of the earth 's age
 the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
 started to rise and ominously fast  the planet became an intense emitter of radio waves the total output from all tv
 and cell phones and radar transmissions  and something else happened
 metallic objects albeit very small ones a few tons at most
 escaped into orbit around the earth some journeyed to the moons and planets a race of advanced extraterrestrials
 watching our solar system from afar
 could confidently predict earth 's final doom in another six billion years  but could they have predicted this unprecedented spike less than
  halfway through the earth 's life 
 these human induced alterations occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime and seemingly occurring with runaway speed 
 if they continued their vigil 
 what might these hypothetical aliens witness in the next hundred years 
 will some spasm foreclose
  or will the biosphere stabilize 
 or will some of the metallic objects launched from the earth spawn new oases oases a post human life elsewhere  
 the science done by the young einstein will continue as long as our civilization but for civilization to survive we 'll need the wisdom of the old einstein
 humane global and farseeing and whatever happens
 in this uniquely crucial century will resonate into
  remote future and perhaps far beyond the earth far beyond the earth as depicted here  thank you very much
