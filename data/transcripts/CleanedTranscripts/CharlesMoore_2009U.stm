  let 's talk trash 
 you know
  we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the great depression and world war ii 
 after the war we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime life
  magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes  
 mental note to the liberators  throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don 't biodegrade only we humans make waste that nature can 't digest 
 plastics are also hard to recycle a teacher told me how to express the
 under five percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream
  's diddly point squat that 's the percentage we recycle
  now  melting point has a lot to do with this plastic is not purified by the  re melting process like glass and metal it begins to 
  melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge
  half of each year 's one hundred billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into 
 trash a large  unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea here is the accumulation at biona creek next to the l a airport 
 and here is the flotsam near california state university long beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday 
 in spite of deposit fees
  much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles we use two million of them in the united states every five minutes here imaged by ted presenter chris jordan 
 who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail 
  rookery off baja 's sparsely populated central coast notice that the bottles here have caps on them 
 bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate pet will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization also the caps are produced in separate factories 
  from a different plastic polypropylene they will float in seawater but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills
  let 's trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo  
 after a year the ones from japan are heading straight across the pacific while ours get caught in the california current and first head down to the latitude of cabo san lucas  
 after ten years a lot of the japanese caps are in what we call the eastern garbage patch while ours litter the philippines  
 after twenty years we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the north pacific gyre
 it so happens that millions of albatross nesting on kure and midway atolls
 in the northwest hawaiian islands national monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks 
 a four month old laysan albatross chick died with this in its stomach 
 hundreds of thousands of the
  stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish like cigarette lighters  
 but mostly bottle caps sadly their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface 
 the retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals this is mae west  still alive at a zookeeper 's home in new orleans
  i wanted to see what my home town of long beach was contributing to the problem so on coastal clean up day in two thousand and five i went to the long beach peninsula at the east end of our long beach we cleaned 
  up the swaths of beach shown i offered five cents each for bottle caps i got plenty of takers 
  i separated them by color and put them on display the next earth day at cabrillo marine aquarium in san pedro  
 governor schwarzenegger and his wife maria stopped by to discuss the display in spite of my girly man hat crocheted from plastic shopping bags they shook my hand 
 laughter i showed him and maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of hawaii with more plastic than
  plankton here 's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like 
 trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this and this  
 now when the debris washes up on the beaches of hawaii it looks like this 
 and this particular beach is kailua beach the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to
  washington  now how do we analyze samples
 like this one that contain more plastic than plankton  
 we sort the plastic fragments into different size classes from five millimeters to one third of a millimeter  
 small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding
  we wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean at the base of the food chain was ingesting these poison pills  
 we did hundreds of necropsies 
 and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs the record holder only two and a half inches long had eighty four pieces in its tiny stomach  
 now  you can buy certified organic produce  but no fishmonger
  is the legacy
 we are leaving to future generations  
 the throwaway society cannot be contained it has gone global we simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff we have to throw it away  
 now  the market can do a lot for us  but it can 't fix the natural system in the ocean we 've broken all the king 's horses and all the king 's men
 will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again narrator the
 levels are increasing  
 the amount of packaging is increasing  the throwaway concept of living is proliferating and it 's showing up in the ocean anchor 
 he offers no hope of cleaning it up straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country
  kill untold amounts of sea life in the process 
 the solution moore says is to stop the plastic at its source  stop it on land before it falls in the ocean 
 and in a plastic wrapped and packaged world he doesn 't hold out much hope for that either
