  if you look
 deep into the night sky 
 you see stars and if you look further you see more stars  and further galaxies and further more galaxies but if you keep looking
 further and further  eventually you see nothing
 for a long while
  and then finally you see a faint fading afterglow  and it 's the afterglow of the big bang  
 now the big bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small incredibly hot incredibly roiling mass  
 and from it sprung everything we see 
 now we 've mapped
 that afterglow with
  great precision  and when i say we i mean people who aren 't me we 've mapped the afterglow with spectacular precision and one of the shocks about it is that it 's almost completely 
 uniform fourteen billion light years that way and fourteen billion light years that way it 's the same temperature now it 's been fourteen billion years since
  and so it 's got faint and cold it 's now two point seven degrees  but it 's not exactly two point seven degrees it 's only two point seven degrees to about
 ten parts in a million  over here it 's a little hotter and over there it 's a little cooler  
 and that 's incredibly important to everyone in this room because where it was a little hotter there was a little more stuff  and where there was a little more stuff we have galaxies and clusters
  and all the structure you see in the cosmos  and those small little 
 twenty parts in a million  
 those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles in that early universe that were stretched across the size of the entire cosmos  that is spectacular  and that 's not what they found on monday what they found on monday is cooler  
 so here 's what they found on monday  
  you take a bell and you whack the bell with a hammer what happens it rings but if you wait that ringing fades and fades and fades until you don 't notice it anymore 
 now that early universe was incredibly dense like a metal way denser  and if you hit it it would ring  but the thing ringing
 would be the structure of space time itself  and the hammer would be quantum
  what they found on monday
 was evidence of the ringing of the space time of the early universe what we call gravitational waves from the fundamental era  and here 's how they found it 
 those waves have long since faded if you go for a walk you don 't wiggle  those gravitational waves in the structure of space
 are totally invisible for all practical purposes but early on when the universe was making that last afterglow the gravitational waves
 put little twists in the structure of the light that we see
  so by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper in fact these guys spent three years on the south pole looking straight up through the coldest clearest  cleanest air they possibly could find
 looking deep into the night sky and studying that glow and looking for the faint twists which are the symbol the signal of gravitational waves
  waves the ringing of the early universe  
 and on monday they announced that they had found it  
 and the thing that 's so spectacular about that to me is not just the ringing though that is awesome the thing that 's totally amazing the reason i 'm on this stage is because what that tells us 
 is something deep about the early universe it tells us that we and everything we see around us are basically one large bubble and this is the
  idea of inflation one large bubble surrounded by something else this isn 't conclusive evidence for inflation but anything that isn 't inflation that explains this will look the 
  same this is a theory an idea that has been around for a while and we never thought we we 'd really see it for good reasons we thought we 'd never see
  really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger roiling pot of universal stuff we
 're never going to see the stuff outside  but by going to the south pole and spending three years looking at the detailed structure of the night sky we can figure out
 that we 're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that and that amazes me  thanks a lot
