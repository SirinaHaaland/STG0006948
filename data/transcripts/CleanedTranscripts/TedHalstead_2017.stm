  daughter named naya who is under the mistaken impression that this conference is named in honor of her father 
 who am i to contradict my baby girl
  as many of you know there 's something about becoming a parent that concentrates the mind on long term problems like climate change  
 it was the birth of my daughter that inspired me to launch this climate organization in order to counteract the excessive polarization of this issue in the united states 
  and to find a conservative pathway forward  
  know what it may even be better 
 let me try to prove that to you 
 what we really need is a killer app to climate policy in the technology world a killer app is an application so transformative that it creates its own market like uber 
 in the climate world a killer app is a new solution
  so promising that it can break through the seemingly insurmountable barriers to progress these include
 the psychological barrier 
 climate advocates have long been encouraging their fellow citizens to make short term sacrifices now for benefits that accrue to other people in other countries thirty or forty years in the future it just doesn 't fly because it runs contrary to basic human
  nature 
 next is the geopolitical barrier  under the current rules of global trade countries have a strong incentive to free ride off the emissions reductions 
 of other nations  instead of strengthening their own programs this has been the curse of every international climate negotiations  including
  we have the partisan barrier 
 even the most committed countries germany the united kingdom  canada are nowhere near reducing emissions at the required scale and speed 
 not even close  and the partisan climate divide is far more acute here in the united states  
  why we need a killer app of climate policy to break through
 each of these barriers i 'm convinced
 that the road to climate progress in the united states runs through the republican party and the business community 
 so in launching the climate leadership council i started by reaching out to a who 's who of republican elder statesmen and
  james baker and george schultz the two most respected republican elder statesmen in america 
 martin feldstein and greg mankiw  the two most respected conservative economists in the country 
 and henry paulson and rob walton two of the most successful and admired business leaders  together 
 we co authored the conservative case for carbon dividends this
  this represents the first time that republican leaders put forth a concrete
 climate solution thank you 
 we presented our plan at the white house two weeks after president trump moved in 
 almost every leading editorial board in the country has since endorsed our plan
  fortune one hundred companies from a wide range of industries are now getting behind it 
 so by now you 're probably wondering what exactly is this plan well  our carbon dividends solution is based on four pillars the first 
 is a gradually rising carbon tax although capitalism is a wonderful system  like many operating systems it
  by far the largest is that market prices fail to take social and environmental costs into account that means every market transaction is based on incorrect information
 this fundamental bug of capitalism more than any other single factor  is to blame for our climate predicament 
  this should be an easy problem to fix 
 economists agree that the best solution is to put a price on the carbon content of fossil fuels  otherwise known as a carbon tax this would 
 discourage carbon emissions in every single economic transaction every day of the year  however a carbon tax by itself has proven to be unpopular and a political dead end 
 directly to citizens in the form of equal monthly dividends  
 this would transform an unpopular carbon tax into a popular and populist solution and it would also solve
 the underlying psychological barrier that we discussed by giving everyone a
 concrete benefit in the here and now 
 and these benefits would be significant  assuming a carbon tax rate that starts at forty dollars per ton 
 a family of four would receive two thousand dollars per year from the get go 
 according to the us treasury department  
 the bottom seventy percent of americans would receive more in dividends than they would pay in increased
  million americans would win economically from solving climate change  and that 
 is revolutionary  and could fundamentally alter climate politics 
 but there 's another revolutionary element here the amount of the dividend
 would grow as the carbon tax rate increases  the more we
  protect our climate  the more our citizens benefit this creates a positive feedback loop which is crucial because the only way we will reach our 
  goals is if the carbon tax rate goes up every year  the third pillar of our program is eliminating regulations that are no longer
  carbon dividends plan is enacted this is a key selling point to republicans and business leaders  
 so why should we trade
 climate regulations for a price on carbon well  let me show you 
 our plan would achieve nearly twice the emissions reductions of all
  and nearly three times the new baseline after president trump repeals all of those regulations that assumes
 a carbon tax starting at forty dollars per ton which translates into roughly an extra thirty six cents per gallon per gallon of gas 
 our plan by itself would meet the high end of america 's commitment under the paris climate agreement and as you can see the emissions
  reductions would continue over time  
 this illustrates the power of a conservative climate solution based on free markets and limited government we would end up with 
 less regulation and far less pollution at the same time  while helping working class americans get ahead doesn 't that sound like something we could all support
 the fourth and final pillar of our program is a new climate 
 domino effect based on border carbon adjustments now that may sound complicated  but it too is revolutionary because it provides us a whole new strategy to reach a global price on carbon  which is ultimately what we need 
  an example  
 suppose country a adopts a carbon dividends plan and country b does not well to level the playing field and protect the competitiveness 
 of its industries country a would tax imports from country b based on their carbon content 
  gets really interesting  because the money raised at the border would increase the dividends going to the citizens of country a well how long do you think it would take the public in 
  country b to realize that that money should be going to them  and to push for a carbon dividends plan in their own land 
  follow suit one by one the dominoes fall 
 and this domino effect could start anywhere my preference  strongly is the united states  
 but it could also start in the united kingdom  in germany or another european country or even in china 
 let 's take china as an example china is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions but what its leaders care even
  more about is transitioning their economy to consumer led economic development well nothing could do more to hasten that transition than giving every chinese 
  citizen a monthly dividend in fact  this is the only policy solution that would enable china to meet its environmental and economic goals at the same
  that 's why this is the killer app of climate policy because it would enable us to overcome each of the barriers we discussed earlier  the psychological barrier  
 the partisan barrier and as we 've just seen the geopolitical barrier 
 all we need is a country to lead the way  and one method of finding what you 're looking for is to take out an ad  so let 's read this one together  wanted country to pioneer carbon dividends plan
  cost to country zero 
 starting date as soon as possible  advantages most effective climate solution popular and populist pro growth and pro business shrinks government and helps the working class  
 additional compensation gratitude of
  i 've seen a conservative get a standing o at ted before that that 's pretty cool 
  the logic seems really powerful but some people you talk to in politics say
 it 's hard to imagine this still getting through congress how are you feeling about momentum behind this ted halstead 
 so i understand that many are very pessimistic about what 's happening in the united states with president trump i 'm less pessimistic here 's why  
 the actions of this white house the early actions on climate are just the first move in a complex game of climate chess  so far it 's been a
  strategy  the pressure is going to mount for a replacement program which is where we come in and there are three reasons why which i 'll go through real quickly one the business community is fundamentally 
  parting ways with the white house on climate change in fact we 're finding a number of fortune one hundred companies supporting our program  within two months we 're going to be announcing some really surprising names coming out in favor of this
  no issue in american politics where there 's a more fundamental gap between the republican base and the republican leadership than climate change  and three 
 thinking of this analogy of chess  
 the big decision up ahead is does the administration stay in paris  well let 's pan it out both ways if it stays in paris as many are pushing for in the administration well then that begs a question what
  the plan  we have the plan  but if they don 't stay in paris  the international pressure will be overwhelming our secretary of state will be asking other countries for nato contributions and they 'll be saying no 
 give us our paris commitment come through on your commitments we 'll come through on ours so international business and even the republican base will all be calling for a republican replacement plan and hopefully we 've provided one
