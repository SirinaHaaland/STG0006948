  how do you observe something you can 't see this is the basic question of somebody who 's interested in finding and studying black holes  
 because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it not even light so you
 can 't see it directly
  story today about black holes is about one particular black hole  i 'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive what we like to call supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy  
 and the reason this is interesting is that
 it gives us an opportunity to
 prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist and second it gives us the opportunity
  to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment  
 and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in 
 so to begin with we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole  so what is a black hole  
 well in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object because
  three characteristics that you can describe the mass  
 the spin  and the charge  and i 'm going to only talk about the mass  so in that sense it 's a very simple object  but in another sense it 's an incredibly complicated object that we 
  need relatively exotic physics to describe and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding
  of the universe  
 but today the way i want you to understand a black hole for the proof of a black hole is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume  
 so  despite the fact that i 'm going to talk to you about an object that 's supermassive  and i 'm going to get to what that really means in a moment  
 it has no finite size so this is a little tricky  
 but fortunately there is a finite size that you can see  and that 's known as the schwarzschild radius
  and that 's named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius  this is a virtual radius not reality the black hole has no size  so why is it so important  
 it 's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole 
 that means you your neighbor your cellphone  the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it down to the size of the schwarzschild radius
 at that point  what 's going to happen at that point gravity wins gravity wins over all other known forces  and the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object and then it 's a black hole  
 so  if i were to compress the earth down to the size of a sugar cube it would become a black hole  because the size of a sugar cube
  the key here is to figure out what that schwarzschild radius is  and it turns out that it 's actually pretty simple to figure out it depends only on the mass of the object bigger objects have 
  bigger schwarzschild radii smaller objects have smaller schwarzschild radii so  if i were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the university of oxford  it would become a black hole  
  is and it 's actually quite a useful concept because it tells us not only when a black hole will form  but it also gives us gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole  i only need 
  two things i need to understand the mass of the object i 'm claiming is a black hole  and what its schwarzschild radius is  and since the mass determines the schwarzschild radius there is actually only one thing i really
  my job in convincing you that there is a black hole
 is to show that there is some object that 's confined to within its schwarzschild
 radius  and your job today is to be skeptical okay  so
 i 'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole i 'm going to talk about supermassive black holes so i wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole
 an ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star 's life
  so if a star starts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the sun  it 's going to end its life by exploding and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here 
  and inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the sun on an astronomical scale that 's a very
 small black hole  now what i want to talk about are the supermassive black holes and the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies  
 and this beautiful picture taken with the hubble space telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes there are big ones there are little ones  almost every object in that picture 
  there is a galaxy  and there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left and there are a hundred billion
  that galaxy just to give you a sense of scale  
 and all the light that we see from a typical galaxy which is the kind of galaxies that we 're seeing here comes from the light from the stars so we see the galaxy because of the star light 
 now there are a few relatively exotic galaxies i like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world because they are kind of show offs  
 and we call them active galactic nuclei and we call them that because their nucleus or their
  are very active 
 so at the center there that 's actually where most of the starlight comes out from and yet what we actually see is light that can 't be explained by the starlight it 's way 
  more energetic  in fact in a few examples it 's like the ones that we 're seeing here  there are also jets emanating out from the center  again a source of energy that 's very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars  
 matter is falling on to so you can 't see the black hole itself but
 you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see so there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies but it 's a kind of indirect
 argument nonetheless  it 's given rise to the notion that maybe it 's not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes but rather all galaxies
 might harbor these
  supermassive black holes at their centers  and if that 's the case and this is an example of a normal galaxy what we see is the star light and if there is a supermassive black hole  what we need to assume 
  is that it 's a black hole on a diet  because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei 
  own galaxy  our milky way  and this is a wide field picture taken of the center of the milky way  and what we see is a line of stars 
  and that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened disk like structure and we live in the middle of it so when we look towards the center we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy or line that defines the plane of the galaxy  
  it 's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we 're ever going to have  because the next closest galaxy is one hundred times further away 
 so we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else  and as you 'll see in a moment the ability to see detail is key to this experiment 
 so how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass inside a small volume which is the job that i have to show you today
  the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole  
 stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun it 's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit if there were no massive objects these things would go
 flying off or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit so this is great
  because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume so if i know how fast it goes around i know the mass  and if i know the scale of the orbit i know the radius  so i want to see 
  the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible  
  and that 's the reason that for this experiment we 've used the world 's largest telescope this is the keck observatory it hosts two telescopes with a mirror ten meters which is roughly
 the diameter of a tennis court  now  this is wonderful  because the
 campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope the smaller the detail that we can see  
 but it turns out these telescopes or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge
 living up to this campaign promise  and that is because
  the atmosphere atmosphere is great for us it allows us to survive here on earth  but it 's relatively challenging for astronomers who want to look through the atmosphere 
  to astronomical sources so to give you a sense of what this is like it 's actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream  
  pebble on the bottom of the of the stream very much in the same way it 's very difficult to see astronomical sources because of the the atmosphere that 's continuously moving by so i 've spent a lot of my career 
  working on ways to correct for the the atmosphere to give us a cleaner view  and that buys us about a factor of twenty  and i think all of you can agree that if you can figure out how to improve life by a factor of twenty  you 've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot say your
  salary  you 'd notice or your kids you 'd notice
  and this animation here shows you one example of the techniques that we use called adaptive optics you 're seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don 't use this 
  technique in other words just a picture that shows the stars and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy where we think
 black hole is so without this technology you can 't see the stars  with this technology all of a sudden you can see it this technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system 
 that 's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you so it 's kind of like
  although we 've looked at all of them 
 so i want to see how these things have moved and over the course of this experiment these stars have moved a tremendous amount so we 've been doing this experiment for fifteen years and we see the stars go all the way around 
 now most astronomers have a favorite star and mine today is a star that 's labeled up there so 2 absolutely my favorite star in the world  
 and that 's because it goes around in only fifteen years  and to give you a sense of how
  the sun takes two hundred million years to go around the center of the galaxy  stars that we knew about before that were as close to the center of the galaxy as possible  take five hundred years 
  and this one this one goes around in a human lifetime that 's kind of profound in a way  but it 's the key to this experiment the orbit tells me how much mass is inside a very small radius  
  center of the galaxy  what we knew before is that there was four million times the mass of the sun inside that circle  and as you can see there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle you can see a lot of stars 
 so there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy because you could put a lot of stuff in there  but with this experiment we 've confined
 that same mass to a much smaller volume that 's ten thousand times
 and because of that we 've been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there to give you a sense of how small that size is that 's the size of our solar system so we 're cramming four 
  million times the mass of the sun into that small volume  now  truth in advertising right i have told you my job is to get it down
  i 'm not quite there  but we actually have no alternative today to explaining this
 concentration of mass and in fact it 's the best evidence we have to date for not only existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy but any in our universe 
 so what next i actually think
 this is about as good as we 're going to do with today 's technology so let 's move on with the problem so  
 what i want to tell you very briefly is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy
  that we know that there is or at least we believe that there is a supermassive black hole there  
 and the fun phase of this experiment is while we 've tested some of our ideas about the consequences of a supermassive black hole
 being at the center of our galaxy  almost every single one has been inconsistent with what we actually see  and that 's the fun 
  let me give you the two examples you can ask what do you expect for the old stars stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time they 've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole what you 
  expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole you should see a lot of old stars next to that
  not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery to get a star to form you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse  and it 's a very fragile entity  and what does the big black 
  hole do it strips that gas cloud apart it pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart in fact we anticipated that star formation shouldn 't proceed in that environment so you shouldn 't see young stars  
 are red  the young ones are blue  and the yellow ones  we don 't know yet  so you can already see the surprise there is a dearth of old stars there is an abundance of young stars so it 's the exact opposite of the prediction  
 so  this is the fun part and in fact today this is what we 're trying to figure out this mystery of how do you get how do you resolve this contradiction  so in fact my graduate students are at this very moment
  telescope  in hawaii  making observations to get us
 hopefully to the next stage  where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars and so few
 old stars to make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away to do that we 'll probably need much more sophisticated technology than we have
  in truth while i said we 're correcting for the earth 's atmosphere we actually only correct for half the errors that are introduced  we do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere  and what we think we can do 
  is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest so this is what we hope to do in the next few years  and on a much longer
  and with this telescope we should be able to see stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy  and we hope to be able to test some of einstein 's theories of general relativity some ideas 
 in cosmology about how galaxies form so we think the future of this experiment is
  and i hope if nothing else  i 've convinced you that one we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy  and this means that these things do exist in our universe and we have to contend with this we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world 
 second we 've been able to look at that interaction of how supermassive black holes interact  and understand maybe the role in which
