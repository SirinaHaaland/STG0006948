  when people think about cities they tend to think of certain things they think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers noisy cabs  
 but when i think about cities i think about
  fundamentally about people and where people go and where people meet are at the core of what makes a city work  
 so even more important than buildings in a city
 are the public spaces in between them  
 and today some of the most transformative changes in cities are happening in these public spaces  
 so
  i believe that lively  enjoyable public spaces are the key to planning a great city  they are what makes it come alive  
 but what makes a public space work 
 what attracts people to successful public spaces  and what is it about unsuccessful places that keeps people away  
 i thought if i could answer those questions  i could make a huge contribution to my city
  but one of the more wonky things about me is that i am an animal behaviorist  
 and i use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces 
 one of the first spaces that i studied
 was this little vest pocket park called paley park in midtown manhattan this little space became
  a small phenomenon
  and because it had such a profound impact on new yorkers  it made an enormous impression on me 
 i studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather  so i knew that places like paley park didn 't happen
  i saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail  
 but what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it 
 well i would sit in the park and watch very carefully  and first among other things were the comfortable  movable chairs 
 people would come in find their own seat  move
  and then stay a while  and then interestingly people themselves attracted other people 
 and ironically  i felt more peaceful if there were other people around  
 and it was green this little park provided what new yorkers crave  comfort and greenery  
 but my question was why weren 't there more places with greenery and places to sit in the middle of the city where you didn 't feel alone
 or like a trespasser  
 unfortunately that 's not how cities were being designed 
 so here you see a familiar sight 
 this is how plazas have been designed for generations  they have that stylish spartan look that we often associate
  it 's not surprising that people avoid spaces like this they not only look desolate  they feel downright dangerous  
 i mean where would you sit here 
 what would you do here  
 but
 architects love them they are plinths for their creations  they might tolerate a sculpture
  but that 's about it 
 and for developers they are ideal there 's nothing to water nothing to maintain and no undesirable people to worry about 
 but don 't you think this is a waste 
 for me  becoming a city planner meant being able to truly change the city that i lived in and loved  
 i wanted to be able to create places that
 would give you the feeling that you got in paley park and not
  developers to build bleak plazas like this 
 but over the many years i have learned how hard it is to create successful meaningful enjoyable public spaces  
 as i learned from my stepfather they certainly do not happen by accident  
 especially in a city like new york where public space has
  to be fought for to begin with and then for them to be successful somebody has to think very hard about every detail  
 now  open spaces in cities are opportunities yes they are opportunities for commercial investment
  but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city
  and those two goals are often not aligned with one another  and therein lies the conflict the first opportunity i had to fight
 for a great public open space was in the early 1980s when i was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called battery park city in lower manhattan on the hudson river 
 and this sandy wasteland had lain barren for ten years and we were told unless we found a developer in six months it would go bankrupt  
 so we came up with a radical  almost insane idea
  instead of building a park as a complement to future development why don 't we reverse that equation
 and build a small but very high quality public open space first and see if that made a difference
  so we only could afford to build a two block section of what would become a mile long esplanade 
 so whatever we built had to be perfect
  just to make sure  i insisted that we build a mock up in wood at scale of the railing and the sea wall  
 and when i sat down on that test bench with sand still swirling all around me 
 the railing hit exactly at eye level  blocking my view and ruining my experience at the water 's edge  
 so you see
  do make a difference  but design is not just how something looks it 's how your body feels on that seat
 in that space  and i believe that successful design always depends on that very individual experience 
 in this photo  
 everything looks very finished  but that granite edge
  the back on that bench  the trees in planting and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be 
 now this proved very valuable twenty years later
 when michael bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of new york
  he said to me on that very day he said that new york was projected to grow from eight to nine million people and he asked me 
 so where are you going to put one million additional new yorkers 
 well  i didn 't have any idea
  now  you know that new york does place a high value on attracting immigrants so we were excited about the prospect of growth but
  honestly  where were we going to grow in a city that was already built out to its edges and surrounded by water 
 how were we going to find housing for that many new new yorkers  
 and if we couldn 't spread out which was probably a good thing  where could new housing go 
 and what about cars our city couldn 't possibly handle any more cars 
 what were we going to do 
 if we couldn 't spread out we had to go up 
 and if we had to go up we had to go up in places where you wouldn 't need to own a car  so that meant using one of our greatest assets 
 our transit system  but we had never before thought of how we could make the most of it 
 so here was the answer to our puzzle  
 if we were to
  channel and redirect all new development around transit we could actually handle that population increase we thought  
 and so here was the plan what we really needed to do we needed to redo our zoning
 and zoning is the city planner 's regulatory tool and basically reshape the entire city  targeting where new development could go
 and prohibiting any development at all in our 
  suburban style neighborhoods  well this was an unbelievably ambitious idea  ambitious
 because communities had to approve those plans  so how was i going to get this done by listening
  i began listening in fact  thousands of hours of listening
 just to establish trust you know communities can tell whether or not you understand their neighborhoods  it 's not something you can just fake  
 and so
 i began walking i can 't tell you how many blocks i walked in sweltering summers in freezing winters 
 year after year just so i could get to understand the dna of each neighborhood and know what
  each street felt like i became an incredibly geeky zoning expert finding ways that zoning could address communities ' concerns  
 so little by little neighborhood by neighborhood block by block we began to set height limits so that all new development would be predictable and near transit 
 over the course of twelve years we were able to rezone
  hundred and twenty four neighborhoods  forty percent of the city  
 twelve  thousand five hundred blocks so that now ninety percent of all new development of new york is within a 10 minute walk of a subway 
 in other words  nobody in those new buildings needs to own a car
 and important  but rezoning was never my mission 
 you can 't see zoning and you can 't feel zoning my mission was always to create great public spaces  
 so in the areas where we zoned for significant development i was determined to create places that would make a difference in people 's
  here you see what was two miles of abandoned degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of greenpoint and williamsburg in brooklyn 
 impossible to get to and impossible to use 
 now the zoning here was massive  so i felt an obligation
 to create magnificent parks on these waterfronts  and i spent an incredible amount of time on every square inch of these plans  
 i wanted to make sure that there were
  from the upland to the water that there were trees and plantings everywhere and of course lots and lots of places to sit 
 honestly  i had no idea how it would turn out  i had to have faith  
 but i put everything that i had studied and learned into those plans  
 and then it opened  and i have to tell you it was incredible people came from all over the city to
  be in these parks  i know they changed the lives of the people who live there  but they also changed new yorkers ' whole image of their city  
 i often come down and watch people get on this little ferry that now runs between the boroughs  
 and i can 't tell you why but i 'm completely moved by the fact that people are using it as if it had always been there 
 and here is a new park in lower manhattan
  now the water 's edge in lower manhattan was a complete mess before nine eleven 
 wall street was essentially landlocked because you couldn 't get anywhere near this edge  
 and after nine eleven the city had very little control  
 but i thought if we went to the lower manhattan development corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront
 that it would have an enormous effect on the
  of lower manhattan  and it did lower manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides
  i really love this park 
 you know  railings have to be higher now  so we put bar seating at the edge  
 and you can get so close to the water you 're practically on it and see how the railing widens and flattens out so you can lay down your lunch or your laptop
  and i love when people come there and look up and they say wow there 's brooklyn  and it 's so close 
 so what 's the trick  how do you turn a park
 into a place that people want to be  well  it 's up to you not as a city planner but as a human
  you don 't tap into your design expertise you tap into your humanity  
 i mean 
 would you want to go there would you want to stay there can you see into it and out of it are there other people there 
 does it seem green and friendly can you find your very own seat  
 well now all over new york city there are places where you can find your very own seat
  where there used to be parking spaces there are now pop up cafes 
 where broadway traffic used to run there are now tables and chairs  
 where twelve years ago sidewalk cafes were not allowed  they are now everywhere  
 but claiming these spaces for public use was not simple  and it 's even harder to keep them
  so now i 'm going to tell you a story about a very unusual park
 called the high line  
 the high line was an elevated railway applause
 the high line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on manhattan 's west side  
 and when the train stopped running it became a self seeded
  a kind of a garden in the sky  and when i saw it the first time  
 honestly when i went up on that old viaduct  i fell in love the way you fall in love with a person  honestly  
 and when i was appointed  saving the first two sections of the high line from demolition became my first priority and my most important project 
 i knew if there was a day that i
  worry about the high line  it would come down 
 and the high line  even though it is widely known now and phenomenally popular it is the most contested public space in the city 
 you might see a beautiful park  
 but not everyone does 
 you know  it 's true  commercial interests will always battle against public space 
  how wonderful it is that more than four million people come from all over the world to visit the high line 
 well a developer sees just one thing  customers  hey  why not take out those plantings and have shops all along the high line wouldn 't that be terrific and won 't it mean a lot more money for the city  
 well no it would not be terrific it would be a mall
  it might mean more money for the city  but a city has to take the long view the view for the common good 
 most recently  
 the last section of the high line the third section of the high line the final section of the high line has been pitted against development interests
  where some of the city 's leading developers are building more than seventeen million square feet at the hudson yards 
 and they came to me and proposed that they temporarily disassemble that third and final section
  perhaps the high line didn 't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a
  perhaps it was just in their way 
 but in any case it took nine months of nonstop daily negotiation to finally get the signed agreement to prohibit its demolition and that was only two years ago  
 so you see no matter how popular and successful a public space may be it can never be taken for granted public
  always this is it saved public spaces always need vigilant champions 
 not only to claim them at the outset for public use  but to design them for the people that use them 
 then to maintain them to ensure that they are for everyone that they are not violated invaded abandoned or ignored 
 if there is any one lesson that i have learned in my life as a city planner it is that public spaces have power
 it 's not just the number of people using them  it 's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there 
 public space can change how you live in a city  how you feel about a city  whether you choose one city over another  
 and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city
 i believe that a successful city is like a fabulous party 
 people stay because they are having a great time  thank you
