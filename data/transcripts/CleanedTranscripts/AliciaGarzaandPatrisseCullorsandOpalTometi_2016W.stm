  black lives matter important for the us right now
 and in the world patrisse cullors black lives matter is our call to action  it is a tool to reimagine
 a world where black people
  are free to exist free to live 
 it is a tool for our allies to show up differently for us  i grew up in a neighborhood that was heavily policed
 i witnessed my brothers and my siblings continuously stopped and frisked by law enforcement 
 i remember my home being raided and one of my questions
 as a child was why  why us black lives matter offers
 answers
 to the why  
 it offers a new vision for young black girls around the world that we deserve to be fought for 
 that we deserve to
  is not only happening in the united states it 's actually happening all across the globe  
 and what we need now more than ever is a human rights movement that challenges systemic racism in every single context
 because
 the global reality is that black people are subject to all sorts of disparities in most of our most challenging issues of our day  
 i think about issues like climate change 
 and how six of the ten worst impacted nations by climate change are actually on the continent of africa 
 people are
  reeling from all sorts of unnatural disasters  displacing them from their ancestral homes
 and leaving them without a chance at making a decent living 
 we also see disasters like hurricane matthew  
 which recently wreaked havoc in many different nations but caused the most damage to haiti 
 haiti is the poorest country in this
  hemisphere  and its inhabitants are black people 
 and what we 're seeing in haiti is that they were actually facing a number of challenges that even preceded this hurricane 
 they were reeling from the earthquake they were reeling from cholera that was brought in by un peacekeepers and still hasn 't been
  is unconscionable and this would not happen if this nation didn 't have a population that was black and we have to be real about that  
 but what 's most heartening right now is that despite these challenges 
 what we 're seeing is that there 's a network of africans all across the continent who are rising up and fighting back and demanding climate justice
  that when black people are free  everyone is free can you talk about what that means alicia garza sure 
 so i think race and racism is probably the most studied social economic and political phenomenon
 in this country but it 's also the least understood 
 the reality is that race in the united states operates on a spectrum from black to white doesn
  mean that people who are in between don 't experience racism  but it means that the closer you are to white on that spectrum 
 the better off you are and the closer to black that you are on that spectrum the worse off your are 
 when we think about how we address problems in this country  we often start from a place of
  so using white folks as the control we say well if we make things better for white folks then everybody else is going to get free  
 but actually it doesn 't work that way  we have to address problems at the root  and when you deal with what 's happening in black communities
  it creates an effervescence right so a bubble up rather than a trickle down  let me give an example when
 we talk about the wage gap  we often say women make
  to every dollar that a man makes you all have heard that before  
 but those are the statistics for white women and white men 
 the reality is that black women make something like sixty four cents to every seventy eight cents that white women make 
 when we talk about latinas  it goes down to about fifty eight cents if we were to talk about indigenous women if we were to talk about trans women it would even go further down
  so again if you deal with those who are the most impacted everybody has an opportunity to benefit from that rather than dealing with the folks who are not as impacted 
  and expecting it to trickle down mb so i love the effervescence bubbling
  you all have been doing this for a minute  and the last few years have been
 well i can 't even imagine but i 'm sure very transformative
  and i know that you all have learned a lot about leadership  what do you want to share with these people about what you 've learned about leadership patrisse let 's start with you pc 
  we have to invest in black leadership that 's what i 've learned the most in the last few years 
 what we 've seen is
 thousands of black people showing up for our lives with very little infrastructure and very little support
  i think our work as movement leaders isn 't just about our own visibility
 but rather how do we make
 the whole visible  how do we
 not just fight for our individual selves but fight for everybody  and i also think
 leadership looks like everybody in this audience
 showing up for black lives  it 's not just about coming and watching people on a stage  right  
  it 's about how do you become that leader whether it 's in your workplace whether it 's in your home
 and believe that the movement for black lives isn 't just for us  but it 's for everybody mb what about you opal 
 so i 've been learning a great deal about interdependence 
 i 've been learning about how to trust your team i 've come up with this new mantra after coming back from a
  sabbatical which is rare for black women to take who are in leadership  but i felt it was really important for my leadership and for my team
 to also practice stepping back as well as also sometimes stepping in and what i learned in this process was that
 we need to acknowledge that different people contribute different strengths  and that in order for our entire
  team to flourish  we have to allow them to share
 and allow them to shine  and so during my sabbatical with the organization that i also work with 
 i saw our team rise up in my absence 
 they were able to launch new programs  fundraise and when i came back  i had to give them
  a lot of gratitude and praise because they showed me that they truly had my back
 and that they truly had their own backs  you know in this process of my sabbatical i was really reminded of this southern african
 philosophy of ubuntu i am because you are you are because i am  and
 i realized that my own leadership and the contributions that i 'm able to make 
 is in large part due to the contributions that they make right  and i have to acknowledge that and i have to see that and so
 my new mantra is keep calm and trust the team 
 and also keep calm and thank the team mb you know one of the things i feel like i 've heard
 in the context of the black lives matter movement more than anywhere else is about being a leaderful movement and that 's such a beautiful concept
  and i think that something that women often bring to the conversation about leadership is really the collective piece  what about you alicia ag 
 yeah  how many of you heard that saying that leadership is lonely  
 i think that there is an element where leadership is lonely but i also believe that it doesn 't have to be like that 
 and in order for us to get to that point i think there 's a few things
  that we need to be doing so one is we have to stop treating leaders like superheroes 
 we are ordinary people attempting to do extraordinary things  and so we need to be supported in that way 
 the other thing that i 've learned about leadership is that there 's a difference between
  and there 's a way in which we 've been kind of transformed into celebrities rather than people who are trying to solve a problem
 and the way that we treat celebrities is very fickle right we like them one day we don 't like what they 're wearing the next day  and all of a sudden we have issues  
 right so we need to stop deifying leaders so that more people will step into leadership  lots of people are terrified to step into leadership because of
 how much scrutiny they receive and how brutal we are with leaders 
 and then the last thing that i 've learned about leadership is that it 's really easy to be a leader when everybody likes you  
 but it 's hard
 to be a leader when you have to make hard choices
 and when you have to do what 's right  even though people are not going to like you for it
 and so in that way i think another way that we can support
  leaders is to struggle with us
  but struggle with us politically not personally  we can have disagreements without being disagreeable
 but it 's important for us to sharpen each other so that we all can rise
  forces you to face some brutal painful realities on a daily basis
  what gives you hope and inspires you in that context pc 
 i am hopeful for black futures  and i say that because
 we live in a society that 's so obsessed with black death we have images of our death
  on the tv screen on our twitter timelines  on our facebook timelines  
 but what if what if instead we imagine black life we imagine black people living and thriving and that
 that inspires me ot 
 what inspires me these days are immigrants immigrants all over the
  world who are doing the best that they can to make a living to survive and also to thrive  
 right now there are over two hundred and forty four million people who aren 't living in their country of origin 
 this is a forty percent increase since the year two thousand 
 so what this tells me is that the disparities across the globe are only getting worse
 yet there are people who are finding the strength and wherewithal to travel to move to eke out a better living for themselves and to provide for their families and their loved ones  
 and some of these people who are immigrants are also undocumented 
 they 're unauthorized  and they inspire me even more because although our society is telling them you 're not wanted
  not needed here and they 're highly vulnerable and subject to abuse to wage theft to exploitation and xenophobic attacks 
 many of them are also beginning to organize in their communities  
 and what i 'm seeing is that there 's also an emerging network of black undocumented people who are
  resisting the framework  and resisting the criminalization of their existence  and that to me is incredibly powerful and inspires me every singe day mb thank you alicia 
 so we know that young people are the present and the future  
 but what inspires me are older people who are becoming transformed in the service of this movement 
 we all know that as you get older you get a little more entrenched in your ways
 it 's happening to me i know that 's right  but i 'm so inspired when i see people who
 have a way that they do things have a way that they think about the world and they 're courageous enough to be open to listening to what the experiences are of so many of us who want to live in world that 's just and want to live in a world
  and i 'm also inspired by the actions that i 'm seeing older people taking in service of this movement i 'm inspired by seeing older people step into their own power 
  and leadership and say i 'm not passing a torch i 'm helping you light the fire mb i love that
 so in terms of action  i think that
  it is awesome to sit here and be able to listen to you all and to have our minds
 open and shift  but that 's not going to get black people free  so if you had
 one thing you would like this audience and the folks who are watching around the world to actually do what would that be ag 
 ok  two quick ones
  call the white house the water protectors are being forcibly removed
 from the camp that they have set up to defend
 what keeps us alive  and that is intricately related to black lives so definitely call the white house and demand
 that they stop doing that there are tanks and police officers arresting every single person there as we speak
  the second thing that you can do is to join something 
 be a part of something there are groups 
 collectives doesn 't have to be a non profit you know what i mean 
 but there are groups that are doing work in our communities right now to make sure that black lives matter so all lives matter get involved
 don 't sit on your couch and tell people what you think they should be doing go do it with us mb do you guys
 that 's good all
 right so and i think that the joining something like if you feel like there 's not something where you are start it ag start it mb these conversations that we 're having have those conversations 
  with somebody else and then instead of just letting it be a talk that you had actually decide to
