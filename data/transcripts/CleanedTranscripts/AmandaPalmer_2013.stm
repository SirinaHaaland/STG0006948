  i didn 't always make my living from music for about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university this
 was my day job 
 i was a   self employed living statue called the eight foot bride  and i love telling people i did this
 for a job because everybody always wants to know who are these freaks in real
  life hello 
 i painted myself white one day  stood on a box put a hat or a can at my feet and when someone came by and dropped in money  i handed them
 a flower
 and some intense eye contact and if they didn 't take the
  i threw in a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away 
 so i had the most profound encounters with people especially lonely people who looked like they hadn 't talked to anyone
 in weeks  and
 we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street  and we
  would sort of
 fall in love a little bit and my eyes would say 
 thank you i see you and their eyes would say 
 nobody ever sees me thank you 
 i would get harassed sometimes people would
  but it hurt  because it made me fear that i was somehow doing something
 and unfair  shameful i had no idea how perfect
 a real education i was getting for the music business on this box
  for the economists out there you may be interested to know i actually made a pretty predictable income which was shocking to me given
 i had no regular customers but pretty much sixty bucks on a tuesday ninety bucks on a friday it was consistent 
 and meanwhile i was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band the dresden dolls this was me on piano a genius drummer  i wrote the songs and eventually we started making enough money that i could quit being a statue  
 and as we started touring
 i really didn 't want to lose this sense of
 direct connection with people because i loved it so after all of our shows we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people 
 and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us and i would track down local musicians and artists
 and they would set up outside of our shows  and they
  would pass the hat and then they would come in and join us onstage so we had this
 rotating smorgasbord of weird random circus guests 
 and then twitter came along and made things even more magic because i could ask instantly for anything anywhere  so i would need a piano to practice on and an hour later i would be at a fan 's house this is in london
  food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us this is in seattle 
 fans who worked in museums and stores and and any kind of public space would wave their hands if i would decide to do a last minute spontaneous free gig  this is a library in auckland 
 on saturday i tweeted for this crate and
 hat because i did not want to schlep them from the east coast and they showed up care of this dude chris from newport beach
  who says hello  
 i once tweeted where in melbourne can i buy a neti pot 
 and a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe i was in and i bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death  
 and i love this kind of random closeness  which is lucky  because
  i do a lot of couchsurfing 
 in mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there 's no wireless  and in punk squats  everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with 
  wireless  clearly making it the better option 
 my crew once pulled our van up to a really poor
 miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was
  family were all undocumented immigrants from honduras and that night her whole family
 took the couches and she slept together with her mom
 so that we could take their beds  and i lay there thinking 
 these people have so little is this fair  and in the morning
 her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give
  me a bible and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken english your music
 has helped my daughter so much
  thank you for staying here  we 're all so grateful and i thought  this is fair  
  this is
 this 
 a couple of months later i was in manhattan  
 and i tweeted for a crash pad and at midnight i 'm on the lower east side and it occurs to me i 've never actually done this alone i 've always been with my band or my crew is this what stupid people do 
 is this how stupid people die  
 and before i can change my mind the door busts open she 's an artist he 's a financial blogger for reuters  and they 're pouring me a glass of red wine and offering
  me a bath and i have had thousands of nights like that and like that 
 so i couchsurf a lot  i also crowdsurf a lot  i maintain
 couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing you 're falling into the audience and you 're trusting each other  i once asked
 an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get
  extra money something that i did a lot  and as usual the band was psyched but there was this one guy in the band
 who told me he just couldn 't bring himself to go out there it felt too much like begging
 to stand there with the hat  and i recognized his fear
 of is this fair
  bigger and bigger we sign with a major label  and our music is a cross between punk and cabaret it 's not for everybody 
 well  maybe it 's for you 
 we sign and there 's all this hype leading up to our next record and it comes out and it sells about twenty five thousand copies in the first
  the sales are going down it 's a failure and they walk off right at this same time  i 'm signing and hugging after a gig  and a guy comes up to me
 and hands me a $ ten bill and he says i 'm sorry i burned your cd from a friend
  know you hate your label i just want you to have this money and this starts happening all the time  i become the hat
 after my own gigs but i have to physically stand there and take the help from people and unlike the guy in the opening band i 've actually had a lot of practice standing there 
  and this is the moment i decide i 'm just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible so it 's like metallica over here  
 napster  bad
 amanda palmer over here  and i 'm going to encourage torrenting downloading sharing  but i 'm going to ask for help  because i saw it work
 on the street  so i fought my way off my label
  and for my next project with my new band the grand theft orchestra  i turned to crowdfunding  
 and i fell into those thousands of connections that i 'd made  and i asked my crowd to catch me 
 and the goal was one hundred thousand dollars my fans backed me at nearly one point two million
 which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date 
 and you can see how many
  people it is it 's
 about twenty five thousand people 
 and the media asked amanda the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy how did you make all these people pay for music 
 and the real answer is i didn 't make them 
 i asked them 
 and through the very act
 of asking
  connected with them  and when you connect with them people want
 to help you it 's kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists they don 't want to ask for things but
 it 's not easy it 's not easy to ask  and a lot of artists have a problem with this asking makes you vulnerable  
 and
 i got a lot of criticism online after my kickstarter went big for
  continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices specifically for asking musicians
 who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer  and this was a doctored image that went up of me
 on a website  and this hurt in a really familiar
  you 're not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling get a job because they weren 't
 with us on the sidewalk  and they couldn 't see
 the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them
  this is slightly not safe for work this is my kickstarter backer party in berlin at the end of the night i stripped and let everyone draw on me  
 now let me tell you if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers 
 i recommend this  especially if those strangers are drunk german people 
 this was a ninja 
  because what i was really saying here was i trust you this much  should i show me 
 for most of human history musicians artists they 've been part of the community  
 connectors and and openers not untouchable stars  celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a
  the internet and the content that we 're freely able to share on it
 are taking us back it 's about a few people loving you up close
 and about those people
 being enough 
 so a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price they see it as an unpredictable risk but the things i 've done the kickstarter the street  the doorbell  i don 't see these things as risk  i see them as trust
  now the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street  they 're getting there  but
 the perfect tools aren 't going to help us if we can 't face each other
 and give and receive fearlessly but more important
 to ask without shame my music career
 has been spent trying to encounter people on the internet the way i could on the box  
 so blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about
 our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers our mistakes and we see each other  
 and i think when we really
 see each other
  want to help each other  
 i think people have been obsessed with the wrong question  which is how do we make people pay for music 
 what if we started asking 
 how do we let people pay for music
