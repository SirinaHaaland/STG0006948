  my colleagues and i are fascinated by the science of moving dots  
 so what are these dots  well it 's all of us and we 're moving in our homes in our offices  as we shop and travel throughout our cities and around the world 
 and wouldn 't it be great if we could understand all
  this movement if we could find patterns and meaning and insight in it 
 and luckily for us we live in a time where we 're incredibly good at capturing information about ourselves  so whether it 's through sensors or videos  or apps  we can track our movement with incredibly fine detail 
 so it turns out one of the places where we have the best data about movement
 is sports
  whether it 's basketball or baseball or football or the other football we 're instrumenting our stadiums and our players to track their movements every fraction of a second  
 so what we 're doing
 is turning our athletes into
 you probably guessed it moving dots  so we 've got mountains of moving dots and like most raw data  it 's hard to deal with and
  that interesting 
 but there are things that for example basketball coaches want to know 
 and the problem is they can 't know them because they 'd have to watch every second of every game remember it and process it and a person can 't do that 
 but a machine can the problem is a machine can 't see the game with the eye of a coach at least they
  what have we taught the machine to see  
 so we started simply we taught it things like passes shots and rebounds things that most casual fans would know 
 and then we moved on to things slightly more complicated  events like post ups and
 and if you don 't know them that 's okay most casual players probably do
  we 've gotten to a point where today  
 the machine understands complex events like down screens and wide pins  basically things only professionals know  
 so we have taught a machine
 to see
 with the eyes of a coach  
 so how have we been able to do this if i asked a coach to describe something like a pick and roll they would give me a description and if i encoded that as
  happens to be this dance in basketball
 between four players two on offense and two on defense  and here 's kind of how it goes  so there 's the guy on offense without the ball the ball and he goes next to the guy guarding the guy with the ball 
 and he kind of stays there and they both move and stuff happens and ta da it 's a pick and roll 
 so that is also an example of a terrible algorithm  so if the player who 's the
  called the screener
 goes close by but he doesn 't stop  it 's probably not a pick and roll 
 or if he does stop but he doesn 't stop close enough  it 's probably not a pick and roll 
 or if he does go close by and he does stop but they do it under the basket  it 's probably not a pick and roll or i could be
  really depends on the exact timing the distances the locations  and that 's what makes it hard 
 so luckily with machine learning we can go beyond our own ability to describe the things we know  
 so how does this work well it 's by example  so we go to the machine and say good morning machine 
 here are some pick and rolls and here are some things that are not  please
 find a way to tell the difference 
 and the key to all of this is to find features that enable it to separate so if i was going to teach it the difference between an apple and and orange i might say why don 't you use color or shape 
 and the problem that we 're solving is what are those things what are the key features that let a computer navigate the world of moving dots  
 so figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location distance timing
  that 's really the key to the science of moving dots or
 as we like to call it spatiotemporal pattern recognition in academic vernacular because the first thing is you have to make it sound hard
 because it is 
 the key thing is for nba coaches it 's not that they want to know whether a pick and roll happened or not it 's that they want to know how it happened and why is it so important to them 
 so here 's a little insight it turns out
  is perhaps the most important play 
 and knowing how to run it and knowing how to defend it is basically a key to winning and losing most games  so it turns out that this dance has a great many variations and identifying 
  the variations is really the thing that matters  and that 's why we need this to be really really good 
  either roll
 or pop the guy guarding the ball can either go over or under  his teammate can either show or play up to touch or play soft and together they can either switch or blitz and i didn 't know most of these things when i started
 and it would be lovely if everybody moved according to those arrows it would make our lives a lot
  but it turns out movement is very very messy people wiggle a lot
 and getting these variations identified with very very high accuracy both in precision and recall is tough because that 's what it takes to get a professional coach to believe in you 
 and despite all the difficulties with the right spatiotemporal features we have been able to do that coaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations 
 we 're at the point where almost every single contender for an nba championship this year is
  using our software  which is built on a machine that understands the moving dots of basketball so
 not only that we have given advice that has changed strategies that have helped teams
 win very important games  and it 's very exciting because you have coaches who 've been in the league for thirty years that are willing to take advice from a machine 
 and it 's very exciting it 's much more than the
 our computer started out with simple things and learned more and more complex things and now it knows so many things frankly i don 't understand
 much of what it does and while it 's not that special to to be smarter than me  
 we were wondering can a machine know more than a coach can it know more than person could know and it turns out the answer is
  coaches want players to take good shots  so if i 'm standing near the basket and there 's nobody near me it 's a good shot if i 'm standing far away surrounded by defenders that 's generally a bad shot  
 but we never knew how good good was or how bad bad was quantitatively until now  
 so what we can do again using spatiotemporal features we looked at every shot  we can see where is the shot what 's the angle to the basket
  the defenders standing what are their distances what are their angles for multiple defenders  we can look at how the player 's moving and
 predict the shot type  we can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances 
 so why is this important  
 we can take something
 that was shooting  which was one thing before  and turn it into two things the quality of the shot and the quality of the shooter  so here 's a bubble chart because
 what 's what 's ted without a bubble chart laughter
 those are nba players the size is the size of the player and the color is the position on the x axis we have the shot probability  people on the left take difficult shots on the right they take easy shots
 on the [ y axis ] is their shooting ability  people who are good are at the top bad at the bottom so for example  if there was a player who generally made forty seven percent of their shots that 's all you knew before  
  i can tell you
 that player takes shots that an average nba player would make forty nine percent of the time 
 and they are two percent worse  and the reason that 's important is that there are lots of 47s out there 
 and so it 's really important to know if the forty seven that you 're considering giving one hundred million dollars to is a good shooter who takes bad shots or a bad shooter who takes
  good shots 
 machine understanding doesn 't just change how we look at players  it changes how we look at the game  
 so there was this very exciting game a couple of years ago in the nba finals miami was down by three
 there was twenty seconds left they were about to lose the championship a gentleman named lebron james came up and he took a three to tie he
  his teammate chris bosh got a rebound  passed it to another teammate named ray allen he sank a three  it went into overtime they won the game they won the championship it was one of the most exciting games in basketball 
 and our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second and the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second can illuminate this moment
 in a way
 that we never could before now
  i can 't show you that video but for you we recreated that moment at our weekly basketball game about three weeks ago 
 laughter and we recreated the tracking that led to the insights so here is us this is chinatown
 in los angeles a park we play at every week and that 's us recreating the ray allen moment and all the tracking that 's
  associated with it so here 's the shot i 'm going to show you that moment
 and all the insights of that moment 
 the only difference is instead of the professional players  it 's us  and instead of a professional announcer  it 's me  so  bear with me  
 miami down three twenty seconds left
  jeff brings up the
  that moment
 had about a nine percent chance of happening in the nba and we know that and a great many other things i 'm not going to tell you how many times it took us to to make that happen
  the important thing about that video
 and the insights we have for every second of every nba game it 's not that it 's the fact you don 't have to be a professional team to track movement 
 you do not have to be a professional player to get insights about movement in fact it doesn 't even have to be about sports because we 're moving everywhere 
 we 're moving
 in our homes
  in our offices  as we shop and we travel
 throughout our cities
 and around
 our world 
 what will we know what will we learn 
 perhaps instead of identifying pick and rolls a machine can identify the moment and let me know when my daughter takes her first steps
  which could literally be happening any second now  perhaps we can learn to better use our buildings better plan our cities i believe
 that with the development of the science of moving dots  we will move better  we will move smarter  we will move forward  thank you very much
