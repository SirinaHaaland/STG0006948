  when i turned nineteen i started my career as the first female photojournalist in the gaza strip palestine 
 my work as a woman photographer was considered a serious insult to local traditions and created a lasting stigma for me and
  family the male dominated field made my presence
 unwelcome by all possible means  they made clear that a woman must not do a man 's job  
 photo agencies in gaza refused to train me because of my gender 
 the no sign was pretty clear three of my colleagues went as far as to drive me to an open air strike
 area
 where the explosion sounds were the only thing i could hear  
 dust was flying in the air and the ground was shaking like a swing beneath me 
 i only realized we weren 't there to document the event
 when the three of them got back into the armored jeep and drove away waving and laughing leaving me behind in the open air strike zone
  for a moment  i felt terrified  humiliated and sorry for myself 
 my colleagues ' action was not the only death threat i have received  but it was the most dangerous one 
 the perception of women 's life in gaza is
  until a recent time a lot of women were not allowed to work or pursue education 
 at times of such doubled war including both social restrictions on women
 and the israeli palestinian conflict women 's dark and bright stories were fading away 
 to men women 's stories were seen as inconsequential 
 i started paying closer attention to women 's lives in gaza
  of my gender  i had access to worlds where my colleagues were forbidden 
 beyond the obvious pain and struggle there was a healthy dose of laughter and accomplishments 
 in front of a police compound in gaza city during the first war in gaza 
 an israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound
 and break my nose
 for a moment  all i saw was white  bright white  like these lights 
 i thought to myself i either got blind
 or i was in heaven by the time i managed to open my eyes  i had documented this moment 
  a palestinian worker who spent two decades in israel 
 as his retirement plan he decided to build a four floor house only by the first field operation at his neighborhood 
 the house was flattened to the ground 
 nothing was left but the pigeons he raised
 and a jacuzzi
  a bathtub that he got from tel aviv mohammed got the bathtub on the top of the rubble
 and started giving his kids an every morning bubble bath 
 my work is not meant to hide the scars of war 
 but to show the full frame of unseen stories of gazans 
 as a palestinian female
  the journey of struggle  survival and everyday life has inspired me to overcome the community taboo
 and see a different side of war and its aftermath i became a witness
 with a choice to run away or stand still  thank you
