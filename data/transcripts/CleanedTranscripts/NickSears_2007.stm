  fuller presented the particularly audacious proposal for the geoscope it was a 200 foot diameter geodesic sphere
 to be suspended suspended over the east river in new york city in full view of the united nations it was a big idea for sure  and it was one that
 he he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through
 through animations of of global data  trends and other information regarding the globe on this sphere  
 and today forty five years later we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity
  what we do have is improved technology today we don 't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display we can use 
  are smaller they 're cheaper they 're longer lasting they 're more efficient 
 most importantly for this they 're faster  and this speed combined with today 's  high performance micro controllers allows us to actually simulate 
 in this piece over seventeen thousand
  and the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision but as this ring rotates at about one thousand seven hundred rpm that 's  twenty eight times per second 
 the equator 's speed is actually about sixty miles per hour
 there are four 
 that each time this ring rotates it as it passes the rear of the display it picks up a position signal and from that 
  can extrapolate the position of the ring
 at all points around the revolution
 and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations but this is really just the beginning 
 in addition to higher resolution versions of this display  my father and i are working on a new patent pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon
 it achieves this by rotating leds about two axes so as you can see here this is a eleven inch diameter circuit board these blocks represent
  you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis it will create
 a disc of light that we can control that 's nothing new that 's a propeller clock that 's
 the rims that you can buy for your car but what is new is that when we rotate this disc about this axis
 this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light and so we can control
  and create a fully volumetric three dimensional display with just two hundred and 
 now this piece is currently in process due out in may
 but what we 've done is we 've put together a small demo just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere 
 i 've got a little video to show you but
 keep in mind that this is with no electronic control  and this is also with only four
  this is actually only about one point five percent of what the final display will be in may so take a look  
 and here you can see it 's rotating about the vertical axis only creating circles  
 and then as the other axis kicks in those actually blur into a volume and
 the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case  but this piece is due out in may it 'll be on display at the interactive telecommunications spring show in
  greenwich village in new york city that 's open to the public definitely invite you all to come and attend it 's a fantastic show there are
 hundreds of student innovators with with fantastic projects 
 this piece actually  will be on display down in the sierra simulcast lounge in the breaks between now and the end of the show so i 'd
 love to talk to you all and invite you to come down and take a closer look it
 's an honor to be here thanks very much
