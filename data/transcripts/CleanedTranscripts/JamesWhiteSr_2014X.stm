  joined the united states air force and was assigned to mountain home air force base and was a part of the air police squadron upon first
  arriving there the first goal that i had
 was for me to identify an apartment so i could bring my wife and my new baby melanie out to join me in idaho  
 i immediately went to the personnel office  
 and talking with the guys in personnel they said hey  no problem finding an apartment in mountain home  idaho  the people down there love us because they 
  know if they have an airman who is coming in to rent one of their apartments they 'll always
  get their money and that was a really important thing he said so here is a list of people that you can call and then they will then allow you to select the apartment that you want 
 so i got the list 
 i made the call the lady answered on the other end and i told her what i wanted she said oh great you called  we have four or five apartments
  's not talk about that just come on down select the apartment that you want we 'll sign the contract and you 'll have keys in your hand to get your family out here right away 
 so i was excited i jumped in my car i went downtown
 and knocked on the door  when i knocked on the door the woman came to the door  and she looked at me
  i was just coming down to make my selection she said you know what i 'm really sorry  but my husband rented those apartments and didn 't tell me about them 
 i said you mean he rented all five of them in one hour she didn 't give me a response and what she said was this  she said why don 't you leave your number 
  needless to say  i did not get a call from her 
 nor did i get any responses from the other people that they gave me on the list where i could get apartments 
 so as a result of that and feeling rejected i went back to the base and i talked to the squadron commander his name was
  we can 't make people rent to folks that they don 't want to rent to 
 and besides we have a great relationship with people in the community and we really don 't want to damage that he said so maybe this is what you should do
 why don 't you let your family stay home because you do know that you 
 so once a year you can go home to your family spend thirty days and then come on back
  to say that didn 't resonate for me so after leaving him  i went back to personnel  and talking to the clerk he said jim i think i have a solution for you
 there 's an airman who is leaving and he has a trailer if you noticed in mountain home there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place you can buy his trailer and you 'd probably get a really good deal because he wants to get out of town
  care of your problem  and that would provide the solution for you 
 so i immediately jumped in my car went downtown saw the trailer it was a small trailer  
 but under the circumstances i figured that was the best thing that i could do  so i bought the trailer and then i asked him  can i just leave the trailer here  and that would take care 
  of all my problems i wouldn 't have to have to find another trailer park he said  before i say yes to that i need to check with management
 so i get back to the base he called me back and management said  
 no you can 't leave the trailer here because we had promised that slot to some other people and that was strange to me because there were several other slots that were open  but it just so happened that he had promised that slot to someone else 
 so what i did
  list
 of going to trailer parks i went to one after another after another and i got the same kind of rejection there that i received when i was looking for the apartment 
 and
 as a result  the kind of comments that they made to me in addition to saying that they didn 't have any slots open one
  the reason why we can 't rent to you we already have a negro family in the trailer park he said and it 's not me because i like you people
  discouraging  it didn 't stop me i kept looking and i looked at the far end of of the town in mountain home  and there was a small trailer park  
 i mean a really small trailer park  it didn 't have any paved roads in it it didn 't have the concrete slabs  it didn 't have fencing to portion off your trailer slot from other trailer 
 slots  it didn 't have a laundry facility  but the conclusion i reached at that moment was that i didn 't have
  a lot of other options  so i called my wife and i said we 're going to make this one work and we moved into it and we became homeowners in mountain home  idaho and of course eventually things settled down 
 four years after that i received papers to move from mountain home  idaho to a place called goose bay  labrador  we won 't even talk about that
  was another great location 
 so my challenge then was to get my family from mountain home  idaho to sharon pennsylvania that wasn 't a problem because we had just purchased a  brand new automobile 
 my mother called and said she 'll fly out she 'll be with us as we drive she 'll help us manage the children 
 so she came out
  her and alice put a lot of food together for the trip that morning we left at about five a m 
 great trip having a great time good conversation somewhere around six thirty seven o 'clock  we got a little bit tired and we said why don 't we get a motel so that we can rest and then have an early start in the morning 
 so we were looking at a number of the motels as we drove down the road and we saw one it was a great big bright flashing light that said 
  so we stopped in they were in the parking lot i went inside when i walked inside the lady was just finishing up one contract with some folks 
 some other people were coming in behind me and so i walked to the counter  and she said  how can i help you i said i would like to get a motel for the evening for my family 
 she said you know  i 'm really sorry  i just rented the last one we will not have
  and she reached over and turned the light off she looked at me and i looked at her there were other people in the room she kind of looked at them  no one said anything 
 so i just got the hint and i left and went outside to the parking lot  and i told my mother and i told my wife and and also melanie and i said
  looks like we 're going to have to drive a little bit further down the road to be able to sleep tonight 
 and we did drive down the road but just before we took off and pulled out of the parking lot guess what happened 
 the light came back on and it said vacancies  vacancies  vacancies we were able to find a nice place
  but it was secure and it was clean and so we had a great sleep that night 
 the piece that 's important about that is that we had similar kinds of experiences from idaho all the way through to pennsylvania  where we were rejected from hotels 
 motels and restaurants  but we made it to pennsylvania we
  bay  labrador  which is another story right 
 here it is
 years later i now have nine grandchildren
 five of the grandchildren are boys i have master 's ph d undergrad
  they 're almost there but not quite i have one who has been in college now for eight years 
 he doesn 't have a degree yet but he wants to be a comedian  so we 're just trying to get him to stay
 in school  because you never know just because you 're funny at home does not make you a comedian right 
  all good kids no drugs  no babies in high school  no crime 
 so with that being the backdrop i was sitting in my tv room watching tv and they were talking about ferguson and all the hullabaloo that was going on 
 and all of a sudden one of the news commentators got on the air and she said 
 in the last three months 
  for some reason at that moment it just all hit me i said what is it 
 it is so insane what is the hatred that 's causing people to do these kinds of things just then one of my
  i 'm just so confused we do everything we do  but it seems that driving while black  walking while black  talking while black it 's just dangerous 
 what can we do we do everything that you told us to do when stopped by the police  we place both hands on the steering wheel at the twelve o 'clock position if asked to get identification
  we tell them ' i am slowly reaching over into the glove compartment to get my i d ' when pulled out of the car to be searched  when laid on the ground to be 
  searched  when our trunks are opened to be searched  we don 't push back  we don 't challenge because we know you 've told us ' don 't you challenge the police after it 's over
  and this is the piece that really bugs me our white friends our buddies we kind of hang together  when they hear about these kinds of things happening to us they say ' why
 do you take it  
 you need to push back  you need to challenge  you need to ask them for their identification ' and here 's what the boys have been taught to tell them we know that you can do that but 
 please do not do that while we 're in the car because the consequences for you
  you are significantly different than the consequences for us and so as a grandparent what do i tell my grandsons 
 how do i keep them safe  how do i keep them alive 
 as a result of this people have come to
  of being angry  
 and i also know the consequences of being enraged so therefore the only thing that i can do is take my collective intellect
 and my energy and my ideas and my experiences and dedicate myself to challenge at any point in time  anything that looks
  like it might be racist so the first thing i have to do is to educate  
 the second thing i have to do is to unveil racism and the last thing i need to do is do everything within my power to eradicate racism in my lifetime by any means necessary  
 the second thing i do is this  i want to appeal
 to americans  i want to appeal to their humanity to their dignity to their civic pride
  and ownership
 to be able
 to not react
 to these heinous crimes in an adverse manner  
 but instead 
 to elevate your level of societal knowledge your level of societal awareness and societal consciousness
 to then collectively come together all of us come together
 to make sure that we speak out against and we challenge any kind of insanity any kind of insanity
 that makes it okay to kill unarmed
 people
  their diversity makeup
