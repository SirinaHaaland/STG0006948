  today i 'd like to show you the future of the way we make things
 i believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self assembling replicating and repairing themselves  so i 'm going to show you what i believe is the current state
  and then compare that to some natural systems  
 so in the current state of manufacturing  we have skyscrapers two and a half years [ of assembly time ] five hundred thousand to a million parts  fairly complex new exciting technologies in steel concrete glass 
 we have exciting machines that can take us into space five years [ of assembly time ] two point five million parts  
 but on the other side if you look at the natural systems  we have proteins
 that have two million types
 can fold in ten thousand nanoseconds or dna with three billion base pairs we can replicate
 in roughly an hour  so
 there 's all of this complexity in our natural systems  but they 're extremely efficient far more efficient than anything we can build far more complex than anything we can build 
 they 're far more efficient in terms of energy they hardly ever make mistakes  and they can repair themselves for longevity  so there 's
  something super interesting about natural systems and if we can translate that into our built environment 
 then there 's some exciting potential for the way that we build things  and i think the key to that is self assembly 
 so if we want to utilize self assembly in our physical environment i think there 's four key factors the first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build so our buildings and machines and we need to decode that into simple sequences
  dna of of how our buildings work then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence
 and use that to fold up or reconfigure 
 we need some energy that 's going to allow that to activate allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program  
 and we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have
 successfully built what we want so i 'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and i at mit are working on to achieve this
 the first two are the macrobot and decibot  so these projects are large scale reconfigurable robots eight ft twelve  ft long proteins they 're embedded with mechanical electrical devices  sensors 
 you decode what you want to fold up into into a sequence of angles so negative one hundred and twenty negative one hundred and twenty zero zero one
  something like that so a sequence of angles or turns and you send that sequence through the string each unit takes its message so negative one hundred and twenty
 it rotates to that checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor  
 so these are the brilliant scientists engineers designers that worked on this project and
 i think it really brings to light is this really scalable i mean thousands of dollars lots of man hours
  made to make this eight foot robot can we really scale this up can we really embed robotics into every part 
 the next one questions that and looks at passive nature  
 or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability but it goes a step further and it tries to have actual computation 
 it basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing the digital logic gate directly into your parts  
 so this is a nand gate you have one tetrahedron which is the gate that 's going to do your computing  and you have two input
  tetrahedrons 
 one of them is the input from the user as you 're building your bricks the other one is from the previous brick that was placed and then it gives you an output in 3d space 
 so what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do it computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do 
 and now it starts moving in three dimensional space so up or down so on the
  equals zero output which goes down on the right hand side [ zero ] input is a one output 
 which goes up 
 and so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build so they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed so that means that we can have some form of self replication in
 this case i call it  self guided
  because your structure contains the exact blueprints if you have errors you can replace a part all the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it 
 so you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one it 's directly embedded there 's no external instructions so the last project i 'll show is called biased chains
 and it 's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of of passive self assembly systems so it takes the reconfigurability and programmability
 and makes it a completely passive system
  so basically you have a chain of elements each element is is completely identical  
 and they 're biased so each chain  or each element wants to turn right or left  
 so as you assemble the chain you 're basically programming it you 're telling each unit if it should turn right or left  
 so when you shake the chain  
 it then folds up into any configuration that you 've programmed in so in this case a spiral
  or in this case 
 two cubes next to each other so you can basically program any  three dimensional shape or
 up into this chain completely passively so what does this tell us about the future i think that it 's telling us that there 's new possibilities for self assembly replication repair in our physical structures our buildings machines 
 there 's new programmability in these parts
  and from that you have new possibilities for computing we 'll have spatial computing imagine if our buildings our bridges machines all of our bricks could actually compute that 's amazing parallel and distributed computing power 
 new design possibilities so it 's exciting potential for this so i think these projects i 've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future 
 if we implement these new technologies for a new
