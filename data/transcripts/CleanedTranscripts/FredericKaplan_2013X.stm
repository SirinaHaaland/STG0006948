  this is an image of the planet earth it looks very much like the apollo pictures
 that are very well known there is something different  you can click on it
 and if you click on it you can
  in many cases you can also see how a building looks from a nearby street this is pretty amazing  but there 's something missing
 in this wonderful tour it 's time i 'm not really sure when this picture was taken  i 'm not even sure it was taken at
  in my lab we develop tools to travel not only in space but also through time
 the kind of question we 're asking is is it possible to build something like google maps of the past can i add a slider
 on top of google maps
 and just change the year seeing how it was one hundred years before one thousand years before is that possible can i reconstruct social networks
  of the past can i make a facebook of the middle ages so can i build time machines 
 maybe we can just say no it 's not possible or maybe we can think of it from an information point of view 
 this is what i call the information mushroom 
 vertically you have the time and horizontally the amount of digital information available obviously in the last ten years we have
  and obviously the more we go in the past  the less information we have 
 if we want to build something like google maps of the past or facebook of the past we need to enlarge this space we need to make that like a rectangle how do we do that 
 one way is digitization there 's a lot of material available newspaper  
 printed books  thousands of printed books  
 i can digitize all these  i can extract
  information from these of course  the more you go in the past the less information you will have so it might not be enough  
 so i can do what historians do  i can extrapolate this is what we call in computer science simulation 
 if i take a log book  i can consider it 's not
  just a log book of a venetian captain going to a particular journey i can consider it is actually a log book which is representative of many journeys of that period  i 'm extrapolating  
 if i have a painting of a facade  i can consider it 's not just that particular building but probably it also
 shares the same grammar
 of buildings where we lost any information  
 so if we want
  to construct a time machine we need two things we need very large archives and we need excellent specialists 
 the venice time machine  the project i 'm going to talk to you about is a joint project between the  epfl and the university of venice ca 'foscari there 's
 something very peculiar about venice that its administration has been very very bureaucratic they 've been keeping
  you have eighty kilometers of archives documenting every aspect
 of the life of venice over more than one thousand years you have every boat that goes out every boat that comes in you have every change that was made in the city 
 this is all there 
 we are setting up a 10 year digitization program
 which has the objective of transforming this immense archive into a giant information system
 the type of objective we want to reach is four hundred and fifty books a day
 that can be digitized 
 of course when you digitize that 's not enough  because these documents most of them are in latin in tuscan 
 in venetian dialect  so you need to transcribe them to translate them in some cases to index them and this is obviously not
  in particular traditional optical character recognition method that can be used for printed manuscripts they do not work
 well on the handwritten document  
 so the solution is actually to take inspiration from another domain speech recognition this is a domain of something that seems impossible which can actually
 be done  simply by putting additional constraints  if you have a very good model of a language which is used
  if you have a very good model of a document how well they are structured and these are administrative documents they are well structured in many cases  
 if you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets where a smaller subset actually shares similar features  
 then there 's a chance of success  
 if we reach that stage then there 's something else  we can extract from this document events 
 actually probably ten billion events can be extracted from this archive
 and this giant information system can be searched in many ways you can ask questions like who lived in this palazzo in 
 how much cost a sea bream at the realto market 
 what was the salary of a glass maker in murano maybe over a decade you can ask even bigger questions because it will be semantically coded
  and then what you can do is put that in space because much of this information is spatial 
 and from that you can do things like reconstructing this extraordinary journey of that city that managed to have a sustainable development
 over a thousand years managing to have all the time a form of equilibrium with its environment 
 you can reconstruct that journey visualize it in many different ways  
 but of course you cannot understand venice if you just look at the city you have to put it in a larger european context so the idea is also
 to document all the things that worked at the european level 
 we can reconstruct also the journey of the venetian maritime empire how it progressively controlled the adriatic sea  
 how it became the most powerful medieval empire of its time 
 controlling most of the sea routes
 from the east to the south  
 but you can even do other things
  because in these maritime routes there are regular patterns  you can go one step
 beyond and actually create a simulation system create a mediterranean simulator
 which is capable actually of reconstructing even the information we are missing which would enable us to
 have questions you could ask like if you were using a route planner if i am in corfu in june
 and want to go to constantinople 
 where can i take a boat probably we can answer this question with one or two or three days  '
 precision how much will it cost what are the chance of encountering pirates 
 of course you understand the central scientific challenge of a project like
  quantifying and representing uncertainty and inconsistency at each step of this process  there are errors everywhere 
 errors in the document it 's the wrong name of the captain  some of the boats never actually took to sea 
 there are errors 
  in translation interpretative biases  and on top of that if you add algorithmic processes you 're going to have errors
  so you have very very uncertain data  
 so how can we detect and correct these these inconsistencies how can we represent that form of uncertainty  
 it 's difficult 
 one thing you can do is document each step of the process not only coding the historical information but what we call the meta historical information 
 how is historical knowledge constructed  
 documenting each step
  that will not guarantee that we actually converge toward a single story of venice but probably we can actually reconstruct a fully documented potential story of venice maybe there 's not a single map maybe there are several maps 
 the system should allow for that because we have to deal with a new form of uncertainty which is really new for this type
  and how should we communicate this new research to a large audience  
 again venice is extraordinary for that 
 with the millions of visitors that come every year  it 's actually one of the best places to try to invent the museum of the future  
 imagine 
 horizontally you see the reconstructed map of a given year  and vertically you see the document that served the reconstruction paintings for instance
  imagine an immersive system that permits to go and dive and reconstruct the venice of a given year  some experience you could share within a group 
 on the contrary imagine actually that you start from a document a venetian manuscript and you show actually what you can construct out of it how it is decoded how the context of
 document can be recreated this is an image from an exhibit which is currently
 conducted in geneva with that type of system so to conclude  we can say that research in the humanities is about to undergo
 an evolution which is maybe similar to what happened to life sciences thirty years ago 
 it 's really
 a question of scale  we see projects which are much beyond any single research team can
  do  and this is really new for the humanities which very often
 take the habit of working
 in small groups or only with a couple of researchers  
 when you visit the archivio di stato you feel this is beyond what any single team can do and that should be a joint and common effort  
 so what we must do
 for this paradigm shift is actually foster a new
  generation of digital humanists that are going to be ready for this shift i thank you very much
