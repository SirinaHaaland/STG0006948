  i study ants in the desert in the tropical forest
 and in my kitchen and in the hills around silicon valley where i live 
 i 've recently realized that ants are using interactions differently in different environments  and that got me
  thinking that we could learn from this about other systems like brains
 and data networks that we engineer  and even cancer  
 so what all these systems have in common is that there 's no central control an ant colony consists of sterile female workers
 those are the ants you see walking around and then one or more reproductive females who just
  lay the eggs they don 't give any instructions even though they 're called queens 
 they don 't tell anybody what to do  so in an ant colony there 's no one in charge  
 and all systems like this without central control are regulated using very simple interactions 
 ants interact using smell they smell with their antennae  and they interact with their antennae
  so when one ant touches another with its antennae  it can tell for example if the other ant is a nestmate and what task that other ant has been doing  
 so here you see a lot of ants moving around and interacting in a lab arena that 's connected by tubes to two other arenas  so when one
  meets another it doesn 't matter which ant it meets and they 're actually not transmitting any kind of complicated signal or message 
 all that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants 
 and all of these interactions taken together  produce a network 
 so this is the network of the ants that you just saw moving around in the arena  
 and it 's this constantly shifting network that produces the behavior of the colony
 like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest or how many are going out to forage 
 a brain actually works in the same way but what 's great about ants is that you can see the whole network as it happens  
 there are more than twelve thousand species of ants in every conceivable environment  
 and they 're using interactions differently to meet different environmental challenges 
  one important environmental challenge that every system has to deal with
 is operating costs just what it takes to run the system 
 and another environmental challenge is resources  finding them and collecting them 
 in the desert operating costs are high because water is scarce  
 and the seed eating ants that i study in the desert have to spend water to get water so an ant outside foraging
  searching for seeds in the hot sun just loses water into the air  but the colony gets its water by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds that they eat  
 so in this environment interactions are used to activate foraging  
 an outgoing forager doesn 't go out unless it gets enough interactions with returning foragers  and what you see are the returning foragers going into the tunnel into the nest and meeting outgoing foragers on their way
  out this makes sense for the ant colony because the more food there is out there the more quickly the foragers find it the faster they come back  and the more foragers they send out 
 the system works to stay stopped  unless something positive happens so interactions function to activate foragers  
 and we 've been studying the evolution of this system first of all there 's variation it turns out that colonies are different
  on dry days some colonies forage less so colonies are different in how they manage this trade off between spending water to search for seeds
 and getting water back in the form of seeds 
 and we 're trying to understand why some colonies forage less than others by thinking about ants as neurons using models from neuroscience
  so just as a neuron adds up its stimulation from other neurons to decide whether to fire an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants to decide whether to forage  
 and what we 're looking for is whether there might be small differences among colonies in how many interactions each ant needs before it 's willing to go out and forage  because a colony like that would forage less  
 and this raises an analogous question about brains we talk about the brain but of course every brain is slightly different
 and maybe there are some individuals or some conditions in which the electrical properties of neurons are such that they require more stimulus to fire  
 and that would lead to differences in brain function 
 so in order to ask evolutionary questions we need to know about reproductive success 
 this is a map of the study site where i have been tracking this population of harvester ant
  colonies for twenty eight years which is about as long as a colony lives 
 each symbol is a colony  and the size of the symbol is how many offspring it had because we were able to use genetic variation to match up parent and offspring colonies that is to figure out
 which colonies were founded by a daughter queen produced by which parent colony  and this was amazing for me after all these years to find out for example
  colony one hundred and fifty four whom i 've known well for many years
 here 's her daughter colony here 's her granddaughter colony  and these are her great granddaughter colonies 
 and by doing this i was able to learn that offspring colonies resemble parent colonies
 in their decisions about which days are so
  that they don 't forage  and the offspring of parent colonies live so far from each other that the ants never meet 
 so the ants of the offspring colony can 't be learning this from the parent colony  
 and so our next step is to look for the genetic variation underlying this resemblance  
 so then i was able to ask okay  who 's doing better  
 over the time of the study and especially in the past ten years there 's been a very severe and deepening drought
 in the southwestern
  and it turns out that the colonies that conserve water that stay in when it 's really hot outside  
 and thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible are the ones more likely to have offspring colonies 
 so all this time i thought that colony one hundred and fifty four was a loser  because on really dry days there 'd be just this trickle of foraging  while
  the other colonies were out foraging getting lots of food 
 but in fact colony one hundred and fifty four is a huge success  she 's a matriarch  she 's one of the rare great grandmothers on the site 
 to my knowledge this is the first time that we 've been able to track the ongoing evolution of collective behavior
 in a natural population of animals and find out what 's actually working best  
  the internet uses an algorithm to regulate the flow of data that 's very similar to the one that the harvester ants are using to regulate the flow of foragers  and guess what we call this analogy 
 the anternet is coming 
 so data doesn 't leave the source computer unless it gets a signal that there 's enough bandwidth for it to travel on 
 in the early days of the internet when operating costs were really
  high
 and it was really important not to lose any data then the system was set up for interactions to activate the flow of data 
 it 's interesting that the ants are using an algorithm that 's so similar to the one that we recently invented  
 but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms that we know about and ants have had one hundred and thirty million years to evolve a lot of good
  ones and i think it 's very likely that some of the other twelve thousand species are going to have interesting algorithms for data networks that we haven 't even thought of yet  
 so what happens when operating costs are low 
 operating costs are low in the tropics because it 's very humid and it 's easy for the ants to be outside walking around 
 but the ants are so abundant and diverse in the tropics
  competition whatever resource one species is using another
 species is likely to be using that at the same time  
 so in this environment interactions are used in the opposite way 
 the system keeps going unless something negative happens and one species that i study makes circuits in the trees of foraging ants going from the nest to a food source and back just round and round
 unless something negative happens like an interaction
 with ants of another species  
 so here 's an example of ant security in the middle there 's an ant plugging the nest entrance with its head in response to interactions 
  with another species those are the little ones running around with their abdomens up in the air  
 and maybe there are situations in computer security where operating costs are low enough
 that we could just block access temporarily in response to an immediate threat and then open it again  
 instead of trying to build a permanent firewall or fortress  
 so another environmental challenge that all systems have to deal with
 is resources  finding and collecting them
 and to do this ants solve the problem of collective search  and this is a problem that 's of great interest right now in robotics because we 've understood that rather than sending a single 
 sophisticated expensive robot out to explore another planet or to search a burning building 
  it may be more effective to get
 a group of cheaper robots exchanging only minimal information  and that 's the way that ants do it 
 so the invasive argentine ant makes expandable search networks 
 they 're good at dealing with the main problem of collective search which is the trade off between
 searching very thoroughly and covering a lot of ground  and what they do is when there are many ants in a small space then each one can search very
  thoroughly because there will be another ant nearby searching over there but when there are a few ants in a large space 
 then they need to stretch out their paths to cover more ground 
 i think they use interactions to assess density so when they 're really crowded they meet more often  and they search more thoroughly 
 different ant species must use different algorithms because they 've evolved to deal with
 different resources  and it could be really useful to know about this  
 and so we recently asked ants to solve the collective search problem in the extreme environment of microgravity in the international space station  
 when i first saw this picture i thought oh no they 've mounted the habitat vertically  but then i realized that of course it doesn 't matter  
 so the idea here is that the ants are working so hard to hang
  on to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it that they 're less likely to interact  and so the relationship between how crowded they are and how often they meet would be messed up 
 we 're still analyzing the data i don 't have the results yet  but it would be interesting to know how other species solve this problem in different
  and so we 're setting up a program to encourage kids around the world
 to try this experiment with different species it 's very simple it can be done with cheap materials  
 and that way we could make a global map of ant collective search algorithms  
 and i think it 's pretty likely that the invasive species the ones that come into our buildings are going to be really good at this because they 're in your kitchen because they 're really good at finding food and water
  familiar resource for ants is a picnic  
 and this is a clustered resource when there 's one piece of fruit there 's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby  and the ants that specialize on clustered resources use interactions 
  for recruitment  so when one ant meets another or when it meets a chemical deposited on the ground by another then it changes direction to follow in the direction of the interaction  
 sharing your picnic  
 now this is a place where i think we might be able to learn something from ants about cancer i mean first it 's obvious that we could do a lot to prevent cancer
 by not allowing people to spread around or sell the toxins that promote the evolution of cancer in our bodies  
 but i don 't think the ants can help us much with this because ants never poison their own colonies  but we might be able to learn something from
  ants about treating cancer 
 there are many different kinds of cancer each one originates in a particular part of the body  
 and then some kinds of cancer will spread or metastasize to particular other tissues where they must be getting resources that they need  
 so if you think from the perspective of early metastatic cancer cells as they 're out searching around
 for the resources that they need  if those resources are clustered
 they 're likely to use interactions for recruitment  and if we can figure out how cancer cells are recruiting then maybe we could set traps
 to catch them before they become established  
 so ants are using interactions in different ways in a huge variety of environments  
 and we could learn from this about other systems that operate without central control 
  only simple interactions ant colonies have been performing amazing feats for more than one hundred and thirty million years  we have a lot to learn from them  thank you
