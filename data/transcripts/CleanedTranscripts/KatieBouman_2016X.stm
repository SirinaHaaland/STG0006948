  at a supermassive black hole set against a backdrop of bright gas the black hole 's massive gravitational pull bends light into a ring  however  this
  a real photograph but a computer graphic rendering an artistic interpretation of what a black hole might look like 
 a hundred years ago albert einstein first published his theory of general relativity 
 in the years since then scientists have provided a lot of evidence in support of it 
 but one thing predicted from this theory black holes  still have not been directly observed 
 although we have some idea as to what a black hole might look like we 've never actually taken a picture of one before  however  you might be surprised to know
  that that may soon change we may be seeing our first picture of a black hole in the next couple years  
 getting this first picture will come down to an international team of scientists an earth sized telescope
 and an algorithm that puts together the final picture 
 although i won 't be able to show you a real picture of a black hole today i 'd like to give you a brief glimpse into the effort involved in getting that first picture
  is katie bouman  and i 'm a phd student at mit i do research in a computer science lab that works on making computers see through images and video  
 but although i 'm not an astronomer today i 'd like to show you how i 've been
 able to contribute to this exciting project if you go out past the bright city lights tonight you may just be lucky enough to see a stunning view of the milky way galaxy  
 and if you could zoom past millions of stars
  thousand light years toward the heart of the spiraling milky way we 'd eventually reach a cluster of stars right at the center 
 peering past all the galactic dust with infrared telescopes astronomers have watched these stars for over sixteen years  
 but it 's what they don 't see that is the most spectacular 
 these stars seem to orbit an invisible
  by tracking the paths of these stars  astronomers have concluded that the only thing small and heavy enough to cause this motion is a supermassive black hole
 an object so dense that it sucks up anything that ventures too close even light 
 but what happens if we were to zoom in even further is it possible to see something that by definition is impossible to see  
 well  it turns out that if we were to zoom in at radio wavelengths we 'd expect to see a ring of light caused by the gravitational
  of hot plasma zipping around the black hole 
 in other words the black hole casts a shadow on this backdrop of bright material carving out a sphere of darkness  
 this bright ring reveals the black hole 's event horizon 
 where the gravitational pull becomes so great that not even light can escape einstein 's equations predict the size and shape of this ring  so taking a picture of it wouldn 't only be really cool 
 it would also help to verify that these equations hold
 in the extreme conditions around the black hole  however  this black hole is so far away from us that from earth this ring appears incredibly small
 the same size to us as an orange on the surface of the moon that makes taking a picture of it extremely difficult 
 why is that well it all comes down to a simple equation due to a phenomenon called diffraction  there are fundamental
  limits to the smallest objects that we can possibly see 
 this governing equation says that in order to see smaller and smaller  we need to make our telescope bigger and bigger  
 but even with the most powerful optical telescopes here on earth we can 't even get close to the resolution necessary to image on the surface of the moon 
 in fact here i show one of the highest resolution images ever taken of the moon from earth it contains roughly thirteen thousand pixels
 and yet each pixel would contain over one point five million oranges  so how big of a telescope do we need in order to see an
 orange on the surface of the moon and by extension our black hole well 
 it turns out that by crunching the numbers you can easily calculate that we would need a telescope the size of the entire earth laughter
 if we could build this
  we could just start to make out that distinctive ring of light indicative of the black hole 's event horizon 
 although this picture wouldn 't contain all the detail we see in computer graphic renderings 
 it would allow us to safely get our first glimpse of the immediate environment around a black hole  
 however  as you can imagine  building a single dish telescope the size of the earth is impossible  but in the famous words of mick jagger you can 't always get what you want
  but if you try sometimes you just might find you get what you need 
 and by connecting telescopes from around the world an international collaboration called the event horizon telescope is creating a computational telescope the size of the earth  capable of resolving 
  structure on the scale of a black hole 's event horizon  this network of telescopes is scheduled to take its very first picture of a black hole next year 
  linked through the precise timing of atomic clocks teams of researchers at each of the sights freeze light by collecting thousands of terabytes of data 
 this data is then processed in a a lab right here in massachusetts  
 so how does this even work   remember if we want to see the black hole in the center of our galaxy we need to build this impossibly large earth sized telescope
 for just a second  let 's pretend we could build a telescope the
  the earth this would be a little bit like turning the earth into a giant spinning disco ball 
 each individual mirror would collect light that we could then combine together to make a picture  however  now let 's say we remove most of those mirrors so only a few remained 
 we could still try to combine this information together but now there are a lot of holes these remaining mirrors represent the locations where we have telescopes 
 this is an incredibly small number of measurements to make a picture from but although we only collect
  light at a few telescope locations as the earth rotates  we get to see other new measurements 
 in other words  as the disco ball spins those mirrors change locations and we get to observe different parts of the image 
 the imaging algorithms we develop fill in the missing gaps of the disco ball in order to reconstruct the underlying black hole image 
 if we had telescopes located everywhere on the globe in other words the entire disco ball this would be trivial
 however  we only see a few samples  and for that reason there are an infinite number of possible images that are perfectly consistent with our telescope measurements  however  not all images are created equal 
 some of those images look more like what we think of as images than others  
 and so my role in helping to take the first image of a black hole is to design algorithms that find the most reasonable image that also fits the telescope measurements
 just as a forensic sketch artist uses limited descriptions to piece together a picture using their knowledge of face structure 
 the imaging algorithms i develop use our limited telescope data to guide us to a picture that that also looks like stuff in our universe 
 using these algorithms we 're able to
 piece together pictures from this sparse noisy data  so here i show a sample reconstruction
 done using simulated data when we pretend to point our telescopes to the black hole in the center of our galaxy  
 although this is just a simulation reconstruction such as this give us hope that we 'll soon be able to reliably take the first image of a black hole
 and from it determine the size of its ring although i 'd love to go on about all the details
  of this algorithm  luckily for you i don 't have the time
  but i 'd still like to give you a brief idea of how we define what our universe looks like and how we use this to reconstruct and verify our results 
 since there are an infinite number of possible images that perfectly explain our telescope measurements  we have to choose between them in some way 
 we do this by ranking the images based upon how likely they are to be the black hole image  and then choosing the one that 's most likely  so what do i mean by this exactly
  's say we were trying to make a model that told us how likely an image were to appear on facebook 
 we 'd probably want the model to say it 's pretty unlikely that someone would post this noise image on the left  and pretty likely that someone would post a selfie like this one on the right 
 the image in the middle is blurry so even though it 's more likely we 'd see it on facebook compared to the noise image it 's probably less likely we 'd see it compared to the selfie but when it comes to images from the black hole
  with a real conundrum we 've never seen a black hole before 
 in that case what is a likely black hole image and what should we assume about the structure of black holes  we could try to use images from simulations we 've done like the image of the black hole from interstellar 
 but if we did this it could could cause some serious problems 
 what would happen if einstein 's theories didn 't hold  
 we 'd still want to reconstruct an accurate picture of what was going on 
 einstein 's equations too much into our algorithms we 'll just end up seeing what we expect to see 
 in other words  we want to leave the option open for there being a giant elephant at the center of our galaxy 
 laughter different types of images have very distinct features we can easily tell the difference between black hole simulation images and images we take every day here on
  we need a way to tell our algorithms what images look like without imposing one type of image 's features too much 
 one way we can try to get around this is by imposing the features of different kinds of images
 and seeing how the type of image we assume affects our reconstructions 
 if all images ' types produce a very similar looking image then we can start to become more confident that the image assumptions we 're making are not biasing
  little bit like giving the same description to three different sketch artists from all around the world 
 if they all produce a very similar looking face then we can start to become confident that they 're not imposing their own cultural biases on the drawings 
 one way we can try to impose different image features is by using pieces of existing images  so we take a large collection of images
  and we break them down into their little image patches  
 we then can treat each image patch a little bit like pieces of a puzzle 
 and we use commonly seen puzzle pieces to piece together an image that also fits our telescope measurements 
 different types of images have very distinctive sets of puzzle pieces  
 so what happens when we take the same data but we use different sets of puzzle pieces to reconstruct the image
  black hole image simulation puzzle pieces  ok  this looks reasonable  this looks like what we expect a black hole to look like  
 but did we just get it because we just fed it little pieces of black hole simulation images  
 let 's try another set of puzzle pieces from astronomical non black hole objects  
 ok we get a similar looking image  and then how about pieces from everyday images like the images you take with your own personal camera  
 great we see the same image
 we get the same image from all different sets of puzzle pieces then we can start to become more confident that the image assumptions we 're making aren 't biasing the final image we get too much  
 another thing we can do is take the same set of puzzle pieces  such as the ones derived from everyday images and use them to reconstruct many different kinds of source images 
 so in our simulations we pretend a black hole looks like astronomical non black hole objects
 as well as everyday images like the elephant in the center of our galaxy  
 when the results of our algorithms on the bottom look very similar to the simulation 's truth image on top then we can start to become more confident in our algorithms  
 and i really want to emphasize here that all of these pictures were created by piecing together little pieces of everyday photographs like you 'd take with your own personal camera  
 so an image of a black hole we 've never seen before
  may eventually be created by piecing together pictures we see all the time of people buildings trees  cats and dogs 
 imaging ideas like this will make it possible for us to take our very first pictures of a black hole 
 and hopefully verify those famous theories on which scientists rely on a daily basis  but of course  getting imaging ideas like this working would never have been possible without the amazing team of researchers that i have the privilege to work with
  still amazes me that although i began this project with no background in astrophysics what we have achieved through this unique collaboration could result in the very first images of a black hole  
 but big projects like the event horizon telescope are successful due to all the interdisciplinary expertise different people bring to the table we 're a melting pot of astronomers physicists  mathematicians
  this is what will make it soon possible to achieve something once thought impossible
 i 'd like to encourage all of you to go out and help push the boundaries of science even if it may at first seem as mysterious to you as a black hole  thank you
