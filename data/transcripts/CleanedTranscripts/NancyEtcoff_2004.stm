  a feeling the pursuit of happiness and human design i put up a somewhat dour darwin but a very happy chimp up there my
 first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory  man wishes to be happy only wishes to be happy and cannot wish not to be so we are
  wired to pursue happiness not only to enjoy it but to want more and more of it so given that that 's true how good are we at
 increasing our happiness  well we certainly try 
 if you look on the amazon site there are over two thousand titles with advice on the seven habits  the nine choices the ten secrets
  fourteen thousand thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness  now another way we try to increase our happiness is we medicate ourselves 
 and so there 's over one hundred and twenty million prescriptions out there for antidepressants  prozac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug it was clean efficient there was 
  no high there was really no danger it had no street value in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five illegal drugs were a $ four hundred billion business representing eight percent of world trade roughly the same as gas and oil
  happiness haven 't really increased happiness very much one problem that 's happening now is although the rates of happiness are about as flat as the surface of the moon 
  depression and anxiety are rising some people say this is because we have better diagnosis and more people are being found out it isn 't just that we 're seeing it all over the world
  united states right now there are more suicides than homicides  
 there is a rash of suicide in china and
 the world health organization predicts by the year two thousand and twenty that depression will be the second largest cause of disability  now the good news here is that if you take surveys 
  from around the world we see that about three quarters of people will say they are at least pretty happy  
  for example these two show great growth in income  absolutely flat happiness curves my field  the field of psychology hasn 't done a
 whole lot
 to help us move forward in understanding human happiness in part we have the legacy of freud who was a pessimist who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest is propelled by infantile aspects
 of the individual that can never be met in
  one feels inclined to say that the intention that man should be happy is not included in the plan of creation 
 so the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy was really what freud called ordinary misery laughter
 and freud in part reflects the the anatomy of the human emotion system which is that we have both a 
  negative system  and our negative system is extremely sensitive
  so for example we 're born loving the taste of something sweet and reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter  we also find that people are more averse to losing
 than they are happy to gain the formula for a happy marriage is five positive remarks or interactions for every one negative
  and that 's how powerful the one negative is especially
 expressions of contempt or disgust well you really need a lot of positives to upset that
  i also put in here the stress response  we 're wired for dangers that are immediate that are physical that are imminent  and so our body goes into an incredible reaction where endogenous opioids come in we have a system that is really ancient  
  really there for physical danger and so over time this becomes a stress response which has enormous effects on the body cortisol floods the brain it destroys hippocampal cells and memory and can lead to
 all kinds of health problems 
 but unfortunately  we need this system in part if we were only governed by pleasure we would not survive 
 we really have two command posts emotions are short lived intense responses to challenge and to opportunity 
 and each one of them allows us to click into alternate
  selves that tune in turn on drop out thoughts perceptions  feelings and memories  we tend to think of emotions as just feelings but in fact emotions are an all systems alert that change what we remember  what kind of decisions we make 
 and how we perceive things  so let me go forward to the new science of happiness we 've come away from the freudian gloom and people are now
 actively studying this and one of the key points in the science of happiness is
  that happiness and unhappiness are not endpoints of a single continuum the freudian model is really one continuum that as you get less
 miserable you get happier and that isn 't true when you get less miserable you get less miserable
  and that happiness is a whole other end of the equation  and it 's been missing it 's been missing from psychotherapy so when people 's symptoms go away they tend to recur because
 there isn 't a sense of the other half of what pleasure happiness compassion gratitude what are the positive emotions and of course we know this intuitively that happiness is not just the absence 
  of misery  but somehow it was not put forward until very recently seeing these as two parallel systems so that the body can both look for opportunity and also protect itself from danger at the same time and they 're sort of two reciprocal and dynamically
  interacting systems 
 people have also wanted to deconstruct we use this word happy and it 's this very large umbrella of a term  
 and then three emotions for which there are no english words fiero which is
 the pride in accomplishment of a challenge schadenfreude  which is happiness in another 's misfortune a malicious pleasure 
  is a pride and joy in one 's children absent from this list and absent from any discussions of happiness are happiness in another 's happiness we don 't seem to have a word for that 
  we are very sensitive to the negative  but it is in part offset by the fact that we have a positivity  
 faces they like to listen to consonant melodies instead of dissonant melodies  babies really are born with a lot of
 innate pleasures 
 there was once a statement made by a psychologist that said that eighty percent of the pursuit of happiness is really just about the genes and it 's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller 
  there is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes about fifty percent but there is still that fifty percent that is unaccounted for let
 's just go into the brain for a moment and see where does happiness arise from in evolution we have basically at least two systems here  
 and they both are very ancient one is the reward system  and that 's fed by the chemical dopamine  and it starts in the ventral tegmental area it goes to the nucleus accumbens all the way up to  the prefrontal cortex
  orbital frontal cortex where decisions are made high level this was originally seen as a system that was the pleasure system of the brain 
 olds and milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat and the rat would just keep pressing that bar thousands and thousands and thousands of times it wouldn 't eat it wouldn 't sleep it wouldn 't have sex it wouldn 't do anything but press this bar so they assumed
  brain 's orgasmatron  it turned out that it wasn 't that it really is a system of motivation a system of wanting 
 it gives objects what 's called incentive salience it makes something look so attractive that you just have to go after it  
 that 's something different from the system that is
 the pleasure system which simply says 
  the pleasure system as you see which
 is the internal opiates there is a hormone oxytocin is widely spread throughout the brain dopamine system  the wanting system is much more centralized  the other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal 
 and we see here the smile  and the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips to the zygomatic major it 's also crinkling the outer corner of the
  so you see even 10 month old babies when they see their mother will show this particular kind of smile  extroverts use it more than introverts 
 people who are relieved of depression show it more after than before  so if you want to unmask a true look of happiness  you will look for this expression 
 our pleasures are really ancient and we learn of course many many pleasures but many of them are base
  of course is biophilia that we have a response to the natural world that 's very profound very interesting studies done on people recovering
 from surgery who found that people who faced a brick wall
 versus people who looked out on trees and nature  
 the people who looked out on the brick wall were in the hospital longer  needed more medication  and had more medical complications there is something very restorative about nature  
  's part of how we
 are tuned humans particularly so we 're very imitative creatures and we imitate from almost the second we are born here is a three week old baby and if you stick your tongue out at this baby 
  the baby will do the same we are social beings from the beginning and even studies of cooperation show that cooperation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain 
  looking at this intersubjectivity or the importance of the social brain to humans who come into the world helpless and need each other tremendously is that they focus instead on the self
 me not we and i think this has been a really tremendous problem that goes against our biology and and nature  
 and hasn 't made us any happier at all because when you think about it people are happiest when in flow
 when they 're absorbed in something out in the world when they 're with other people when they 're active engaged in sports focusing on a loved one learning having sex  whatever they 're not sitting in front of the mirror trying to figure themselves out 
 or thinking about themselves these are not the periods when you feel happiest  the other thing is that a piece of evidence is is if you look at computerized text analysis of
 people who commit suicide what you
  the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone and being alone is is very unnatural to the human 
 there is a profound need to belong  
 but there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up because for example the genes don 't care whether we 're happy they care that we
 replicate that we pass our genes on so for example we have three
  systems that that underlie reproduction because it 's so important  there 's lust which is just
 wanting to have sex and that 's really mediated by the sex hormones  romantic attraction that gets into the desire system and that 's dopamine fed and that 's i must have this one person there 's attachment which is oxytocin and the opiates which says
  person can be in a long term attachment  
 become romantically infatuated with someone else and want to have sex with a third person  
 the other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray is in social status  we are very acutely aware of our social status and
 always seek to further and increase it now in the animal world
  only one way to increase status and that 's dominance  i seize command by physical prowess  and i keep it by beating my chest and you make submissive gestures 
 now the human has a whole other way to rise to the top and that is a prestige
 route which is freely conferred someone has expertise and knowledge and knows how to do things and we give that person status and that 's clearly the way for us 
  to create many more niches of status so that people don 't have to be lower on the status hierarchy as they are in the animal world
 the data isn 't terribly supportive of money buying happiness  but it 's not irrelevant so if you look at questions like this life satisfaction you see life satisfaction going up with each 
  rung of income  you see mental see mental distress going up with lower income  so clearly there is some effect  but the effect is is relatively small  and one of the problems with money is materialism what happens when people pursue money
  too avidly is they forget about the real basic pleasures of life  
 so we have here this couple do you think the less fortunate are having better sex and then this kid over here is saying leave me alone with my toys so one of the things is that it really takes over that whole 
  system takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system maslow had this idea back in the 1950s that
  as people rise above their biological needs as the world becomes safer
 and we don 't have to worry about basic needs being met our biological system
 whatever motivates us is being satisfied we can rise above them to think beyond ourselves toward 
  or transcendence and rise above the materialist so to just quickly conclude with some brief data that suggests this might be so 
 one is people who underwent what is called a quantum change  they felt their life and their whole values had changed  
 and sure enough if you look at the kinds of values that come in you see wealth adventure achievement pleasure fun be respected before the change and much more post materialist values after women had a whole different set of value shifts  
 but very similarly the only one that survived there was happiness they went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self control to generosity and forgiveness
  i end with a few quotes 
 there is only one question how to love this world 
 and rilke if your daily life seems poor do not blame it blame yourself tell yourself that you are not poet enough
 to call forth its riches first say to yourself what you would be then do what you have to do
