  there 's a big question at the center of life in our democracies today 
 how do we fight terror without destroying democracies without trampling human rights
  i 've spent much of my career working with journalists with bloggers with activists
  activists with human rights researchers all around the world  and i 've come to the conclusion
 that if our democratic societies do not double down
 on protecting and defending human rights  freedom of the press and a free and open internet  radical extremist
  i actually want to drill down on this a little bit  so 
 one of the countries that has been on the frontlines of this issue is tunisia  
 which was the only country to come out of the arab spring with a successful democratic revolution  
 five years later
 they 're struggling with serious terror attacks and rampant isis recruitment 
 and many tunisians are calling on their government to do whatever it takes to keep them safe 
 tunisian cartoonist nadia khiari
 has summed up the situation with this character who says i don 't give a damn about human rights  i don 't give a damn about the revolution
 i don 't give a damn about democracy and liberty  i just want to be safe 
 satisfied asked his jailer you 're safe now 
 if the tunisian people can figure out how to deal with their terrorism problem without ending up in
  they will be a model not only for their region  but for all of us
 the reality is that civil society journalists and activists are coming under attack from extremist groups on the one hand and in many countries also from their own governments 
 we 're seeing bloggers and journalists being jailed 
 charged and intimidated by their own governments many of which are allies with the west in the war on terror
 just three examples a friend and former colleague of mine 
 has been charged with threatening state security along with six other activists in morocco 
 the saudi blogger raif badawi has been jailed and flogged for insulting islam and criticizing the
  has been detained and charged with spreading terrorist propaganda  because he and some other activists have been supporting kurdish media
 anti terror measures quickly turn into state repression without strong protection for minority communities
 and for peaceful debate this
  needs to be supported by a robust  independent local media but while that 's not really happening 
 washington is teaming up with silicon valley and with hollywood
 to pour millions hundreds of millions of dollars into what 's called 
 a fancy word for
  to counter
 the terrorist propaganda spreading all over the internet 
 in europe internet referral units are being set up so that people can report on extremist content that they find and get it censored  
 the problem is that all of this propaganda  monitoring and censorship completely fails to make up for the fact
 that the people
  who are the most credible voices who can present credible ideas and alternative solutions to real economic  social and political 
  problems in their community that are causing people to to turn to extremism in the first place are being silenced by their own governments
  house  the human rights organization 
 reports that two thousand and fifteen marks the 10th straight year in a row of decline in freedom worldwide  
 and this is not just because of the actions of authoritarian governments it 's also because democratic governments are increasingly cracking down
  un secretary general ban ki moon has warned that preventing extremism and promoting human rights go hand in hand it 's not to say that governments shouldn 't keep us safe of course they should 
 but we need public oversight  transparency and accountability to the rule of law 
  thirteen in bangladesh over a dozen secular bloggers
 and community activists have been literally slaughtered by extremists while the government has done very little 
 from the city of raqqa in syria people like  ruqia hassan and naji jerf have been assassinated for their reporting out of
  silently relies on strong encryption to send out their reports and shield themselves from interception and surveillance  
 yet authorities in countries like the united states the united kingdom and many other democracies are seeking to use the law to either weaken or outright ban strong
  because the bad guys are using it too 
 we have got to fight for the right of citizens to use strong encryption  
 otherwise  dissent and investigative journalism are going to become even more difficult in even more places  
 and the bad guys the criminals and terrorists are still going to find ways to communicate  
 kudos to the companies that are standing up for their users ' right to use encryption
  but when it comes to censorship  the picture is much more troubling  
 yes there 's a real problem of extremist content spreading all over the internet  
 and facebook  youtube and twitter are among the many companies who report having taken down hundreds of thousands of pieces of content and deactivating accounts that are connected 
  to the extremist 's speech  the problem is their enforcement mechanisms are a complete black box and there is collateral damage
 take for example  iyad
 an activist who makes fun of isis on twitter he had his account deactivated because he shares a surname with a prominent isis leader  
 last december a number of women named isis which also happens to be the name of an egyptian goddess had their accounts deactivated
  this woman who lives in the united states and is a computer programmer reported on twitter about her deactivation on facebook  managed to get enough media attention to have her account reinstated  
 but that 's the thing she had to get media attention 
 and journalists aren 't immune david thomson an expert on terrorism and reporter for radio france international had reports deleted from his facebook account and had his account deactivated for several days because they contained
  pictures of isis flags even though he was just reporting on isis not promoting it 
 and then we have stories from people like this egyptian man  ahmed abdellahy 
 who reported recently in an event in washington dc that some of his arguments with extremists he now spends his time on social media arguing with isis followers trying to
  get them to turn away
 some of his arguments with these extremists get deleted which he believes has the effect of shielding them
 from alternative points of view it 's unclear whether facebook even knows the extent of the collateral damage or the other
 companies as well  but we do know that journalism activism and public debate are being silenced in the effort to stamp out extremist speech  
 so with these companies having so much power over the public discourse  they need to be held accountable they need to carry out impact assessment to identify 
 and fix the problems that we 're clearly seeing they need to be more transparent about their enforcement mechanisms and they need to have clear appeal and
  grievance mechanisms so people can get their content reinstated now i 've been talking
 for the last ten minutes about how governments and companies are making it more difficult for people like these this is a picture of members of the citizen media network global voices that i helped to cofound over ten years ago with my friend ethan
  about five years ago right after the arab spring  the data scientist gilad lotan
 created a network map of the people in global voices who were heavy users of twitter during the arab spring  
 and he found that many of these people served as key information nodes between activists and journalists throughout the tunisian and
  we 've got to make sure that these people not only survive  
 but are able to continue to thrive many of them are still active other than the ones who have gone to jail or have been driven into hiding
 or exile 
 all around the world 
 people who are sick and tired of fear and oppression are linking up in their communities and across borders  we 've got to do everything we can to push our governments and companies to do a
  better job of protecting their rights  we 've also got to be more mindful about how our own personal political consumer and business choices affect people like these around the world  
 also if you follow the news it 's pretty clear that that alone isn 't going to be enough 
 we 've got to take personal responsibility
 by joining or at very least
  supporting
 the growing ecosystem of individuals and groups who are fighting for social justice  environmental sustainability government accountability human rights  freedom of the press and a free and open internet all around the world  
 i believe that ultimately  we can overcome
 the digitally empowered networks of
 demagoguery and hate  but we 've got to do this by really beefing up
 the global networks of citizens around the world  powered by people who are working hard every day  and taking personal risk
 for a future world that is more peaceful just open and free
 thanks very much for
