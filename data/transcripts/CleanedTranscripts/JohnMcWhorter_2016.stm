  the language i 'm speaking right now is on its way to becoming the world 's universal language for better or for worse  let 's face it 
  it 's the language of the internet  it 's the language of finance  it 's the language of air traffic control
  popular music  diplomacy english is everywhere 
 now mandarin chinese is spoken by more people  but more chinese people are learning english than english speakers are learning chinese 
 last i heard there are two dozen universities in china right now teaching
  is taking over and in addition to that it 's been predicted that at the end of the century
 almost all of the languages that exist now there are about six thousand will no longer be spoken there will only be some hundreds left  
 and on top of that it 's at the point where instant translation of live speech is not only possible
 but it gets better every year 
 the reason i 'm reciting those things to you is because i can tell that we 're getting to the point where a question is going to start being asked which is why should 
  we learn foreign languages other than if english happens to be foreign to one why bother to learn another one when it 's getting to the point where almost everybody in the world will be able to communicate
  i think there are a lot of reasons  but i first want to address the one that you 're probably most likely to have heard of because actually it 's more dangerous than you might think 
 and that is the idea that a language channels your thoughts that the vocabulary and the grammar of different languages gives everybody a different kind
 acid trip so to speak that is a marvelously enticing idea 
 but it 's kind of fraught so it 's not that it 's untrue completely  
 so for example in french and spanish the word for table is for some reason  marked as feminine so la table la mesa you just have to deal with it 
 it has been shown that if you are a speaker of one of those languages and you happen to be
  asked how you would imagine a table talking 
 then much more often than could possibly be an accident a french or a spanish speaker says that the table would talk with a high
 and feminine voice  so if you 're french or spanish to you a table is kind of a girl as opposed to if you are an english speaker  
 it 's hard not to love data like that and many
  will tell you that that means that there 's a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages but you
 have to watch out because imagine if somebody put us under the microscope the us being those of us who speak english natively  what is the worldview
 from english  so for example let 's take an english speaker up on the screen that is
  he speaks english i presume he has a worldview now 
 that is donald trump in his way he speaks english as well 
 and here is ms kardashian  and she is an english speaker too 
  here are three speakers of the english language what worldview do those three people have in common 
 what worldview is shaped through the english language that unites them it 's a highly fraught concept and so
 gradual consensus is becoming that language can shape thought  but it tends to be in rather darling  obscure psychological flutters 
  it 's not a matter of giving you a different pair of glasses on the world 
 if that 's the case  then why learn languages if it isn 't going to change the way you think  what would the other reasons be there are some 
 one of them is
 that if you want to imbibe
 a culture if you want to drink it in if you want to become part of it then whether or not the language channels the culture and that seems doubtful
  if you want to imbibe the culture you have to control to some degree the language that the culture happens to be conducted in there 's no other way there 's an interesting 
 illustration of this i have to go slightly obscure but really you should seek it out there 's a movie by the canadian film director denys  arcand read out in english on the page 
 if you want to look him up he did a film called
  jesus of montreal and many of the characters are vibrant  funny passionate interesting
  women there 's one scene closest to the end where they have to take a friend to an anglophone hospital 
 in the hospital they have to speak english now they speak english but it 's not their native language  they 'd rather not speak english  and they speak it more slowly
 they have accents they 're not idiomatic suddenly these characters that you 've fallen in love with become husks of themselves they 're shadows of themselves 
 to go into a culture and to only ever process people through that kind of skrim curtain is to never truly get the culture and so to the extent that hundreds of languages will be
  one reason to learn them is because they are tickets to being able to participate in the culture of the people who speak them just by virtue of the fact that it is their code  so that 's one reason 
 second reason  
 it 's been shown that if you speak two languages dementia is less likely to set in 
 and that you are probably a better multitasker  and these are factors that set in early  and so that ought to give you some sense of when
  when to give junior or juniorette lessons in another language  bilingualism is healthy  and then third
 languages are just an awful lot of fun much more fun than we 're often told  so for example
  have in common all those things have in common the consonants sitting in the middle like pillars they stay still and the vowels dance around 
  the consonants who wouldn 't want to roll that around in their mouths you can get that from hebrew you can get that from ethiopia 's main language amharic that
  languages have different word orders learning how to speak with different word order is like
 driving on the different side of a street if you go to certain country or the feeling that you get when you put witch hazel around your eyes and you feel the tingle a language 
 can do that to you so for example the cat in the hat comes back a book that i 'm sure we all
  do you know where i found him do you know where he was he was eating cake in the tub yes he was fine 
 now if you learn that in mandarin chinese then you have to master you can know i did where him find  he was tub inside gorging cake no mistake gorging chewing that just feels good imagine being able to do that
 for years and years at a time or have you ever
 learned any cambodian
 me either but if i did i would get to roll around in my mouth not some baker 's dozen of vowels like english has but a 
 good thirty different vowels scooching and oozing around in the cambodian mouth like bees in a hive that is what a language can get you 
  when it 's never been easier to teach yourself another language it used to be that you had to go to a classroom 
 and there would be some diligent teacher some genius teacher in there but that person was only in there at certain times and you had to go then and then was not most times you had to go to class 
 if you didn 't have that you had something called a record  i cut my teeth on those
  there was only so much data on a record  or a cassette or even that antique object known as a cd other than that you had books that didn 't work that 's just the way it was 
 today you can lay down lie on your living room floor sipping bourbon and teach yourself any language that you want to with wonderful sets such as rosetta stone i highly recommend the lesser known
  as well you can do it any time therefore you can do it more and better 
 you can give yourself your morning pleasures in various languages i take some dilbert in various languages every single morning it can increase your skills  couldn 't have done 
  it twenty years ago when the idea of having any language you wanted in your pocket coming from your phone would have sounded like science fiction to very sophisticated people 
 that you teach yourself languages other than the one that i 'm speaking because there 's never been a better time to do it  it 's an awful lot of fun  it won 't change your mind but it will most certainly blow your mind  thank you very much
