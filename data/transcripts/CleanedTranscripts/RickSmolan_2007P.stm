  some of you have heard the story before but in fact there 's somebody in the audience who 's never heard this story in front of an audience before so i 'm a
 little more nervous than i normally am telling this story  i used to be a photographer for many years
  to photograph amerasian children children who had been fathered by american gis all over southeast asia  and then abandoned forty thousand children all over asia  i had never heard the word amerasian before  
 i spent a few days photographing children in different countries  and
 like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists i always hope that when my pictures were
  they might actually have an effect on a situation instead of just documenting it so 
 i was so disturbed by what i saw  and i was so unhappy with the the article that ran afterwards 
 that i decided i would take six months off i was twenty eight years old i decided i would find six children in different countries  and actually go spend some time with the kids and try to 
  tell their story a little bit better than i thought i had done for time magazine 
 was looking for children who hadn 't been photographed before  and the pearl buck foundation told me that they worked with a lot of
 americans who were donating money to help some of these kids and a man told me who ran the pearl buck foundation
 in korea that there was a young girl who was eleven years old being raised by
  and the grandmother had never let any westerners ever see her  every time any westerners came to the village she hid the girl and of course i was immediately intrigued
 i saw photographs of her and i thought i wanted to go and the guy just told me there 's no way this grandmother won 't even you know there 's no way she 's ever going to let you meet this this girl that 's she 's raising i took a translator with me 
 and went to this village found the grandmother sat down with her and to my astonishment she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter  
  i had a sleeping bag the family had a small shed on the side of the house  so i said could i sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings and
 i just told the little girl whose name name was  hyun sook lee  that if i ever did anything to embarrass her she didn 't speak a word of english although she looked very american
 she could just put up her hand and say stop and i would stop taking
  so there i was i couldn 't speak a word of korean and this is the first night i met hyun sook her mother was still alive her mother
 was not raising her her grandmother was raising her and what struck me immediately
 was how in love the two of these
 people were the
 grandmother was incredibly fond  deeply in love with this little girl they slept on the floor at night the way they heat their homes in korea is to put bricks under the floors so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor  hyun sook was eleven years old  i had photographed
  as i said a lot of these kids  hyun sook was in fact the fifth child that i found to photograph and almost universally amongst all the kids they were really psychologically
 damaged by having been made fun of ridiculed picked on and been rejected and korea was probably the place i found
 to be the worst for these kids and what struck me immediately in
  was how confident she appeared to be how happy she seemed to be in her own skin 
 and remember this picture because i 'm going to show you another picture later but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother  although she looks so western  i decided to follow her to school this is the first morning i stayed with her  this is on the way to school  
 this is the morning assembly outside her school  
 and i noticed that she was clowning around when the teachers would ask questions she 'd be the first person to raise
  hand
  again not at all shy or withdrawn or anything like the other children that i 'd photographed again the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions getting in trouble for whispering into her best friend 's ears 
 in the middle of class  and one of the other things that i said to her through the translator again  this thing about saying stop
  who picked the other girls to be on her team  
 it was very obvious from the very beginning that she was a leader  this is on the way home and that 's north korea up along the hill this is up along the dmz they would actually cover the windows every night so that light 
 couldn 't be seen because the south korean government has said for years that the north koreans may invade at any time so there 's always this the closer you were to north korea the more terrifying it was very often at school i 'd be taking pictures and she
  would whisper into her girlfriends ' ears and then look at me and say stop and i would stand at attention and all the girls would crack up and it was sort of a little joke 
 the end of the week came and my translator came back because i 'd asked her to come back  so i could formally thank the grandmother and hyun sook 
 and in the course of the grandmother talking to to the translator the grandmother started crying  and i said to my translator what 's going on why is she crying
  she spoke to the grandmother for a moment and then she started getting tears in her eyes and i said ok what did i do  what 's going on  why is everyone crying 
 and the translator said the grandmother says that she thinks she 's dying  
 and she wants to know if you would take  hyun sook to america with you 
 and i said    i 'm twenty eight years old and i
  live in hotels and
 i 'm not married i mean  i had fallen in love with this girl but i you know it was like  emotionally i was about twelve years old if you know of photographers  
 the joke is it 's the the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented 
 sorry i have to go on an assignment i 'll be back and then you never come back  so
 i asked the translator why she thought she was dying can i get her to a hospital could i pay to
  she refused any help at all 
 and so when i got outside i actually gave the translator some money and said please go back and see if you can do something and i gave the grandmother my business card and i said if you 're serious i will try to find a family for her 
 and i immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta georgia who had an 11 year old son  
 and
 my best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child 
 my friends gene and gail had not heard from me in about a year and suddenly i was calling saying i 'm in korea and i 've met this extraordinary girl and
 i said
 the grandmother thinks she 's sick but i think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also and i said i 'll pay for the i mean i had this whole sort of picture so anyway i left and
 my my friends actually said they were very interested in
  scare the grandmother to death if i actually
 write to her and tell her that you 're willing to adopt her i want to go back and talk to her but i was off on assignment i figured i 'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother and on christmas day i was in bangkok 
  with a group of photographers and got a telegram back in those days you got telegrams
 because i hadn 't told them what i was doing because i was so upset with the story they 'd run  
 so i went back to korea and i went back to hyun sook 's village and she was gone  and the house that i had spent time in was empty it was incredibly cold no one 
  in the village would tell me where hyun sook was because the grandmother had always hidden her from westerners and they had no idea about this request that she 'd made of me so i finally found myung sung 
  gave us an address on the outside of seoul  and i went to that address
 and
 knocked on the door 
 and a man answered the door it was not a very nice area of seoul
  as there were mud streets outside of it and i knocked on the door and hyun sook answered the door and her eyes were bloodshot  and she seemed to be in shock she didn 't recognize me there was
  and this man came to the door and kind of barked something in korean and i said to the translator what did he say and she said he wants to know who you are and i said well tell him that i
 am a photographer i started explaining who i was and he interrupted  and she said he says he knows who you are what do you want i said well tell him that i
 was asked by this little girl 's grandmother to find a family for her and he said i 'm her uncle she 's fine you can leave now
  was you know the door was being slammed in my face it 's incredibly cold  and i 'm trying to think what would the hero do in a movie if i was writing this as a movie script so
 i said listen it 's really cold i 've come a very long way do you mind if i just come in for a minute i 'm freezing so the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor and as we started talking 
 i saw him yell something and
  and brought us some food  
 and i had this whole mental picture of sort of like cinderella i sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful bright happy little child who now appeared to be very withdrawn 
 being enslaved by this family  and i was really appalled and i couldn 't figure out what to do and the more i tried talking to him the less friendly he was getting 
 so i finally decided i said look 
  a family to live with i was very worried about her i made a promise to her grandmother your mother that i would find a family and now i 'm so happy that you 're going to take care of her i said but you know i bought an airline ticket and i 'm stuck here for a week 
 and i said  i 'm staying in a hotel downtown would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow 
 and you can practice your english because he told me i was trying to ask him questions about himself
  i went to the hotel  and i found two older amerasians a girl
 whose mother had been a prostitute  and she was a prostitute and a boy who 'd been in and out of jail  and
 i said to them look  there 's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to america i said i don 't know if it 's the right decision or not but i would like you to come
  to lunch tomorrow and tell the uncle what it 's like to walk down the street what people say to you what you do for a living 
 and just i want him to understand what happens if she stays here 
 and i could be wrong i don 't know but i wish you would come tomorrow so these two came to lunch  and
 we got thrown out of the restaurant they were yelling at him they were
 it got to be really ugly and we went outside and he was just furious and i knew i had totally blown this whole thing here i was again trying to figure out what to do  
 and he started yelling at me and i said to the translator ok tell him to calm down
  saying and she said well he 's saying ' who the hell are you to walk into my house some rich american with your cameras around your neck
 accusing me of enslaving my niece  this is my niece i love her she 's my sister 's daughter
  who the hell are you to to accuse me of something like this
  children i said i 'm in love with your niece i think she 's an incredibly special child and i said look  i will fly my friends over here from the united states if you want to meet them to see if you approve of them i just think that
 what little i know about the situation  she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to
  everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was again the stupidest thing i could have possibly done because who 's ever good enough for your
 relative but he invited me to come to a ceremony they were having that day for her grandmother 
 and they actually take items of clothing and photographs and they burn them as part of the ritual 
 and you can see how different she looks just in three months this was now  i think february
 early february and the pictures before were taken in september
  marine priest that i had met in the course of doing the story who had  seventy five children living in his house he had three women helping him take care of these kids and so i suggested to the uncle that we go down and meet father keene 
 to find out how the adoption process worked because i wanted him to feel like this was all being done very much above board so this is on the way down to the orphanage
 this is father keene he 's just a wonderful guy
 he had kids from all over korea living there and he would find families for these kids  
 this is a social worker interviewing
  hyun sook now i had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this because the grandmother to me appeared to be sort of the village wise woman and
 the person everybody throughout the day i noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother and i always had this mental picture that even though they may have been one of the poorer families in the village
 were one of the most respected families in the village and i always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded and insisted that the villagers treat hyun sook with the same respect they treated her
 hyun sook stayed at father keene 's and her uncle agreed to let her stay there until the adoption went through he actually agreed to the adoption and i went off on assignment
  and he closes the door and he says i have seventy five children here in the orphanage and it 's total bedlam and there 's clothes and there 's kids and you know there 's three adults and seventy five kids you can imagine  
 and he said the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the
 names of the older kids and the younger kids and she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids  and then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day
 she 's telling me that i 'm messy and i have to clean up my room and he said i don 't know who raised her but he said she 's running the orphanage and she 's been here three days 
 this was movie day that she organized where all the kids went to the movies 
 a lot of the kids who had been adopted actually wrote back to the other kids telling them about what their life was like with
  it was a really big deal when the letters showed up  this is a woman who is now working at the orphanage whose son had been adopted 
 gene and gail started studying korean the moment they had gotten my first letter they really wanted to be able to welcome 
 hyun sook into their family and one of the things father keene told me when i came back from one of these trips  hyun sook had chosen the name natasha  
  on the american air force station this may be one of those myth buster things that we 'll have to clear up here in a minute so my friend gene flew over with his son tim gail couldn 't come 
 and they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary and this was gene showing the uncle where atlanta was on the map where he lived  
 this is the uncle signing the adoption papers now we went out to dinner that night to celebrate the uncle went back to his family
  natasha and tim and and gene and i went out to dinner  and gene was showing natasha how to use a knife and fork and then natasha was returning
 the utensil lessons
  we went back to our hotel our hotel room and gene was showing natasha also where atlanta was  this is the third night we were in korea the first night we 'd gotten
 a room for the kids right next to us now i 'd been staying in this room for about three months
 it was a little
 15 story korean hotel 
 so the second night we didn 't keep the kids ' room  because we went down and slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage and the third night we came back we 'd just gone out to dinner where you saw the pictures
  and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said there 's no other free rooms on your floor tonight so if you want to put the kids five floors below you there 's a room there 
 and gene and i looked at each other and said
  sleeping bag i 'll sleep on the floor and i said yeah i have one too so  tim and i slept on the floor natasha got one bed gene got the other
 kids pass out it 's been very exciting for three days we 're lying in bed and gene and i are talking about how cool we are we said 
 that was so great we saved this little girl 's life we were just like you know ah 
 just full of ourselves  and we fall asleep and i 've been in this room you know for a couple of months now and they always
  overheat overheat the hotels in korea terribly so during the day i always left the window open  and then at night about midnight they turn the heat off in the hotel so at about one a m the whole room would be like twenty below zero and i 'd get up i 'd been doing this every night i 'd been there so sure enough it 's one o 'clock room
 's freezing i go to close the window  and i hear people shouting outside and i
  the bars must have just gotten out and i don 't speak korean but i 'm hearing these voices and i 'm not hearing
 anger i 'm hearing terror 
 so i open the window and i look out  and there 's flames coming up the side of our hotel and the hotel 's on fire  
 so i run over to gene and i wake him up and i say gene don 't freak out  i think the hotel 's on fire and now there 's smoke and flames coming by our windows we 're on the eleventh floor so the two of us were just
  are like when they 've been asleep for like an hour it 's like they took five valiums you know they 're all over the place and we can 't talk to her i remember his son  had the l l bean bootlaces and we 're trying to do up his
 his laces so we try to get to the door  and we run to the door and we open the door and it 's like walking into a blast furnace  
 there 's people screaming there 's the sound of glass breaking there 's these weird thumps  
 and the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds and gene turns around and says we 're not going to make it
 he closes the door and the whole room is now filled with smoke we 're all choking  and there 's smoke pouring through the vents under the doors there 's people screaming
 i just remember this unbelievable just utter chaos i remember sitting near the bed and i was just so i had two overwhelming feelings one was absolute terror it 's like oh please god i just want to wake 
  up this has got to be a nightmare this can 't be happening please i just want to wake up it 's got to be a nightmare and the other is unbelievable guilt here i 've been playing god with
  friends ' lives my friends ' son with natasha 's life and this what you get when you try playing god is you hurt people i remember just being so frightened and terrified and gene who 's lying on the floor says man we 've got to soak towels i said what he says 
 we 've got to soak towels we 're going to die from the smoke so we ran to the bathroom and got towels and put them over our faces and the kids faces  
 then he said do you have gaffer 's tape
  all we can do we 've got to stop the smoke i mean  gene thank god for gene so  
 we put the the room service menus over the vents in the wall  we put blankets at the bottom of the door we put the kids on the windowsill to try to get some air
  and there was a building a new building going up that was being built right outside across the street from our hotel  and there in the building
 were photographers waiting for people to jump 
 eleven people ended up dying in the fire  five people jumped and died other people were were killed by the smoke and
 there 's this loud thumping on the door after about forty five minutes in all this and people were shouting in korean and i remember
 natasha didn 't want us opening the door sorry i was trying not to open the door because we 'd spent so much time barricading the room  i didn 't know who it was i didn 't know what they wanted and natasha
  could tell they were  they were firemen trying to get us out  i remember a sort of a tussle at the door trying to get the door open in any case  
 twelve hours later  i mean they put us in the lobby  gene ended up using his coat and his fist in the coat to break open a liquor cabinet people were lying on the floor  it was one of just the most horrifying nights
  and then
 twelve hours later we rented a car as we had planned to and drove back to natasha 's village and we kept saying do you realize we were dying in a hotel fire like eight eight hours ago it 's so weird how life just goes 
  on natasha wanted to introduce her brother and father to all the villagers and the day we showed up turned out to be a 60 year old man 's birthday this guy 's sixty years old  so it turned into a dual celebration because natasha was the first person from this village ever to go to the united
  these are the greenhouse tents this is the elders teaching gene their dances we drank a lot of rice wine we were both so drunk i couldn 't believe it
 this is the last picture before gene and tim headed back the
 adoption people told us it was going to take a year for the adoption to go through like
 what could you do for a year  so i found out the name of every official on both the korean and american side and i photographed them and told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done
 and four months later  the adoption papers came through  this is
 saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage  this is father keene with natasha at the bus stop her great aunt at the airport i had
 a wonderful deal with cathay pacific airlines for many years where they gave me free passes on all their airlines
  in return for photography it was like the ultimate perk  and
 the pilot i actually knew because they used to let me sit in the jump seat to tell you how long ago this was  this is a tri star and so they let natasha actually sit in the jump seat  and the pilot  jeff cowley 
 actually went back and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after after meeting natasha this is twenty eight hours later in atlanta it 's a very long flight 
 if you were writing this you 'd say no we 've got to write the script differently 
 this is the first night showing natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts gene and gail know everyone in atlanta they 're the most social couple imaginable so at this point natasha doesn 't speak a word of english other than
 what little father keene taught her  this is kylie her sister who 's now a
  this is a deal i had with natasha which is that when we got to atlanta she could take she could cut off my beard she never liked it very much 
 she learned english in three months she entered seventh grade at her own age level 
 pledge of allegiance for the first time this
 is her cooking teacher  natasha told me that a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up because they would talk to her and she wouldn 't answer and they didn 't realize she didn 't actually speak english very
  well in the beginning but what i noticed again as an observer was she was choosing who was going to be on her team  and
 seemed to be very popular very very quickly now remember the picture how much she looked like her grandmother at the beginning 
 people were always telling natasha how much she looks like her mother  gail
  a tense moment in the first football game i think 
 and kylie i mean it was almost like kylie was her own child she
 's being baptized 
 now a lot of parents when they adopt actually want to erase their children 's history and gail and gene did the complete
  they were studying korean they bought korean clothes 
 gene even did a little tile work in the kitchen which was that once upon a time there was a beautiful girl that came from hills of korea to live happily ever after in atlanta she hates this picture it was her first job  
 she bought a bright red karmann ghia with the money she made working at burger king the captain of the cheerleaders  
 beauty pageant 
 used to do their christmas card every year  gene 's been restoring this car for a million years
 kodak hired natasha to be a translator for them at the olympics in korea her future husband  jeff 
 was working for canon cameras and
 met natasha at the olympic village  this is her first trip back to korea so there 's her uncle
 this is
  it was just so interesting just to watch this is her mother in the background there  
 this is natasha 's wedding day
  this is sydney who 's going to be three years old
  today was the first time i 'm actually seeing him give the whole
