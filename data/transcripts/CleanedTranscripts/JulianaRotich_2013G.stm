  living in africa is to be on the edge  
 metaphorically and quite literally when you think about connectivity before two thousand and eight  
 though many human intellectual and technological leaps had happened in europe and the rest of the world but africa was
  sort of cut off  
 and that changed first with ships when we had the renaissance
  the scientific revolution and also the industrial revolution and now we 've got the digital revolution  
 these revolutions have not been evenly distributed across continents and nations never have been 
  this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables
 that connect africa to the rest of the world what i find amazing is that africa is transcending its geography problem 
 africa is connecting to the rest of the world and within itself  
 the connectivity situation has improved greatly 
 but some barriers remain it is with this context that ushahidi came to be 
  one of the problems that we faced was
 lack of information flow there was a media blackout in two thousand and eight when there was  post election violence in kenya  
 it was a very tragic time it was a very difficult time so we came together
 and we created software called ushahidi and ushahidi means testimony or witness in swahili i 'm very lucky to work with two amazing
  this is david and erik i call them brothers from another mother clearly i have a german mother somewhere  
 and we worked together first with building and growing ushahidi and the idea of the software was to gather information from sms  email and web  and put a map so that you could see what was happening where 
 and you could visualize that data 
 and after that initial prototype  we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have to start from scratch like
  we did 
 all the while we also wanted to give back to the local tech community that helped us grow ushahidi and supported us in those early days  and that 's why we set up the ihub in nairobi an actual physical space where we could
 collaborate  and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem
  we did that with the support of different organizations like the macarthur foundation and omidyar network  
 and we were able to grow this software footprint  and a few years later it became
 very useful software and we were quite humbled when it was used in haiti where citizens could indicate where they are and what their needs were 
 and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis and the tsunami in japan 
  this year the internet turns twenty  and ushahidi turned five 
 ushahidi is not only the software that we made  it is the team  
 and it 's also the community that uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee  we did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world 
 there are crisis
  even environmental monitoring crowd maps  
 we are humbled that this has roots in kenya and that it has some use to people around the world trying to figure out the different issues that they 're dealing with 
 there is more that we 're doing to explore this idea of collective intelligence that i as a citizen if i share the information with whatever device that i have could inform you about what is going on and that if you do the same we can have a bigger picture of
  what 's going on 
 i moved back to kenya in two thousand and eleven erik moved in two thousand and ten very different reality i used to live in chicago where there was abundant internet access i had never had to deal with a blackout 
 and in kenya  it 's a very different reality and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress and the digital revolution is the electricity problem
  dealing with this can be let 's just say very annoying
  blackouts are not fun imagine sitting down to start working and all of a sudden the power goes out  your internet connection goes down with it 
 so you have to figure out okay  now where 's the modem 
 how do i switch back and then guess what you have to deal with
  this is the reality of kenya where we live now and other parts of africa  the other problem that we 're facing is that communication costs
 are also still a challenge  it costs me five kenyan shillings  or
  to call the u s canada or china  guess how much it costs to call rwanda  ghana  nigeria
  kenyan shillings that 's six times the cost to connect within africa  
 and also when traveling within africa you 've got different settings for different mobile providers this is the reality that we deal with 
 so we 've got a joke in ushahidi
 where we say if it works in africa
 and reduce the cost of connection could we leverage the cloud we 've built a crowd map we 've built ushahidi could we leverage these technologies
 to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country 
 so we looked at the modem an important part of the infrastructure of the internet and asked ourselves why
 the modems that we are using right now are built for a different context where you 've got
  ubiquitous internet you 've got ubiquitous
 electricity yet we sit here in nairobi
 and we do not have that luxury  
 we wanted to redesign the modem for the developing world for our context  and for our reality what if we could have connectivity with less friction 
  a backup to the internet so that when the power goes out  
 it fails over and connects to the nearest gsm network 
 mobile connectivity in africa is pervasive it 's actually
 everywhere most towns at least have a 3g connection so why don 't we leverage that and that 's why we built this  the other reason that we built this is when
  electricity goes down this has eight hours of battery left so you can continue working you can continue being productive  and let 's just say you are less stressed  
 and for rural areas  it can be the primary means of connection the software sensibility at ushahidi is still at play when we wondered how can we use the cloud
 to be more intelligent so that you can analyze the different networks
  and whenever you switch on the backup you pick on the fastest network so we 'll have multi sim capability so that you can put multiple sims 
 and if one network is faster that 's the one you hop on  
 and if the up time on that is not very good then you hop onto the next one 
 the idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere with load balancing this can be possible
  the other interesting thing for us we like sensors
 is this idea that you could have an  on ramp for the internet of things 
 imagine a weather station that can be attached to this it 's built in a modular way so that you can also attach a satellite module so that you could have internet connectivity even in very remote areas 
 out of adversity can come innovation and
 how can we help the ambitious coders and makers in kenya to be resilient in the face of problematic infrastructure  
 and for us we begin with solving the problem in our own backyard in kenya  
 it is not without challenge our team has basically been mules carrying components from the u s to kenya we 've had very
  not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects so we put it on kickstarter and i 'm happy to say that 
 through the support of many people not only here but online 
 the brck has been kickstarted  and now the the interesting part of bringing this to
  i will close by saying that if we solve this for the local market it could be impactful not only for the coders in nairobi
 but also for small business owners
 who need reliable connectivity and it can reduce the cost of connecting and hopefully collaboration within african countries  
 the idea is that the building blocks of the
  our part to keep africans connected and to help them drive the global digital revolution thank you
