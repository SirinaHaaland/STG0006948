  to this next edition of ted dialogues
  we 're trying to do some bridging here today you know the american dream has inspired millions of people around the world for
  i think you can say that
 america is divided  
 perhaps more than ever and the divisions seem to be getting worse it 's actually
 really hard for people on different sides to even have a conversation people almost feel 
 disgusted with each other 
 some families can 't even speak to each other right now 
 our purpose in this dialogue today is to try
  to do something about that to try to have a different kind of conversation to do some listening some thinking some understanding 
 and i have two people with us to help us do that they 're not going to come at this hammer and tong against each other this is not like cable news
 this is two people who have both spent a lot of their working life
 in the political center or right of the center
  themselves in conservative worldviews if you like they know that space very well  and we 're going to explore together how to think about what is happening right now 
 and whether we can find new ways to to bridge and just to have wiser more connected conversations 
 hosting fox and friends and then the real story before
 taking a courageous stance in in filing sexual harassment claims against roger ailes which eventually led to his departure from fox news  
 david brooks who has earned the wrath of many of [ the new york times 's ] left leaning readers because of his
 conservative views and more recently
 some of the right leaning readers because of his criticism of some aspects of trump  
 yet his columns are usually the top one two or three most read
 content of the day because they 're brilliant because they bring psychology and social science to providing understanding for what 's going on 
  million americans voted for donald trump 
 why did they do this gretchen carlson there are a lot of reasons in my mind  why it happened i mean i think it was a movement of sorts  but it started
 long ago  it
 didn 't just happen overnight anger would be the first word that i would think of
 anger with nothing being done in washington
  anger about not being heard  
 i think there was a huge swath of the population that feels like washington never listens to them you know 
 a good part of the middle of america not just the coasts  and he was somebody they felt was listening to their
  i think those two issues would be
 the main reason i have to throw in there also celebrity  i think that that had a huge
 a huge impact on donald trump becoming president ca was the anger justified david brooks yeah i think so
  and fifteen and early two thousand and sixteen i wrote about thirty columns with the following theme don 't worry donald trump will never be the republican nominee
  and gotten that so wrong i decided to spend the ensuing year just out in trumpworld and i found a lot of economic dislocation 
 i ran into a woman in west virginia who was going to a funeral for her mom she said the nice thing about being catholic is we don 't have to speak 
 and that 's good because we 're not word people 
 that phrase rung in my head word people a lot of us in the ted community are word people but if you 're not the economy has not been angled toward you
  and so eleven million men for example are out of the labor force
 because those jobs are done away a lot of social injury  you used to be able to say i 'm not the richest person in the world i 'm not the most famous  but my neighbors can count on me
 and i get some dignity out of that and because of 
  if you 're not rich or famous you feel invisible and a lot of moral
  sense of feeling betrayed
 and frankly in this country we almost have one success story  which is you go to college get a white collar job and you 're a success  
 and if you don 't fit in that formula  you feel like you 're not respected  
 and so that accumulation of things and when i talked to trump voters and still do i found most of them completely realistic about his failings  but they said this is my shot 
 and yet i predicted that he would be the nominee  because i 've known him for
  master marketer  and one of the things he did extremely well that president obama also did extremely well was simplifying the message 
 simplifying down to phrases and to a populist message even if he can 't achieve it it sounded good
  and many people latched on to that simplicity again it
  no it 's not 
 but people at home would see that and they 'd be like wow i should be watching the number one show on tv and lo and behold it became the number one show on tv 
 so he had this i 've seen this ability in him
 to be the master marketer ca it
 's puzzling to a lot of people on on the left that so many women voted for him 
 despite some of his comments gc i wrote a column about this for time motto saying that i really
 believe that lot of people put on blinders  and
 maybe for the first time some people decided that policies they believed in and being heard and not
  being invisible anymore was more important to them than the way in which he had acted or acts as a human  and so human dignity
 whether it would be the dust up about the disabled reporter or what happened in that audiotape with billy bush and the way in which he spoke about women
 they put that aside and pretended as if they hadn 't seen that or heard that because to them
  policies were more important
 just because someone voted for trump it 's not blind
 adherence to everything that he 's said or stood for
 gc no i heard a lot of people that would say to me wow i just wish he would shut up before the election  if he would just stay quiet  he 'd get elected ca
 and so maybe for people
  on the left there 's a trap there to sort of
 despise or or just be baffled by
 the support assuming that it 's for some of the unattractive features actually maybe they 're supporting him despite those because they see something exciting they see a man of action they see
 the choking hold of government being thrown off
 in some way and they 're excited by that gc but don 't forget we saw that on the left as well bernie sanders
  so this is one of the commonalities that i think we can talk about today the year of the outsider david right 
 and even though bernie sanders has been in congress for a long time he was deemed an outsider this time  
 and so there was anger on the left as well  and so many people were in favor of of bernie sanders 
 so
 i see it as a commonality people who like trump people who like bernie sanders they were liking different policies but the underpinning was
  anger  ca david there 's often this this
 narrative then that the sole explanation for
 for trump 's victory and his rise is his tapping into
 anger in a very visceral way
  but you 've written a bit about about  that  it 's actually more than that that there 's a worldview that 's being worked on here could you talk about that
  i would say he understood what frankly i didn 't which is what debate we were having and so i 'd grown up starting with reagan
 and it was the big government versus small government debate it was barry goldwater versus george mcgovern  and that was the debate we had been having for a generation
  it was democrats wanted to use government to enhance equality  republicans wanted to limit government to enhance freedom that was the debate he understood what
 what i think the two major parties did not which was that 's not the debate anymore the debate is now open versus closed 
 on one side are those who have the tailwinds of globalization and the meritocracy blowing at their back  
 and they tend to favor open trade  open borders open social mores because there are so many opportunities on the other side are those who
 headwinds of globalization and the meritocracy just blasting in their faces  and they favor closed trade  closed borders closed social mores  because they just want some security  
 and so he was right on that fundamental issue and people were willing to overlook a lot to get there  
 and so he felt that sense of security we 're speaking the morning after trump 's joint session speech  there are three traditional groups in the republican party 
 there are the foreign policies hawks who believe in america as global policeman 
 trump totally repudiated that view
  second there was the social conservatives who believed in religious liberty
 prayer in schools  
 he totally ignored that there was not a single mention of a single social conservative issue  and then there were the fiscal hawks 
 the people who wanted to cut down on the national debt tea party cut the size of government he 's expanding the size of government here 's a man who
  american party
 because he understood where the debate was headed before other people  and then guys like steve bannon come in and give him substance to his impulses ca 
 and so take take that a bit further  and maybe expand a bit more on on
 your insights into steve bannon 's worldview because he 's sometimes
  but there 's another part that 's probably true 
 too he 's part of a global movement  it 's like being around marxists in one thousand nine hundred and seventeen 
 there 's him here  there 's the ukip party  there 's the national front in france there 's putin there 's a turkish version a philippine version so we have to recognize
  that this is a global intellectual movement  
 and it believes that wisdom and virtue is not held in individual conversation and civility the way a lot of us in the enlightenment side of the world do 
 it 's held in in the german word is the volk in the people 
 in the common instinctive wisdom of the plain people 
 and the essential virtue of that people is always being threatened by outsiders  and he
  got a strategy for how to get there he 's got a series of policies to bring the people up and
 repudiate the outsiders whether those outsiders are islam mexicans  the media  the coastal elites 
 and there 's a whole worldview there it 's a very coherent worldview i sort of have more respect for him
  loathe what he stands for and i think he 's wrong on the substance but it 's interesting to see someone with a set of ideas find a vehicle donald trump  and then try to take control of
 the white house in order to advance his viewpoint ca so it 's almost become like that the core question of our time now is 
 can you be
 patriotic but also have a global mindset are these two things implacably opposed to each other  i mean  a lot of
  conservatives
 and to the extent that it 's a different category a lot of trump supporters are infuriated by
 the coastal elites and and the globalists because they see them as sort of 
 not cheering for america not embracing fully american values i mean have you seen that in your
 in your conversations with people in your understanding of their mindset gc i do think that there 's a huge difference between
 i
  hate to put people in categories but middle america versus people who live on the coasts  it
 's an entirely different existence and i grew up in minnesota so i have an understanding
 of middle america and i 've never forgotten it and maybe that 's why i have an understanding of what happened here because those people often feel like nobody 's listening to
  and that we 're only concentrating on california and new york and so
 i think that was a huge reason why trump was elected i mean  
 these people felt like they were they were being heard whether or not patriotism falls into that  
 i 'm not sure about that i do know one thing a lot of things trump talked about last night are not conservative things 
  had hillary clinton gotten up and given that speech not one republican would have stood up to applaud  i mean he 's talking about spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure
  that is not a conservative viewpoint  he talked about 
 maternity leave a lot of women may love that it 's not a conservative viewpoint  so it 's fascinating that
 people who loved what his message was during the campaign i 'm not sure how do you think they 'll react to that db i should
  but what did you make of the speech last night it seemed to be a move to a more moderate position on the face of it db yeah i thought it was his best speech  and
  i do think he 's a moral freak  and i think he 'll be undone by that fact  
 the fact that he just doesn 't know anything about anything and is uncurious about it but if you if you
 take away these minor flaws  i think we got to see him at his best and it was revealing for me to see him at his best 
 because to me it exposed a central contradiction that he 's got to confront that a lot of what
  i 'm ordering closed borders i 'm going to secure the world for you 
 for my people but then if you actually look at a lot of his economic policies like health care reform  which is about private health care accounts that 's not security that 's risk  
 educational vouchers that 's risk deregulation that 's risk  there 's really a contradiction between the security of the mindset and a lot of
  and what i would say  especially having spent this year
  the people in rural minnesota in new mexico they 've got enough risk in their lives
  and so they 're going to say no thank you and i think his health care repeal will fail for that reason ca 
 but despite the criticisms
 you just made of him  it does at least seem that
  's listening to a surprisingly wide range of voices it 's not like everyone is coming from the same place  
 and maybe that leads to a certain amount of chaos and confusion but gc i
 actually don 't think he 's listening to a wide range of voices i think he 's listening to very few people that 's just my
 impression of it  i believe that some of the things he said last night had ivanka all over them 
 so i believe he was listening to her before that speech  and
 he was teleprompter trump last night
 as opposed to twitter trump and that 's why before we came out here i said we better check twitter
 to see if anything 's changed and also i think you have to keep in mind that
 because he 's such a unique character 
 what was the bar that we were expecting last night was it here or here or here and so he
 comes out and gives a looking political speech and everyone goes wow  he can do it 
 it just depends on which direction he goes db yeah and we 're trying to build bridges here and especially for an audience that may have contempt for trump
  it 's important to say no this is a real thing 
 but as i try my best to go an hour showing respect for him my thyroid is surging because i
 i think the the oddities of his character
  describe you as right of center and yet here you are with this
 visceral reaction against against him  and some of what he stands for  i mean  i 'm
 how do you have a conversation  the people who support him on evidence so far are probably pretty
 excited  he
  he 's certainly
 shown real engagement in a lot of what he promised to do  
 and there is a strong desire to change the system radically people hate what government has become and how it 's left them out  gc i totally agree with that
 but i think that when he was proposing a huge government program last night that we used to call the bad s word stimulus 
  to spend a trillion dollars on something that is not a conservative viewpoint then again i don 't really believe he 's a republican db and
 i would say as someone who identifies as conservative first of all to be conservative is to believe in the limitations of politics  
 samuel johnson said of all the things that human hearts endure how few are those that kings can cause and cure 
 politics is a limited realm what matters most is the moral nature of the society  and so i have to think character comes first and a man who doesn 't pass the character threshold cannot be a good president
  second i
 'm the kind of conservative who i harken back to alexander hamilton 
 who was a latino  hip hop star from the heights
 but his definition of america
 was very future oriented he was a poor boy from the islands who had this rapid and amazing rise to success  and he wanted
  government to give poor boys and girls like him a chance to succeed using limited but energetic government to create social mobility for him and for lincoln and for teddy roosevelt 
 the idea of america was the idea of the future  we may have division and racism and slavery in our past but we have a common future  
  it 's nostalgic  it 's for the past  and that is not traditionally the american identity that 's traditionally frankly the russian identity that 's how they
 define virtue  and so i think it is a fundamental and foundational betrayal of what conservatism used to stand for ca 
 well i 'd like actually like to hear from you and if we see some comments coming in from some 
  's one right now jeffrey alan carnegie i 've tried to convince progressive friends that they need to understand what motivates trump supporters yet many of them have given up trying to understand
 in the face of what they perceive as lies selfishness and hatred how would you reach out to such people the tea party of the left to try to bridge this divide gc 
 i actually think there are commonalities in anger as i expressed earlier  
 so i think you can come to the table both being passionate about something so at least you care
  i would like to believe
 the c word has also become a horrible word compromise right so
 you have the far left and the far right and compromise forget it  
 those groups don 't want to even think about it  but you have a huge swath of voters myself included who are registered independents like forty percent of us right  
 so there is a huge faction of america that wants to see change and wants to see people come together  it 's just that we have to figure out how how to do that
 so 
  having these ted dialogues we 're trying to bridge
  there 's a lot of people out there right now perhaps especially on the left who think this is a terrible idea that actually the only
 moral response to
 the great tyranny that may be about to emerge in america
 is to resist it at every stage is to fight it tooth and nail
 's a mistake to try and do this just fight
 is there a case for that db it depends what fight means if it means literal fighting then no 
 if it means marching well maybe marching to raise consciousness that seems fine  but if you want change in this country  we do it through parties and politics  
 we
 organize parties and those parties are big diverse messy coalitions and we engage in politics and
  politics is always morally unsatisfying because it 's always a bunch of compromises  but politics is essentially a competition between partial truths  
 the trump people have a piece of the truth in america i think trump himself is the wrong answer to the right question but they have some truth
 and it 's truth found in the epidemic of opiates around the
  it 's truth found in the spread of loneliness  it 's the truth found in people whose lives are inverted they peaked
 professionally at age thirty  and it 's all been downhill since 
 and so understanding that doesn 't take fighting it takes conversation and then asking what are we going to replace trump with gc but you saw fighting last night even at the speech because you saw the democratic women who came and wore white to honor the suffragette movement
 i remember back during the campaign where some trump supporters wanted to actually get rid of the amendment that allowed us to vote as women it was like  what  so
 i don 't know if that 's the right way to fight it was interesting because i was looking in the audience trying to see democratic women who didn 't wear
 white so there 's a lot going on there and there 's a lot of
 ways to fight that are not necessarily doing that
  one of the key questions to me is the people who voted for trump but if you like are more in the center like they 're
 possibly amenable to persuasion are they more likely to be persuaded by seeing a passionate
 uprising of people saying
  bigotry
 you 're supporting sexism 
 you 're a primitive fascistic rise from some authoritarian past that 's probably not going to be too persuasive to you
  and so the way any of us are persuaded is by a some basic show of respect
 for the point of view and saying i think this guy is not going to get you where
  there are two phrases you 've heard over and over again
 wherever you go in the country one the phrase flyover country 
 and that 's been heard for years but i would say this year i heard it almost on an hourly basis a sense of feeling invisible and then the  sense a sense of the phrase political correctness 
 just that rebellion they 're not even letting us say what we think 
 and i teach at yale  the narrowing
  is a trap that liberals have fallen into by
 celebrating causes they really believe in often expressed through the language of political correctness they have
 done damage they have pushed people away db i would say a lot of the argument
  for the coastal media that every time he does something slightly wrong  we go to eleven
 and we 're at eleven every day  and it just strains credibility at some point ca
 crying wolf a little too loud and a little too early  but there may be a time when we really do have to cry wolf
  call him out when things are not true or will they just go along with it  to me that is what is essential in this entire discussion because
 when you have
 followers of somebody who don 't really care if he tells the truth or not that can be very dangerous  so to me 
  how is the conservative media going to respond to it i mean you 've been calling them out
 but how will how will other forms of conservative media deal with that as we move forward db it 's all shifted though the conservative media used to be fox or charles krauthammer or george will 
 they 're no longer the conservative media now there 's another whole set of institutions further right which is breitbart and
  fox ca my last
 question for the time being is just on this question of the truth i mean it 's one of the scariest things to people right now that there is no agreement nationally
 on what is true i 've never seen anything like it 
 where facts are so massively disputed your whole newspaper sir is delivering fake news every day
  is there any path whereby we can start to get some kind of consensus 
 to believe the same things can online communities play a role here  how do we fix this gc see i understand how that happened that 's another
  groundswell kind of emotion that was going on in the middle of america and not being heard in thinking that the mainstream media was biased
 there 's a difference though between being biased and being fake 
 to me that is a very important distinction in this conversation  so let 's just say that there was some bias in the mainstream media 
 ok  so there are ways to try and mend that but what what trump 's doing
  that 's where it gets dangerous ca do you think enough of his supporters have
 a greater loyalty to the truth than to any like the principle of
 not supporting something that is demonstrably not true actually matters so there will be a correction at some point db i think the truth eventually comes
  so for example  donald trump has based a lot of his economic policy on this supposition that americans have lost manufacturing jobs because they 've been stolen by the chinese  
 that is maybe thirteen percent of the jobs that left the truth is that eighty seven percent of the jobs were replaced by technology that is just the truth
  and so as a result when he says i 'm going to close tpp and all the jobs will come roaring back they will not come roaring
  what his supporters think is the truth  no matter how many times you might say that they still believe him db but eventually either jobs will come back or they will not come back
 and at that point either something will work or it doesn 't work  and it doesn 't work or not work because of great marketing it works because it actually addresses a real problem and so
  hear a lot of this talk about how we all need to start talking to each other more and understanding each other more and i 've even written about this published on this subject as well 
 but now today i keep hearing
 liberals yes i live in new york i can be considered a liberal we sit here and
  what did we do to not understand the rust belt or what can we do to understand middle america better and what i 'd like to know 
 have you seen any attempts or conversations from middle america of what can i do to understand the so called coastal elites better because i 'm just offended as being
 put in a box as a coastal elite as someone in middle america is as being considered a flyover state and not listened to
 i would say and
 this is someone who has been conservative all my adult life when you grow up conservative you learn to speak both languages  
 because if i 'm going to listen to music  i 'm not going to listen to ted nugent
 a lot of my favorite rock bands are all on the left  
  if i 'm going to go to a school i 'm going probably to school where the culture is liberal  if i 'm going to watch a sitcom or a late night comedy show it 's going to be liberal if i 'm going to read a good newspaper it 'll be the new york times  as a result you learn to speak both languages
  and that that actually at least for a number of years when i started at national review with william f buckley it made us sharper  
 because we were used to arguing against people every day  the problem now that 's happened is you have ghettoization on the right and you can live entirely in
 so as a result the quality of argument on the right has diminished  because you 're not in the other side all the time  
 but i do think if you 're living in minnesota or iowa
 or arizona the coastal elites make themselves aware to you so you know that language as well but it 's not the reverse
  if you could plant one piece of truth from the mindset of someone in this room for example
  what would you say to them db just how insanely wonderful we are laughter
 no i reject the category  the problem with populism is the same problem with elitism  
 it 's just a prejudice on the basis of probably an over generalized social class distinction
 which is too simplistic to apply in reality 
 those of us in new york know there are some people in new york who are completely awesome and some people who are pathetic  and if you live in iowa some people are awesome and some people are pathetic
  not a question of what degree you have or where you happen to live in the country  the distinction is just a crude simplification to arouse political power gc but i would encourage people to watch
 a television news show or read a column that they normally wouldn 't 
 so if you are a trump supporter watch the other side for a day because you need to come out of the bubble
 if you 're ever going to have a conversation and
  both sides so if you 're a liberal then watch something that 's very conservative read a column that is not something you would normally read 
 because then you gain perspective of what the other side is thinking and to me that 's a start of coming together i worry about the same thing you worry about  these bubbles  i think if you only watch certain entities you have no idea what the rest of the world is talking about
  watching being part of an organization that meets at least once a month that puts you in direct contact with people completely unlike yourself is something we all have a responsibility for i may get this a little wrong 
 but i think of the top selling automotive models in this country  i think the top three or four are all pickup trucks  
  that 's sort of a warning sign kind of a problem where can i join a club where i 'll have a lot in common with a person who drives a pickup truck because we have a common interest in whatever 
 ca and so the internet is definitely
 contributing to this a question here from chris ajemian how do you feel structure of communications especially the prevalence of social media
 and individualized content can be used to bring together a political divide  instead of just filing communities into
  echo chambers i mean it looks like facebook and google since the election are working hard on this question they 're trying to
 change the algorithms so that
 they don 't amplify fake news to the extent that it happened last time round do you see any other promising signs of
  on the left
  to figure out how to
  but i think that
  have an understanding of
  he 's a
  he 's got a
  i may
