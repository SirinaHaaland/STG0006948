  and killed a man  i was a young drug dealer with a quick temper
  but that wasn 't the end of my story in fact it was beginning and the twenty three years since
 is a story
 of acknowledgment  apology
 and atonement  but it didn 't happen in the way that you might imagine or think 
 these things occurred in my life in a way that was surprising
  especially to me see like many of you 
 growing up  i was an honor roll student a scholarship student with dreams of becoming a doctor  
 but things went dramatically wrong when my parents separated
 and eventually divorced  
  i got shot three times standing on the corner of my block in detroit 
 my friend rushed me to the hospital  doctors pulled the bullets out 
 patched me up and sent me back to the same neighborhood where i got shot
  throughout this ordeal  no one hugged me  no one counseled me
  no one told me i would be okay  
 no one told me that i would live in fear that i would become paranoid or
 that i would react  hyper violently to being shot 
 no one told me that one day i would become the person behind the trigger 
 fourteen months later at
 i fired the shots that caused a man 's death 
 when i entered prison
 i was bitter
 i was angry  i was hurt i didn 't want to take responsibility  i blamed everybody from my parents to the
  's better to be the shooter
 than the person getting shot as i sat in my cold cell  i felt helpless  unloved
 and abandoned  i felt like nobody cared
 and i reacted with hostility to my confinement
  myself getting deeper and deeper into trouble  i ran black market stores  i loan sharked 
 and i sold drugs that were illegally smuggled into the prison i
 had in fact become what the warden of the michigan reformatory called the worst of the worst 
  i landed in solitary confinement for seven and a half years out of my incarceration  
 now as i see it solitary confinement is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places you can find yourself but
 find myself i did 
 one day i was pacing my cell  when an officer
 came and delivered
  i looked at a couple of letters before i looked at the letter
 that had my son 's squiggly handwriting on it 
 and anytime i would get a letter from my son it was like a ray of light in the darkest place you can imagine  
 and on this particular day i opened this letter
  and in capital letters he wrote my mama told me why you was in prison
  jesus watches what you do pray to him 
 now i wasn 't religious at that time nor am i religious now  but it was something so profound
 about my son 's words 
 they made me examine things about my life that i hadn 't considered it was the first time in my life that i had actually thought about the fact
 that my son would see me as a murderer
  i sat back on my bunk
 and i reflected on something i had read in [ plato ] 
 where socrates stated in apology that the unexamined life isn 't worth living 
 at that point is when the transformation began  
 but it didn 't come easy
  of the things i realized which was part of the transformation was that there were four key things 
 the first thing was i had great mentors now
 i know some of you all are probably thinking how did you find a great mentor in prison  but in my case 
 some of my mentors who are serving life sentences
 were some of the best people to ever come into my life
  because they forced me to look at my life honestly and they forced me to challenge myself about my decision making  
 the second thing was literature  
 prior to going to prison  i didn 't know that there were so many brilliant black poets  authors and philosophers  
 and then i had the great fortune
 of encountering malcolm x 's autobiography
 and it shattered every stereotype i had about myself  
 the third thing was family for nineteen years my father stood by my side
 with an unshakable faith because he believed that i had what it took to turn my life around i also met an amazing woman
 who is now the mother
 she taught me how to love myself in a healthy way  
 the final thing was writing  when i got that letter from my son i began to write a journal
 about things i had experienced in my childhood and in prison  
 and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea of atonement
  earlier in my incarceration i had received a letter from
 one of the relatives of my victim  and in that letter 
 she told me she forgave me because she realized i was a young child who had been abused and had been through some hardships
 and just made a series of poor decisions  it was the first time in my life
 that i ever felt
 open to forgiving myself
 one of the things that happened after that experience is that
 i thought about the other men who were incarcerated alongside of me and how much i wanted to share this with them and so i started talking to them about
 some of their experiences  and i was devastated to realize that most of them came from the same abusive environments  and most of them wanted help and they wanted to turn it
  around  but unfortunately the system that currently holds two point five million people in prison is designed to warehouse
 as opposed to rehabilitate or transform so i made it up in my mind that if i was ever released from prison
 that i would do everything in my power
 to help change that
  i walked out of prison for the first time after two decades  now imagine if you will fred flintstone
 walking into an episode of the jetsons 
 that was pretty much what my life was like 
 for the first time i was exposed to the internet  social media cars that talk like kitt from knight rider
  fascinated me the most was phone technology see when i went to prison our car phones were this big
 and required two people to carry them so imagine what it was like when i first grabbed my little blackberry
 and i started learning how to text  but the thing is the people around me they didn 't realize that i had no idea what all these abbreviated texts meant like lol
  with one of my friends via text
 and i asked him to do something and he responded back k 
 and i was like what is k and he was like k is okay so in my head i was like well what the hell is wrong
  and then he texts back and he asks me why was i cussing him out  and i said lol fu as in i finally understand 
 and so fast forward three years i 'm doing relatively good i have a fellowship at mit media lab  i work for an
  i teach at the university of michigan  but it 's been a struggle
 because i realize that there are more men and women coming home
 who are not going to be afforded those opportunities  i 've been blessed to work with some amazing men and women 
 helping others reenter society and one of them is my friend named calvin evans 
 he served twenty four years for a crime
  's currently enrolled in college  
 and one of the things that we talked about is the three things that i found important in my personal transformation the first being acknowledgment i
 had to acknowledge that i had hurt others i also had to acknowledge that i had been hurt  
 the second thing was apologizing  
 i had to apologize to the people i had hurt  even though i had no expectations of them accepting it it was important to do because it was the right thing but i also had to apologize
  thing was atoning for me atoning meant going back into my community
 and working with at risk youth who were on the same path  but also becoming at one with myself 
 through my experience of being locked up one of the things i discovered is this  the majority of men and women who are incarcerated are
  fact is ninety percent of the men and women who are incarcerated will at some point return to the community 
 and we have a role in determining what kind of men and women return to our community 
 my wish today
 is that we will embrace a more empathetic approach toward how we deal with mass incarceration  that we
  my journey is a unique journey  but it doesn 't have to be that way  anybody can have a transformation
 if we create the space for that to happen so what i 'm asking today is that you envision
 a world where men and women aren 't held hostage
 to their pasts where misdeeds and mistakes don 't define you for the rest of your life
 i think collectively we can create that reality  and i hope you do too
