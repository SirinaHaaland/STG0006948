  here to talk about congestion  namely road congestion road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon it exists in basically all of the cities all around the world which is a little bit surprising when you think
 i mean think about how different cities are actually  i mean you have the typical european cities with a dense urban core good public transportation mostly 
 not a lot of road capacity  but then on the other hand you have the american cities
  it 's moving by itself okay  anyway the american cities 
 lots of roads dispersed over large areas almost no public transportation and then you have
 the emerging world
 with a mixed variety of vehicles mixed land use patterns also rather dispersed but often with a very dense urban core  
 and traffic planners all around the world have tried lots of different measures
  dense cities or dispersed cities lots of roads or lots of public transport or lots of bike lanes or more information or lots of different things but nothing seems to work  
 but all of these attempts have one thing in common they 're basically attempts at figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car
  driving they 're essentially to a point attempts at planning what other people should do planning their life for them 
 now  planning a complex social system is a very hard thing to do and let me tell you a story back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine when the berlin wall fell
  an urban urban planner in london got a phone call from a colleague in moscow saying basically
  i 'd like to know  who 's in charge of london 's bread supply 
 and the urban planner in london goes 
 what do you mean  who 's in charge of london 's i mean  no one is in charge oh but surely someone must be in charge i mean it 's a very complicated system someone must control all of this 
 no  
 no no one is in charge i mean it basically i haven 't really thought of it it basically organizes itself 
 it organizes itself  that 's an example of a complex social system
  which has the ability of 
 and this is a very deep insight 
 when you try to solve really complex social problems the right thing to do is most of the time to create the incentives you don 't plan the details  and people will figure out what to do how to adapt to this new framework  
 and let 's now look at
  how we can use this insight to combat road congestion this is a map of stockholm my hometown  now stockholm is a 
  roughly two million people but stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges narrow bridges old bridges which means lots of road congestion
 and these red dots show the most congested parts which are the bridges that lead into the inner city  and then
 someone came up with the idea that
 apart from good public transport
  from spending money on roads 
 let 's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks  now one or two euros that isn 't really a lot of money  i mean compared to parking charges and running costs etc so 
 you would probably expect that car drivers wouldn 't really react to this fairly small charge you would be wrong 
  twenty percent well  that 's a fairly huge figure you might think but you 've still got eighty percent left of the problem right because you still have eighty percent of the traffic now that 's also wrong 
 because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon  meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really really rapidly  
 but fortunately
  it also works the other way around  if you can reduce traffic even somewhat then congestion will go down
 much faster than you might think  
 now congestion charges were introduced in stockholm on january three 
 two thousand and six and the first picture here is a picture of stockholm one of the typical streets
  january two 
 the first day with the congestion charges looked like this 
 this is what happens when you take away twenty percent of the cars from the streets
  reduce congestion quite substantially 
 but well as i said i mean  car drivers adapt  right so after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges  wrong again  
 it 's now six and a half years ago since the congestion charges were introduced in stockholm  and we basically have the same low traffic levels
 still but you see there 's an interesting gap here in the time series in two thousand and seven  well  the thing is that
  congestion charges they were introduced first as a trial so they were introduced in january and then abolished again at
 the end of july  followed by a referendum and then they were reintroduced again in two thousand and seven  which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity i mean
 this was a really a really fun experiment to start with  and we actually got to do it twice
  like to do this every once a year or so but they won 't let me do that but it was fun anyway  so we followed up what happened 
 this is the last day with the congestion charges july thirty one and you see the same street but now it 's summer and summer in stockholm is a very nice and light
 time of the year  and the first day without the congestion charges looked like this all the cars were back
  and you even have to admire the car drivers they adapt so extremely quickly the first day they all came back  
 and this effect this effect hanged on so two thousand and seven figures looked like this  
 now these traffic figures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know  but i would say that the most surprising slide here i 'm going to show you today is not this one it
 's this one 
 this shows public support for congestion pricing of stockholm  and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced in
  the beginning of spring two thousand and six people were fiercely against it seventy percent of the population didn 't want this  
 but what happened when the congestion charges were there is not what you would expect that people hated it more and more no on the contrary they changed up to a point where we now have seventy percent support for keeping the charges  
 meaning that i mean let me
  seventy percent of the population in stockholm want to keep a price for something that used to be free  
 okay so why can that be why is that well  think about it this way
  who changed  i mean  the twenty percent of the car drivers that disappeared surely they must be discontent in a way  and where did they go  if we can understand understand this then maybe we can figure out
 how people can be so happy with this  well so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services and tried to figure out who changed
  and where did they go and it turned out that they don 't know themselves for some reason the car drivers are
 they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do  and why is that it 's because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think 
 each day people make new
  and people change and the world changes around them and each day all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people don 't even notice they 're not even aware of this themselves  
 and the other question who changed their mind  who changed their opinion and why 
 so we did another interview survey tried to figure out why people changed their mind  and what type of group changed their
  and after analyzing the answers it turned out that more than half of them believe that they haven 't changed their minds  
 they 're actually confident that they have they have liked congestion pricing all along  
 which means that we are now in a position where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon with twenty percent and reduced congestion by enormous numbers  and people aren 't even aware that they have changed  and they honestly believe
  that they have liked this all along
