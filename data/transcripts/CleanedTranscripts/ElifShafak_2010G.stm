  what i do in life telling stories writing novels
 and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called
  but before i go there please allow me to share with you glimpses of my personal story  i will do so with the help of words of course but also a geometrical shape  the circle  
 so throughout my talk you will come across several circles  
 i was born in strasbourg france
 to turkish parents  shortly after my parents got separated  and i came to turkey with my mom from then on i was raised as a single child by a single mother
  now in the early 1970s in ankara that was a bit unusual our neighborhood was full of large families where fathers were the heads of households 
 so i grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee in a patriarchal environment  in fact i grew up observing two different kinds of womanhood on the one hand was my mother a well educated
 on the other hand was my grandmother who also took care of me and was more spiritual less educated and definitely less rational  this was a woman who read coffee 
  grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye 
  take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove  
 then one by one she would encircle these thorns with dark ink a week later the patient would come back for a follow up examination 
 now i 'm aware that i should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists  but the truth is of all the people who visited my
  grandmother for their skin conditions  i did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed  
 i asked her how she did this was it the power of praying in response she said yes praying is effective  but also beware of the power of circles 
 from her i learned  amongst many other things one very precious lesson
 that if you want to destroy something in this life be it an acne a blemish
 or the human soul all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls it will dry up inside  
 now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle  we all do we 're born into a certain family nation class  
 but if we have no connection whatsoever with the worlds beyond the one we take for
  then we too run the risk of drying up inside 
 our imagination might shrink our hearts might dwindle  and our humanness might wither if we stay for too long inside our cultural cocoons 
 our friends neighbors colleagues family if all the people in our inner circle resemble us it means we are surrounded with our mirror image now one other thing women 
  like my grandma do in turkey is to cover mirrors with velvet or to hang them on the walls with their backs
  facing out it 's an old eastern tradition based on the knowledge that it 's not healthy for a human being to spend too much time staring at his own reflection 
 ironically [ living in ] communities of the 
 is one of the greatest dangers of today 's globalized world  and it 's happening everywhere  among liberals and conservatives agnostics and believers the rich and the poor east and west alike
  we tend to form clusters based on similarity  and then we produce stereotypes about other clusters of people 
 in my opinion one way of transcending these cultural ghettos is through the art of storytelling 
 stories cannot demolish frontiers  but they can punch holes in our mental walls and through those holes we can get a glimpse of the other and sometimes even like what
  we see  
 i started writing fiction at the age of eight my mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if i 'd be interested in keeping a personal journal  
 in retrospect i think she was slightly worried about my sanity  i was constantly telling stories at home which was good except i told this to imaginary friends around me which was
  i was an introverted child to the point of communicating with colored crayons
 and apologizing to objects when i bumped into them so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day to day experiences and emotions 
 what she didn 't know was that i thought my life was terribly boring 
 and the last thing i wanted to do was to write about myself  instead i began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened and thus began my
  passion for writing fiction 
 so from the very beginning fiction for me was less of an autobiographical manifestation than a transcendental journey into other lives other possibilities 
  and please bear with me i 'll draw a circle and come back to this point 
  grandmother  i was zoomed into this posh  international school [ in madrid ] where i was the only turk  
 it was here that i had my first encounter with what i call the representative foreigner 
 in our classroom there were children from all nationalities  yet this diversity did not necessarily lead to a cosmopolitan
  it generated an atmosphere in which each child was seen not as an individual on his own  but as the representative of something larger  
 we were like a miniature united nations which was fun  except whenever something negative with regards to a nation or a religion took place 
 the child who represented it was mocked  ridiculed and
  and i should know because during the time i attended that school a military takeover happened in my country 
 a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the pope and turkey got zero points in [ the ] eurovision song contest 
 i skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor during those days  i also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there the other children asked
  which i had not seen they inquired how many cigarettes a day i smoked because they thought all turks were heavy smokers  
 and they wondered at what age i would start covering my hair 
 i came to learn that these were the three main stereotypes about my country politics cigarettes and the veil 
 after spain we went to jordan germany and ankara again
  i felt like my imagination was the only suitcase i could take with me stories gave me a sense of center  continuity and coherence the three big cs that i otherwise lacked 
 in my mid twenties i moved to istanbul the city i adore i lived in a very vibrant diverse neighborhood where i wrote several of my novels 
 i was in istanbul when the earthquake hit in
  when i ran out of the building at three in the morning i saw something that stopped me in my tracks 
 there was the local grocer there a grumpy old man who didn 't sell alcohol and didn 't speak to marginals  
 he was sitting next to a transvestite with a long black wig and mascara running down her cheeks  
 i watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling hands and offer one to
  and that is the image of the night of the earthquake in my mind today a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite smoking together on the sidewalk 
 in the face of death and destruction our mundane differences evaporated and we all became one even if for a few hours  
 but i 've always believed that stories too have a similar effect on us i 'm
 not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake but when we are reading a good novel  we leave our small cozy apartments behind
  go out into the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and perhaps had even been biased against  
 shortly after  i went to a women 's college in boston then michigan i experienced this not so much as a geographical shift as a linguistic one  i started 
  writing fiction in english  i 'm not an immigrant refugee or exile they ask me why i do this
  commute between languages gives me the chance to recreate myself i love writing in turkish which to me is very poetic and very emotional  and i love writing in english 
 which to me is very mathematical and cerebral  so i feel connected to each language in a different way 
  is you live there with with a continuous
 and perpetual frustration as latecomers we always want to say more you know crack better jokes say better things  but we end up saying less because there 's a gap between the mind and the tongue  
 and that gap is very intimidating but if we manage not to be frightened by
  it 's also stimulating  and this is what i discovered in boston that frustration was very stimulating 
 at this stage my grandmother who had been watching the course of my life with increasing anxiety  started to include in her daily prayers that i urgently get married so that
  i could settle down once and for all and because god loves her  i did get married 
 but
  instead of settling down i went to arizona 
 and since my husband is in istanbul i started commuting between arizona and istanbul the two places on the surface of earth that couldn 't be more different 
 i guess one part of me has always been a nomad physically and spiritually stories accompany me keeping my pieces and memories together like an existential glue 
 yet as much as i love stories
  i 've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story  and this is a subject that i would love to think about together
  when my first novel written in english came out in america i heard an interesting remark from a literary critic 
 i liked your book he said but i wish you had written it differently 
 i asked him what he meant by that he said well look at it there 's so many spanish american hispanic
  characters in it but there 's only one turkish character and it 's a man 
 now the novel took place on a university campus in boston so to me it was normal that there be more international characters in it than turkish characters  
 but i understood what my critic was looking for and i also understood that i would keep disappointing him 
 he wanted to see the manifestation of my identity he was looking for a turkish woman in the book
 because i happened to be one 
 we often talk about how stories change the world  but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated 
 read and reviewed many authors feel this pressure but non western authors feel it more heavily if you 're a woman writer from the muslim world like me then you are expected to write the stories of
  muslim women and preferably the unhappy stories of unhappy muslim women 
 you 're expected to write informative poignant and characteristic stories and leave the experimental and avant garde to your western colleagues 
 what i experienced as a child in that school in madrid is happening in the literary world today 
 writers are not seen as creative individuals on their own  but as the
  representatives of their respective cultures a few authors from china a few from turkey a few from nigeria we 're all thought to have something very distinctive if not peculiar  
 the writer and commuter james baldwin gave an interview in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality
  when the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him as a gay writer baldwin stopped and said but don 't you see there 's nothing in me that is not in everybody else and nothing in everybody else that is not in me 
 when identity politics tries to put labels on us it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger there 's a fuzzy category called multicultural literature in which all authors from outside the western world are lumped together  
 i never forget my first multicultural
  reading in harvard square about ten years ago  we were three writers one from the philippines one turkish and one indonesian
 like a joke you know 
 and the reason why we were brought together was not because we shared an artistic style or a literary taste it was only because of our passports 
  multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories not so much the imaginary a function is attributed to fiction in this way not only the writers themselves 
 but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger  
  and i experienced this firsthand when i was put on trial in two thousand and five for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel 
 i had intended to write a constructive multi layered novel about an armenian and a turkish family through the eyes of women my micro story 
  became a macro issue when i was prosecuted some people criticized  others
  but there were times when i wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction it was just a story 
 and when i say just a story i 'm not trying to belittle my work i want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is not as a means to an end 
 writers are entitled to their political opinions and there are good political novels out there but the language of fiction is not the language of daily politics
 said the solution to a problem and the correct way of posing the question are two completely separate things  
 and only the latter is an artist 's responsibility 
 identity politics divides us fiction connects one is interested in sweeping generalizations the other in nuances one draws boundaries the other recognizes no frontiers
  politics is made of solid bricks fiction is flowing water 
 in the ottoman times there were itinerant storytellers called meddah they would go to coffee houses where they would tell a story in front of an audience often improvising with each 
  new person in the story the meddah would change his voice  impersonating that character everybody could go and listen you know ordinary people even the sultan muslims and
 stories cut across all boundaries  
 like the tales of nasreddin hodja which were very popular throughout the middle east  north africa  the balkans and asia 
 today stories continue to transcend borders when palestinian and israeli politicians talk they usually don 't listen to each other but a palestinian reader still reads a novel by a jewish author  and vice versa
 and empathizing with the narrator literature has to take us beyond if it cannot take us there  it is not good literature 
 books have saved the introverted  timid child that i was that i once was but i 'm also aware of the danger of fetishizing them when the poet and mystic rumi
  met his spiritual companion shams of tabriz one of the first things the latter did was to toss rumi 's books into water and watch the letters dissolve 
 the sufis say knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance 
 the problem with today 's cultural ghettos is not lack of knowledge we know a lot about each other or so we think but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves it makes us elitist distant and disconnected
 there 's a metaphor which i love living like a drawing compass as you know one leg of the compass is static rooted in a place meanwhile the other leg draws a wide circle constantly moving
 like that my fiction as well one part of it is rooted in istanbul with strong turkish roots but the other part travels the world
  to different cultures in that sense  i like to think of my fiction as both local and universal  both from here and everywhere  
 now those of you who have been to istanbul have probably seen topkapi palace  which was the residence of ottoman sultans for more than four hundred years 
 in the palace  just outside the quarters of the favorite concubines there 's an area called the gathering place of the djinn it 's between buildings  
 i 'm intrigued by this concept we usually distrust
  those areas that fall in between things  we see them as the domain of supernatural creatures like the djinn who are made of smokeless fire and are the symbol of elusiveness 
 but my point is perhaps that elusive space is what writers and artists need most 
 when i write fiction i cherish
  i like not knowing what will happen ten pages later  i like it when my characters surprise me  i might write about a muslim woman in one novel and perhaps it will be a very happy 
  story  and in my next book i might write about a handsome gay professor in norway 
  suggested i feel  therefore i am free i think it was a wonderful paradigm shift  
 and yet why is it that in creative writing courses today the very first thing we teach students is write what you know 
 perhaps that 's not the right way to start at all  
 imaginative literature is not necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity is
  about we should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we can feel  we should get out of our cultural ghetto and go visit the next one and the next 
 in the end stories move like whirling dervishes  drawing circles beyond circles they connect all humanity  regardless of identity politics and that is the good news  
 and i would like to finish with an
  old sufi poem come let us be friends for once  let us make life easy on us  let us be lovers and loved ones  the earth shall be left to no one
