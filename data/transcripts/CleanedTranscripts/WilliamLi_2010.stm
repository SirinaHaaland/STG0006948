  there 's a medical revolution happening all around us and it 's one that 's going to help us conquer some of society 's most dreaded conditions  including cancer
 the revolution is called angiogenesis and it 's based on the
  process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels  so why should we care about blood vessels  well the human body is literally packed with them
 sixty thousand miles worth in a typical adult end to end  that would form a line that would circle the earth twice  
 the smallest blood vessels are called capillaries we 've got nineteen billion of them in our bodies  and these are the vessels of life
 'll show you they can also be the vessels of death 
 now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they 're growing in for example in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood 
 in the lungs  they line air sacs for gas exchange in muscle they corkscrew so that muscles
 can contract without cutting off circulation  and in nerves they course along like power lines keeping those nerves alive 
 we get most of these blood vessels when we 're actually still in the womb  
 and what that means is that as adults blood vessels don 't normally grow except in a few special circumstances  
 in women blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus  during pregnancy  they form the placenta which connects mom and baby  
 and after injury
 blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound  
 and this is actually what it looks like hundreds of blood vessels  all growing toward the center of the wound  
 so the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time
 it does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis  such that
  need a brief burst of blood vessels the body can do this
 by releasing stimulators proteins called angiogenic factors that act as natural fertilizer and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout 
 when those excess vessels are no longer needed the body prunes them back to baseline using 
 inhibitors of angiogenesis 
  there are other situations where we start beneath the baseline and we need to grow more blood vessels  just to get back to normal levels for example after an injury
 and the body can do that too  but only to that normal level that set point  
 but what we now know is that for a number of diseases there are defects in the system  
 where the body can 't prune back extra blood vessels or can 't grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time and
  these situations angiogenesis is out of balance and when angiogenesis is out of balance a myriad of diseases result 
 for example  insufficient angiogenesis not enough blood vessels
 leads to wounds that don 't heal  heart attacks  legs without circulation  death from stroke  nerve damage and
 on the other end excessive angiogenesis too many blood vessels drives disease and we see this in
  alzheimer 's disease  
 in total there are more than seventy major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide that all look on the surface to be different from one another  but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator  
 and this realization is allowing us to 
  the way that we actually approach these diseases by
  i 'm going to focus on cancer  because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer
 every type of cancer  
 so here we go 
 this is a tumor  dark gray ominous mass growing inside a brain 
 and under the microscope you can see hundreds of these brown stained blood vessels capillaries that are feeding cancer cells bringing oxygen and nutrients  
 but cancers don 't start out like this and in fact cancers don 't start out with a blood supply
 they start out as small microscopic nests of cells that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size that 's the tip of a ballpoint pen  
 then they can 't get any larger because they don 't have a blood supply so they don 't have enough oxygen or nutrients 
 in fact we 're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body autopsy studies
 from people who died in car
  accidents have shown that about forty percent of women between the ages of forty and fifty
 actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts 
 about fifty percent of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers  
 and virtually one hundred percent of us by the time we reach our 70s will have microscopic cancers growing in our
  without a blood supply  most of these cancers will never become dangerous 
 dr judah folkman who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field once called this cancer without disease 
 so the body 's ability to balance angiogenesis  when it 's working properly 
 prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers  and this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms
 against cancer
  in fact if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells tumors simply can 't grow up 
 but once angiogenesis occurs cancers can grow exponentially  
 and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to being deadly 
 cancer cells mutate and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors natural fertilizer that tip the balance in favor of blood
  vessels invading the cancer and once those vessels invade the cancer  it can expand  it can invade local tissues and the same vessels that are feeding tumors
 allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation
 as metastases and unfortunately this late stage of cancer is the one at which it 's most likely to be
  when angiogenesis is already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild so if angiogenesis is a tipping point
 between a harmless cancer and a harmful one then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution
 is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply  
 we call this antiangiogenic therapy  and it 's completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood
  vessels that are feeding the cancers  we can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal healthy vessels we see in other places of the body
 they 're abnormal they 're very poorly constructed  and because of that they 're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them 
 in effect when we give cancer patients
  an experimental drug for a glioma which is a type of brain tumor
 you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved 
 here 's a woman with a breast cancer  being treated with the antiangiogenic drug called avastin which is fda approved  
 and you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment well
 i 've just shown you two very different types of cancer
 that both responded to antiangiogenic
  therapy  so a few years ago  i asked myself can we take this one step further and treat other cancers even in other species 
 so here is a nine year old boxer named milo who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder  it invaded into his lungs his veterinarian only gave him three months to live  
 so we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic
  that could be mixed into his dog food as well as an antiangiogenic cream that could be applied on the surface of the tumor  
 and within a few weeks of treatment  
 we were able to slow down that cancer 's growth  such that we were ultimately able to extend milos survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted 
 all with a very good quality
  and we 've subsequently treated more than six hundred dogs  we have about a sixty percent response rate and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized 
 so let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples 
 this is 20 year old dolphin living in florida  and she had these lesions in her mouth that over the course of three years developed into invasive squamous cell cancers  
 so we created an antiangiogenic paste  we had it painted on top of the cancer
  three times a week  and over the course of seven months the cancers completely disappeared and the biopsies came back as normal 
 here 's a cancer growing on the lip of a quarter horse named guinness it
 's a very very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma it had already spread to his lymph nodes  so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip  and the oral cocktail  so we could treat from the inside as well as
  the outside  and over the course of six months he experienced a complete remission  
 and here he is six years later  guinness with his very happy owner 
 now obviously antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers
  the first pioneering treatments for people as well as dogs are already becoming available  
 there are twelve different drugs  eleven different cancer types  
 but the real question is how well do these work in practice  so here 's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer
 the bars represent survival time
 taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy or surgery
  but starting in two thousand and four when antiangiogenic therapies first became available you can see that there has been a seventy to one hundred percent
 improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer  multiple myeloma  colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors 
 that 's impressive  
 but for other tumors
 and cancer types  the improvements have only
  so i started asking myself why haven 't we been able to do better 
 and the answer to me is obvious we 're treating cancer too late in the game  when it 's already established and oftentimes it 's already spread or metastasized  
 and as a doctor i know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage achieving a cure can be difficult if not impossible 
 so i went back to the biology of angiogenesis
  and started thinking 
 could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis  
 beating cancer at its own game  so the cancers could never become dangerous 
 this could help healthy people as well as people who 've already beaten cancer once or twice  and want to find a way to keep it from coming back 
 so to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer
  went back to look at cancer 's causes  
 and what really intrigued me was when i saw that diet accounts for thirty to thirty five percent of environmentally caused cancers
  now the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet what to strip out take away  
 but i actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking what could we be adding to our diet
 that 's naturally
  antiangiogenic and that could boost the body 's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers 
 in other words can we eat to starve cancer 
 well the answer is yes  and i 'm going to show you how 
 and our search for this has taken us to the market  the farm and to the spice cabinet because what we 've discovered is that mother nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs
 inhibitors of angiogenesis 
 here 's a test system we developed at the center is a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion  
 and we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating
 let me show you what happens when we put in an extract
  the active ingredient is resveratrol it 's also found in red wine this inhibits abnormal angiogenesis  by sixty percent 
 here 's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries  it potently inhibits angiogenesis 
 and extract from soybeans  
 and here is a growing list of antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we 're interested in studying for each food type  we believe that
  there are different potencies within different strains and varietals  and we want to measure this because well  while you 're eating a strawberry or drinking tea  why not select the one that 's most potent for preventing cancer  
 so here are four different teas that we 've tested  they 're all common ones  
 chinese jasmine japanese sencha earl grey and a special blend that we prepared  and you can see clearly
 that the teas vary in their potency from less potent
 to more potent  
 but what 's very cool is when we combine the two less potent teas together  
 the combination  the blend is more potent than either one alone 
 this means there 's food synergy  
  here 's some more data from our testing now in the lab we can simulate tumor angiogenesis  represented here in a black bar  
 and using this system we can test the potency of cancer drugs  so the shorter the bar the less angiogenesis that 's good  
 and here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people 
 statins  nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs and a few others
 they inhibit angiogenesis too  and here are the
  factors going head to head against these drugs you can see they clearly hold their own  and in some cases they 're more potent than the actual drugs  
 soy  parsley  garlic  grapes  berries  i could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients
 imagine if we could create the world 's first rating system in which we could score foods according to their
 antiangiogenic cancer preventative properties  and that 's what we 're doing right now now
 i 've shown you a bunch of lab data and so the real question is what is the evidence in people
 that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer  
 well the best example i know is a study of seventy nine thousand men followed over twenty years in which it was found that men who consumed
  cooked tomatoes two to three times a week had up to a fifty percent reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer 
 now  we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene  and lycopene is antiangiogenic  
 but what 's even more interesting from this study is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer  those who ate more servings of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer
  so this human study is a prime example
 of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels can have an impact on cancer 
 and we 're now studying the role of a healthy diet with dean ornish at ucsf and tufts university
 the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream
 obviously  what i 've shared with you has some
 far ranging implications even beyond cancer research because if we 're right it could impact consumer education food services  public health and even the insurance industry  
 and in fact some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines  check out this ad from bluecross blueshield of minnesota
 for many people around the world
 dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution  
 because not everybody can afford expensive end stage cancer treatments 
 but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local sustainable antiangiogenic crops 
 now  
 finally  i 've talked to you about food and i 've talked to you about cancer  so there 's just one more disease that i have to tell you about and that 's
  because it turns out that adipose tissue fat is highly 
 and like a tumor fat grows when blood vessels grow so the question is can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply 
 the top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse
 that eats nonstop until it turns fat like this furry tennis ball
  and the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse if you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor  it loses weight  stop the treatment gains the weight back  restart the treatment loses 
  the weight stop the treatment it gains the weight back and in fact you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting angiogenesis  
  truly interesting thing about this is that we can 't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse 's weight is supposed to be 
 in other words  we can 't create supermodel mice 
 and this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy set points  
 albert szent gyrgi once said discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen  and thinking what no one has thought 
 i hope i 've convinced you that for diseases like cancer  obesity and other conditions
 there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator angiogenesis and that 's what i think the world needs now  thank you
 for anyone out here who has cancer  what would you recommend do you recommend pursuing these treatments now for most cancer patients
  consider the approved ones look for clinical trials  
 but then between what the doctor can do for you we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves  this is one of the themes i 'm talking about we can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors can 't do for us which is to use knowledge and take action  
 and if mother nature has given us
  we think there might be a new future in the value of how we eat and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day jc right 
 and along those lines for people who might have risk factors for cancer would you recommend pursuing any treatments prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce wl 
 well you know there 's abundant epidemiological evidence and i think in the information age it doesn
  take long to go to a credible source like pubmed the national library of medicine to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications  and that 's certainly something that anybody can look into
