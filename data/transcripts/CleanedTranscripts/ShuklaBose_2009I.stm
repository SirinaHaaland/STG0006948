  to share with you my journey of the last six years in the field of service
  neither am i a veteran social worker i was twenty six years in the corporate world trying to make organizations profitable  and then in two thousand and three
 i started parikrma humanity foundation from my kitchen table the first thing that we did was walk through the slums
 in bangalore who live in eight hundred slums  we couldn 't go to all the
 slums but we tried to cover as much as we could we walked through these slums  identified houses
 where children would never go to school  we talked to the parents tried to convince them
 about sending their children to school  we played with the children and came
  back home really tired exhausted but with images of bright faces twinkling eyes  and
 went to sleep we were all excited to start  but
 the numbers hit us then two hundred million children between four to fourteen that should be going to school but do not
  million children who go to school but cannot read one hundred and twenty five million who cannot
 do basic maths  
 we also heard that two hundred and fifty billion indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling  ninety percent of it was spent on 
 teachers ' salary and administrators ' salary and yet india has nearly the
 the highest teacher absenteeism in the in the world 
 with one out of four teachers not going to school at all the entire academic year 
 those numbers were absolutely 
 overwhelming  and we were constantly asked when will you start how many schools will you start
  children will you get how are you going to scale how are you going to replicate 
 it was very difficult not to get scared not to get daunted  but we dug our heels and said we 're not in the number game  
 we want to take one child at a time
 and take the child right through school  sent to college  and get them
  we started
 parikrma the first parikrma school started in a slum
 where there were seventy thousand people living
 below the poverty line  our first school was on a rooftop
 of a building inside the slums a second story building the only second story building inside the
  slums and that rooftop did not have
 any ceiling only half a tin sheet 
 that was our first school one hundred sixty five children 
 indian academic year begins in june so june it rains so many a times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof 
 waiting for the rain to stop my god what a bonding
  exercise that was and all of us that were under that roof are still here together today 
 then came the second school the third school  the fourth school and a junior college 
 in six years now we have four schools 
  very simple to send each of these kids get them prepared to be educated but also to live
 peacefully contented in this
 you have to talk english 
 and so all our schools are english medium schools  but they know there is this myth that children from the slums
 cannot speak english well no one in their family has spoken english no one in their generation has spoken english 
  i like those books because they have something special in them the vocabulary used in those
  i mean like once i pick up one book i cannot put it down until i finish the whole book  even if it takes me four and a half hours
  girl that you saw
 her father sells flowers on the roadside  
 and this little boy has been coming to school for five years but isn 't it strange that little boys all
  he hasn 't seen one he hasn 't ridden one of course  but he has done a lot of research through google search 
 you know  when we started with our english medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible 
 the icse curriculum 
 and again there were people who laughed at me and said don 't be crazy choosing such a tough curriculum for these students they 'll never be able to
  cope 
 not only do our children cope very well  but they excel in it you should just come across to see how well our children do 
 there is also this myth that parents from
 the slums are not interested in their children going to school  they 'd much rather put them to work that 's absolute hogwash all parents all over the world
 want their children to lead a better life than themselves  but they need to believe that change is possible
  we have eighty percent attendance for all our
  meeting sometimes it 's even one hundred percent much more than many privileged schools  fathers have started to attend it 's very interesting when we started our 
 the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register now they have started
 writing their signature the children have taught them it 's amazing how much children can teach
  we have a few months ago actually late last year we had a few mothers who came to us and said 
 you know we want to learn how to read and write can you teach us so we started an afterschool for our parents for our mothers we had twenty five mothers who came regularly after school to
  we want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools 
 ninety eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics so you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from  
 we have to send the fathers to de addiction labs
 and when they come back most times sober  we have to find
 a job for them so that they don 't regress  we have about three
  three fathers who have been trained to cook we have
 taught them nutrition  hygiene  we have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children they
 do a very good job because
 their children are eating their food  but most importantly this is the first
  they have got respect and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile more than ninety percent of
  staff are all parents and extended families we 've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school
  vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming
  there is also this myth that children from the slums cannot integrate with mainstream 
 take a look at this little girl who was one of the twenty eight children
 from all privileged schools best schools in the country that was selected for the duke university talent identification program and was sent to iim ahmedabad
  it was such a pride for us
  even now we are in touch through facebook  after this ahmedabad trip i 've been
  i don 't even mingle or start speaking with someone so
  working as a maid before she came to school  and today she wants to be a neurologist 
  our children are doing brilliantly in sports
  they are really excelling there is an  inter school athletic competition that is held every year every year
 in bangalore where five thousand children participate
 from one hundred and forty best schools in the city
 we 've got the best school award for three years successively  and our children are coming back home with bags full of medals
  lots of admirers and friends
 last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school  we also have
 our very own dream team  
 why is this happening why this confidence is it the exposure  we have
 professors from mit
  institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas  experiments much beyond the classroom art music
 are considered
 therapy and mediums of expression  we also believe that it 's the content
  not the toilets not the libraries but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important
  creating an environment of learning of inquiry of exploration is what is true education 
 when we started parikrma we had no idea which direction we were taking 
 we didn 't hire mckinsey to do a business plan
  but
 we we know for sure that what we want to do today is is take one child at a time not get bogged with numbers and actually see the child complete
 the circle of life and unleash his total
  we do not believe in scale because we believe in quality and scale and numbers will automatically happen  
 we have corporates that have stood behind us and we are able to now open more schools  but we began with the idea of one child at a time 
 this is  five year old parusharam he was begging
 by a bus stop a few years ago got picked up and
  is now in an orphanage has been coming to school for the last four and a half months he 's in kindergarten  he has learned how to speak english we have a model by which
 kids can speak english and understand english in three month 's time he can tell you stories in english of the thirsty
  of the crocodile and of the giraffe  and if you ask him
 what he likes to do he will say i like sleeping  i like eating  i like playing and if you ask him what he wants to do he will say i want to horsing 
 now horsing is going for a horse ride so
  parusharam
 comes to my office every day he comes for a tummy rub because he believes that will give me luck
  began with the idea of
