  what do you do when you have a headache 
 you swallow an aspirin  but for this pill to get to your head  where the pain is it goes through
 your stomach
  and various other organs first swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering
 any medication in the body 
 the downside though is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution 
 and this is a big problem particularly in hiv patients when they take their
  these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood  and increasing the cd4 cell counts  but they are also notorious
 for their adverse side effects  
 but mostly bad  because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood  
 and worse by the time they get to the sites where it matters most 
 within the hiv
  viral reservoirs 
 these areas in the body such as the lymph nodes the nervous system  as well as the lungs where the virus is sleeping  
 and will not readily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent
  drugs therapy  however  upon discontinuation of therapy the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood
  now  all this is a big problem in treating hiv with the current drug treatment which is a life long treatment that must be swallowed by patients 
 one day  i sat and thought 
 can we deliver
 directly within its reservoir sites without the risk of
  laser scientist the answer was just before my eyes lasers of course  if they can be used for dentistry 
 for diabetic wound healing and surgery they can be used for anything imaginable including transporting drugs into cells 
 as a matter of fact  we are currently using laser pulses
 to poke or drill extremely tiny holes which open
  and close almost immediately in
 cells in order to deliver drugs within them how is that possible
  the laser pierces the cell while the cell swallows the drug in a matter of microseconds before you even know it the induced hole becomes immediately repaired  
 now we are currently testing this technology
 in test tubes or in petri dishes but the goal is to get this technology in the human body  apply it in the human body
 how is that possible you may ask  well the answer is through a  three headed device
  using the first head  which is our laser we will make an incision in the site of infection  
 using the second head  which is a camera  we meander to the site of infection
  a third head which is a drug spreading sprinkler  
 we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection while the laser is again used to poke those cells open 
 well this might not seem like much right now  but
 one day  if successful this technology can lead to complete eradication of hiv in the body  
 yes a cure for hiv this is every hiv researcher 's dream in our case a cure lead by lasers  thank you
