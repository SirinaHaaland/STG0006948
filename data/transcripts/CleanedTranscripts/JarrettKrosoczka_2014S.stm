  when my first children 's book was published in two thousand and one  i returned to my old elementary school to talk to the students about being an author and an illustrator  
 and when i was setting up my slide projector
  i looked across the room and
 there she was 
 my old lunch lady 
 she was still there at the school and she was busily preparing lunches for the day  
 so i approached her to say hello and i said hi jeannie how are you and she looked at me and i could tell that she recognized me 
 but she couldn 't quite place me and she looked at me and she said stephen
  and i was amazed that she knew i was a krosoczka but stephen is my uncle who is twenty years older than i am  and she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid 
 and she started telling me about her grandkids and that
 blew my mind my lunch lady had grandkids and therefore kids and therefore left school at the end of the day
 i thought she lived in the cafeteria with the serving spoons i had never thought about any of that before well that chance encounter inspired my imagination
  and i created the lunch lady graphic novel series 
 a series of comics about a lunch lady who uses her fish stick nunchucks to fight off evil cyborg substitutes 
 a school bus monster  and mutant  mathletes and the end of every book they get the bad guy with their hairnet  and they proclaim
  and it 's been amazing because the series was so welcomed into the reading lives of children  and they sent me the most amazing letters and cards and artwork and 
  i would notice as i would visit schools the lunch staff would be involved in the programming in a very meaningful way  
 because the lunch lady has not been treated very kindly in popular culture over time
  but it meant the most to jeannie when the books were first published i invited her to the book launch party  
 and in front of everyone there everyone she had fed over the years i gave her a piece of artwork and some books 
 and two years after this photo was taken she passed away  
 and i attended her wake and nothing could
  have prepared me for what i saw there because next to her casket
 was this painting and her husband told me it meant so much to her
 that i had acknowledged her hard work  i had validated what she did 
 and that inspired me to create a day where we could recreate that feeling in cafeterias across
  the country 
 school lunch hero day a day where kids can make creative projects for their lunch staff  
 and i partnered with the school nutrition association and did you know that a little over thirty million kids participate in school lunch programs every day that equals up to a little over five billion lunches made every school year  
 and the stories of heroism go well beyond just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets on their lunch tray there is ms brenda in
  who keeps a close eye on every student that comes through her line and then reports back to the guidance counselor if anything is amiss there are the lunch ladies in kentucky who realized that  sixty seven percent 
  of their students relied on those meals every day  and they were going without food over the summer  so they retrofitted a school bus to create a mobile feeding unit  and they traveled around the neighborhoods feedings five hundred kids a day during the summer  
 they took photos of their lunch lady 's head and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady and fixed that to a milk carton and presented them with flowers  
 and they made their own comics starring the cartoon lunch lady alongside their actual lunch ladies  
 and they made thank you pizzas where every kid signed a different topping of a construction paper pizza
  i was so moved by the response
 that came from the lunch ladies  because one woman said to me she said before this day  i felt like i was at the end of the planet at this school i didn 't think that anyone noticed us down here 
 another woman said to me 
 you know what i got out of this is that what i do is important 
 and of course what she does is
  they all do is important  they 're feeding our children every single day  and before a child can learn their belly needs to be full  
 and these women and men are working on the front lines to create an educated society 
 so i hope
 that you don 't wait for school lunch hero day to to say thank you to your lunch staff  and i hope that you remember
 how powerful a thank you can be a thank you can change a life
 it changes the life of the person who receives it  and it changes the life of the person who expresses it thank you
