  a few years ago  i broke into my own house 
 i had just driven home it was around midnight in the dead of montreal winter i had been visiting my friend jeff across town  and
 the thermometer on the
 porch read minus forty degrees
 and don 't bother asking if that 's celsius or fahrenheit  minus forty is where the two scales meet
 it was very cold and as i stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets  i found i didn 't have my keys 
 in fact i could see them through the window  lying on the dining room table where i had left them  
 so i quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows and they were locked tight i thought about calling a locksmith at least i had my cellphone but at midnight it could take
  a while for a locksmith to show up and
 it was cold
 i couldn 't go back to my friend jeff 's house for the night because i had an early flight to europe the next morning and i needed to get my passport and my suitcase 
 so desperate and freezing cold  i found a large rock and i broke through the basement window  cleared out the shards of glass i crawled through  i found a piece of cardboard and taped it up
  over the opening figuring that in the morning on the way to the airport i could call my contractor and ask him to to fix it this was going to be expensive but probably no more expensive than 
  a middle of the night locksmith so i figured under the circumstances i was coming out even 
  raises your heart rate it
 modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking  
 so the next morning  
 when i woke up on too little sleep  worrying about the hole in the window  and a mental note that i had to call my contractor and the freezing temperatures and the meetings i had upcoming in europe
  you know with all the cortisol in my brain my thinking was cloudy  but i didn 't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy and
 it wasn 't until i got to the airport check in counter that i realized i didn 't have my passport 
 so i raced home in the snow and ice forty minutes got my passport raced back to the airport  i made it just in
  but they had given away my seat to someone else so i got stuck in the back of the plane next to the bathrooms in a seat that wouldn 't recline on an eight hour flight well
 i had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep 
 and i started wondering are there things that i can do systems that i can put into place that will prevent bad things from happening 
 or at least if bad things happen will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe  
  about that but my thoughts didn 't crystallize until about a month later i was having dinner with my colleague danny kahneman the nobel prize winner 
 and i somewhat  embarrassedly told him about having broken my window and 
 you know forgotten my passport and danny shared with me that he 'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight 
  it 's something that he had gotten from the psychologist gary klein who had written about it a few years before also called the pre mortem now you all know what the postmortem is whenever there 's a disaster 
  a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong  right well in the pre mortem danny explained you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong  
  to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre mortem 
 some of them are obvious some of them are not so obvious i 'll start with the obvious ones around the home  
 designate a place for things that are easily lost 
 now this sounds like common sense and it is  but there 's a lot of science to back this up based on the way our spatial memory works
 there 's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus that evolved over tens of thousands of years to keep track of the locations of important things
 where the well is where fish can be found that stand of fruit trees
  where the friendly and enemy tribes live the hippocampus is the part of the brain that in london taxicab drivers becomes enlarged  it 's the part of the brain that allows
  squirrels to find their nuts  and if you 're wondering somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels and they could still find their nuts they weren 't using smell 
 they were using the hippocampus this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things 
  car keys and reading glasses and passports 
 so in the home designate a spot for your keys a hook by the door  maybe a decorative bowl for your passport a particular drawer for your reading glasses a particular table if you designate a spot and you 're scrupulous about it 
 your things will always be there when you look for them 
 what about travel take a cell phone picture of your credit cards your driver 's license your passport
 mail it to yourself so it 's in the cloud if these things are lost or stolen you can facilitate replacement now these are some rather obvious things
  remember when you 're under stress the brain releases cortisol cortisol is toxic  and it causes cloudy thinking so part of the practice of the pre mortem
 is to recognize that under stress you 're not going to be at your best and you should put systems in place
 and there 's perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you 're confronted with a medical decision to make 
 and at some point all of us are going to be in that position where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one to help them with a decision 
 and so i want to talk about that and i 'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition 
 but this stands as a proxy for all kinds of
 decision making and indeed for financial decision making and social decision making any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts 
 so suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says i just got your lab work back 
 your cholesterol 's a little high 
 now you all know
  high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease heart attack stroke  and so you 're thinking having high cholesterol isn 't the best thing and so the 
  doctor says you know i 'd like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol a statin 
  give me the statin 
 but there 's a question you should ask at this point a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don 't like talking about and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less
  it 's for the number needed to treat 
 now what is this the nnt it 's the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure
 before one person
  you 're thinking what kind of crazy statistic is that the number should be one my doctor wouldn 't prescribe something to me if it 's not going to help 
 but actually medical practice doesn 't work that way and it 's not the doctor 's fault if it 's anybody 's fault it 's the fault of scientists like me we haven 't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough 
  but glaxosmithkline estimates that ninety percent of the drugs work in only thirty to fifty percent of the people 
 what do you suppose it is how many people have to take it before one person is helped 
 this is according to research by research practitioners jerome groopman and pamela hartzband independently confirmed by bloomberg com i ran through the numbers myself
  three hundred people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack stroke or other adverse event is prevented now you 're probably
  thinking well ok 
 one in three hundred chance of lowering my cholesterol why not doc  give me the prescription anyway but you should ask at this point for another statistic and that is tell me about the side effects right 
  so for this particular drug the side effects occur in five percent of the patients  
  gastrointestinal distress
 but now you 're thinking five percent not very likely it 's going to happen to me i 'll still take the drug but wait a minute  remember under stress you 're not thinking clearly so think about how you 're going to work through this ahead of 
  time so you don 't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot three hundred people take the drug right one person 's helped  five percent of those three hundred have side effects that 's fifteen people 
 fifteen times more likely to be harmed by the drug
 than you are to be helped by the drug 
 now  i 'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not i 'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor medical ethics requires it it 's part of the principle of informed consent 
 you have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not now you might be thinking i 've pulled this number out of the air for shock value
  needed to treat for the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of fifty 
 removal of the prostate for cancer the number needed to treat is forty nine 
 that 's right forty nine surgeries are done for every one person who 's helped  and the side effects in that case
 occur in fifty percent of the patients  they include impotence erectile dysfunction urinary incontinence  rectal tearing
  incontinence  and if you 're lucky and you 're one of the fifty percent who has these they 'll only last for a year or two so
 the idea of the pre mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward you don 't want to have to manufacture all of this 
  on the spot and you also want to think about things like quality of life because you have a choice oftentimes
  shorter life that 's pain free or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end 
 these are things to talk about and think about now with your family and your loved ones you might change your mind in the heat of the moment but at least you 're practiced with this kind of thinking  
 remember  our brain
 under stress releases cortisol and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down there 's an
  evolutionary reason for this face to face with a predator you don 't need your digestive system or your libido or your immune system  because if you 're body is expending metabolism 
  on those things and you don 't react quickly you might become the lion 's lunch and then none of those things matter
  colleagues have shown  so we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations  i think the important point here
 is recognizing that all of us are flawed we all are going to fail now and then 
 the idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be
  put systems in place
