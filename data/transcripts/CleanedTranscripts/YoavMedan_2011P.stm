  thirteen years one three thirteen years i 've been part of an exceptional team at insightec in israel
 and partners around the world for taking this idea this concept noninvasive surgery from the research lab
 to routine clinical use
  and this is what i 'll tell you about thirteen years
 for some of you you can empathize with that number for me today on this date it 's like a second bar mitzvah experience 
 laughter so this this dream is really enabled by the convergence of two known technologies 
 one is the focused ultrasound and the
  other one is the 
  magnetic resonance imaging  
 so let 's first talk about focused ultrasound  
 and i hold in my hand a tissue mimicking phantom it is made out of silicon it is transparent
  made just for you so you see it 's all
  take you now to the acoustic lab you see the phantom within the aquarium this is a setup i put in a physics lab on the right hand side you see an ultrasonic transducer  
 so the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses
 inside the phantom
 okay  when you hear the click  this is when the energy starts to emit and you see
  lesion form inside the phantom  okay  so everything around it
 is whole and intact  it 's just a lesion formed inside so think about this is in your brain  we need to reach a target inside the brain  we can do it without harming any tissue  
 so this is i think
  let 's talk a little bit about ultrasound the force of ultrasound you know all about imaging  right ultrasound imaging and you know also about lithotripsy
 breaking
 breaking kidney stones  but ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between because
  it 's a mechanical
 force basically it 's a force acting on a tissue that it transverses  so you can change the intensity the frequency  the duration  the pulse shape of the ultrasound to create anything from an airbrush
 to a hammer   and i am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing
  this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain is not new at all when i was born this idea was already conceived
 by pioneers such as the fry brothers
 and lars leksell who is know actually as the inventor of the gammaknife  but
 you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain noninvasively with focused
  ultrasound in the ' 50s he failed  so he then invented the gammaknife  
 and it makes you ponder why why those pioneers failed  and there was something fundamental
 that they were missing they were missing the vision it wasn 't until the invention of the mr and really the integration of
  ultrasound that we could get the feedback
 both the anatomical and the physiological
 in order to have a completely noninvasive  closed loop surgical procedure
   so this is how it looks you know the operating room of the future today  this is an mr suite
  focused ultrasound system  and i will give you several examples so the first one is in the brain  one of the neurological conditions that can be treated with focused ultrasound
 are movement disorders like parkinson 's or essential tremor what is typical to those conditions
 to essential tremor for example is
 inability to
 drink or eat cereal or soup without spilling everything
  over you or write legibly so people can understand it and be really independent in your life
 without the the help of others  so i 'd like you to meet john 
 john is a retired professor of history from virginia  so he suffered from essential tremor for many years 
  medication didn 't help him anymore and many of those patients refused to undergo surgery to have people cut into their brain  and about four or five months ago  
 he
 underwent an experimental procedure  it is approved under
 the university of virginia in charlottesville using focused ultrasound
  this is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the mr so now i 'll take you through [ what ] a typical procedure like that looks like [ what ]
  looks like 
 so we put the patient on the mr table we attach a transducer in this case to the brain but if it will be a different organ it will be a different transducer attached to the
 patient and the physician will then take
 a regular mr scan   and the objective of that i don 't have a pointer here but you see the
  sort of rectangle or trapezoid  
 this is the sort of general area of the treatment  it 's a safety boundary around the target  it 's a target in the thalamus   so once those pictures are acquired 
  and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on 
 injecting the energy we call it sonication the only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse  this is the only device he needs in this treatment  
 so he presses sonicate and this is what happens you see the transducer the light blue there 's water in between the skull and the transducer  
 and it does this burst of energy it elevates the temperature we first need to verify that
  that we are on target  so the first sonication is at lower energy it doesn 't do any damage  but it elevates the temperature
 by a few degrees and one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the mr
 is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively  this is really a unique
  not being used in regular diagnostic imaging  
 but here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time and you can see the points there on the graph 
 the temperature was raised to forty three degrees c temporarily  this doesn 't cause any damage  but the point is we are right on target  
 so once the physician verifies
 that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen then we move
 to perform
 ablation like you see here  and you see the temperature rises to like fifty five to sixty degrees c 
 if you do it for more than a second it 's enough to basically
 destroy the proteins of the cells  this is the outcome
  courageous people who volunteered for the study  and you have to understand what is in people 's mind when when they are willing to take the risk 
 this is a quote from john after he wrote it he said miraculous and his wife said this is the happiest moment of my life 
 and you wonder why i mean 
 one of the messages i like to carry over is what about defending quality of life i mean those people lose their independence they are dependent on
  and john today is fully independent  he returned to a normal life routine  and he also plays golf like you do in in virginia
 when you are
 retired  okay  so you can see here
 the spot it 's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain there 's no damage outside he suffers from no neurodeficit 
 there 's no recovery needed no nothing
  to his normal life let 's move now
 to a more painful subject pain is something that can make your life miserable  and people are suffering from all kinds of pain like
 neuropathic pain lower back pain
 and cancer pain from bone metastases when the
  get to your bones sometimes they are
 very painful all those i 've indicated have already been shown to be successfully treated by
 focused ultrasound relieving the pain again very fast and i would like to tell you about
 pj  he 's a 
  who suffered from how should i say it it 's called pain in the butt he had
 metastases in his right buttock
 buttock  and he couldn 't sit even with medication  
 he had to forgo all the farm activities
  he was
 treated with radiation therapy state of the art radiation therapy  but it didn 't help many patients like that favor radiation therapy
  and again he volunteered to a pivotal study
 that we ran worldwide also in the u s and
 his wife actually took him they drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital  he had to sit
  because it was very painful  he took the treatment  and on the way
 back he drove the truck by himself  
 so again  this is an immediate relief  and you have to understand what
 those people feel and what their family
  returned again to his daily routine on the farm he rides his tractor  he rides his horse to their mountain cabin
 regularly  and
 he has been very happy  
 but now you ask me but what about war  the war on cancer show us some primary cancer  what can be done there  
  so i have good news and bad news  the good news  there 's a lot that can be done  and it has been shown actually outside of the u s and
 doing that in the u s is very painful i don 't see without this nation taking it as 
 collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen  it will not happen and it 's not just because of regulation
  because of the amount of money needed under the current
 medicine and the size of trials and so on
 to to make it happen  so the first two applications are breast cancer and prostate cancer  they were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound  
 and
  results in breasts  but
 i have a message for the men here we heard here yesterday quyen
 talking about
 the adverse event trait in prostate cancer there is a unique opportunity now with focused ultrasound guided by mr 
 because we can actually think about
 prostate lumpectomy treating just the focal lesion and not removing the whole gland and by that avoiding all the issues
  with potency and incontinence  
 well there are other
 cancer tumors in the abdomen quite lethal very lethal actually pancreas liver kidney 
 the challenge there
 with a breathing and awake patient and in all our treatments the patient is awake and conscious and
  speaks with the physician
 is you have to teach the mr some tricks how to do it in real time  and
 this will take time  this will take two years but i have now a message to the ladies  and this is in two thousand and 
  focused ultrasounds for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids  women suffer from that
 disease all those tumors have
 heavy bleeding during periods  abdominal pressure back pain  frequent urination  and sometimes they cannot even conceive and become pregnant because of the fibroid  
  this is a big fibroid  she was offered a hysterectomy  
 but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option  
 so she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in two thousand and eight 
 and in two thousand and ten she became a first time mother to a healthy baby  so new life was
  like to leave you with with actually four messages one is think about the amount of suffering that is saved from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery 
 and also the economical and emotional burden removed from their families and communities and the society
  at large and
 i think also from their physicians by the way and the other thing i would like you to think about is
 the new type of relationship between physician and patients when you have a patient
 on the table [ who ] is awake and can even monitor the treatment in all our treatments  the patient holds a stop sonication button he can stop the surgery
 at any moment and
 with that note i would like to thank you for listening
