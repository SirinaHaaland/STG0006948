  id like to dedicate this one to all the women in south africa
 those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid and of course 
 im dedicating it also to my grandmother
  a lot of important roles  especially for me when i was an activist  and being harassed by the police you will recall that 
  sixteen the students of south africa boycotted the language of afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor as
 they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in afrikaans biology mathematics and
  about our languages  and
 the students wanted to speak to the government  and police answered with bullets  so every year june sixteen we will commemorate all those
 comrades or students who died  and i was very young then i think i was eleven years  and
  and thats when my political education
 started  and i joined  later on the
 youth organization under the african national congress  so
 as part of organizing this and whatever this commemoration the police will round us up as
 they call us leaders  and i used to run away from home when i know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or  10th of june or so
  grandmother one time said no look  youre not going to run away this is your place you stay here 
 and indeed 
 the police came because theyll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like  after the 20th or so 
 so it was on the 10th of june  and they came and they surrounded the house  
 and my grandmother
 switched off all the lights in the house
 and opened the kitchen door  
 and she said to them vusi 's here  
 and you 're not going to take him tonight i 'm tired of you having to come here  harassing us while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes  he is here and you 're not going to take him 
 i 've got a bowl full of boiling water the first one who comes in here  gets it
  maybe
  all the
 lights
