  charles and ray were a team  they were husband and wife despite the new york times ' and vanity fair 's best efforts recently they 're not brothers 
 and they were a lot of fun you know ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family
  when i speak of him i 'm really speaking of both of them as a team here 's charles when he was three  so he would be one hundred this june we have a lot of cool celebrations that we 're going to do the thing about their
 work is that most people come to the door of furniture i suspect you probably recognize this chair and some of the others i 'm going to show you but we 're going to first enter through the door of the big top
  is that you know why am i showing it 
 is it because charles and ray made this film this is actually a training film for a clown college that they had they also practiced a clown act when the future of furniture
  was not nearly as auspicious as it turned out to be there is a picture of charles so let 's watch the next clip  
 the film that we 're about to see is a film they made for the moscow world 's fair video 
 this is the land  it has many contrasts it is rough
 and it is flat in places
  too much rain falls on some areas  and not enough on others  
 but people live on this land 
 and as in russia
  they are drawn together into towns and cities 
 here is something of the way they live eames demetrios now 
 this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the united states it was on seven screens and it was two hundred feet across 
 and it was at the height of the cold war the 
  nixon khrushchev kitchen debate happened about fifty feet from where this was
  and yet how did it start  you know  commonality the first line
 in charles ' narration was the same stars that shine down on russia shine down on the united states from the sky our cities look much the same it was that human connection that charles and ray always found in everything  
 and you can imagine and the thing about it is that they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images because the important thing was to get the gestalt of what the
 what the images were about so
  but the thing about charles and ray is that they
 they were always modeling stuff they were always trying things out i think one of the things i am passionate about my grandparents work i 'm
 passionate about my work but on top of all that i 'm passionate about
 about a holistic vision of design where design is a life skill not a professional skill  and you know 
 those of us with kids often want our kids to take music i 'm no exception  but it 's not about them becoming
  bono or tracy chapman  it 's about getting that music thing going through their heads and their thinking design is the same way design has to become that same way  and this is a model that they did of that seven screen presentation and charles just
 checking it out there  so now we 're going to go through that door of furniture  this is an unusual installation of airport seating
 so what we 're going to see is some of the icons of eames furniture and the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer was essentially
  of a good host anticipating the needs of the guest 
 so those are cool images but these are ones i think are really cool these are all the prototypes these are the mistakes although i don 't think mistakes is the right word in design  
 it 's just the things you try out to kind of make it
 make it work better and you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs some of them are kind of cool looking it 's like hey why didn 't they try that it was that hands on iterative process which is 
 so much like vernacular
  and folk design in traditional cultures and i think that 's one of the commonalities between modernism and traditional design i think it may be a real common ground as we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next twenty or thirty years the other thing that 's
 kind of cool  is that you look at this and
 in the media when people say design they actually mean style  and i 'm really here to talk about design  but you know the object is just a pivot  it 's a pivot between a process and a system
  film i made about the making of the eames lounge chair the design process for charles and ray never
 never ended in manufacturing 
 it continued they were always trying to make thing better and better because it 's like as bill clinton was saying about rwandan health clinics 
 it 's not enough to create one  you 've got to create a system that will work
  any more basic than that you try things out this is a relatively famous chair  
 its early version had an x base that 's what the collectors like charles and ray liked this one because it was better  it worked better h base much more practical 
 this is something called a splint  and i was very touched by
 dean kamen 's work for the for the military or for the soldiers because charles and ray designed a molded plywood splint this is it and they 'd been working
  on furniture before but doing these splints they learned a lot about the about the manufacturing process  which was incredibly important to them
 i 'm trying to show you too much because i want you to really get a broth of ideas and images  this is a house that charles and ray designed my sister is chasing someone else
  it 's not me  although i endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary
 it 's not me  and then this is a film on the lower left that charles and ray made now look at that plastic chair
  make the house curvy they didn 't say our style is grids let 's make the chair griddy they focused on the need they tried to solve the design design problem charles used to say the extent to which 
  you have a design style is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem it 's kind of a brutal quote  
  very expensive medium here 's a film we 've
 been hearing things about the powers of ten is a film they made if we watch the next clip you 're
 going to see the first version of powers of ten upper left  
 the familiar one on the lower right  the eames ' film tops lower left
  and
 a lamp that charles designed for a church video which in turn
  to a local group of galaxies these form part of a grouping system much as the stars do they are
 so many and so varied that from this distance they appear like the stars from earth ed you
 've seen that film and
 what 's so great about this whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale everybody here is coming at it from a different way i want to give you one example e o wilson once told me that when he looked at ants he loved
  of course and he wanted to learn more about them he consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale so here is the tiny creature and yet simply by changing the frame of reference it reveals so much including what ended up being the ted 
  prize modeling they tried modeling all the time they were always modeling things  
  it was part of the business of life in general  it was part of the quality of life and here is some some family pictures and
 you can see why i 'm down on style with a haircut like that but anyway 
 i remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the eames house when i was a kid so we 're going to watch another film this is a film
 the one called toys you can see me i have the same haircut 
 in the upper right corner  
 upper left is a
  materials in the plywood
 and now i 'm going to test you this is a letter that my grandfather sent to my mom when she was five years old  so can you read it 
 lucia angel
  you 've been to the website dogs of saint louis in the late in the
  i saw many trains and also rode on one i hope you had a nice time at buddy
  guys did pretty good cool
  so my mom and charles had this great relationship where they 'd send those sorts of things back and forth to one another and it 's all part of the you know they used to say take your pleasure seriously 
 these are some images from a project of mine
 that 's
 called kymaerica it 's sort of an alternative universe it 's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape those plaques are plaques we 've been installing around north america we 're about to do
 six in the u k next week and they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world so of course since it 's bronze it has to be true video 
 kymaerica with waterfalls tumbling through our ed this is one of the traditional kymaerican songs 
 and so we had spelling bees in paris illinois video your word is n carolina girl y i n d i a n a 
  and then embassy row is actually a historical site because in the  in the kymaerican story
 this is where the parisian diaspora started where there embassy was so you can actually visit and have this  three dimensional fictional
 experience there  and the town has really embraced it we had the spelling bee in conjunction with the gwomeus club  but what is really cool is that we take our visual environment as inevitable 
 and it 's not other things could have happened the japanese could have discovered monterey and we could have been born one hundred thousand years ago and
  fun things this is the museum of the bench they have trading cards and
 all sorts of cool things and you 're kind of trapped in the texture
 texture of kymaerica  the tahatchabe the great road building culture 
 a guy named nobu naga the so called japanese columbus  but now i 'm going to return you to the real world  
 and this is cranbrook  i 've got a real treat for you which is the first film that charles ever made  
 so let 's watch that nobody 's ever seen it
 cranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here it
 's a film about maya gretel a famous ceramicist and a teacher at cranbrook  and he made it for the one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine faculty exhibition  
 silent we don 't have a track for it yet 
 very simple it 's just a start but
  to learn how to make films go make a movie  and you try something out but here is what 's really great 
 see that chair there the orange one that 's the organic chair one thousand nine hundred and forty 
 at the same time that charles was doing that chair he was doing this film  so my point is that this scope of vision this holistic vision of design was with them from the beginning it wasn 't like oh we made some chairs and got successful now we 're going to do some movies it was always part of how they looked at the world
  and that 's what 's really powerful and i think that all of us in this room as you move design forward it 's not about just doing
 one thing it 's about how you approach problems and there is this huge beautiful commonality between design business
 and the world so we 're going to do the last clip  and i 've shown you some of the images i just want to focus on sound now so this is charles ' voice charles eames in india 
 those without and the lowest in caste eat very often particularly in southern india they eat off of a banana leaf
  and those a little bit
 up the scale eat off of a sort of a low fired ceramic dish and a little bit higher why they
 have a glaze on a thing they call a thali  if you 're up the scale a little bit more why a brass thali  and then
 things
  and there is solid silver thalis and
 i suppose some nut has had a gold thali that he 's eaten off of  but you can go beyond that and
 the guys that have not only means  but a certain amount of
 knowledge and understanding  go to the next step and they eat off a banana leaf and
 i think that in these times when we fall back and regroup that somehow or other the
 banana leaf parable sort of got to get working there because i 'm not
 prepared to say that the banana leaf that one eats off of is the same
 as the other eats off of  but it
  that process that has happened within the man that changes the the banana leaf
