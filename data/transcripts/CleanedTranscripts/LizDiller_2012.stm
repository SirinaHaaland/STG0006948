  we conventionally divide space into private and public realms  and we know these legal distinctions very well because we 've become experts at protecting our
 private property and private space  but we 're less attuned to the nuances of
 of the public 
 what translates generic public space into qualitative space i mean this is something that our studio has been working on for the past decade  and we 're doing this through some case studies 
 a large chunk of our work has been put into transforming this neglected industrial ruin into a viable post industrial space that looks forward and backward at the same time
  and another huge chunk of our work has gone into making relevant a site that 's grown out of sync with its time 
 we 've been working on democratizing lincoln center for a public that doesn 't usually have 
 to spend on an opera ticket  so we 've been eating drinking thinking living public space
 for quite a long time  and it 's taught us really one thing
  and that is
 to truly make good public space 
 you have to erase the distinctions between architecture  urbanism landscape media design
 and so on it really goes beyond distinction now we 're moving onto washington d c and we 're working on another
  and that is for the existing hirshhorn museum that 's sited on the most revered public space in america  the national mall 
 the mall is a symbol of
 american democracy  and what 's fantastic is that this symbol
 is not a thing it 's not an image it 's not an artifact actually it 's a space  and it 's kind of just defined
  line of buildings on either side  
 it 's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power  
 it 's a place where pivotal moments in american history have taken place  and they 're inscribed in there forever like the march on washington for jobs and freedom
 and the great speech that martin luther king gave there 
 the vietnam protests the commemoration of all that died in the pandemic of aids the march for women 's reproductive rights
 right up until almost the present the mall is the greatest civic stage
 in this country for dissent  and
 it 's synonymous with free speech  even if you 're not sure what it is that you have to say  it may just be a place for civic commiseration
  there is a huge disconnect
 we believe between the communicative and discursive space of the mall and the museums that line it to either side  
 and that is that those museums are usually passive they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience as the receiver of information and so you can
  insects and collections of locomotives and all of that but you 're really not involved you 're being talked to 
 when richard koshalek took over as director of the hirshhorn in two thousand and nine
 he was determined to take advantage of the fact that this museum was sited at the most unique place at the seat of power in the
  art and politics are inherently and implicitly
 together always and all the time  there could be some very special relationship that could be forged here in its uniqueness 
 the question is is it possible ultimately for art to insert itself into the dialogue of national and world affairs and could the museum be an agent of cultural diplomacy  
 there are over
  one hundred and eighty embassies in washington d c there are over five hundred think tanks
 there should be a way of harnessing all of that intellectual and global energy
 into and somehow through the museum there should be some kind of brain trust so the hirshhorn as we began to think about it and as we
 we evolved the mission with richard and his team it 's really his life blood  but beyond exhibiting
 contemporary art the hirshhorn
 will become a public forum a place of discourse for for issues around arts culture 
 politics and policy  
 it would have the global reach of the world economic forum it would have the interdisciplinarity of the ted conference
 it would have
 the informality of the town square  
 and for this new initiative the hirshhorn would have to expand or appropriate a site for a contemporary  deployable structure 
 this is it this is the hirshhorn so 
  concrete doughnut designed in the early ' 70s by gordon bunshaft 
  it 's hulking it 's silent it 's cloistered it 's arrogant  
 it 's a design challenge  
 architects love to hate it one redeeming feature is it 's lifted up off the ground and it 's got this void  and it 's got an empty core kind of in the 
  spirit and that facade very much corporate and federal style and around that space the ring is actually galleries very very difficult to mount shows in there  
  times critic had some choice words neo penitentiary modern a maimed
 monument and a maimed mall for a maimed collection 
 almost four decades later how will this building expand for a new progressive program 
 where would it go it can 't go in the mall  there is no space there it can 't go in the
  it 's already taken up by landscape and by sculptures well there 's always the hole  
 but how could it take the space of that hole
 and not be buried in it invisibly how could it become iconic  and what language
 would it take 
 the hirshhorn sits among the mall 's monumental institutions most are neoclassical heavy and opaque made of stone or concrete 
 and the question is if one inhabits
  that space what is the material
 of the mall  
 it has to be different from the buildings there it has to be something entirely different it has to be air in our imagination it has to be light it has to be ephemeral it has to be formless  
 and it has to be free
  this is the big idea  it 's a giant airbag  
 the expansion takes the shape of its container and it oozes out wherever it can the top and sides  
 but more poetically we like to think of the structure as
 inhaling the democratic air of the mall
  into itself the before
 and the after 
 it was dubbed the bubble by the press 
 that was the lounge it 's basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction  
 the membrane is translucent it 's made of silcon coated glass
  it 's inflated twice a year for one month at a time  this is the view from the inside so you might have been wondering
 how in the world did we get this approved by the federal government  it had to be approved by actually two agencies
 and one is there to preserve the dignity and sanctity of the mall
  i blush whenever i show this it is yours to interpret  but one thing i can say is that
 it 's a combination of iconoclasm
 and adoration 
 there was also some creative interpretation involved the congressional buildings act of one thousand nine hundred and ten limits the height of buildings
  to one hundred and thirty feet except for spires towers domes and minarets this pretty much exempts monuments
 of the church and state  and the bubble is one hundred and fifty three ft that 's
 the pantheon next to it it 's about one point two million cubic feet of compressed air  
 and so we argued it on the merits of being a dome  so there it is very stately
  among all the stately buildings in the mall and while this
 hirshhorn is not landmarked it 's very very historically sensitive and so we couldn 't really touch its surfaces we couldn 't leave any traces behind 
 so we strained it from the edges and we held it by cables it 's a study of some bondage techniques which are actually very very important because it 's hit by wind all the time  there
 one permanent steel ring at the top  but it can 't be seen from any vantage point on the mall  
 there are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit it glows from within it 's translucent  but it can 't be more lit than the capitol or some of the monuments so it 's
 down the hierarchy on lighting  so it comes to the site twice a year it 's taken off the delivery truck  it 's hoisted  and then
  and then it 's restrained with the cables and then it 's ballasted with water at the very bottom 
 this is a very strange moment where we were asked by the the bureaucracy at the mall
 how much time would it take to install  and we said well the first erection would take one week 
 and they really connected with that idea   
 and then it was really easy all the way through so we didn 't really
  have that many hurdles i have to say with the government and all the authorities but some of the toughest hurdles have been the technical ones this is the warp and weft 
 this is a point cloud  
 there are extreme pressures this is a very very unusual building in that there 's no gravity load  but there 's load in every direction and i 'm just going to
  this is the space in action so flexible interior
 for discussions just like this but in the round luminous and reconfigurable could be used for anything for performances  films for installations  
 and
 the very first program will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy organized in partnership with the council on foreign relations  form and content are together
  here the bubble is an 
 the ideals of participatory democracy are represented through suppleness rather than rigidity art and politics occupy an ambiguous site
 outside the museum walls but inside of the museum 's core  
 blending its air with the democratic air of the mall and
 the bubble will
 inflate hopefully for the first time at the end of two thousand and thirteen thank you
