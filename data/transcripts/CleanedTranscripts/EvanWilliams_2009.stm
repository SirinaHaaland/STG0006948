  four years ago
 on the ted stage i announced a company i was working with at the time called odeo  
 and because of that announcement we got a big article in the new york times which led to more press which led
 to more attention and me deciding to become ceo of that company whereas i was
  an adviser
 and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring  
 one of the guys i hired was an engineer named jack dorsey and a year later when we were trying to decide which way to go with odeo  
 jack presented an idea he 'd been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends 
 we were also playing with sms at the time at odeo so we kind of put two and two together
  and in early two thousand and six we launched twitter as a side project at odeo  
 now it 's hard to justify doing a side project at a startup where focus is so critical  
 but i had actually launched blogger as a side project to my previous company thinking it was just a little thing we 'd do on the side 
 and it ended up taking over not only the company but my life for the next five or six years so i learned to follow hunches even though you can 't necessarily
  them or know where they 're going to go  and that 's kind of what 's happened with twitter time after time 
 so for those of you unfamiliar twitter is based around a very simple seemingly trivial concept 
 you say what you 're doing in one hundred and forty characters or less 
 and people who are interested in you get those updates if they 're really interested they get the update as a text message on their cell phone  
 so for instance i may twitter right now that i 'm giving a talk
  at ted  and
 in my case when i hit send up to sixty thousand people will receive that message in a matter of seconds 
 now the fundamental idea is that twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want be they momentous occasions
 or mundane ones it
 is by sharing these moments as they 're happening that lets
  people feel more connected and in touch  despite distance and in real time 
 this is the primary use we saw of twitter from the beginning 
 and what got us excited what we didn 't anticipate was the many many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system  
 one of the things we realized was how important twitter
  when the wildfires broke out in san diego in october of two thousand and seven people turned to twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them  
 but it wasn 't just individuals the l a times actually turned to twitter to dispense information as well  and put a twitter feed on the front page  and the l a fire department and red cross used it to dispense news and updates as well 
 at this event dozens of people here are twittering and thousands of people around the world
  are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what 's happening 
 among the other interesting things that have cropped up are many things from businesses 
 from marketing and communications and predictable things 
 to an insanely popular korean barbecue taco truck that drives around l a and twitters where it stops  causing a line to form around the
  politicians have recently begun twittering in fact there are forty seven members of congress who currently have twitter accounts  
 and they 're tweeting in some cases from behind closed door sessions with the president in this case this guy 's not liking what he 's hearing 
 the president himself is our most popular twitter user  although his tweets have dropped off as of late 
 while senator mccain 's have picked up 
 as have this guy
 twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium you send one message and it goes out to everybody and you receive the messages you 're interested in 
 one of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific
  that shaquille o 'neal 's using here to reply to one of his fans was completely invented by users and we didn 't build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier 
 this is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system another is via the api we built an application programming interface which basically means that
 programmers can write software that interacts with twitter we currently know about over two thousand pieces of software that can send twitter updates
 interfaces
  windows your iphone your blackberry
 as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby twitter when it kicks
 or a plant twitter when it needs water  
 probably the most important  third party development came from a little company in virginia called summize summize built a twitter search engine  
 and they tapped into the fact that if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they 're doing and what 's around them you have an incredible resource
 any topic or event while it 's going on this really changed how we perceived twitter for instance here 's what people are saying about ted 
 this is another way that our mind was shifted and twitter wasn 't what we thought it was 
 we liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product  
 this not only lets you view
  twitters in different ways but it introduces new use cases as well one of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in atlanta  
 some users figured out that they would twitter when they found gas where it was and how much it cost and then appended the keyword # atlgas which let other people search for that and find gas themselves and
 this trend of people using this communication network to help each other
  out goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends it 's
 happened more and more lately  whether it 's raising money for homeless people or to dig wells in africa
 or or for a family in crisis people have raised tens of thousands of dollars over twitter
 in a matter of days on several occasions 
 it seems like when you give people easier
  ways to share information more good things happen 
 i have no idea what will happen next with twitter  i 've learned to follow the hunch but never assume where it will go
 live this is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do after they 've been to an event  
 it 's totally intimidating so  
 this would be the twitter search screen so we 're going to just type a couple of random words into twitter for example evan
 williams 
  in the eight minutes he was talking there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk so he 'll see every aspect of the reaction the fact that
 barack obama is the biggest twitterer the fact that it came out of ted i don 't think there 's any other way of getting instant feedback that way
