  's funny the things you forget i went to see my mother the other day  and she told me this story that i 'd completely forgotten about
 how when we were driving together she would pull the car over and by the time she had gotten out of the car and gone around the car to let me out of the car i
  would have already gotten out of the car and pretended to have died 
 because that 's how you die 
  was a game i used to play with myself to entertain myself whenever i was bored or frustrated 
 settle down 
 people say we live in an age of information overload right i don 't know about that but i just know that i get too many marketing emails 
 i got a marketing email from
 a supermarket firm which
 will remain nameless
  i got an email from them  and it went like this it said just three weeks until safemart at king 's cross opens and i resented this because
 not only do i not remember signing up to that  but i resent the fact that they appear to think that i should be excited
 about a shop opening
  so what i did was i scrolled down to the bottom of the email and i pressed unsubscribe and
 i thought that 'd be the end of it but a week later i got another one that said just two weeks
 until safemart at king 's cross opens and i thought obviously i haven 't clicked hard enough so i i tried it again right
  lo and behold a week passes you guessed it just one week
  and here 's the problem the internet gave us access to everything  
 but it also gave everything access to us
  it 's hard enough to discriminate between the things that genuinely matter in this world and the minutiae of life without having emails about supermarket chains and candy crush saga and
 i was really annoyed with them and i thought ok i was about to write a strongly
  guy called dan said hi james i 've asked a colleague to help me with your query
  what 's the plan dan  i 'm thinking fireworks bouncy castle
  but what was all the ' three weeks until ' ' two weeks until ' emails i was getting excited
  if we don 't use it we 're out a few hundred quid dan
  be there to make sure people take their shoes off i
 'll be honest  then my relationship with dan deteriorated somewhat because
  i got and i was just like this is
  must have wondered why there was no bouncy castle and then we were back to this 
 and that might have been the end of the story  but i remembered that anything everything
 even something as mundane as getting out of a car can be fun if you find the right game
 this is what i replied
  i set it up so every time it receives an email from safemart 
  just pings one back so i set it up and it says thanks for your email your case number is then it has a little formula that i wrote
 to up the case number every time  and i put it on the server
 and set it running
  a number of emails going back and forth 
 it gives me an immense sense of satisfaction to know that
 these computer programs are just going to be pinging one another for eternity and as legacies go
 don 't think that 's bad  
 so guys just remember if ever you feel weighed down by the
 the bureaucracy and often mundanity of modern life don 't fight the frustration 
 let it be the catalyst for whimsy
