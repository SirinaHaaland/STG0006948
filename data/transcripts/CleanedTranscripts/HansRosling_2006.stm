  about ten years ago  i took on the task to teach global development to swedish undergraduate students 
 that was after having spent about twenty years together with african institutions studying hunger in africa
  so i was sort of expected to know a little about the world  and
 i started in our medical university karolinska institute  an undergraduate course called global health  
 but when you get that opportunity you get a little nervous i thought these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in swedish college systems so i thought maybe they know everything i 'm going to teach them about 
 so i did a pre test
 when they came and one of the questions from which i learned a lot was this one which country has the highest
  child mortality of these five pairs 
 i put them together so that in each pair of country one has twice the child mortality of the other  and this means that
 it 's much bigger a difference than the uncertainty of the data  i won 't put you at a test here but it 's turkey which is highest there 
  and south africa and these were the results of the swedish students i did it so i got the confidence interval which is pretty narrow  and i got happy of course a
 one point eight right answer out of five possible that means that there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course 
 but one late night when i was compiling the report i really realized my discovery i have shown that swedish top students know statistically
  significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees 
 because the chimpanzee would score
 half right if i gave them two bananas with sri lanka and turkey they would be right half of the cases but the students are not there  the problem for me was not ignorance it was preconceived ideas i did also an
 unethical study of the professors of the karolinska institute that hands out the
  nobel prize in medicine and they are on par with the chimpanzee there laughter
 this is where i realized that there was really a need to communicate because the data of what 's happening in the world 
  and the child health of every country is very well aware  we did this software which displays it like this  every bubble here is a country 
 is china  this is india  the size of the bubble is the population  and on this axis here  i put fertility rate  
 because my students what they said when they looked upon the world and i asked them what do you really think about the world 
 well i first discovered that the textbook was tintin mainly 
  the world is still ' we ' and ' them ' and ' we ' is western world and ' them ' is third world 
 and what do you mean with western world i said well that 's long life and small family  and third world is short life and large family 
 so this is what i could display here  i put fertility rate here  number of children per woman one two three four up to about eight children per woman  we have very
  and sixty about on the size of families in all countries the error margin is narrow here i put life expectancy at birth from thirty years in some countries up to about seventy years and 
 one thousand nine hundred and sixty two there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries and they had small families and long lives and these were the developing countries they had large families and they had relatively
  what has happened since one thousand nine hundred and sixty two we want to see the change are the students right is it still two types of countries  or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here  
  or have they got longer lives and live up there  let 's see we stopped the world then this is all u n statistics that have been available here we go can you see there it 's china there moving against better 
  health there improving there  all the green latin american countries are moving towards smaller families  your yellow ones here are the arabic countries and they get
  longer life but not larger families the africans are the green here they still remain here  this is india indonesia is moving on pretty fast in the ' 80s here  you have bangladesh 
  still among the african countries  but now bangladesh it 's a miracle that happens in the ' 80s the imams start to promote family planning they move up into that corner and
  we have the terrible hiv epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the african countries and all the rest of them move up into the corner  where we have long lives and small family  and we have a completely new world
  states of america and vietnam
 america had small families and long life vietnam had large families and short lives and this is what happens the data during the war indicate
 that even with all the death there was an improvement of life expectancy by the end of the year the family planning started in vietnam they went for smaller families and the united states up
  there is getting for longer life keeping family size and in the ' 80s now  they give up
 communist planning and they go for market economy and it moves faster even than social life and today  we have in vietnam the same life expectancy and 
  the same family size here in vietnam two thousand and three as in united states one thousand nine hundred and seventy four by the end of the war
 if we don 't look in the data i think we all underestimate the tremendous change in asia  which was in social change before we saw the economical 
  change let 's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of the income  
  dollars or one hundred dollars per day  
 there 's no gap between rich and poor any longer  this is a myth  there 's a little hump here  
 but there are people all the way  and if we look where the income ends up
 this is one hundred percent the world 's annual income and the richest twenty percent they take out of that about
 and the poorest twenty percent  they take about two percent  and this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful 
 we think about aid like these people here giving aid to these people here  
 but in the middle  we have most of the world population  and they have now twenty four percent of the income we heard it in other forms  and who are
 these where are the different countries  i can show you africa  this is
 africa  ten % the world population most in poverty  this is oecd 
 the rich country the country club of the u n and they are over here on this side quite an overlap between africa and oecd and
  this is latin america it has everything on this earth from the poorest to the richest in latin america and on top of that we can put east europe  we can put east asia 
 and we put south asia and how did it look like if we go back in time to about one thousand nine hundred and seventy 
  move forward  you will see that while population increases  there are hundreds of millions in asia getting out of poverty and some others getting into poverty and this is the pattern we have today  and the best projection from the world bank is that this will happen  
 and we will not have a divided world we 'll have most people in the middle of course it 's a logarithmic scale
  our concept of economy is growth with percent we look upon it as a possibility of
 percentile increase if i change this  and take gdp per capita instead of family income  and i turn these
 individual data into regional data of gross domestic product  and i take the regions down here the size of the bubble is still the
  and you have the oecd there and you have sub saharan africa there  and we take off the arab states there  coming both from africa and from asia  and we put them separately  and we can 
  expand this axis  and i can give it a new dimension here  by adding
  of children survive to five years of age others only seventy  and here it seems there is a gap between oecd latin america  east europe  
 east asia arab states south asia and sub saharan africa  the linearity is very strong between child survival and money but let me split sub saharan africa
  health is there and
 better
 health is up there  i can go here  and i can split
 sub saharan africa into its countries and when it burst the size of its country bubble is the size of the population sierra leone down there  mauritius is up there  mauritius 
  was the first country to get away with trade barriers and they could sell their sugar they could sell their textiles on equal terms as the people in europe and north america  there 's a huge difference between africa and ghana is here in the middle
  sierra leone humanitarian aid here in
 uganda  development aid here time to invest there you can go for a holiday  it 's a tremendous variation within africa which we rarely often make
 i can split south asia here  india 's the big bubble in the middle  but a huge difference between afghanistan and sri lanka i can split arab states
  how are they same climate  same culture same religion huge difference even between neighbors yemen civil war united arab emirates money  which was quite 
 equally and well used not as the myth is and that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country 
  the difference here  cambodia  singapore the differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data  east europe  
 soviet economy for a long time but they come out after ten years very very differently and there is latin america  
 today we don 't have to go to cuba to find a healthy country in latin america chile will have a lower child mortality than cuba within some few years from now
  here we have high income countries in the oecd and we get the whole pattern here of the world  which is more or less like like this  and
 if we look at it how the world looks 
 in one thousand nine hundred and sixty  it starts to move this is mao tse tung he brought health to china  and then
  and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and brought them into the mainstream again  and we have seen how countries move in different directions like this  so it 's sort of sort of difficult to get an
 example country which shows the pattern of the world  but i would like to bring you back to about here
  korea which is this one  with brazil which is this one  
 the label went away for me here  and i would like to compare uganda  which is there
  and i can run it forward like this  
 and you can see how
 south korea is making a very very fast advancement whereas brazil
  is much slower  and if we move back again here  and we put on trails on them like this  you can see again that
 the speed of development is very very different 
 and the countries are moving more or less in the same rate as money
  and health but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first and
 to show that you can put on the way of united arab emirates they came from here  
 a mineral country  they cached all the oil they got all the money  but health cannot be bought at the supermarket
  you have to invest in health you have to get kids into schooling you have to train health staff  you have to educate the population  and sheikh zayed did that in a fairly good way in spite of falling oil prices  he brought
  this country up here  so we 've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world where all countries tend to use their money better than they used in the past 
 now this is more or less
 if you look at the average data of the countries
 they are like this  now that 's dangerous to use average data  because there is such a lot of
  difference within countries  so if i go and look here we can see that uganda
 today is where south korea was in one thousand nine hundred and sixty if i split uganda  there 's quite a difference within uganda these are the quintiles of uganda the richest twenty percent of ugandans are there  the poorest are down there
  if i split south africa it 's like this  and if i go down and look at
 niger where there was such a terrible famine lastly it
 's like this  the twenty percent poorest of niger is out here  and the twenty percent richest of south africa is there and yet we tend to discuss on what solutions there should be in africa  everything in this world exists in africa 
 and you can 't discuss universal access to hiv [ medicine ] for that quintile up here with the same strategy
 as down here  the improvement of the world must be highly contextualized  and it 's not relevant to have it on regional level we must be much more detailed  
 we find that students get very excited when they can use this and even more policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see see how
  why doesn 't this take place why are we not using the data we have we have data in the united nations in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other 
  because the data is hidden down in the databases  and the public is there and the internet is there  but we have still not used it effectively all that information we saw changing in the world does not include
  some web pages like this you know but they take some
 nourishment down from the databases but people put prices on them stupid passwords and boring statistics and this won 't work 
 so what is needed we have the databases it 's not the new database you need we have wonderful design tools and more and more are added up here  
 so we started a nonprofit venture
 which
 linking data to design we called gapminder from the london underground where they warn you mind the gap so we thought gapminder was appropriate  and we started to write software which could link the data like this
  and it wasn 't that difficult it took some person years  and we have produced animations you can take a data set and put
  some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world  but what we really need is of course a search function 
 a search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world 
 and what do we hear when we go around i 've done anthropology on the main statistical units  
 everyone says it 's impossible  
 this can 't be done our information is so peculiar in detail
  that cannot be searched as others can be searched we cannot give the data free to the students free to the entrepreneurs of the world 
 but this is what we would like to see isn 't it 
 data is down here  and we would like flowers to grow out on the net  and one of the crucial points is to make them searchable  and then people can use the different design tool to animate it there  and i have
  good news for you i
 have good news that the present new head of u n statistics he doesn 't say it 's impossible he only says we can 't do it 
 and that 's a quite clever guy huh 
 so we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years we will be able to look at income distributions in completely
  new ways
  this is the income distribution of china one thousand nine hundred and seventy  this is the income distribution of the united states one thousand nine hundred and seventy 
 almost no overlap and what has happened what has happened is this that china is growing it 's not so equal any longer
  and it 's appearing here  overlooking the united states  almost like a ghost isn 't it it 's
 pretty scary 
 but i think it 's very important to have have all this information we need really to see it and
 instead of looking at this i would like to end up by showing the internet users per one thousand
  software we access about five hundred variables from all the countries quite easily it takes some time to to change for this but on the axises you 
  can quite easily get any variable you would like to have and the thing would be to get up the databases free to get them searchable and with a second click to get them into the graphic formats where you can instantly
 understand them now statisticians don 't like it  because they say that this will not
 show the the reality we have to have statistical analytical methods but this is 
 i end now with the world  there the internet is
  the number of internet users are going up like this  this is the gdp per capita and it 's a new technology coming in but then amazingly how well it fits to 
  the economy of the countries  that 's why the $ one hundred computer will be so important but it 's a
