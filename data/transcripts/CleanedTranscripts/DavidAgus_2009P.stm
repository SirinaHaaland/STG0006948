  i 'm a cancer doctor and i walked out of my office and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital
 three or four years ago  and this was the cover of fortune magazine sitting in the window of the pharmacy  
 and so as a cancer doctor you look at this and you get a little bit downhearted
 but when you start to read the article by
  cliff who himself is a cancer survivor who was saved by a clinical trial where his parents drove him from new york city to upstate new york to get an
 experimental therapy for at the time hodgkin 's disease which saved his life he makes remarkable points here  
 and the point of the article was that we have gotten reductionist in our view of biology in our view of cancer
  the last fifty years we have focused on treating the individual gene in understanding cancer not in controlling cancer  
 so this is an astounding table  and this is something that sobers us in our field everyday in that obviously we 've made remarkable impacts on cardiovascular disease 
  but look at cancer  the death rate in cancer in over fifty years hasn 't changed  
  wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia where we have a pill that can put one hundred percent of people in remission  
 but in general we haven 't made an impact at all in the war on cancer  
 so what i 'm going to tell you today is a little bit of why i think that 's the case  and then go out of my comfort zone
 and tell you where i think it 's going where a new approach
 that we hope to
 to push forward in terms of treating cancer  because this is wrong 
 so what is cancer first of all well  if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value you go to a doctor  they stick a needle in they way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern
  does it look normal  
 does it look abnormal so that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle  this is a normal cell
  this is a cancer cell that is the state of the art today in diagnosing cancer  
 there 's no molecular test  there 's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday  there 's no fancy looking at the chromosomes this
  and how we do it
  you know  i know very well  
 as a cancer doctor  i can 't treat advanced cancer  
 so  as an aside  i firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early  
 it is the only way you can start to fight cancer is by catching it early  
 we can prevent most cancers you know the previous talk alluded to
 preventing heart disease we could do the same in cancer
  company called navigenics where if you spit into a tube and we can look look at thirty five or forty genetic
 markers for disease  all of which are delayable in many of the cancers you start to identify
 what you could get and then we can start to work to prevent them  
 because the problem is when you have advanced cancer we can 't do that much today about it as the statistics allude to
  so the thing about cancer is is that it 's a disease of the aged  
 why is it a disease of the aged  because evolution doesn 't care about us after we 've had our children see
 evolution protected us
 during our childbearing years and then after age thirty five or forty or forty five it said it doesn 't matter
  because they 've had their progeny so if you look at cancers it is very rare extremely rare to have cancer in a child 
 on the order of thousands of cases a year as one gets older very very common  
 why is it hard to treat because it 's heterogeneous  and that 's the perfect
 substrate for evolution within the cancer
  it starts to select out for those bad aggressive cells what we call clonal selection  
 but if we start to understand that cancer isn 't just a molecular defect it 's something more then we 'll get 
 to new ways of treating it  as i 'll show you so one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer is that right now we describe it by a number of adjectives
  you then have some anatomic descriptions you get that ct scan there 's a three centimeter mass in the liver 
 you then have some body part descriptions it 's in the liver in the breast in the prostate and that 's about it so our dictionary for describing 
  cancer is very very poor  it 's basically symptoms it 's manifestations of a disease  
  has spent four hundred million dollars  and they 've
 allocated another billion dollars to what we call the cancer genome atlas project 
 so it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer and giving us a new lexicon 
 a new dictionary to describe it  you know in the  mid 1850 's in france  they started to describe cancer by body part 
 that hasn 't changed in over one hundred and fifty
  years  
 it is absolutely archaic that we call cancer by prostate by breast 
 by muscle it makes no sense  if you think about it  
 so  obviously  the technology is here today and over the next several years that will change you will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic  
  and they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions that were involved in causing this individual cancer  so hopefully we will go from being the art of medicine
 more to the science of medicine and be able to do what they do in infectious disease  which is look at that organism  that bacteria  and then say this antibiotic makes sense because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it 
 when one is
  exposed to
 you take tamiflu and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease why  
 because we know what you have and we know how to treat it
 although we can 't make vaccine in this country but that 's a different story  the cancer genome atlas
  is coming out now the first cancer was was done which was brain cancer 
 in the next month the end of december  you 'll see ovarian cancer and then lung cancer will come several months after 
 there 's also a field of proteomics that i 'll talk about in a few minutes which i think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease  
 but remember i 'm not pushing
  to be a reductionist 
 i 'm doing it so we can identify what we 're up against  and there 's a very important distinction there that we 'll get to 
 in health care today  we spend most of the dollars in terms of treating disease
 most of the dollars in the last two years of a person 's life  we spend very little if any dollars in terms of identifying what we 're up against  
 if you could start to move that to identify what you 're up against
  to do things a hell of a lot better  
 if we could even take it one step further and prevent disease  we can take it enormously the other direction and obviously that 's where we need to go going forward 
 so this is the website of the national cancer institute  
 and i 'm here to tell you it 's wrong  
 so the website of the national cancer institute says that cancer is a genetic disease
  the website says if you look there 's an individual mutation and maybe a second and maybe a third  and that is cancer 
 but as a cancer doc  this is what i see this isn 't a genetic disease  
 so  there you see  it 's a liver with colon cancer in it and you see into the microscope a lymph node where cancer has invaded you see a ct scan
 where cancer is in the liver
  cancer is an interaction of a cell
 that no longer is under growth control with the environment  
 it 's not in the abstract  it 's the interaction with the environment  it 's what we call a system  
 the goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer and i think that 's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades 
 is that we have strived to understand cancer
 the goal is to control cancer and
 that is a very different optimization scheme a very different strategy for all of us 
 i got up at the american association of cancer research one of the big cancer research meetings with twenty thousand people there 
 and i said we 've made a mistake
  we 've all made a mistake myself included by focusing down by being a reductionist we need to take a step back and believe it or not there were hisses in the audience
 people got upset but this is the only way we 're going to go forward you know i was very fortunate to meet
 danny hillis a few years ago  we were pushed together  and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other 
 i said do i really want to meet a guy from disney who designed computers and he was saying does he really want to meet another doctor  
 but people prevailed on us and we got together and it 's been transformative in what i do
  absolutely transformative 
 we have designed and we have worked on the modeling and much of these ideas came from danny and from his team the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system 
 and i 'll show you some data there where i really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it  
 the key is
  when you look at these variables and you look at this data you have to understand the data inputs you know if i measured your temperature
 over thirty days  and i asked what was the average temperature and it came back at ninety eight point seven  i would say great 
 but if during one of those days your temperature spiked to one hundred and two for six hours and you took tylenol and got better etc i would totally miss it  
 so one of the problems the fundamental problems in medicine is that you
  and i and all of us we go to our doctor once a year  we have discrete data elements we don 't have a time function on them 
 earlier it was referred to this direct life device  
 you know  i 've been using it for two and a half months it 's a staggering device not because it tells me how many kilocalories i do every day  but because it looks over
  what i 've done in a day  and i didn 't realize that for three hours i 'm sitting at my desk and i 'm not moving at all 
 and a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here
 are really
 different than we understand them because we 're not measuring them dynamically  and so  if you think of cancer
 as a system  there 's an input and an output and a state
  are equivalent classes of history  and the cancer patient the input is the environment  the diet  the treatment  the genetic mutations 
 the output are our symptoms 
 do we have pain is the cancer growing do we feel bloated  etc most of that state
 is hidden so what we do in our field is we change and input we give
  did that output get better did that pain improve  etc 
 and so  the problem is that it 's not just one system  it 's multiple systems on multiple scales  it 's a system of systems  
 and so when you start to look at emergent systems you can look at a neuron under a microscope a neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here  
 but when you start to put them together in a complex
  system and you start to see that it becomes a brain  and that brain can create intelligence 
 what we 're talking about in the body and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system  
 well  the bad news is that these robust and robust is a key word emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail  
 the good news is you can manipulate them 
 you can try to control them without
 that fundamental understanding of every component 
 one of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer came out in february in the new england journal of medicine  
 where they took women who were  pre menopausal with breast cancer so about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get 
 they had gotten their chemotherapy  and then they randomized them where half got placebo and half got a drug called zoledronic acid that
  builds bone  it 's used to treat osteoporosis and they got that twice a year  
 they looked and in these one thousand eight hundred women given twice a year a drug that builds bone you reduce the recurrence of cancer by 
  of cancer by a drug that doesn 't even touch the cancer  so the notion you change the soil
 the seed doesn 't grow as well  you change that system  
 and you could have a marked effect on the cancer  
 nobody has ever shown and this will be shocking nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy actually touches a cancer cell  
 it 's never been shown there 's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes that if you give this cancer drug you can do this effect to the cell  but the doses
 in those dishes are nowhere near the doses that happen in the body  
 if i give a woman with breast cancer a drug called taxol every three weeks which is the standard 
 about forty percent of women with metastatic cancer have a great response to that drug 
 and a response is fifty percent shrinkage well remember that 's not even an order of magnitude but that 's a different
  i give them that same drug every week 
 another thirty percent will respond  they then recur  i give them that same drug over ninety six hours by continuous infusion 
 another twenty or thirty percent will respond 
 so you can 't tell me it 's working by the same mechanism in all three size  it 's not we have no idea the mechanism 
 so the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting that complex system
  like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence chemotherapy may work by that same exact way the wild thing about that trial
 also was that it reduced new primaries so new cancers by thirty percent also  
 so  the problem is yours and mine all of our systems are changing
  they 're dynamic  i mean this is a scary slide not to take an aside  but it looks at obesity in the world and i 'm sorry if you can 't read the numbers they 're kind of small  but if you 
  start to look at it that red that dark color there more than seventy five percent of the population of those countries are obese 
 look a decade
  look two decades ago  markedly different 
 so our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago  so the diseases we have today  
 which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades are going to change
 dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this 
  of the whole proteome so this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet  and
 we 're able to get resolution where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body we can start to see that system  
 each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified the power of these magnets the power of what we can do here is that we
  see an individual neutron
 with this technology so 
 again this is stuff we 're doing with danny hillis and a group called applied proteomics  where we can start to see individual neutron differences  and we can start to look at 
  that system like we never have before so instead of a reductionist view we 're taking a step back 
  who had recurrent
 lung cancer  it was in her brain in her lungs in her liver  she had gotten carboplatin taxol carboplatin taxotere
 every drug we have she had gotten and that disease continued to grow she had three kids under the age of twelve 
 and this is her ct scan and so what this is
  taking a cross section of her body here  and you can see in the
 middle there is her heart and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will invade and will kill her untreated in a matter of weeks 
 she goes on a pill a day
 that targets a pathway 
  and again i 'm not sure if this pathway was in the system in the cancer but it targeted a pathway  and a month later pow that cancer 's gone 
 six months later it 's still gone  
 that cancer recurred and she passed away three years later from lung cancer  but she got three years
 from a drug whose symptoms predominately were acne that
  is that the clinical trial was done  and we were a part of it 
 and in the fundamental clinical trial the pivotal clinical trial we call the phase three we refused to use a placebo  
 would you want your mother your brother your sister to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live 
 and the answer obviously is not so it was done on this group of patients ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here 
 the drug went to the fda and the fda said without a placebo  how do i know patients actually benefited from the drug 
 so the morning the fda was going to meet this was the
 editorial in the wall street journal and so what do you know that drug was approved
  the amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial where they gave half placebo and half the drug and we learned something important there what 's interesting is they did it in south america and canada where it 's more ethical to give placebos 
 they had to give it also in the u s to get approval so i think there were three u s patients in upstate new york who were part of the trial but they did that and what they found is that seventy percent
  lived much longer and did better
 than people who got placebo 
 so it challenged everything we knew in cancer is that you don 't need to get a response you don 't need to shrink the disease  if we slow the disease  
 we may have more of a benefit on patient survival patient outcome how they feel than if we shrink the disease  the problem is that if
 i 'm this doc and i get your ct scan today and you 've got a two centimeter mass in your liver and you come back to me in three months and it 's three centimeters  
 did that drug help you or not 
 how do i know  would it have been ten centimeters  or am i giving you a drug with no benefit and significant cost  
 so  it 's a fundamental problem and again  that 's where these new technologies
 can come in  and so the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor 's office
  well  the ultimate goal is is that you prevent disease  
 right the ultimate goal is is that you prevent any of these things from happening that is the most effective
 cost effective best way we can do things today  
 but if one is unfortunate to get a disease you 'll go into your doctor 's office he or she will take a drop of blood and we will start to know how to treat your disease  
 the way
 we 've approached
  it is the field of proteomics again this looking at the system  it 's taking a big picture  the problem with technologies like this
 is that if one looks at proteins in the body  there are eleven orders of magnitude difference between the  high abundant and the low abundant proteins  
 so there 's no technology in the world that can span eleven orders of
  and so a lot of what has been done with people like danny hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles try to bring the software we can start to look at different components along this spectrum  
 and so  earlier was talked about cross discipline 
 about collaboration  and i think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now is that people from those fields are coming in yesterday the national cancer institute announced a new program
  sciences and oncology where physicists  mathematicians are brought in to think about cancer people who never approached it before 
 danny and i got sixteen million dollars they announced yesterday to try to attach this problem 
 a whole new approach  instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy by
  to try to bring technology to get a picture of what 's actually happening
 in the body  
 so  just for two seconds how these technologies work because i think it 's important to understand it
  what happens is every protein in your body is charged  so the proteins are sprayed in the magnet spins them around  and then there 's a detector at the end when it hit that detector is dependent on the mass
  and so we can accurately if the magnet is big enough and your resolution is high enough you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding
 of the individual system  and so as a cancer doctor  instead of having paper
 in my chart in your chart and it being this thick  this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices  
 where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data electronic data elements are
  describing every aspect of the disease and certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter
 and actually move forward  
 instead of just having encounter and encounter  without fundamental learning so to conclude  
 we need to get away from reductionist thinking  we need to start to think differently
 and radically and so i implore everyone here
  here think differently come up with new ideas tell them to me or anyone else in our field 
 because over the last fifty nine years  nothing has changed  we need a radically different approach  you know andy grove stepped down as chairman of the board at intel
 and andy was one of my mentors
  tough individual when andy stepped down he said no technology will win technology itself will win and i 'm a firm believer in the field of medicine
  and especially cancer that it 's going to be a broad platform of technologies that will help us move forward and hopefully help patients in the
