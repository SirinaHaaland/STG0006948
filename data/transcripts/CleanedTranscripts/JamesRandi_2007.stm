  see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces i 
  very peculiar background attitude and
  to the real world
 because i am a conjurer now i prefer that term over magician because if i were a magician that would mean
 that i use spells and incantations and weird gestures
 in order to accomplish real magic no i don 't do that i 'm a conjurer who is someone who pretends to be a real magician 
  how do we go about that sort of thing
 we depend on the fact that audiences such as yourselves will make assumptions for example when i walked up here and i took the microphone
 from the stand and switched it on you assumed this was a microphone which it is not 
 as a matter of fact this is something that about half of you more than half of you will not be familiar with it 's a
  makes a very bad microphone i 've tried it many times 
 the other assumption that you made and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions not only that you can but that you will when they are properly suggested to you 
 you believe i 'm looking at you  
 wrong  i 'm not looking at you i can 't see you  i know you 're out there they told me backstage it 's a full house and such i know you 're there because i can hear you  but i can 't see you because i normally wear glasses these are not glasses
  these are empty frames 
 quite empty frames now why would a grown man appear before you wearing empty frames on his face 
 to fool you ladies and gentlemen to deceive you to show that you too can make assumptions  don 't you ever forget that 
 now i have to do something first of all switch to real glasses so i can actually see you which would probably be a convenience i don 't know i haven 't had a good look well
  that great a convenience 
 i have to do something now which seems a little bit strange for a magician  but i 'm going to take some medication this is
 a full bottle of calms forte i 'll explain that in just a moment  ignore the instructions that 's what the government has to put in there
  a moment i must tell you that i am an actor i 'm an actor who plays a specific part i play the part of a magician
  wizard if you will a real wizard if someone were to appear on this stage in front of me and actually claim to be
 an ancient prince of denmark named hamlet you would be insulted
 and rightly so why would a man assume that you would believe something bizarre like this but there exists out there
 a very large population of people who will tell you
  that they have psychic  magical powers that they can predict the future that they can make contact with with the deceased  oh they also say
 they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods oh
 they gladly sell you that  yes  and they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems  they claim to be psychics or sensitives whatever they can
  thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead 
 now to my innocent mind dead implies
 incapable of communicating 
 you might agree with me on that  but these people  they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead
 but they can hear the dead as well and they can relay this information back to the living 
 i wonder if that 's true  
 i don 't think so because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do exactly the same the same
 physical methods the same psychological methods
 and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people
 around the earth to their detriment  they deceive these people costs them a lot of money cost them a lot of emotional anguish  
 billions of dollars are spent every year all over the globe on these charlatans  
 now  i have two questions i would like to ask these people if i had the opportunity to do
  first question if i want to ask them to call up because they do hear them through the ear they listen to the spirits like this
 i 'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because when she died she had the family will and she secreted it someplace we don 't know where it is so we ask granny where is the will 
 granny what does granny say  she says i 'm in heaven and it 's wonderful i 'm here with all my old friends my deceased friends and my family and all the puppy dogs and the the kittens that i used to have when i was a little girl  and i love you
  always be with you good bye 
 and she didn 't answer the damn question  
 where is the will 
 now she could easily have said oh it 's in the library on the second shelf behind the encyclopedia but she doesn 't say that  no she doesn 't she doesn 't bring any useful information to us  we paid a lot of money for that information be we didn 't get it 
 the second question that i 'd like to ask rather simple
  i ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased  father in law as an example  why do they insist on saying remember they speak into this ear
 why do they say my name starts with j or m 
 is this a hunting game hunting and fishing what is it is it twenty questions no it 's more like one hundred and
  game that these people play  and they take advantage of the innocent the naive the grieving  the needy people out there 
 now this is a process
 that is called cold reading 
 there 's one fellow out there  van praagh is his name james van praagh he 's one of the
  practitioners of this sort of thing  john edward sylvia browne and rosemary altea they are other operators there are hundreds of them all over the earth  but in this country james 
  van praagh is very big and what does he do  he likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased  
  very often is like this he says he tells me  he tells me before he passed  
 that he had trouble breathing folks  that 's what dying is all about 
 you stop breathing and then you 're dead
 it 's that simple and that 's the kind of information they 're going to bring back to you  i don 't think so now these people will make guesses they 'll say things like why am i getting electricity
  it was a game of hunting questions like this this is what they go through now 
 folks often ask us at the james randi educational foundation they call me they say why are you so concerned about this mr randi isn 't it just a lot of fun no it is not fun  it is a cruel farce  
 now  it may bring a
 certain amount of comfort 
 but that comfort lasts only about twenty minutes or so and then the people look in the mirror and they say  i just paid a lot of money for that reading  and what did she say to me ' i love 
  you ' they always say that they don 't get any information they don 't get any value for what they spend  now  sylvia browne is the big operator we call her the talons 
  browne just to show you
 she actually gets seven hundred dollars for a twenty minute reading over the telephone she doesn 't even go there in person  and you have to wait up to two years because she 
  's booked ahead that amount of time  you pay by credit card or whatever  and then she
  now  
 montel williams is an intelligent man  we all know who he is on television he
 's well educated  he 's smart  he knows what sylvia browne is doing but he doesn 't give a damn 
 he just doesn 't care 
 because the bottom line is the sponsors love it  and he will expose her to television publicity all the time now what does sylvia browne
  give you for that seven hundred dollars she gives you the names of your guardian angels that 's first  now  without that how could we possibly function 
 she gives you the names of previous lives who you were in previous lives duh it turns out that the women
 that she gives readings for were all babylonian
  the men were all grecian warriors fighting with agamemnon  nothing is ever said about
 a fourteen year old bootblack in the streets of london who died of consumption he isn 't worth bringing back obviously and the strange thing folks you may have noticed this too  you see these folks on television
 they never call anybody back from hell
  everyone comes back from heaven but never from hell  if they call back any of my friends they 're not going to well  you see the story 
 now  sylvia browne is an exception 
 an exception in one way because the james randi educational foundation my foundation offers a one million dollar prize
 in negotiable bonds very simply won all you have to do is prove any paranormal occult or supernatural event or power of any kind under proper observing conditions
  's very easy win the million dollars sylvia browne is an exception in that she 's the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge
  she did this on the larry king live show on cnn six and a half years ago  and we haven 't heard from her since 
  she said that first of all that she didn 't know how to contact me duh a professional psychic who speaks to dead people she can 't reach me 
 i 'm alive you may have noticed 
 well pretty well anyway  she couldn 't reach me now she says she doesn 't want to reach me
 because i 'm a godless person all the more reason to take the million dollars wouldn 't you think sylvia now these people need to be stopped
  seriously now they need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce  we get people coming to the foundation all the time  
 they 're ruined financially and emotionally because they 've given their money and their faith to these people 
 now i popped some pills earlier  i have to explain that to you  
 homeopathy  let 's find out what that 's all about
  it 's an alternative form of healing right homeopathy actually consists and that 's what this is this is
 calms forte thirty two caplets of sleeping pills i forgot to tell you that i just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills 
 six and a half days that certainly is a fatal dose it says right on the back
  case of overdose contact your poison control center immediately and it gives an eight hundred number  keep your seats it 's going to be okay  i don 't really need it
 because i 've been doing this stunt for audiences all over the world
 for the last eight or ten years taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills  why don 't they affect me
  homeopathy  it 's taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond avogadro 's limit diluting it down to the point where there 's none of it left 
 now folks this is not just a metaphor i 'm going to give you now  it 's true  it 's exactly equivalent to taking one
  of lake tahoe  and then stirring it up obviously with a very big stick  
 and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous 
 then when you get a headache  you take a sip of this water and voila  it is gone laughter
 now that is true  that is what homeopathy is all about and another claim that they make you 'll love this one the more dilute the medicine is they say
  more powerful it is 
 now wait a minute we heard about a guy in florida the poor man  he was on homeopathic medicine he died of an overdose  he forgot to take his pill 
 work on it work on it 
 it 's a ridiculous thing it is absolutely ridiculous  i don 't know what we 're doing believing in all this nonsense over all these years
  now  let me tell you the james randi educational foundation
 is waving this very big carrot  
 but i must say  the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer doesn 't mean that the powers don 't exist  
 they might some place out there 
 maybe these people are just independently wealthy well with sylvia
  seven hundred dollars for a twenty minute reading over the telephone
 that 's more than lawyers make 
 i mean that 's a fabulous amount of money these people don 't need the million dollars perhaps  but wouldn 't you think they 'd like to take it just to make me look silly 
 just to get rid of this godless person out there that sylvia browne talks about all the time  i think that something needs to be done about
  we really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal state and local authorities to get them to do something 
 if you find out now i understand  we 've seen people even today speaking to us about aids epidemics and and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with those are very important 
 critically important to us and we must do something about those problems  but at the same time
 as arthur c clarke said the rotting of the human mind  
 the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult and the supernatural all of this total nonsense this medieval thinking i think something should be done about that  and it all lies in education 
 largely  it 's the media
 who are to blame for
  they shamelessly promote all kinds of nonsense of this sort because it pleases the sponsors  it 's the bottom line  the dollar line  that 's what they 're looking at 
 we really must do something about this i 'm willing to take your suggestions and i 'm willing to have you tune in to our webpage  
 it 's
 go in there and look at the archives and you will begin to understand much more of what i 've been talking
 you will see the records that we have there 's nothing like sitting in that library and having a family appear there and say that mum gave away all the family fortune she cashed in the cds  she gave away the stocks and the certificates  
 that 's really sad to hear and it hasn 't helped them one bit  hasn 't solved any of their problems  yes there could be a rotting of the american mind and of
  minds all the way around the earth  if we don 't start to think sensibly about these things  
 now  we 've offered this carrot as i say we 've dangled the carrot  we 're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it oh we get lots of them hundreds of them every year come by 
 these are dowsers and people who think that they can talk to the dead as well but they 're amateurs  they don 't know how to evaluate their own
  professionals never come near us  except in that case of sylvia browne
 that i told you about a moment ago  she did accept and then backed away  ladies and gentlemen
  i 'm james randi  
 and i 'm waiting
