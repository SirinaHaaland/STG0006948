  in an age of
 global strife and climate change  i 'm here to answer the all important question why is sex so damn good if
 you 're laughing you know what i mean now before we get
  let me tell you about chris hosmer chris is a great friend of mine from my university days but secretly  i hate him here
 's why back in university we had a quick project to design some solar powered clocks here 's my clock 
 it uses something called the dwarf sunflower which grows to about twelve inches in height now as you know  sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day  so in
  you see which direction the sunflower is facing and you mark it on the blank area in the base at noon you mark the changed position of the sunflower  and in the evening again and that 's your clock 
 now i know my clock doesn 't tell you the exact time  but it does give you a general idea using a flower so in my completely unbiased subjective opinion it 's brilliant
  however  here 's chris 's clock
  it 's five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one in each shot glass is a different scented oil 
 in the morning the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass  focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath 
 this will warm up the scented oil inside and a particular smell will be emitted a
 couple of hours later the sun will shine on the next magnifying glass  and a different smell will be emitted  so during the course of the day
 five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment  anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell 
 you can see why i hate chris i thought my idea was pretty good but his idea is genius  
 and at the time i knew his idea was better than mine but i just couldn 't explain why one thing you have to know about me is i hate to lose  
 this problem 's been bugging me for well over a decade all
 right let 's get back to the question of why sex
  is so good  many years after the solar powered clocks project 
 a young lady i knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses  and when she said this i had an epiphany  
 so i decided to evaluate different experiences i had in my life from the point of view of the five senses  
 to do this  i devised something called the five senses graph 
 along the y axis you have a scale from zero
  to ten  and along the x axis you have of course  the five senses  
 anytime i had a memorable experience in my life  i would record it on this graph like a five senses diary here
 's a quick video to show you how it works
  and that 's how the five senses graph works now for a period of three years i gathered data  not just me but also some of my friends 
  i used to teach in university so i forced my i mean i asked my students to do this as well so here are some other results 
 the first is for instant noodles now obviously taste and smell are quite high  but
 notice sound is at three 
 many people told me a big part of the noodle eating experience is the slurping noise  you know needless to say i no longer dine with these people
 here what i found interesting was that taste is at four and many respondents told me
 it 's because of the taste of drinks but also in some cases kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience these people i still do hang out with all right 
 and smoking  here i found touch is at [ six ] and one of the reasons is that
  smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bringing it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience which shows it 's kind of scary to think
 how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers ok 
 now what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph it would of course be a horizontal
  along the top now you can see not even as intense an experience as riding a motorbike comes close in fact  
 in the years that i gathered data only one experience came close to being the perfect one that is of course sex 
 great sex respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level here
 i 'll quote one of my students who said sex is so good  it 's good even when it 's bad 
 so the five senses theory does
  help explain why sex is so good  
 now in the middle of all this five senses work  
 i suddenly remembered the solar powered clocks project from my youth and i realized this theory also explains why chris 's clock is so much better than mine  
 you see my clock only focuses on sight  and a little bit of touch  
 here 's chris 's clock 
 it 's the first clock ever that uses
  smell to tell the time in fact in terms of the five senses  chris 's clock is a revolution  
 and that 's what this theory taught me about my field you see up till now us designers we 've mainly focused on making things look very pretty  and a little bit of touch  which means we 've ignored the other three senses 
 chris 's clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product
 so what if we started using the five senses theory in all of our designs  here 's three quick ideas i came up with 
 this is an iron you know 
 for your clothes to which i added a spraying mechanism so you fill up the vial with your favorite scent and your clothes will smell nicer but hopefully it should also make the ironing
  so i brush my teeth twice a day  and what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy  
 and when the taste of candy ran out you 'd know it 's time to change your toothbrush 
 finally  i have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet it
 's not just the way they look but i love the way they feel when you press down on them  now  i don 't play the flute or the
  clarinet  so i decided to combine these keys with an instrument i do play the television remote control 
 now when we look at these three ideas together you 'll notice that the five senses theory doesn 't only change the way we use these products but also the way they look  
 so in conclusion i 've found the five senses theory to be a very useful
  tool in evaluating different experiences in my life and then taking those best experiences and hopefully incorporating them into my designs  
 now  i realize the five senses isn 't the only thing that makes life interesting 
 there 's also the six emotions and that elusive x factor 
 maybe that could be the topic of my next talk  until then
  please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs oh one last thing before i leave  
 here 's the experience you all had while listening to the ted talks however it would be better if we could boost up a couple of the other senses like smell and taste 
 and the best way to do that is with
 free candy  you guys ready
