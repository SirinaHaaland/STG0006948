  a confession to make  
 i 'm a business professor whose ambition has been to help people learn to lead 
 but recently i 've discovered that what many of us think of as great leadership does not work when it comes to leading innovation  
  i 'm an ethnographer i use the methods of anthropology to understand the questions in which i 'm interested  so along with 
 i spent nearly a decade observing up close and personal exceptional leaders of innovation 
 we studied sixteen men and women  located in seven countries across the globe working in twelve different industries 
 in total we spent hundreds of hours on the ground 
  watching these leaders in action  we ended up with pages and pages and pages of field notes that we analyzed and looked for patterns in what our leaders did 
 the bottom line if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again  we must unlearn our conventional notions of leadership 
 leading innovation is not about creating a vision  and inspiring others to execute it but
 what do we
  innovation is anything that is both new and useful
 it can be a product or service it can be a process or a way of organizing  it can be incremental or it can be breakthrough  we have a pretty inclusive definition 
 how many of you recognize this man put your hands up
 keep your hands up if you know who this is
  from your show of hands it looks like many of you have seen a pixar movie but very few of you recognized ed catmull 
 the founder and ceo of pixar one of the companies i had the privilege of studying 
 my first visit to pixar was in two thousand and five when they were working on ratatouille that provocative movie about a rat
  movies are really mainstream today  but it took ed and his colleagues nearly twenty years to create the first
  movie in the twenty years hence they 've produced fourteen movies  i was recently at pixar and i 'm here to tell you that number fifteen is sure to be a winner
  when many of us think about innovation though we think about an einstein having an ' aha
  but we all know that 's a myth innovation is not about solo genius  it 's about collective genius
 let 's think for a minute about what it takes to make a pixar movie 
 no solo genius  no flash of inspiration produces one of those movies 
 on the contrary it takes about two hundred and fifty people four to five years to make one of those
  to help us understand the process an individual in the studio drew a version of this picture 
 he did so reluctantly  because it suggested that the process was a neat series of steps done by discrete groups 
 even with all those arrows he thought it failed to really tell you just how iterative interrelated and frankly messy their process was 
 throughout the making of a movie at pixar  the story evolves
  so think about it  some shots go through quickly  
 they don 't all go through in order  it depends on how vexing the challenges are that they come up with when they are working on a particular scene 
 so if you think about that scene in up where the boy hands the piece of chocolate to the bird 
 that ten seconds took one animator almost six months to perfect
  the other thing about a pixar movie is that no part of the movie is considered finished until the entire movie wraps
 partway through one production an animator drew a character with an arched eyebrow that suggested a mischievous side 
 when the director saw that drawing he thought it was great it was beautiful but he said you 've got to lose it it
  weeks later the director came back and said let 's put in those few seconds of film 
 because that animator was allowed to share what we referred to as his slice of genius  
 he was able to help that director reconceive the character in a subtle but important way that really improved the story
 what we know is at the heart of innovation is a paradox 
 you have to unleash the talents and passions of many people and you have to harness
  them into a work that is actually useful 
 innovation is a journey  
 it 's a type of collaborative problem solving  usually among people who have different expertise and different points of view  
 innovations rarely get created full blown 
 as many of you know they 're the result usually of trial and error  lots of false starts  missteps and mistakes
 innovative work can be very exhilarating  but it also can be really downright scary  
 so when we look at why it is that pixar is able to do what it does  we have to ask ourselves 
 what 's going on here 
 for sure  history and certainly hollywood is full of star studded teams that have failed
  most of those failures are attributed to too many stars or too many cooks if you will in the kitchen 
 so why is it that pixar with all of its cooks is able to be so successful time and time again  
 when we studied an islamic bank in dubai  or a luxury brand in korea
  or a social enterprise in africa we found that innovative organizations are communities that have three capabilities  
 creative abrasion creative agility and creative resolution  
 creative abrasion is about being able to create a marketplace of ideas through debate and discourse 
 in innovative organizations they amplify differences they don 't minimize them 
 creative abrasion is not about brainstorming where people suspend their judgment
  know how to have very heated but constructive arguments to create a portfolio of alternatives  
 individuals in innovative organizations learn how to inquire  they learn how to actively listen but guess what they also learn how to advocate for their point of view  
 they understand that innovation rarely happens unless
  you have both diversity and conflict 
 creative agility is about being able to test and refine that portfolio of ideas through quick pursuit reflection and adjustment  
 it 's about discovery driven learning where you act as opposed to plan your way to the future  it 's about design thinking where you have that interesting combination of the scientific method
 and the artistic process it 's about running a series of experiments and not a series of pilots experiments are usually about
  learning when you get a negative outcome you 're still really learning something that you need to know 
 pilots are often about being right  when they don 't work someone or something is to blame  
 the final capability is creative resolution 
 this is about doing decision making in a way that you can actually combine even opposing ideas to reconfigure them in new combinations
 to produce a solution that is new and
  useful 
 when you look at innovative organizations they never go along to get along  they don 't compromise  they don 't let one group or one individual dominate even if it 's the boss  even if it 's the expert  
 instead they have developed a rather patient and more inclusive decision making process that allows for both and solutions to arise and not simply either
  or solutions
 these three capabilities are why we see that pixar is able to do what it does 
 let me give you another example and that example is the infrastructure group of google 
 the infrastructure group of google is the group that has to keep the website up and running twenty four 
  so when google was about to introduce gmail and youtube  they knew that their data storage system wasn 't adequate  
 the head of the engineering group and the infrastructure group at that time was a man named bill coughran 
 bill and his leadership team who he referred to as his brain trust had to figure out what to do about this situation 
 they thought about it for a while instead of creating a group to tackle this task  they decided to allow groups
  to emerge spontaneously
 around different alternatives  
 two groups coalesced one became known as big table the other became known as build it from scratch 
 big table proposed that they build on the current system build it from scratch proposed that it was time for a whole new system
  these two teams were allowed to work full time on their particular approach 
 in engineering reviews bill described his role as injecting honesty into the process
 by driving debate 
 early on the teams were encouraged to build prototypes so that they could bump them up against reality and discover for themselves the strengths and weaknesses of their particular approach 
 when build it from scratch shared their prototype with the group whose beepers would have to go off in the
  middle of the night if something went wrong with the website they heard loud and clear about the limitations of their particular design 
 as the need for a solution became more urgent and as the data or the evidence began to come in it became pretty clear that the big table solution was the right one for the moment  
 so they selected that one but to make sure that they did not lose the learning of the
  build it from scratch team bill asked two members of that team to join a new team that was emerging to work on the next generation system
 this whole process took nearly two years  but i was told that they were all working at breakneck speed
 early in that process one of the engineers had gone to bill and said we 're all too busy for this inefficient system of running parallel experiments
  but as the process unfolded he began to understand the wisdom of allowing talented people to play out their passions he admitted if you had forced us to all be on one team 
 we might have focused on proving who was right  and winning and not on learning and discovering what was the best answer for google 
  capabilities required for that they know how to do collaborative problem solving they know how to do discovery driven learning and they know how to do integrated decision making
 some of you may be sitting there and saying to yourselves right now we don 't know how to do those things in my organization  so why do they know how to do those things at pixar and why do they know how to do those things at google 
 when many of the people that worked for bill told us
 bill was one of the finest leaders in silicon valley we completely agreed the man is a genius 
 leadership is the secret sauce  
 but it 's a different kind of leadership not the kind many of us think about when we think about great leadership 
 one of the leaders i met with early on said to me linda  i don 't read books on leadership
 all they do is make me feel bad 
 in the first chapter they say i 'm supposed to create a vision  
 but if i 'm trying to do something that 's truly new i have no answers  i don 't know what direction we 're going in and i 'm not even sure i know how to figure out how to get there 
 for sure there are times when visionary leadership is exactly what is needed  but if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again we
  must recast our understanding of what leadership is about leading innovation
 is about creating the space where people are willing and able to do the hard work of innovative problem solving
 at this point  some of you may be wondering what does that leadership really look like at pixar
  they understand that innovation takes a village
 the leaders focus on building a sense of community and building those three capabilities 
 how do they define leadership  they say leadership is about creating a world to which people want to belong 
 what kind of world do people want to belong in at pixar a world where you 're living at the frontier 
 what do they focus their time on not on creating a vision  instead they spend their time thinking about how do we design a studio that has the sensibility
 of a public public square so that people will interact 
 let 's put in a policy that anyone no matter what their level or role is allowed to give notes to the director about how they feel about a particular film
 what can we do to make sure that all the disruptors all the minority voices in this organization speak up and are heard and
  let 's bestow credit in a very generous way i don 't know if you 've ever looked at the credits of a pixar movie but the babies born during a production are listed there laughter
 how did bill think about what his role was 
 bill said i lead a volunteer organization talented people don 't want to follow me anywhere  
 they want to cocreate with me the future  
 my job is to nurture the bottom up and not let it degenerate
  into chaos 
 how did he see his role i 'm a role model  i 'm a human glue  i 'm a connector  i 'm an aggregator of viewpoints  i 'm never a dictator of viewpoints 
 advice about how you exercise the role hire people who argue with you 
 and guess what sometimes it 's best to be deliberately fuzzy and vague
 some of you may be wondering now what are these people thinking
  thinking i 'm not the visionary i 'm the social architect  i 'm creating the space
 where people are willing and able to share and combine their talents and passions 
 if some of you are worrying now that you don 't work at a pixar or you don 't work at a google i want to tell you there 's still hope  
 we 've studied many organizations that were really not organizations you 'd think of as ones where a lot of innovation happens
  we studied a general counsel in a pharmaceutical company who had to figure out how to get the outside lawyers  nineteen competitors to collaborate and innovate 
 we studied the head of marketing at a german automaker where fundamentally they believed that it was the design engineers not the marketeers who were allowed to be innovative  
 we also studied vineet nayar at hcl technologies  an indian outsourcing company
 when we met vineet his company was about in his words to become irrelevant  we watched as he turned that company into a global dynamo of i t innovation 
 at hcl technologies like at many companies  the leaders had learned to see their role as setting direction and making sure that no one deviated from it 
 what he did
 is tell them
  it was time for them to think about rethinking what they were supposed to do  because what was happening is that everybody was looking up and you weren 't seeing the kind of bottom up innovation we saw at pixar or google 
 so they began to work on that they stopped giving answers  they stopped trying to provide solutions  
 instead what they did is they began to see the people at the bottom of the pyramid the young sparks
 the people who were closest to the customers as the source of innovation 
 they began to transfer the organization 's growth to that level 
 in vineet 's language this was about inverting the pyramid so that you could unleash the power of the many by loosening the stranglehold of the few and increase the quality and the speed of innovation that
  happening every day 
 for sure vineet and all the other leaders that we studied were in fact visionaries 
 for sure they understood that that was not their role  
 so i don 't think it is accidental that many of you did not recognize ed
  like vineet understands that our role as leaders is to set the stage not perform on it
 if we want to invent a better future  and i suspect that 's why many of us are here  
 then we need to reimagine our task 
 our task is to create the space
 where everybody 's slices of genius
 can be unleashed and harnessed and turned into works of collective genius  thank you
