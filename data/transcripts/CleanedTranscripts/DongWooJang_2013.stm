  it is said
 that the grass is always greener
 on the other side of the fence  and i believe
 this is true  especially when i hear president obama often talk about the korean education system as a benchmark of success
 well i can tell you that in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the korean school system 
 also known as pressure cooker not everyone can do well
 in that environment  while many people responded in different ways about our education system my response
 high pressure environment
 was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building  why bows i
 'm not quite sure  
 perhaps in the face of constant pressure 
 my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows  
 if you think about it
  bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times 
 the area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the joseon dynasty 
 where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves 
 in order to raise the historical awareness of this fact the government has planted mulberry trees
 the seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there
 nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway
 that has been built around the one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight olympics 
 the area near these walls  which nobody bothers to pay attention to had been left free from major intervention 
 and this is where i first
  found my treasures 
 as i fell deeper into bow making  i began to search far and beyond my neighborhood  
 when i went on school field trips  family vacations or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes  
 i wandered around wooded areas
 and gathered tree branches with the tools that i sneaked
  inside my school bag  and they would be somethings like saws  knives  sickles and axes
 that i covered up with with a piece of towel  
 i would bring the branches home  riding buses and subways  barely holding them in my hands  and
 i did not bring the tools here to long beach
  security 
 in the privacy of my room  covered in sawdust  i 
 and polish wood all night long
 until a bow took shape  one day  i was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place
  the rooftop of my apartment building a place where ninety six families call home 
 a customer from a department store across from my building called nine hundred and eleven 
 and i ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned  
 i want to take this opportunity to tell my mom in the audience today mom  i was really
 and i will be more careful with open fire from now on 
 my mother had to do a lot of explaining  telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson  
 i also researched extensively on bows around the world in that
  i tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow  
 i also worked with many different types of wood such as maple  yew and mulberry 
 and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that i mentioned before 
 the most effective bow for me would be like this 
  when you draw and shoot the arrow 
 two belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight which means more power 
 three  sinew used in the outer layer of the limb
 for maximum tension storage and four  horn used to store energy in compression
 after fixing breaking redesigning  mending bending and amending 
 my ideal bow began to take shape  and when it was finally done 
 it looked like this  
 i was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own
 this is a picture of korean traditional bows taken from a museum  and see
 how my bow resembles them 
 thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention
  of my heritage  learning the information that has accumulated over time
 and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice
 any living adults could give me 
 you see  i searched far and wide  but never bothered to look close and near 
 from this realization  i began to take
  interest in korean history  which had never inspired me before in the end the grass
 is often greener on my side of the fence  although we don 't realize it  
 now  i am going to show you how my bow works  and
  a bow may function in a simple mechanism  but in order to make a good bow a great amount of sensitivity is required
 you need to console and communicate with the wood material  each fiber in the wood
 has its own reason and function for being  
 and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow  
 i may be an [ odd ] student with
  i hope
 i am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you 
 my ideal world is a place where no one is left behind where everyone is needed
 exactly where they are like the fibers and the tendons in a bow 
 a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is
  the bow resembles me  and i resemble the bow now  i am shooting a part of myself to you 
 no better yet a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind did it strike you  thank you
