  the brain is an amazing and complex organ 
 and while many people are fascinated by the brain they can 't really tell you that much about the properties about how the brain works because we don 't teach neuroscience in
  and one of the reasons why is that the equipment is so complex and so expensive that it 's really only done at major universities and large institutions
 and so in order to be able to access the brain you really need to
 dedicate your life and spend six and a half years as a graduate student just to become a neuroscientist to get access to these tools 
 and that 's a shame because one out of five of us that 's twenty percent of the entire world will have a neurological
  and there are zero cures for these diseases  and so it seems that what we should be doing  is reaching back earlier in the eduction process and
 teaching students about neuroscience so that in the future they may be thinking about possibly becoming a brain scientist  
 when i was a graduate student my lab mate tim marzullo and myself decided that what if we took this complex equipment that we have for studying the brain and made it simple enough and affordable enough that anyone
 that you know an amateur or a high school student  
 could learn and actually participate in the discovery of neuroscience and so we did just that 
 a few years ago we started a company called backyard brains and we make diy neuroscience equipment and i brought some here tonight and i want to do some demonstrations you guys want to see some so
 i need a
  i 'm going to record from your brain  have you had this before sk 
 no gg i need you to stick out your arm for science  roll up your sleeve a bit
  so what i 'm going to do i 'm putting electrodes on your arm and you 're probably wondering i just said i 'm going to record from your brain what am i doing with your arm
 well you have about eighty billion neurons
  inside your brain right now they 're sending electrical messages back and forth and chemical messages
 but some of your neurons right here in your motor cortex are going to send messages down when you move your arm like this they 're going to
 go down across your corpus callosum down onto your spinal cord to your lower motor neuron out to your muscles here and that electrical discharge is going to be picked up by these
 electrodes right here and we 're going to be able to listen to exactly what your brain is going to be doing so i 'm going to turn
  so what you 're listening to so this is your motor units happening right here  let 's take a look at it as well so i 'm going to stand over here 
 and i 'm going to open up our app here so now i want you to squeeze so right
  these are the motor units that are happening from her spinal cord out to her muscle right here and as she 's doing it you 're seeing the electrical activity that 's happening here you can even click here and try to see one of them so keep doing it really really hard
 so now we 've paused on one motor action potential that 's happening right now inside of your brain  do you
 guys want to see some more
  to stand right here so  when you 're moving your arm like this your brain is sending a signal down to your muscles right here  
 i want you to move your arm as well  so your brain is going to send
 a signal down to your muscles and so it turns out that there is a nerve that 's right here that runs up here that innervates these three fingers and
 it 's close enough to the skin that we might be able to stimulate that so that what we can do is copy
  your brain signals going out to your hand
 and inject it into your hand so that your hand will move when your brain tells your hand to move so in a sense  
 she will take away your free will and you will no longer have any control over this hand  you with me
  so i just need to hook you up 
 laughter so i 'm going to find your ulnar nerve which is probably right around here
 're signing up for when you come up so now i 'm going to move away and we 're going to plug it in to our human to human interface over here  
 okay so sam i want you to squeeze your hand again
  do it again
  perfect so now i 'm going to hook you up over here so that you get the it 's going to feel a little bit weird at first this is going to feel like a 
 you know when you lose your
  free will and someone else becomes your agent it does feel a bit strange now i want you to relax your hand   sam you 're with me  so you 're going to
  so right now your brain is controlling your arm and it 's also controlling his arm so go ahead and just do it one more time all right so it 's perfect 
 so now what would happen if i took over my control of your your hand and so just relax your hand  what happens
 nothing why not because the brain has to do it so you do it again all right that 's perfect 
 thank you guys for being such a good sport
