  we do not invest in victims we invest in survivors  
 and in ways both big and small the narrative of the victim shapes the way we see women  
 you can 't count what you don 't see and we don 't invest in what 's invisible to
  us  but this is the face
 of resilience 
 six years ago i started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict 
 i set out to write a compelling economic story one that had great characters that no one else was telling  and one that i thought mattered  and that turned out to be women
  news and a career i loved at the age of thirty for business school a path i knew almost nothing about 
 none of the women i had grown up with in maryland had graduated from college  
 let alone considered business school  but they had hustled to feed their kids and pay their rent 
 and i saw from a young age that having a decent job and earning a good living made the biggest difference for families who were struggling  
 so if you 're going to talk about jobs
  you have to talk about entrepreneurs 
 and if you 're talking about entrepreneurs in conflict and post conflict settings  then you must talk about women because they are the population you have left  
 rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide was   seventy seven percent female
 i want to introduce
  you to some of those entrepreneurs i 've met and share with you some of what they 've taught me over the years  
 i went to afghanistan in two thousand and five to work on a financial times piece and there i met kamila 
 a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly $ two thousand a month
 an astronomical sum in that context  and she had turned it down she said  because she was going to start her next business an entrepreneurship consultancy that would teach
  business skills to men and women all around afghanistan 
 business she said was critical to her country 's future because long after this round of internationals left 
 business would help keep her country peaceful and secure  
 and she said business was even more important for women
 because earning an income earned respect and money was power for women
  so i was amazed  i mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time
 who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from the apprentice 
 so i asked her how in the world do you know this much about business why are you so passionate she said oh gayle  
 this is actually my third business 
 my first business was a dressmaking
  business i started under the taliban  and that was actually an excellent business because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood  and that 's really how i became an entrepreneur 
 think about this  here were girls who braved danger to become breadwinners
 during years in which they couldn 't even be on their streets and at a time of economic collapse
 when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces and windows and doors
  just to survive these girls made the difference between survival and starvation for so many 
 i couldn 't leave the story and i couldn 't leave the topic either  
 because everywhere i went i met more of these women who no one seemed to know about or even wish to 
 i went on to bosnia and early on in my interviews i met with an imf official who said
  actually have women in business in bosnia  but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road  so maybe you could interview her 
 so i went out reporting
 and within a day i met narcisa kavazovic who at that point was opening a new factory on the war 's former front lines in sarajevo 
  she had started her business squatting in an abandoned garage sewing sheets and pillow cases she would take to markets all around the city so that she could support the twelve or thirteen family members who were counting on her for survival 
 by the time we met she had twenty employees  most of them women who were sending their boys and their girls to school 
 and she was just the start i met women running essential oils businesses  wineries and even the country 's largest
  advertising agency 
 so these stories together became the herald tribune business cover  and when this story posted i ran to my computer to send it to the imf official and i said just in case you 
  're looking for entrepreneurs to feature at your next investment conference  here are a couple of women
 is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro
  the biases whether intentional or otherwise are pervasive  and so are the misleading mental images 
 if you see the word microfinance what comes to mind  
 most people say women  and if you see the word entrepreneur most people think men
  why is that because we aim low and we think small when it comes to women  microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to 
 but we must move beyond micro hopes and micro ambitions for women because they have so much greater hopes for themselves 
 they want to move from micro to medium and beyond  
 and in many places they 're there
 in the 
  businesses will create five and a half million new jobs by two thousand and eighteen in south korea and indonesia women own nearly half a million firms  
 china women run twenty percent of all small businesses  and in the developing world overall that figure is forty to fifty percent 
 nearly everywhere i go i meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs who are seeking access
  to finance access to markets and established business networks they are often ignored
 because they 're harder to help 
 it is much riskier to give a fifty thousand dollar loan than it is to give a five hundred dollar loan  
 and as the world bank recently noted women are stuck in a productivity trap  those in small businesses can 't get the capital they need to expand and those in
  't grow out of them  
 recently i was at the state department in washington and i met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from ghana she sells chocolates  
 and she had come to washington not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan 
 she had come seeking serious investment dollars so that she could build the factory and buy the equipment she needs to export her chocolates to
  africa europe the middle east and far beyond
 capital that would help her to employ more than the twenty people that she already has working for her  
 and capital that would fuel her own country 's economic climb 
 the great news is we already know what works  
 theory and empirical evidence have already taught us we don 't need to invent solutions because we have them
 cash flow loans based in income rather than assets  
 loans that use secure contracts rather than collateral  because women often don 't own land 
 and kiva org the microlender is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing small and medium sized loans  and that 's just to start 
  has become very much in fashion to call women the emerging market of the emerging market 
 i think that is terrific you know why  because and i say this as somebody who worked in finance
 five hundred billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade  because investors saw the potential for return
 at a time of slowing economic growth and so they created financial products and financial
  innovation tailored to the emerging markets 
 how wonderful would it be if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words with our wallets
 and invest five hundred billion dollars unleashing women 's economic potential just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs productivity 
  child nutrition maternal mortality literacy and much much more 
 because as the world economic forum noted  smaller gender gaps are directly correlated with increased economic competitiveness 
 and not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap
 not one so the great news is this is an incredible opportunity we have so much room to grow
 you see this is not about doing good this is about global growth
 and global employment  it is about how we invest
 and it 's about how we see women  and women can no longer be both half the population and a special interest group
  oftentimes i get into very interesting discussions with reporters who say to me gayle these are great stories but you 're really writing about the exceptions now
 that makes me pause for just a couple reasons  first of all for exceptions there are a lot of them
 and they 're important secondly when we talk
  about men who are succeeding we rightly consider them icons or pioneers or innovators to be emulated 
 and when we talk about women they are either exceptions to be dismissed
 or aberrations to be ignored  
 and finally there is no society anywhere in all the world that is not changed except by its most exceptional 
 so why wouldn 't we celebrate
 and elevate these change makers and job
  creators rather than overlook them 
 this topic of resilience is very personal to me and in many ways has shaped my life 
 my mom was a single mom who worked at the phone company during the day and sold tupperware at night
 so that i could have every opportunity possible  we
 we shopped double coupons and layaway and consignment stores  
 and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer and could no longer work we even applied for food stamps  
 and when i would feel sorry for myself as nine or ten year old girls do she would say to me my dear on a scale of major world tragedies  yours is not a three 
 and when i was applying to business school and felt certain i couldn 't do it and nobody i knew had done it i went to my aunt who survived years
  of beatings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact  
 and she told me never import other people 's limitations 
 and when i complained to my grandmother a world war ii veteran who worked in film for fifty years and who supported me from the age of thirteen 
 that i was terrified that if i turned down a plum assignment at
  overseas i would never ever ever find another job she said kiddo i 'm going to tell you two things  first of all no one turns down a fulbright  
 and secondly  mcdonald 's is always hiring 
 you will find a job  take the leap 
 the women in my family are not exceptions  the women in this room and watching in
  the world are not exceptions  we are not a special interest group
 we are the majority and for far too long we have underestimated ourselves and been undervalued by others 
 it is time for us to aim higher when it comes to women to invest more and to deploy our dollars to benefit women all around the world
  we can make a difference and make a difference not just for women  but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions  
 together we can make certain that the so called exceptions
 begin to rule when we change the way we see ourselves others will follow and it is time for all of us to think
 bigger  thank you very
