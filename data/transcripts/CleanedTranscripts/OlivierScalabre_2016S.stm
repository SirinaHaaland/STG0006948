  and it 's a big deal  our global economy stops growing  and it 's not new
  actually declined for the last fifty years  if we continue like this we need to learn how to live in a world with no growth in the next decade  
 this is scary
 because when the economy doesn 't grow  our children don 't get better lives  what 's even scarier
 is that when the pie does not grow  each of us get a smaller piece we 're then ready to fight for a bigger one 
 this creates tensions and serious conflicts growth matters
  a lot 
 if we look at the history of growth times of big growth have always been fueled by big manufacturing revolutions 
 it happened three times  every 50 60 years  
 the steam engine
 in the middle of the  19th century the mass production model
 in the beginning of
  and the first automation wave in the 
 why did these manufacturing revolutions create huge growth in our economies  
 because they have injected huge productivity improvement  
 it 's rather simple in order to grow you need to be producing more putting more into our economy  
 this means either more labor
 or more capital or more productivity
  each time productivity has been the growth lever  i 'm here today
 to tell you
 that we are on the verge of another huge change 
 and that this change surprisingly enough is going to come from manufacturing again  
 it will get us out of our growth
  will change radically the way globalization has been shaped
 over the last decade  i 'm here to tell you about the amazing fourth manufacturing revolution
 that is currently underway  
 it 's not as if we 've done nothing with manufacturing since the last revolution actually we 've made some pretty lame attempts to try to revitalize it 
 but none of them have been the big overhaul
 we really need to get us growing again for example  
 we 've tried to relocate our factories offshore in order to reduce cost and take advantage of cheap labor 
 not only did this not inspire productivity  but it only saved money for a short period of time because cheap labor didn 't stay cheap for long 
 then  we 've tried to make our factories larger
 and we
  the idea was that we can make a lot of one product and stockpile it to be sold with demand 
 this did help productivity for a while  but it introduced a lot of rigidities in our supply chain  
 let 's take fashion retail  traditional clothing companies have built offshore global rigid supply chains
  competitors like zara
 started replenishing their stocks faster from two collections a year to one collection a month  
 none of them have been able to keep up with the pace most of them
 are in great difficulties today  
 yet with all of their shortcomings those are the factories we know today when you open the doors they look the same as they did
  we 've just changed the location the size the way they operate 
 can you name anything else that looks the same as it did fifty years ago  it 's crazy  
 we 've made all the tweaks to the model that we could and now we hit
 its limits  after all of our attempts
 to fix the manufacturing model failed  we thought growth could come from elsewhere  we turned to the tech sector there
  been quite a lot of innovations there just to name one the internet  
 we hoped it could produce growth  and indeed it changed our lives  it made big waves in the media  the service the entertainment spaces  
 but it hasn 't done much for productivity 
 actually  what 's surprising is that productivity is on the decline
 despite all of those innovation efforts
  that sitting at work scrolling through facebook  watching videos on youtube has made us less productive weird 
 this is why we are not growing 
 we failed at reinventing the manufacturing space and large technological innovations have played away from it  
 but what if we could combine those forces  what if the existing
  manufacturing and large
 technological innovation came together
 to create the next big manufacturing reinvention bingo  this is the fourth manufacturing revolution and it 's happening right now 
 major technologies are entering the manufacturing space big time 
 they will boost industrial productivity by more than a third  
 this is massive  and it will
  do a lot in creating growth  let me tell you about some of them 
 have you already met advanced manufacturing robots 
 they are the size of humans 
 they actually collaborate with them and they can be programmed in order to perform complex non repetitive tasks 
 today in our factories only eight percent of the tasks are automated the
  complex the more repetitive ones  it will be twenty five percent in ten years  it means that by 
 advanced robots will complement workers to be together twenty percent more productive 
 to manufacture twenty percent more outputs to achieve twenty percent additional growth 
 this isn 't some fancy futuristic idea these robots are working for
  us right now 
 last year in the us they helped amazon prepare and ship all the products required for cyber monday  
 the annual peak of online retail  
 last year in the us  it was the biggest online shopping day of the year and of history 
 consumers spent three billion dollars on electronics that day that 's real
 economic growth 
 then there 's additive manufacturing 3d printing
 3d printing has already improved plastic manufacturing and it 's now making its way through metal those are not small industries 
 plastic and metals represent twenty five percent of global manufacturing
  let 's take a real example 
 in the aerospace industry  
 fuel nozzles are some of the most complex parts to manufacture for one reason they are made up of twenty different parts
 that need to be separately produced and then painstakingly assembled 
 aerospace companies are now using 3d printing  which allows them to turn those twenty different parts into just one
 the results  forty percent more productivity  forty percent more output produced  forty percent more growth for this specific industry  
 but actually  the most exciting part of this new manufacturing revolution
 goes much beyond productivity it 's about producing better smarter products it 's about scale
  customization imagine a world
 where you can buy the exact products you want with the functionalities you need with the design you want 
 with the same cost and lead time as a product that 's been mass produced like your car or your clothes or your cell phone 
 the new manufacturing revolution makes it possible
  advanced robots
 can be programmed in order to perform any product configuration
 without any setup time or ramp up 3d printers instantaneously
 produce any customized design we are now able to produce
 a batch of one product your product at the same cost and lead time
 as a batch of many those are only a few examples of the manufacturing revolution at play
  not only will manufacturing become more productive  
 it will also become more flexible and those were exactly the elements of growth that we are missing  
 but actually there are even some bigger implications for all of us when manufacturing will find its way back
 into the limelight  it will create a huge
  shift 
 first our factories will be relocated into our home markets 
 in the world of scale customization  consumer proximity is the new norm 
 then our factories will be smaller agile scale does not matter anymore  flexibility does
  trade flows will be replaced by regional trade flows east for east west for west when you think about that 
 the old model was pretty much insane
  piling up stocks making products travel the whole world
 before they reach their end consumers the new model producing just next to the consumer market will be much cleaner 
 much better for our environment  
 in mature economies manufacturing will be back home creating more employment more productivity and more growth  
  isn 't it  but here 's the thing with growth
 it does not come automatically mature economies will have to seize it we
 'll have to massively re train our workforce 
 in most countries like in my country france  we 've told our children that manufacturing had no future that it was something happening far away  we need to reverse that
 and teach manufacturing again at
  the countries that will boldly transform will be able to seize this growth 
 it 's also a chance for developing economies of course
 china and other emerging economies won 't be the factory of the world anymore  
 actually  it was not a sustainable model in the long term as those countries are becoming richer 
 last year it was already
 as expensive to produce in brazil as to produce in france 
 by two thousand and eighteen manufacturing costs in china will be on par with the us  
 the new manufacturing revolution will accelerate the transition
 of those emerging economies towards a model driven by domestic consumption  and this is good
  because this is where growth will be created 
 in the next five years  the next billion consumers in china will inject more growth in our economies than the top five european markets together
  this fourth manufacturing revolution is a chance for all of us 
  see sustainable growth in all of our economies  this means more wealth distributed to all of us
 and a better future for our children thank you
