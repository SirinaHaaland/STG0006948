  by asking you all to go to your happy place please yes your happy place i know you 've got one even if it 's fake
  place 
 any plastic tables  polyester flooring  
 mobile phones no  i think we all know that our happy place is meant to be somewhere natural  outdoors on a beach fireside we 'll be reading or eating or knitting  
 and we 're surrounded by natural light and organic elements natural things make us happy
 and happiness is a great motivator we strive for happiness perhaps that 's why we 're always redesigning everything in the hopes that our solutions might feel more
 natural  so let 's start there with the idea that good design should feel natural your phone
 is not very natural and you probably think you 're addicted to your phone but you 're really
  not we 're not addicted to devices we 're addicted to the information that flows through them 
 i wonder how long you would be happy in your happy place without any information
 from the outside world 
 i 'm interested in how we access that information how we experience it  we 're moving from a time of static information held in books and libraries and bus stops
  a period of digital information  towards a period of fluid information  where your children will
 expect to be able to access anything anywhere at any time from quantum physics to medieval viticulture 
 from gender theory to tomorrow 's weather  just like switching on a lightbulb
 imagine that humans also like simple
  tools  your phone is not a very simple tool a fork is a simple tool 
 laughter and we don 't like them made of plastic 
 in the same way i don 't really like my phone very much it 's not how i want to experience information
  i think there are better solutions than a world mediated
  by screens i don 't hate screens  but i don 't feel and i don 't think any of us feel that good about how much time we spend slouched over them 
 fortunately the big tech companies seem to agree they 're actually heavily invested in touch and speech and gesture  
 and also in senses things that can turn dumb objects like cups and imbue them with the magic of the internet
  potentially turning this digital cloud into something we might touch and move  
 the parents in crisis over screen time need physical digital toys teaching their kids to read as well as  family safe app stores  
 and i think actually that 's already really happening reality is richer than screens  
  i love books 
 for me they are time machines atoms and molecules bound in space from the moment of their creation to the moment of my experience 
 but frankly the content 's identical on my phone  
 so what makes this a richer experience than a screen  i mean  
 scientifically  
  i 'm going to show film i need the enormous screen  
 but there 's more than you can do with these magic boxes 
 your phone is not the internet 's door bitch we can build things
 physical things using physics and pixels that can integrate the internet into the world around us and i 'm going to show you a few
  a while ago i got to work with a design agency  berg on an exploration of what the internet without screens might actually look like 
 and they showed us a range ways that light can work with simple senses
 and physical objects to really bring the internet to life to make it tangible  like this
 wonderfully mechanical youtube player and this was an inspiration to me 
 next i worked with the japanese agency aq on a research project into mental health  we wanted to create an object that could capture the 
  subjective data around mood swings that 's so essential to diagnosis 
 and then you you might revisit those moments later and add context to them online  
 most of all  we wanted to create an intimate  beautiful thing
 that could live in your pocket
 and be loved the binoculars are actually a birthday present for the sydney opera house 's 40th anniversary 
  our friends at tellart in boston brought over a pair of street binoculars the kind you might find on the empire state building and they fitted them with 
  views of other iconic world heritage sights 
 using street view  and then we stuck them under the steps  
 so they became this very physical simple reappropriation or like a portal to these other icons so you might see versailles or shackleton 's hut 
 basically it 's virtual reality
 in our office we use hacky sacks to exchange urls this is incredibly simple it 's like your opal card you basically put a a website on the little the little chip in here  
 and then you do this and bosh the website appears on your phone  
 it 's about ten cents  treehugger is a project that we 're working
  on with grumpy sailor and finch here in sydney and
 i 'm very excited about what might happen when you pull the phones apart and you put the bits into trees  and that my children might have
 an opportunity to visit an enchanted forest guided by a magic wand  
 where they could talk to digital fairies and ask them questions and be asked questions in return 
 as you can see we 're at the cardboard stage with this one
 but i 'm very excited by the possibility of getting kids back outside without screens but with all the the powerful magic of the internet at their fingertips  
 and we hope to have something like this
 working by the end of the year  
 so let 's recap  humans like natural
  need simple tools  these principles should underpin how we design for the future not just for the internet 
 you may feel uncomfortable about the age of information that we 're moving into you may feel challenged  rather than simply
 excited guess what me too it 's a really extraordinary period of human history
 we are the people that actually build our world  there are no artificial intelligences  yet 
 it 's us designers architects  artists  engineers  
 and if we challenge ourselves  i think that actually we can have a happy place
 filled with the information we love
  feels as natural and as simple
 as switching on lightbulb  
 and although it may seem inevitable that what the public wants is watches and websites and widgets  maybe we could give a bit of thought
 to cork
 and light and hacky sacks thank you very much
