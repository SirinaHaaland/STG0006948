  less than a year after september eleven and i was at the chicago tribune writing about shootings and murders and it was leaving me feeling pretty dark and depressed 
 i had done some activism in college so i decided to help a local group hang door knockers against animal testing  
 i thought it would be a safe way to do something
 positive but of course i have the absolute worst luck ever and we were all arrested 
 police took this blurry photo of me holding leaflets as evidence 
 my charges were dismissed but a few weeks later two fbi agents knocked on my door and they told me that unless i helped them by spying on protest
  they would put me on a domestic terrorist list 
 i 'd love to tell you that i didn 't flinch  but i was terrified 
 and when my fear subsided i became obsessed with finding out how this happened how animal rights and environmental activists who have never injured anyone could become the fbi 's number one domestic terrorism threat 
 a few years later i was invited to testify before congress about my reporting and i told lawmakers that while everybody is talking about going green
 some people are risking their lives to defend forests and to stop oil pipelines  they 're physically putting their bodies on the line between the whalers ' harpoons and the whales 
 these are everyday people like these protesters in italy who spontaneously climbed over barbed wire fences to rescue beagles from animal testing
  and these movements have been incredibly effective and popular so in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five their opponents made up a new word
 to shift how we view them they just made it up 
 now these companies have backed new laws like the animal enterprise terrorism act  which turns activism into terrorism if it causes a loss of profits 
 now most people never even heard about this law  including members of congress
 less than one percent were in the room when it passed the house 
 the rest were outside at a new memorial 
 they were praising dr king as his style of activism was branded as terrorism if done in the name of animals or the environment  
 supporters say laws like this are needed for the extremists
  the arsonists the radicals but right now companies like transcanada are briefing police in presentations like this one
 about how to prosecute nonviolent protesters as terrorists the fbi 's training documents on 
 are not about violence  they 're about public relations 
 today in multiple countries corporations are pushing new laws that make it illegal to photograph animal cruelty on their farms
  latest was in idaho just two weeks ago  and today we released a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional as a threat to journalism 
 the first of these  ag gag prosecutions as they 're called 
 was a young woman named amy meyer  and amy saw a sick cow being moved by a bulldozer outside of a slaughterhouse as she was on the public street  
 and amy did what any of us would she filmed it 
  out about her story i wrote about it and within twenty four hours it created such an uproar that the prosecutors just dropped all the charges  
 but apparently even exposing stuff like that is a threat  
 through the freedom of information act i learned that the counter terrorism unit has been monitoring my articles and speeches like this one
  blurb on the next book right 
 the point of all of this is to make us afraid  but as a journalist i have an unwavering faith in the power of education our best weapon
 is sunlight dostoevsky wrote that the whole work of man is to prove he 's a man and not a piano key
  over and over throughout history people in power have used fear to silence the truth and to silence dissent it 's time we strike a new note  thank you
