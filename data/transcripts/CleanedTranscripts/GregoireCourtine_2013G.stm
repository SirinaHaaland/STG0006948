  i am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine 
 my lab at the swiss federal institute of technology
 focuses on spinal cord injury
  affects more than fifty thousand people around the world
 every year with dramatic consequences for affected individuals  whose life literally shatters
 in a matter of a handful of seconds 
 and for me  the man of steel  christopher reeve has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured
  and this is how i started my own personal journey in this field of research working with the christopher and dana reeve foundation  i still remember
 this decisive moment it was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation  chris addressed us the scientists
 and
 experts you have to be more pragmatic when leaving your laboratory tomorrow  i want you to stop by the rehabilitation center
 to watch injured people fighting to take a step  struggling to maintain their trunk  
 and when you go home think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their lives better 
 these words they stuck with me  
 this was more than ten years
  ever since my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury 
 and my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well controlled experimental conditions  
 and for this purpose  we placed two hemisections on opposite sides of the body  they completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord
 complete and permanent paralysis of the leg 
 but as observed 
 after most injuries in humans there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur  
 but how to make it happen  
 well  the classical approach consists
 of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber
  to the original target  and while this certainly remained the key for a cure this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me 
 to reach clinical fruition rapidly it was obvious  i had to think about the problem differently it
 turned out that more than one hundred years of research
 on spinal cord physiology  starting with the nobel prize
  that
 the spinal cord  below most injuries  contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion 
 but because input from the brain is interrupted
  they are in a nonfunctional state like kind of dormant my idea  we awaken this network 
  fellow in los angeles after completing my ph d in france  where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted 
 i was
 afraid to talk to my new boss  
 but decided to muster up my courage i knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor reggie edgerton to share my new idea  
 he listened to me carefully  and responded with a grin
  grin why don 't you try 
 and i promise to you this was such an important moment in my career 
 when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas 
 and this was the idea  i 'm going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain to you this complicated
  the locomotor system is a car
  the engine is the spinal cord the transmission is interrupted  the engine is turned off how could we re engage the engine 
 first we have to provide the fuel 
 second press the accelerator pedal  third steer the car  it turned out that there are known neural pathways coming from the brain that play this very function during locomotion my idea  replace this missing input
 provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk 
 for this i leveraged twenty years of past research in neuroscience first
 to replace the missing fuel with pharmacological agents that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire 
  to mimic the accelerator pedal with electrical stimulation so here imagine an electrode
 implanted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver painless stimulation it took many years but eventually we developed an electrochemical 
 that transformed the neural network in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state  
  as soon as the treadmill belt starts moving  the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg  
 but without the brain  
 here what i call the spinal brain cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle
  i was
 completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain  but at the same time so frustrated  
 this locomotion was completely involuntary  the animal had virtually no control over the legs  clearly  the steering system was
  missing 
 and it then became obvious from me that we had to move away from the classical rehabilitation paradigm  
 stepping on a treadmill  and develop conditions that would encourage
 the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg 
 with this in mind we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in
  any direction of space imagine this is really cool so imagine the little  200 gram rat
 attached at the extremity of this 200 kilo robot  but the rat does not feel the robot  the robot is transparent 
 just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure
  me summarize the rat received a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord  the electrochemical 
 enabled a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks the robot
 provided the safe environment to allow the rat to attempt anything to engage the paralyzed legs  
 and for motivation we used what i think is the most powerful pharmacology of switzerland  
 fine swiss chocolate
 laughter actually the first results were very very 
 very disappointing here
 is my best physical therapist
  the rat to take a single step  whereas the same rat five minutes earlier  walked beautifully on the treadmill  we were so frustrated  
 but you know one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance  
 we insisted we refined our paradigm  and after several months of training  
  and whenever she decided initiated full weight bearing locomotion to sprint towards the rewards 
 this is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis 
 in fact
  initiate and sustain locomotion on the ground 
 they could even adjust leg movement for example to resist gravity in order to climb a staircase 
 i can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laboratory 
 it took us ten years of hard work to reach this goal  
 but the remaining question
  was how i mean how is it possible  and here what we found was completely unexpected  this
 novel training paradigm
 encouraged the brain to create new connections  some relay circuits
 that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control
 over the locomotor networks below the injury 
 and here you can see one such example  where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red  
 this blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center 
 and what this constellation
 of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron
 but the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area it occurred throughout the central nervous system  
 including in the brain stem  where we observed
 increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain  we did not aim to repair the spinal cord  yet
 we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling
  of axonal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammal after an injury 
 and there is a very important message
 hidden behind this discovery  
 they are the result of a young team of
  have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals  this is truly a 
  team they are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of dna  we are creating the next generation of m d '
  capable of translating discoveries all the way from bench to bedside  and me  
 i am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony now i am sure
 you are all wondering
  enough yet  this is certainly not a cure
 for spinal cord injury  but i begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery
 and people 's quality of life i would like you all
 to take a moment and dream with me  imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury
 after a few weeks of recovery  
 we will implant a programmable pump to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail directly to the spinal cord  
 at the same time  we will implant an electrode array a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement
  and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator that delivers stimulations that are tailored to the person 's needs  this defines
 a personalized electrochemical 
 that will enable locomotion
 during training with a newly designed supporting system  
 and my hope is that after several months of training there may be enough remodeling of residual connection to allow locomotion
 without the robot
  even without pharmacology or stimulation  my hope here is to be able to create the personalized condition
 to boost the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord  and this is a radically new concept
 that may apply to other neurological disorders  what i termed
  interfaces  i implanted throughout the nervous system 
 in the brain in the spinal cord  even in peripheral nerves  based on
 impairments  but not to replace the lost function  no to help the brain help
  this enticed your imagination because i can promise to you
 this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur  but when 
 and remember  we are only as great as our imagination as big as our dream  
 thank you
