  was hopelessly stuck every research direction that i tried led to a dead end  it seemed like my basic assumptions just stopped working  
 i felt like a pilot flying through the mist  and i lost all sense of direction
 i stopped shaving  i couldn 't get out of bed in the morning  
 i felt unworthy of stepping across the gates of the university  because i wasn 't like einstein or newton or any other scientist whose results i had learned about because in science we just learn about the results not the process  
  i couldn 't be a scientist  but i had enough support
 and i made it through and discovered something new about nature this is an amazing feeling of calmness being the only person in the world who knows a new law of nature  
 and i started the second project in my ph d and it happened again  i got stuck and i made it through and i started thinking  maybe there 's a pattern here 
  that 's exactly what happened to us except nobody told us about it we 'd all studied science as if it 's a series of logical steps between question and answer  
 but doing research is nothing like that at
 the same time  i was also studying to be an improvisation theater actor  
 so physics by day  and by night laughing jumping singing playing my guitar improvisation theater just like science  goes into the unknown
 because you have to make a scene onstage without a
  director without a script without having any idea what you 'll portray or what the other characters will do  
 but unlike science  in improvisation theater they tell you from day one what 's going to happen to you when you get onstage 
 you 're going to fail miserably 
 you 're going to get stuck and we we would practice staying creative inside that stuck place
 we had an exercise where we all stood in a circle and each person had to do the world 's worst tap dance  
 and everybody else applauded and cheered you on supporting you onstage 
 when i became a professor and had to guide my own students through their research projects  i realized again  i don 't know what to do i 'd
 studied thousands of hours of physics biology chemistry  but not one hour not one concept on how to mentor  how to guide someone to go together into the unknown
 about motivation  
 so i turned to improvisation theater  and i told my students from day one what 's going to happen when you start research 
 and this has to do with our mental schema of what research will be like
 because you see whenever people do anything for example if i want to touch this blackboard my brain first builds up a schema a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do before i even start moving my hand
 and if i get blocked
 if my schema doesn 't match reality  that causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance that 's why your schemas had better match reality  but if you believe
 the way science is taught  and if you believe textbooks you 're liable to have the following schema of research 
 if a is the question and b is the answer
  then research is a direct path 
 the problem is that if an experiment doesn 't work or a student gets depressed it
 's perceived as something utterly wrong and causes tremendous stress  and that 's why i teach my students a more realistic
  an example where things don 't match
  different schema  if a is the question b is the answer
 stay creative in the cloud and you start going  
 and experiments don 't work  experiments don 't work experiments don 't work experiments don 't work  until you reach a place linked with negative emotions
 where it seems like your basic assumptions have stopped making sense
  somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet  
 and i call this place the cloud  
 now you can be lost in the cloud for a day a week a month a year
  whole career  
 but sometimes if you 're lucky enough and you have enough support you can see in the materials at hand or perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud 
 a new answer
 c and you decide to go for it and experiments don 't work  experiments don 't work
  you get there  and then you tell everyone about it by publishing a paper that reads a arrow c  which is a great way to communicate  
 but as long as you don 't forget the path that brought you there 
 now this cloud is an inherent part of research an inherent part of our craft because the cloud stands guard at the boundary 
 it stands guard at the boundary between the known
 and the unknown  
 because in order to discover something truly new at least one of your basic assumptions has to change
 and that means that in science we do something quite heroic  every day we try to bring ourselves to the boundary between the known and the unknown and face the cloud
  now notice that i put b in the land of the known because we knew about it in the beginning  but c is always more interesting
 and more important than b so b is essential in order to get going  
 but c is much more profound  and that 's the amazing thing about resesarch now
 just knowing that
  has been transformational in my research group  because students come to me and say uri i 'm in the cloud and i say great you must be feeling miserable 
 but i 'm kind of happy  because we might be close to the boundary between the known and the unknown and we stand a chance of discovering something truly new  
 since the way our mind works it 's just knowing that the cloud
 is normal  it 's essential
  in fact beautiful  we can join the cloud appreciation society
 and it detoxifies the feeling that something is deeply wrong with me 
 and as a mentor  i know what to do which is to step up my support for the student because research in psychology shows that if you 're feeling
 fear and despair your mind narrows
 down to very safe and conservative ways of thinking if you 'd like to explore the risky paths needed to get out of the cloud  you need other emotions solidarity support hope that come 
  with your connection from somebody else so like in improvisation theater in science  it 's best to walk into the unknown together  
  conversations inside the cloud  
 it 's based on the central principle of improvisation theater  
 so here improvisation theater came to my help again it 's called saying yes and to the offers made by other actors 
 that means accepting the offers and building on them
  for example if one actor says here is a pool of water and the other actor says no that 's just a stage the improvisation is over  it 's dead  and everybody feels frustrated
  that 's called blocking
 if you 're not mindful of communications scientific conversations can have a lot of blocking 
 saying yes and sounds like this here is a pool of water yeah let 's jump in look there 's a whale let 's grab it by its tail  it 's pulling us to the moon
  critic 
 we all have an inner critic that kind of guards what we say so people don 't think that we 're obscene or crazy or unoriginal and science is full of the fear of appearing unoriginal 
 saying yes and bypasses the critic and unlocks
 hidden voices of creativity you didn 't even know that you had and they often carry the answer
 about the cloud so you see knowing about the cloud and about saying
  made my lab very creative students started playing off of each others ' ideas and we made surprising discoveries in the interface between physics and biology  for example  
 we were stuck for a year trying to understand the intricate biochemical networks inside our cells 
 and we said we are deeply in the cloud and we had a playful conversation
 where my student shai shen orr said let 's just draw this on a piece of paper
 this network and instead of saying but we 've done that so many times and it doesn 't work i said yes and
 let 's use a very big piece of paper and then ron milo said let 's use a gigantic architect architect 's blueprint kind of paper and i know where to print it and we printed out the network and looked at it and that 's where we made our most important
  that this complicated network is just made of a handful of simple  repeating interaction patterns like motifs in a
 stained glass window we call them network motifs and they 're the elementary circuits that help us understand
 the logic of the way cells make decisions in all organisms including our body  
 soon enough after this i started being invited to give talks to thousands of scientists across the world but the knowledge about the cloud and saying
  and just stayed within my own lab because you see in science we don 't talk about the process  anything subjective or or emotional we talk about the results  
 so there was no way to talk about it in conferences that was unthinkable  
 and i saw scientists in other groups get stuck without even having a word to describe what they 're seeing  
 and their ways of thinking narrowed down to very safe paths their science didn 't reach its full potential and they were miserable
 i thought
 that 's the way it is i 'll try to make my lab as creative as possible and if everybody else does the same science will eventually become
 more and more better and better that way of thinking got turned on its head
 when by chance i went to hear evelyn fox keller give a talk about her experiences as a woman in science 
 and she asked why is it that we don 't talk about the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science  it 's not by chance
  's a matter of values 
 you see science seeks knowledge that 's objective and rational  that 's the beautiful thing about science  but we also have a cultural myth
 that the doing of science what we do every day to get that knowledge is also only objective and rational like mr spock
  and when you label something as objective and rational  automatically the other side the subjective and emotional
 become labeled
 or anti science or threatening to science and we just don 't talk about it  
 and when i heard that 
 that science has a culture  
 everything clicked into place for me because if science has a culture culture can be changed  and i can be a change agent working to change the culture of science wherever i could and so the very
  lecture i gave in a conference i talked about my science and then i talked about the importance of the subjective and emotional aspects of doing science and how we should talk about them and i looked at the audience  
 and they were cold  
 they couldn 't hear what i was saying in the context of a ten  back to back powerpoint presentation conference and i tried again and again conference after conference  
 but i wasn 't getting through  
 i was in the cloud 
 and eventually i managed to get out the cloud using
  improvisation and music
  since then every conference i go to i give a science talk and a second special talk called love and fear in the lab 
 and i start it off by doing a song about scientists ' greatest fear 
 which is that we work hard   we discover something new  and somebody else publishes it before we do
 and being scooped feels
 horrible it makes us afraid to talk to each other which is no fun because we came to science to share our ideas and to learn from each other  
 and so i do a blues song
  and i ask the audience to be my backup singers  and i tell them your text is ' scoop
  thank you
 for your backup singing  so everybody starts laughing  starts breathing notices that there 's other scientists around them with shared issues  and we start talking about the emotional and subjective things 
  that go on in research  it feels like a huge taboo has been lifted finally we can talk about this in a scientific conference  
  even started courses about the process of doing science  about going into the unknown together and many other things  so my vision is that just like every scientist knows the word 
 atom that matter is made out of atoms every scientist would know the words like the cloud saying yes and 
  and would also be much more playful and what i might ask you to remember from this talk is that next time you face a problem you can 't solve
 in work or in life there 's a word for what you 're going to see the cloud 
 and you can go through the cloud not alone but together with someone who is your source of support to say yes and to your ideas to help you say yes and to your own
  to increase the chance that through the wisps of the cloud you 'll find that moment of calmness where you get your first glimpse of your
 unexpected discovery your
