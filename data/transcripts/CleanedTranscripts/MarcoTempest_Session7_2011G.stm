  so magic is a very introverted field  while scientists regularly publish their latest research  we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets that 's true even amongst peers 
 but if you look at creative practice as a form of research or art as a form of
 r & d for humanity  
 then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research  now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic 
 and about three years ago  i started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open source software community
 to create new digital tools for magic
 tools that could eventually be
  shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster 
 today i 'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations it 's an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system or a digital storytelling tool could we bring down the lights please
  so let 's give this a try  
 and i 'm going to use it to give you my my take on the stuff of life
  i forgot the floor
 the
  you heard her  go ahead
