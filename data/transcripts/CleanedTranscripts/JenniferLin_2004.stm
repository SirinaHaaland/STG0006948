  like the speaker before me i am a ted virgin i guess  i 'm also the
  anderson invited me i 'm
 really grateful that i get a chance to play for everyone  
 and the song that i just played was by josef hofmann it 's called kaleidoscope and hofmann is a
 polish pianist and composer of the late
  and he 's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time
 i have another piece that i 'd like to play for you it 's called abegg variations by robert schumann a german
 but he wrote that for his wife 
 so actually if you listen carefully there are supposed to be five variations on this abegg theme
  it 's written around one thousand eight hundred and thirty four so even though it 's old i hope you 'll like it
  oh

  me that this session is called sync and flow i was wondering what do i know that these geniuses don 't 
 so i 'll talk about musical composition even though i don 't know where to start
  how do i compose  i think yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose what i do first
  i make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano
 and i choose one of those to become my main theme my main melody  like the abegg that you just heard 
 and once i choose my main theme  i have to decide out of all the styles in music what kind of style do i want 
 and this year i composed a romantic style so for inspiration i listened to liszt and tchaikovsky and all the great romantic composers 
 next i
 make the structure of the
  entire piece with my teachers  they help me plan out the whole piece  and then
 the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas because then you have to think 
 laughter and then when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form solidified excuse me solidified form you 're supposed to
 actually polish the piece polish the details and then polish the overall performance
 of the composition 
 and another thing that i enjoy doing is drawing  drawing because i like to draw you know japanese anime art  i think that 's a craze among teens right now
  and once i realized it there 's a parallel between creating music and creating art  because for your motive or your little
 initial idea for your drawing it 's your character you want to decide who you want to draw
 or if you want to draw an original character  and then you want to decide how are you going to draw the character 
 like am i going to use one page am i going to draw it on the computer am i going to use a two page spread like
 like a comic book for a more grandiose effect i guess  and then
 you have to do the initial sketch of the character which is like your structure of a piece  and then you add pen and pencil and whatever details that you need that 's polishing the
  drawing  and another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind  because i know
 i 'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted so
 if i 'm trying to do homework and i don 't feel like it i 'll try to draw
 or you know waste my time  and then what happens is sometimes i absolutely can 't draw or i can 't compose at all  and then it 's like there 's too much on your mind you can
  't focus on what you 're supposed to do and sometimes if you manage to use your time wisely and
 work on it you 'll get something out of it but it doesn 't come naturally
  what happens is if something magical happens if something natural happens to you you 're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly  
 and then that 's what i consider flow because that 's when everything clicks
  and you 're able to do anything you feel like you 're on top of your game and you can do anything you want
  i 'm not going to play my own composition today because although i did finish it it 's way too long
  instead i 'd like to try something called improvisation i have here seven note cards  one with each
 note of the musical alphabet and i 'd like someone to come up here and choose five
  to come up here and choose five and then i can make it into some sort of melody and i 'll improvise it
  would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose
  i 'm going to try to put that in some sort of order
  i 'm going to have a moment to think and i 'll try to make something out of it
  ok
  ok
  ok

  the next song or the encore that i 'm going to play is called
