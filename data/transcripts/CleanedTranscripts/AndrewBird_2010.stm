  to do something special today i want to debut a new song that i 've been working on in the last
 five or six months  and there 's few things more thrilling than playing a song
 for the first time in front of an audience especially when it 's 
 i 'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it because it gets into all sorts of
 crazy realms  and
 so this is basically a song about loops but not the kind of loops that i make up here they 're feedback loops and in the audio world that
 that 's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source and then it gets in this
  i 've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of of realms from  say the ecological okay  there seems to be
 a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from  it gets ugly so like you can 't feed
 cows their own brains or you get mad
  mad cow disease and
 inbreeding and incest and let 's see what 's the other one  biological there 's autoimmune diseases where the body attacks itself
 little too overzealously and destroys
 the the host or the person  and then
 okay this is where we get to the song kind of bridges the gap to the
  emotional  because although i 've used scientific terms in
 in songs it 's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical  
 and there 's some things you just don 't need to have in songs so i 'm
 trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody
  close my eyes sometimes
 and try to sleep  i can 't stop thinking about my own eyes and it 's like your eyes start straining to see themselves that 's what
 it feels like to me it 's not pleasant i 'm sorry if i put that idea in your head it 's impossible of course for your eyes to see themselves
  little more closer to a personal experience 
 or ears being able to hear themselves it 's just impossible that 's the thing  so 
 i 've been working on this song that mentions these
 things and then also imagines
 a person who 's who 's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they 're left to do the deed themselves
  if that 's possible and that 's what the song is asking all
 right it doesn 't have a name yet
 the
  's kind of cool songwriters can sort of get away with murder  you can throw out
 crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or
 graphs or
 research  but you know i think reckless curiosity would be what the world needs now just a little bit
 i 'm going to finish up with a song of mine called weather systems
  systems
