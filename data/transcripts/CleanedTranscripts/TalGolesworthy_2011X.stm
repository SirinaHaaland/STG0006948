  all about
 boilers and incinerators and fabric filters and cyclones and things like that but i also have marfan syndrome this is an inherited disorder  
  i participated in a genetic study and found to my horror as you can see from the slide 
 that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range the green line at the bottom everyone in here will be between 
  was already up at four point four and as you can see my aorta dilated progressively and i got closer and closer to
 the point where surgery was going to be necessary  the surgery on offer was pretty gruesome
 anesthetize you open your chest put you on an artificial heart and lung machine  
 drop your body temperature to about eighteen centigrade stop your heart  cut the aorta out replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta  
 and most importantly  commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation
  the thought of the surgery was not attractive  the thought of the warfarin was
 really quite frightening  
 so i said to myself i 'm an engineer i 'm in r & d this is just a plumbing problem i can do this i can change this so i set out
 to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation the project aim is really
  the only real problem with with the ascending aorta in people with marfan syndrome is that it lacks some tensile strength
  so the possibility exists to simply
 externally wrap the pipe 
 and it would remain stable and operate quite happily  if your high pressure hose pipe or hydraulic line bulges a little you just wrap some tape around
  really is that simple in concept  though not in execution  
 the great advantage of an external support for me was that i could retain all of my own bits all of my own endothelium and valves  and not need any anticoagulation therapy 
 so where do we start this is
 a sagittal slice through me in the middle you can see
  little structure squeezing out that 's the left ventricle pushing blood out through the aortic valve you can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there
 up into the ascending aorta 
 and it 's that part the ascending aorta  which
 dilates and ultimately
 bursts  which of course is fatal  we started by organizing image acquisition from magnetic resonance and ct imaging machines
  from which to make a model of the patient 's aorta  
 this is a model of my aorta  i 've got a real one in my pocket if anyone would like to look at it and play with it 
 laughter you can see it 's quite a complex structure it has a funny tri lobal shape at the bottom which contains the aortic valve 
 it then comes back into a round form and then tapers and curves off
  it 's quite a difficult structure to to produce 
 this is a sort of cad model of me and this this is one of the later cad models we went through an iterative process of producing
 better and better models when we produced that model 
 we turned it into a solid plastic model as you can see using a rapid prototyping technique  another engineering technique  we then
  used that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta  
 so this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really  every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke
 implant  once you 've made it the installation is quite easy  john pepper bless his heart
  professor of cardiothoracic surgery 
 never done it before in his life  he put the first one in didn 't like it he put the second one in happy  away i went four and a half hours on the table and everything was done 
 so the surgical implantation was actually the easiest part  
 if you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative the composite aortic root graft there are one or two startling comparisons which
 i 'm sure will be clear to all
  of you two hours to install one of our devices compared to six hours for the
 the existing treatment as i said 
 the existing treatment requires the heart lung bypass machine  and it requires a total body cooling  we don 't need any of that we work on a beating heart 
 he opens you up he accesses the aorta while your heart is beating all at the right temperature 
 no breaking into your circulatory system so it really is great
 but for me  absolutely the best point is there is no anticoagulation therapy
 required  i don 't take any drugs at all other than recreational ones that i would choose to take 
 laughter and in fact if you speak to people who are on long term warfarin it is a serious compromise to your quality of life  and even worse  it inevitably foreshortens your life
  likewise  if you have the artificial
  valve option you 're committed to antibiotic therapy whenever you have any intrusive
 medical treatment even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics in case you get an internal infection on the valve  
 again  i don 't have any of that so i 'm entirely free my artery is fixed 
 i haven 't got to worry about it which is
 a rebirth for me
  back to the theme of the presentation multidisciplinary research how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up
 producing a medical device which transforms his own life well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team this is a list of
 the core team  and you can see there aren 't only two principal
 technical disciplines there medicine and engineering but also there are various specialists from within those two disciplines
  john pepper was the cardiac surgeon who did all the the actual work on me  but everyone else had to contribute one way or another 
 raad mohiaddin a medical radiologist we had to get good quality images
 from which to make the cad model  
 warren thornton who still does all our cad models for us had to write a bespoke piece of cad code to produce this model from this really rather difficult
 input data set
 there are some barriers to this though there are some problems jargon is a big one i would think no one in this room understands the first 
 four jargon points  the engineers amongst you will recognize rapid prototyping and cad 
  understands all those four words 
 taking the jargon out was very important to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant when a particular phrase was used 
 our disciplinary conventions were funny as well  we took a lot of horizontal slice images through me  
 produced those slices and used them to build a cad model and the very first cad model we made the surgeons were playing with
  and couldn 't quite figure it out  and then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta and it was a mirror image because
 in the real world we always look down on plans plans of houses or streets or maps in the medical world they look up at plans  
 so the horizontal images were all in inversion 
 so one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not
  were another serious headache in the project the brompton hospital was taken over by the imperial college school of medicine and there are some seriously bad
 relationship problems between the two organizations i was working with the imperial and the brompton  and this generated some serious problems for the project really problems that shouldn 't exist 
 research & ethics committee if you want to do anything new in surgery  you have to get a
  from your local research & ethics i 'm sure it 's the same in poland there will be
 some form of equivalent which licenses new types of surgery  we didn 't only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that we also had
 professional jealousies there were people on the research & ethics committee who really didn 't want to see john pepper succeed again because he is so successful 
 and they made extra problems for us
  bureaucratic problems 
 ultimately when you have a new treatment you have to have a guidance note for all the hospitals in the country in the uk we have the national institute and clinical excellence you have an equivalent in poland no doubt and
 we had to get past the the nice
 problem we now have a great clinical
  on the net so any other hospitals interested can come along read the nice report get in touch with us and then get doing it themselves  
 funding barriers another big area to be to be concerned with 
 a big problem with understanding one of those perspectives when we first approached one of the big  charitable uk organizations that fund this kind
  they didn 't understand it they were doctors next to god it must be rubbish they binned it 
 so in the end i went after private investors  just gave up on it
 most r & d is going to be institutionally funded by the polish academy of sciences or the engineering and physical sciences research council or whatever  
 and you need to get past those people 
 jargon is a huge problem when you try to work
  in an engineering world we all understand cad and rp not in the medical world  
 i suppose the funding bureaucrats ultimately have to get their act together they 've really got to start talking to each other  and exercise a bit of imagination if that 's not too much to ask 
 which it probably is 
 i 've coined the phrase obstructive conservatism so many people in the medical world
  don 't want to change
 particularly when some jumped up engineer has come along with the answer they don 't want to change 
 they simply want to do whatever they 've done before and in fact many surgeons in the uk are still waiting for one of our patients to have some sort of an episode so that they could say told you that was no good 
 we 've actually got thirty patients at seven and a half years we 've got ninety  post op patient years between us and we haven 't had a
  it really is a problem i 'm sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance amongst medics doctors surgeons at some point
 the middle point is simply the the way that the doctors protect themselves well of course i 'm looking after my patient i think it 's
 not good but that
  again a huge problem if you work in a multidisciplinary team you 've got to give your guys the
 benefit of the doubt you 've got to express support for them tom treasure  professor of cardiothoracic surgery
  incredible guy  dead easy to give him respect  him giving me respect  slightly different that
 's all the bad news the good news is  the benefits are
  when you have a group of people with different professional training a different professional experience  they not only have a different knowledge base but also a different perspective on everything 
 and if you can bring them together and get them talking and understanding each other 
 the results can be spectacular  you can find really novel solutions that have never been looked at before very quickly and easily you can
 short cut huge amounts of work simply
 by using the extended knowledge base you have and as a result it  's an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you
 the result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress on incredibly small budgets
  i 'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that i 'm not prepared to tell you what it cost 
 because i suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments probably in the usa  which cost more
 for a one off patient than the cost of us getting from
 my dream to my reality 
 that 's all i want to say  and i 've got three minutes left so ewa 's going to like me
  if you have any questions please come up and talk to me later on it would be a pleasure to speak with you many
