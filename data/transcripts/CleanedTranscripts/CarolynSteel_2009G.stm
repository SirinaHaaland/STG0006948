  's one of the great questions of our time  yet it 's one that 's rarely asked  
 we take it for granted that if we go into a shop or or restaurant  or indeed into this theater 's foyer in about an hour 's time there is going to be food there waiting for us
  having magically come from somewhere 
 but when you think that every day for a city the size of london enough food has to be produced 
 transported  bought and sold  
 cooked  
 eaten disposed of and that something similar has to happen every day for every city
  it 's remarkable that cities get fed at all  
 we live in places like this as if they 're the most natural things in the world  
 forgetting that because we 're animals and that we need to eat we 're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were  
 and as more of us move into cities more of that natural world is being
 transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me it 's soybean fields in mato grosso in brazil
 in order to feed us 
 these are extraordinary landscapes but few of us ever get to see them  and increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either 
 as more of us move into cities more of us are eating meat so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals 
 and given that it takes three times as much
 grain actually ten times as much grain to feed a human if it 's passed through an animal first that 's not a very efficient way of feeding us 
 and it 's an escalating problem too 
 by two thousand and fifty it 's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities  and it 's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed 
 so
 meat and
  urbanism are rising hand in hand and that 's going to pose an enormous problem six
 billion hungry carnivores to feed by two thousand and fifty  
 that 's a big problem and actually if we carry on as we are it 's a problem we 're very unlikely to be able to solve 
 nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land although at the same time we 're losing an equivalent amount of
  existing arables to salinization and erosion we
 're very hungry for fossil fuels too it takes about ten calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the west  
 and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost we don 't actually value it
  half the food produced in the usa is currently thrown away  
 and to end all
  of this at the end of this long process we 're not even managing to feed the planet properly a billion of us are obese while a further billion starve  
 none of it makes very much sense and when you think that eighty percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations  
  a grim picture 
 as we 're moving into cities the world is also embracing a western diet  
 and if we look to the future  it 's an unsustainable diet  
 so how did we get here and more importantly what are we going to do about it  
 well to answer the slightly easier question first about ten thousand years ago i would say is the beginning of this process
 in the ancient near east known as the fertile crescent because as you can
 see it was crescent shaped and it was also
  fertile  
 and it was here about ten thousand years ago  that two extraordinary inventions agriculture and urbanism happened roughly in the same place and at the same time 
 this is no accident  because
 agriculture and cities are bound together  they need each other  
 because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was
 large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements  
 and if we look at what those settlements were like we see they were compact  they were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at ur  
 that were in fact  effectively spiritualized  central food
  because it was the temples that organized the harvest gathered in the grain offered it to the gods and then offered the grain that the gods didn 't eat back to the people
  so if you like the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them 
 and in fact that 's true of every ancient city  but of course not all of them were that small
  had about a million citizens by the first century a d so how did a city like this
 feed itself 
 the answer is what i call ancient food miles 
 basically rome had access to the sea which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away  this is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world because it was very difficult to transport food over roads which were
  and the food obviously went off very quickly  
 so rome effectively waged war on places like carthage and egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves and in fact  you could say that the expansion of the empire was really sort of one
 long drawn out militarized shopping spree really 
 in fact i love the fact i just have to mention this rome in fact used to import oysters from london at one stage i think that 's extraordinary so rome shaped its hinterland
 through its appetite  
 but the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre industrial world if we look at a map of london in the 17th century we can see that its grain  which is coming in from the thames along the bottom of this map 
 so the grain markets were to the south of the city  and the roads leading up from them to
  which was the main market were also grain markets and if you look at the name of one of those streets bread street you can tell what was going on there three hundred years ago 
 and the same of course was true for fish fish was of course coming in by river as well same thing and of course billingsgate famously was london 's fish market  operating on site here until the
  which is extraordinary really when you think about it  
  everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port
 this is another thing about food in cities once its roots into the city are established 
 they very rarely move meat is a very different story because of course animals could walk into the city  so much of london 's meat was coming from the northwest from scotland and wales  
  coming in and arriving at the city at the northwest which is why smithfield london 's very famous meat market was located up there poultry was coming in from east anglia and so on to the northeast i feel a bit like a weather woman doing this anyway 
 and so the birds were coming in
 with their feet protected with little canvas shoes  and then when they hit the eastern end of cheapside that 's where they were sold which is why it 's called
  in fact if you look at the map of any city
 built before the industrial age you can trace food coming in to it you can actually see how it was physically shaped by food both by reading
  the names of the streets which give you a lot of clues  friday street in a previous life is where you went to buy your fish on a friday  
 and thirty you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from in fact if you were having sunday lunch the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier  
 so this was obviously an organic city part of an organic cycle  
 and then ten years later everything changed this is an image of the great western in one thousand eight hundred and forty and as you can see some of the
  earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep  
 so all of a sudden these animals are no longer walking into market  they 're being slaughtered out of sight and mind somewhere in the countryside and they 're coming into the city by rail  and this changes everything 
 to start off with it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities really any size and shape in any place cities used to be constrained by geography
  to have to get their food through very difficult physical means all of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography  
 and as you can see from these maps of london in the ninety years after the trains came it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot 
 and so on to a large splurge that would be very very difficult to feed with anybody on foot either animals or people
 and of course that was just the beginning after the trains came cars  and really this marks the end of this process it 's the final emancipation 
  of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all  and this is the kind of city that 's devoid of smell devoid of mess certainly devoid of people because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape 
  to a box somewhere on the outskirts came back with a week 's worth of shopping 
 and wondered what on earth to do with it  
 and this really is the moment when our relationship both with food and cities changes completely here we have food that used to be the center the social core of the city
  at the periphery it used to be a social event buying and selling food now it 's anonymous 
 or a little bit of an egg if you 're making a cake or something we don 't smell food to see if it 's okay to eat we just
 read the back of a label on a packet  and we don 't value food  
 we don 't trust it  so instead of trusting it we fear it and instead of valuing it  we throw it away 
 one of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they 've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder 
 by making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place  they 've actually distanced us from our most important relationship  which is that of us and nature 
 and also they 've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver that as we 've seen are unsustainable  
  's not a new question  five hundred years ago it 's what thomas more was asking himself this is the frontispiece of his book utopia and it was a series of 
  if that sounds remotely familiar a day 's walk from one another where everyone was basically 
 and grew vegetables in their back gardens and ate communal meals together and so on and i think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of utopia 
 even though more never framed it that way
 and here is another very famous utopian vision that of ebenezer howard the garden city same idea series of 
 little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around joined to one another by railway and again food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision 
 it even got built but nothing to do with this vision that howard had and that is the problem with these
 utopian ideas that they are utopian  utopia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately it was a kind of joke 
 because it 's got a double derivation from the greek it can either mean a good place  or no place  because it 's an ideal  it 's an imaginary thing we can 't have it  and i think as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling  
 that makes it not much use  so i 've come up with an
  alternative  
 which is sitopia from the ancient greek sitos for food and topos for place i believe we already live in sitopia  we live in a world shaped by food and if we 
  realize that we can use food as a really powerful tool a conceptual tool design tool to shape the world differently  
  well i think it looks a bit like this  i have to use this slide it 's just the look on the face of the dog but anyway  this is 
 it 's food at the center of life at the center of family life being celebrated being enjoyed people taking time for it
  this is where food should be in our society but you can 't have scenes like this unless you have people like this by the way these can be
 people who think about food who think ahead  who plan who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them we need these people we 're part of a network
 because without these kinds of people we can 't have places like this here i deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable  but
 networks markets where food is being grown locally it 's common it 's fresh it 's part of the social life of the city  because without that you can 't have this kind of place
  food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape and is not just a zero sum commodity off in some unseen hell hole cows with a view  
 steaming piles of humus this is basically bringing the whole thing together  
 and this is a community project i visited recently in toronto it 's a greenhouse where kids get told all about food and growing their own food 
 here is a plant called kevin or maybe it
 a plant belonging to a kid called kevin i don 't know but anyway  these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important  
 so sitopia for me is really a way of seeing it
 's basically recognizing that sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere the trick is to join them up
  to use food as a way of seeing  
 and if we do that we 're going to stop seeing cities as big metropolitan unproductive blobs like this 
 we 're going to see them more like this as part of the productive organic framework of which they are inevitably a part symbiotically connected  but of course that 's not a great image 
  either because we need not to be producing food like this anymore we need to be thinking more about permaculture
  which is why i think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing it 's a 
 of the way food shapes our lives
  we can use food as a really powerful tool
