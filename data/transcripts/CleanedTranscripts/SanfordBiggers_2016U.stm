  as a conceptual artist i 'm constantly looking for creative ways to spark challenging conversations  
 i do this though painting sculpture video and performance  but regardless of the format two of my favorite materials
  glass depiction of a lotus blossom 
 in buddhism the lotus is a symbol for transcendence and for purity of mind and spirit  but a closer look at this lotus
 reveals each petal to be the cross section of a slave ship 
 this iconic diagram was taken from a british slaving manual and later used by abolitionists to show the atrocities of slavery
 in america we don 't like to talk about slavery  
 nor do we look at it as a global industry  but by using this buddhist symbol i hope to universalize and transcend the history and trauma of black america
 and encourage discussions about our shared past 
 to create lotus we carved over six thousand figures and this later led to a commission by the city of new york to create a
  28 foot version in steel as a permanent installation at the eagle academy for young men a school for black and latino students the two groups most affected by this history 
 the same two groups are very affected by a more recent phenomenon  but let me digress  
 i 've been collecting wooden african figures from tourist shops and flea markets around the
  the authenticity and origin of them is completely debatable but people believe these to be imbued with power or even magic  
 only recently have i figured out how to use this in my own work gun
 since two thousand and twelve the world has witnessed the killings of
  brown eric garner  sandra bland tamir rice and literally countless other unarmed black citizens at the hands of the police  who frequently walk away with no punishment at all 
 in consideration of these victims and the several times that even i a law abiding ivy league professor have been targeted and harassed at gunpoint by the police  
 i created this body of work simply entitled
 it was important to erase the identity of each of these figures to make them all look the same
 and easier to disregard to do this i dip them in a thick brown wax before taking them to a shooting range where i re sculpted them using bullets 
 and it was fun  playing with big guns and high speed video cameras  
  but my reverence for these figures kept me from actually pulling the trigger  somehow feeling as if i would be shooting myself 
 finally my cameraman  raul fired the shots  
 i then took the fragments of these and created molds and cast them first in wax 
 and finally in bronze like the image you see here which bears the marks of its violent creation like battle wounds or scars  
 when i showed this work recently in miami a woman told me she felt every gun shot to her soul
 but she also felt that these artworks
 memorialized the victims of these killings as well as other victims of racial violence throughout us history  
 but lotus and bam are larger than just us history  while showing in berlin last year a philosophy student asked me what prompted these recent killings 
 i showed him a photo
 of a lynching postcard
  and reminded him that these killings have been going on for over five hundred years  
 but it 's only through questions like his and more thoughtful dialogue about history and race can we evolve as individuals and society  i hope my artwork creates
 a safe space for this type of honest exchange and an opportunity for people to engage one another in real and necessary conversation
