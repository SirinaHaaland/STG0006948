  like most journalists i 'm an idealist i love unearthing good stories especially untold stories 
 i just didn 't think that in two thousand and eleven women would still be in that
  i 'm the president of the journalism and women symposium jaws that 's sharky 
 i joined ten years ago because i wanted female role models and i was frustrated by the lagging status of women in our profession and what that meant for our image in the media 
 we make up half the population of the world but we 're just twenty four percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories
  and we 're just twenty percent of the experts quoted in stories  and now with today 's technology  it 's possible to remove women from the picture completely 
 this is a picture of president barack obama and his advisors tracking the killing of osama bin laden  you can see hillary clinton on the right let
 's see how the photo ran in an orthodox jewish newspaper based in brooklyn 
  the paper apologized but said it never runs photos of women they might be sexually provocative 
 this is an extreme case yes  but the fact is women are only nineteen percent of the sources in stories on politics and only twenty percent in stories on the economy 
 the news continues to give us a picture where men outnumber women in nearly all occupational categories except two
  students
 and homemakers so we all get a very distorted picture of reality  
 the problem is of course there aren 't enough women in newsrooms they report at just  thirty seven percent of stories in print tv and radio  
 even in stories on gender based violence men get an overwhelming majority of print space and airtime case in point 
 this march the new york
  times ran a story by james mckinley about a gang rape of a young girl eleven years old in a small texas town 
 mckinley writes that the community is wondering how could their boys have been drawn into this 
 drawn into this like they were seduced into committing an act of violence and the first person he quotes says these boys will have to live with this the rest of their lives
 laughter you don 't hear much about the 11 year old victim  except that she wore clothes that were a little old for her
 and she wore makeup  
 the times was deluged with criticism  
 initially it defended itself and said these aren 't our views this is what we found in our reporting now here 's a secret you probably know already  
 your stories are constructed as reporters we research we interview
  we try to give a good picture of reality  we also have our own unconscious biases 
 but the times makes it sound like anyone would have reported this story the same way  
 i disagree with that 
 so three weeks later  the times revisits the story this time it adds another byline to it with mckinley 's
  erica goode 
 what emerges is a truly sad horrific tale of a young girl and her family trapped in poverty she was raped numerous times by many men 
 she had been a bright  easygoing girl she was maturing quickly physically  but her bed was still covered with stuffed animals it
 's a very different picture 
 perhaps the addition of ms goode is what made this story more complete 
 the global media monitoring project has found that stories by female reporters are more likely to
  challenge stereotypes than those by male reporters 
 at kunm here in albuquerque elaine baumgartel did some graduate research on the coverage of violence against women 
 what she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims and devalue their lives  they tend to sensationalize  and they lack context  
 so for her graduate work she did a three part series on the murder of eleven women found buried on albuquerque 's west mesa 
 she tried to challenge
  those patterns and stereotypes in her work and she tried to show the challenges that journalists face from external sources their own internal biases and cultural norms 
 and she worked with an editor at national public radio to try to get a story aired nationally  she 's not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female 
 stories in the news are more than twice as likely to present women as victims than men
 and women are more likely to be defined by their body parts wired magazine november
  here 's the thing wired almost never puts women on its cover oh there have been some gimmicky ones pam from the office manga girls 
 a voluptuous model covered in synthetic diamonds 
 texas state university professor cindy royal wondered in her blog how are young women like her students supposed to feel about their roles in technology  reading wired 
 chris anderson the editor
  wired defended his choice and said there aren 't enough women prominent women in technology to sell a cover to sell an issue 
 part of that is true there aren 't as many prominent women in technology  here 's my problem with that argument 
 media tells us every day what 's important by the stories they choose and where they place them  it 's called agenda setting  
 how many people knew the founders of facebook and google
  before their faces were on a magazine cover  putting them there made them more recognizable 
 now fast company magazine embraces that idea 
 this is its cover from november fifteen two thousand and ten  the issue is about the most prominent and influential women in technology 
 editor robert safian told the poynter institute silicon valley is very white
  and very male  but that 's not what fast company thinks the business world will look like in the future  so it tries to give a picture of where the globalized world is moving 
 by the way apparently wired took all this to heart this was its issue in april 
 that 's limor fried the founder of adafruit industries in the rosie the riveter pose 
 it would help to have more women in positions of leadership in media a recent global survey found that
  jobs are still held by men  but this is also about something far more complex our own unconscious biases and blind spots  
 shankar vedantam is the author of the hidden brain how our unconscious minds elect presidents control markets wage wars and save our lives 
 he told the former former ombudsman at national public radio who was doing a report on how women fare in npr coverage unconscious bias flows
  throughout most of our lives it 's really difficult to disentangle those strands  but he did have one suggestion  he used to work for
 two editors who said every story had to have at least one female source 
 he balked at first  but said he eventually followed the directive happily because his stories got better and his job got easier  
 now i don 't know if one of the editors was a woman  but that
  can make the biggest difference  the dallas morning news won a pulitzer prize in 
 for a series it did on women around the world but one of the reporters told me she 's convinced it never would have happened if they had not had a female assistant foreign editor 
 and they would not have gotten some of those stories without female reporters and editors on the ground  particularly one on female genital mutilation men would just not be
  allowed into those situations 
 this is an important point to consider  because much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries where the treatment of women is an issue 
 such as afghanistan 
 what we 're told in terms of arguments against leaving this country is that the fate of the women is
  i 'm sure a male reporter in kabul can find women to interview not so sure about rural  traditional areas 
 where i 'm guessing women can 't talk to strange men  
 it 's important to keep talking about this in light of lara logan  she was the cbs news correspondent
 who was brutally sexually assaulted in egypt 's tahrir square  right after this photo was taken  almost immediately pundits weighed in blaming her
 and saying things like
 maybe women shouldn 't be sent to cover those stories i never heard anyone say this about anderson cooper and his crew who were attacked covering the same story 
 one way to get more women into leadership is to have other women mentor them 
 one of my board members is an editor at a major global media company but she never thought about this as a career
  until she met female role models at jaws  but this is not just a job for 
 or my organization you all have a stake in a strong vibrant media  
 analyze your news 
 and speak up when there are gaps missing in coverage like people at the new york times did suggest female sources to reporters and editors 
 remember a complete picture of reality may depend upon it and i
 'll leave you with a video clip that i first saw in
  london  it 's for the guardian newspaper it 's actually long before i ever thought about becoming a journalist but i was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world
 but it 's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what 's going on
