  going to be clear in a moment  maybe a sobering thought
  and i suspect many of you gave something to the people of haiti this year and there is something else i believe in the back of your mind
 you also know that
 is every day twenty five thousand children die of entirely preventable causes  
 that 's a haiti earthquake every eight days  
 and i suspect many of you probably gave something towards that problem as well  but somehow it doesn 't happen with the same
  intensity  so why is that  
 well here is a thought experiment for you 
 imagine you have a few million dollars that you 've raised maybe you 're a politician in a developing country and you have a budget to spend you want to spend it on the poor  
 how do you go about it  
 do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money that we know how to eradicate poverty we just need
  to do more or
 do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help 
 on the contrary it might hurt it might exacerbate corruption  dependence etc or
 maybe you turn to the past after all we have spent billions of dollars on aid  maybe you look at the past and see has it done any good 
 and sadly we don 't know  and worst of all we will never know
 the reason is that take africa for example africans have already got a lot of aid these are the blue bars  
 and the gdp in africa is not making much progress 
 okay fine  how do you know what would have happened without the aid  maybe it would have been much worse  
 or maybe it would have been better we have no idea  we don 't know what the counterfactual is there 's only one africa
  so what do you do to give the aid and hope and pray that something comes out of it  or do you focus on your everyday life and let the
 earthquake every eight days continue to happen  the thing is  if we don 't know whether we are doing any good 
 we are not any better than the medieval doctors and their leeches  
 sometimes the patient gets better  sometimes the patient
  leeches is it something else  we don 't know  
 so here are some other questions they 're smaller questions  but they are not that small 
 immunization  that 's the cheapest way to save a child 's life 
 and the world has spent a lot of money on it the gavi and the gates foundations are each pledging a lot of money towards it and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort  
 and yet
 every year at least twenty five million children do not get the immunization they should get 
 so this is what you call a last mile problem 
 the technology is there  
 the infrastructure is there and yet it doesn 't happen  so you have your million how do you use your million to solve this last mile problem  
 and here 's another question
  kills almost nine hundred thousand people every year  
 most of them in sub saharan africa  most of them under five in fact that is the leading cause of under five mortality  
 we already know how to kill malaria  but some people come to you and say you have your millions how about bed nets 
 bed nets are very
  ten dollars you can manufacture and ship an insecticide treated bed net and you can teach someone to use them 
 and not only do they protect the people who sleep under them but they have these great contagion benefits 
 if half of a community sleeps under a net  the other half also benefits because the contagion of the disease spread  
 and yet only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net  societies should be willing to go out and subsidize the net give them for free or for that matter pay people to use
  them because of those contagion benefits 
 not so fast say other people if you give the nets for free people are not going to value them  
 they 're not going to use them or at least they 're not going to use them as bed nets  maybe as fishing nets 
 so what do you do do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage or do you make people pay in order to make sure that they really value them  how do you know  
 and a third question
 education maybe that 's the solution maybe we should send kids to school but how do you do that 
 do you hire teachers  do you build more schools do you provide school lunch  how do you know  
 so here is the thing  i cannot answer the big question  whether aid did any good or not but these three questions  i can answer them  
  and in the 20th century randomized controlled trials have revolutionized medicine
 by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that don 't work 
 and you can do the same randomized controlled trial for social policy  
 you can put social innovation to the same rigorous  scientific tests that we use for drugs and in this way  you can take the
  guesswork out of 
 by knowing what works what doesn 't work and why 
 and i 'll give you some examples with those three questions  
 so i start with immunization here 's udaipur district rajasthan  beautiful  
 well when i started working there about one percent of children were fully immunized  that 's bad  but there are places like that
  now it 's not because the vaccines are not there they are there and they are free and it 's not because parents do not care about their kids the same child that is not immunized against measles  if they do get measles parents will spend thousands of rupees to help them  
 so you get these empty village  subcenters and crowded hospitals so what is the problem
  part of the problem surely is people do not fully understand  after all in this country as well  all sorts of myths and misconceptions go around immunization  
 so if that 's the case that 's difficult  because persuasion is really difficult  
 but maybe there is another problem as well  it 's going from intention to action  
 imagine you are a mother in udaipur district  rajasthan you have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized  and maybe when you get there what you find is this the subcenter is closed
  you have to come back and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do you will always tend to postpone and postpone and eventually it gets too late well 
 if that 's the problem  then that 's much easier because a we can make it easy 
 and b we can maybe give people a reason to act today rather than wait till tomorrow 
  so these are simple ideas but we didn 't know so let 's try them  
 so what we did is we did a randomized controlled trial in one hundred and thirty four villages in udaipur districts 
 so the blue dots are selected randomly we made it easy i 'll tell you how in a moment in the red dots  we made it easy and gave people a reason to act now  
 the white dots are comparisons  nothing changed  
 so we make it easy by organizing this monthly camp where people can get their kids immunized  and then you
  make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization 
 now a kilo of lentils is tiny  it 's never going to convince anybody to do something that they don 't want to do 
 on the other hand if your problem is you tend to postpone  then it might give you a reason to act today rather than later  
  everything is the same that 's the beauty of randomization
 the camp just having the camp increases immunization from six percent to seventeen percent that 's full immunization  that 's not bad  that 's a good improvement 
 add the lentils and you reach to thirty eight percent so here you 've got your answer 
 make it easy and give a kilo of lentils you multiply immunization rate
  but it 's not sustainable we cannot keep giving lentils to people well it turns out it 's wrong economics because it is cheaper to give lentils than not to give them  since you have to pay for the nurse anyway  
 the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don 't 
 how about bed nets  should you give them for free or should you ask people to pay for them  
 so the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions one is
  must pay for a bed net are they going to purchase them  the second one is if i give bed nets for free are people going to use them  
 and the third one is do free bed nets discourage future purchase the third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts  it might destroy markets to distribute free bed
  now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric  
 it 's more ideological than practical  but it turns out it 's an easy question we can know the answer to this question we can just run an experiment  
 and many experiments have been run and they all have the same results so i 'm just going to talk to you about one 
 and this one that was in kenya they went around and distributed to people vouchers discount vouchers
  so people with their voucher could get the bed net in the local pharmacy  
 and some people get one hundred percent discount and some people get twenty percent discounts and some people get fifty percent discount etc 
 and now we can see what happens 
 so how about the purchasing  
 well what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets  the coverage rate really falls down a lot so even with partial subsidy three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net and now you only have twenty percent of the people with
  bed nets  you lose the health immunity that 's not great  
 second thing is how about the use 
 well the good news is people if they have the bed nets  will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it if they get it for free they use it if they have to pay for it they use it  
 how about the long term  in the long term people who got the free bed nets
  one year later were offered the option to purchase a bed net at two dollars  
 and people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn 't get a free one 
 so people do not get used to handouts they get used to nets  maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit 
 so that 's for bed nets so you will think that 's great you know how to immunize kids you know how to give bed nets 
 but what politicians need is a range of options they need to know out of
  all the things i could do what is the best way to achieve my goals  
 so suppose your goal is to get kids into school there are
 so many things you could do you could pay for uniforms  you could eliminate fees  you could build latrines you could give girls sanitary pads etc etc  
 so what 's the best well at some level we think all of these things should work
  if we think they should work intuitively should we go for them  well in business that 's certainly not the way we would go about it  
 consider for example transporting goods 
 before the canals were invented in britain before the industrial revolution goods used to go on horse carts  
 and then canals were built  and with the same horseman and the same horse you could
 carry ten times as much cargo  so should they have continued
  to carry the goods on the horse carts  on the ground that they would eventually get there well if that had been the case there would have been no industrial revolution  
 so why shouldn 't we do the same with social policy  
 in technology we spend so much time experimenting fine tuning getting the absolute cheapest way to do something so why aren 't we doing that with social policy
  what you can do is answer a simple question  suppose you have one hundred dollars to spend on various interventions  
 how many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars now i
 'm going to show you what we get with various education interventions  
 so the first ones are if you want the usual suspects hire teachers  school meals  school uniforms
  not bad for your hundred dollars  you get between one and three extra years of education 
 things that don 't work so well is bribing parents just because so many kids are already going to school that you end up spending a lot of money  
 and here are the most surprising results  
 tell people the benefits of education  
 that 's very cheap to do so for every hundred dollars you spend doing that you get forty extra years of education 
 and in places where there are worms
  intestinal worms  cure the kids of their worms  and for every hundred dollars you get almost thirty extra years of education 
 so this is not your intuition this is not what people would have gone for  and yet these are the programs that work 
 we need that kind of information we need more of it  and then we need to guide policy  
 so now i started from the big problem and i couldn 't answer it  and i cut it
 smaller questions  and i have the answer to these smaller questions  and they are good  scientific robust answers 
 so let 's go back to haiti for a moment 
 in haiti about two hundred thousand people died actually a bit more by the latest estimate  
 and the response of the world was great two billion dollars got pledged just last month  so that 's about ten thousand dollars per death
  that doesn 't sound like that much when you think about it  
 but if we were willing to spend ten thousand dollars for every child under five who dies that would be ninety billion per year just for that problem  
 and yet it doesn 't happen  so why is that well 
 i think what part of the problem is that in
  although the problem is huge  somehow we understand it it 's localized you give your money to doctors without borders you give your money to partners in health and they 'll send in the doctors and they 'll send in the lumber  and they 'll helicopter things out and in 
 and the problem of poverty is not like that 
 so first it 's mostly invisible  second it 's huge  
 and third we don 't know whether we are doing the right thing there 's no silver bullet  you cannot helicopter people out of poverty  and that 's very frustrating 
  we just did today  i gave you three simple answers to three questions  
 give lentils to immunize people provide free bed nets  deworm children 
 with immunization or bed nets you can save a life for three hundred dollars per life saved with deworming you can get an extra year of education for three dollars  
 so we cannot eradicate poverty just yet but we can get started and maybe we
  get started small with things that we know are effective here
 's an example of how this can be powerful  deworming worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines  they are not beautiful and don 't kill anybody  
 and yet when the young global leader in davos showed the numbers i gave you they started deworm the world and thanks to deworm the world
  and the effort of many country governments and foundations twenty million school aged children got dewormed in two thousand and nine so this evidence is powerful  it can prompt action  
 so we should get started now it 's not going to be easy  
 it 's a very slow process you have to keep experimenting and sometimes ideology has to be trumped by practicality  
 and sometimes what works somewhere doesn 't work elsewhere  so it 's a slow process  
 but there is no other way 
 these economics i 'm proposing it 's like
 20th century medicine it 's a slow deliberative process
 of discovery there is no miracle cure  
 but modern medicine is saving millions of lives every year  and we can do the same thing  
 and now maybe we can go back to the bigger question that i started with at the beginning
  i cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference  
 but can we come back here in thirty years and say what we have done  it really prompted a change for the better 
 i believe we can and i hope we will thank you
