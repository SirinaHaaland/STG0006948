  my name is harry baker harry baker is my name if your name was harry baker then our names would be the same
  on the wrong side of the bed  
 realizes all his hair is on one side of his head takes just under a minute to work out that its because of the way that he slept he finds some clothes and gets dressed 
 he cant help but look in the mirror and be subtly impressed how he looks rough around the edges and yet casually messed and as he glances out the window he sees the sight that he gets blessed with of sixty from across the street  
 now sixty was beautiful with
 perfectly trimmed cuticles dressed in something suitable never rude or crude at all unimprovable right on time as usual more on cue than a snooker ball but
  to play it super cool
 fifty nine wanted to tell her that he knew her favorite flower  
 he thought of her every second every minute every hour but he knew it wouldnt work hed never get the girl because although she lived across the street they came from different
  was one hundred and one dalmatians she preferred the sequel  
 he romanticized the idea they were star crossed lovers they could overcome the odds and evens because they had each other while she maintained the strict views imposed on her by her mother that separate could not be equal  
 and though at the time he felt stupid and dumb for trying to love a girl controlled by her
 stupid mum he should have been comforted by the simple sum  take fifty nine away from sixty  and youre left with the one
 sure enough after two months of moping around sixty one days later sixty one was who he found he
 had lost his keys and his parents were out so one day after school he went into a house as he noticed the slightly wonky numbers on the door he wondered why hed never introduced himself before as she let him in his jaw dropped in awe sixty one was like sixty 
 but a little bit more laughter
 she had prettier eyes and an approachable smile
 and like him rough around the edges casual style and like him everything was in disorganized piles and like him her mum didnt mind if friends stayed a while because she was like him  and he liked her he
 reckoned she would like him if she knew he was like her and it was different this time i mean this girl was wicked so he plucked up the courage and asked for her digits she said
  come over to mine she said sure she loved talking to someone just as quirky
 she agreed to this unofficial first date in the end he was only ready one minute early but it didnt matter because she arrived one minute late and from that moment on
 there was nonstop chatter how they loved x factor how they had two factors how that did not matter
  distinctiveness made
 one of a kind girl in his life he told her the very definition of being prime was that with only one and himself could his heart divide and
 she was the one he wanted to give his heart to 
 she said she felt the same and now she knew the films were half true because that wasn 't real love that love was just a sample when it came to real love they were a prime example
  which turned out to be a prime number themed poetry competition  and i became a prime number themed poetry competition winner or as i like to call it a prime minister
 if you don 't know what a poetry slam is it was a format come up with in america thirty years ago as a way of tricking people into going to poetry events
 by putting an exciting word like slam on the end and
 each performer got three minutes to perform and then random audience members would hold up scorecards  and they would end up with a numerical score and what this meant
  it kind of broke down the barrier between performer and audience and and encouraged the kind of connection with the listener and what it also means is is you can win
  and if you win a poetry slam you can call yourself a slam champion
 and pretend you 're a wrestler  and if you lose a poetry slam you can say 
  a subjective art form you can 't put numbers on such things but
 i loved it and i got involved
  slam champion and got invited to the poetry world cup
 in paris  which was unbelievable it was people from all around the world speaking in their native languages to be judged by five french strangers 
 and
 somehow i won  which was great  and i 've been able to travel the world since doing it but it also means that this next piece is
  according to five french strangers  so this is paper people 
 i like people  
 i 'd like some paper people theyd be purple paper people maybe pop up purple paper people proper pop up purple paper
 how do you prop up pop up purple paper people i hear you cry
 i id probably prop up proper pop up purple paper people with a proper  pop up purple people paperclip but id pre prepare appropriate adhesives as alternatives a cheeky pack of blu tack just in case the paper slipped  because
  without appropriate apologies thered be a little paper me  and a little paper you and we could watch paper tv and it would all be 
  see the poppy paper rappers rap about their paper package or watch paper people carriers get stuck in paper traffic on the a4 paper 
  be a paper princess kate
 but wed all stare at paper pippa and then wed all live in fear of killer jack the paper ripper 
 because the paper propaganda propagates the people 's prejudices papers printing pictures of the photogenic terrorists a little paper me  
 and a little paper you and in a pop up population peoples problems pop up too thered be a pompous paper parliament who remained out of touch and who ignored the people
  protests about all the paper cuts then the peaceful paper protests would get blown to paper pieces by the confetti cannons manned by pre emptive police and yes
 thered still be paper money  
 so thered still be paper greed  
 and the paper piggy bankers pocketing more than they need purchasing the potpourri to pepper their paper properties others live in poverty and aint acknowledged properly a proper poor economy where so many are proper poor but
 while their needs are ignored the money goes to big wars origami armies unfold plans for paper planes and we remain imprisoned in our own paper chains but the greater shame
  shame is that
 it always seems to stay the same what changes is whos in power choosing how to lay the blame theyre naming names forgetting these are names of people 
 because in the end it all comes down to people  i like people '
 cause even when the situations dire it is only ever people who are able to inspire and on paper 
 its hard to see how we all cope  but in the bottom of pandoras box theres still hope and i still hope
  i believe in people people like my grandparents who every single day since i was born have taken time out of their morning to pray for me
 thats seven thousand eight hundred and ninety two days straight of someone checking im okay and thats amazing 
 people like my aunt who puts on plays with prisoners people who are capable of genuine forgiveness
  the persecuted palestinians people who go out of their way to make your life better and expect nothing in return you see people
 have potential to be powerful 
 just because the people in power tend to pretend to be victims we dont need to succumb to that system  and a paper population is no different
 theres a little paper me  and a little paper you and in a pop up population people 's problems pop up too but even if the whole world fell apart then wed still make it through 
  got time for one more for me poetry has been the ultimate way of
  ideas without frontiers when i first started the people who inspired me were the ones with the amazing stories and
  with a happy life it was too normal  but i could create these worlds where i could talk about my experiences and dreams and beliefs  so
 it 's amazing to be here in front of you today thank you for being here if you weren 't here it would be pretty much like the sound check yesterday 
  this is more fun so this last one is called the sunshine kid thank you very much for listening 
 old man sunshine was proud of his sun 
 and it brightened his day to see his little boy run not because of what hed done nor the problems overcome but that despite that his disposition remained a sunny one 
 it hadnt always been like this 
 thered been times when hed tried to hide his brightness
  every star hits periods of hardship it takes a brighter light to inspire them through the darkness  if we go back
 to when he was born in a nebula we know that he never was thought of as regular because he had a flair about him 
 to say the midas touch is wrong but all he went near seemed to turn a little bronze yes this sun
 was loved by some more than others it was a case of joseph and his dreamcoat and his brothers because standing out from the crowd had its pros and its cons and jealousy created
  enemies in those he outshone such as the shadow people
 now the shadow people didnt like the sunshine kid
 because he showed up the dark things the shadow people did and when he shone he showed the places where the shadow people hid so the shadow people had an evil plan to get rid of him first up
 they made fun of his sunspots  
 shooting his dreams from the sky their words were gunshots designed to remind him he wasnt very cool and he didnt fit in with any popular kids at school they said his head was up in space and they would bring him down to earth essentially he came from nothing and
  was worth hed never get to go to university to learn only degrees hed ever show would be the first degree burns from those that came too close they
 told him he was too bright thats why no one ever looked him in the eyes his judgment became clouded
 so did the sky with evaporated tears as the sun started to cry because the sunshine kid was bright  with a warm
  and inside he burned savagely hurt by the words and curses of the shadowy folk who spoke holes in his soul and left cavities and as his heart hardened 
 his spark darkened 
 every time they called him names it cooled his flames  he thought they might like him if he kept his light dim but they were busy telling lightning she had terrible aim  
 he couldnt quite get to grips with what they said  
 so he let his light be eclipsed by what
  he fell into a lone star state like texas and felt like hed been punched in his solar plexus but
 thats when little miss sunshine came along
 singing her favorite song about how were made to be strong and you dont have to be wrong to belong just be true to who you are because
 we are all stars at heart little miss sunshine was hot stuff 
 the kind of girl when you looked at her
 you forgot stuff
  was no forgetting her the minute he saw her her image burned in his retina she was out of this world and she accepted him
 something about this girl meant he knew whenever she was next to him things werent as dark as they seemed and he dared to dream shadows were nowhere to be seen when she was there he beamed his eyes would light up
 in ways that cant be faked 
 when she grinned her rays erased the razor tipped words of hate they gave each other nicknames they were cool star and fun sun and gradually the shadowy damage became undone 
 she was one in a
 septillion and she was brilliant could turn the coldest blooded reptilians vermillion loved by billions from chileans to brazilians and
 taught the sunshine kid the meaning of resilience she said all the darkness in the world cannot put out the light from a single candle
 so how the hell can they handle your light only you
 can choose to dim it and the sky is the limit so silence the critics by burning  
 and if eyes are windows to the soul then she drew back the curtains and let the sun shine through the hurting
 in a universe of adversity these stars stuck together  and though days became nights the memories would last forever whether the weatherman said it or not  it would be fine ' cause even behind the clouds the kid could still shine yes the sunshine kid was bright  
 with a warm personality  and inside he burned savagely fueled by the fire inspired across galaxies
 by the girl who showed him belief
