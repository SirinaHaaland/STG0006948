  this meeting has really been about a digital revolution but i 'd like to argue
 that it 's done we won 
 we 've had a digital revolution but we don 't need to keep having it and i 'd like to look after that to look what comes after the digital revolution  
 so let me start
  projecting forward these are some projects i 'm involved in today at mit  looking what comes after computers  this first one 
 internet zero up here
 this is a web server that has the cost and complexity of an rfid tag about a dollar that can go in every light bulb and doorknob  and this is getting commercialized
  and what 's interesting about it isn 't the cost it 's the way it encodes the internet it uses a kind of a morse code for the internet so you could send it optically you can communicate acoustically through a power line 
 through rf it takes the original principle of the internet which is inter networking computers and now lets devices inter network that we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the internet and bring it down to the physical world in this internet
  this internet of devices  so this is the next step from there to here and this is getting commercialized today  a step after that is
 a project on fungible computers fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded so  half as much grain is half as much useful but half a baby or half a computer
 is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer  and we 've been trying to make computers that work that way so what you
 see in the background is a prototype this was from a thesis of a student bill butow now at intel 
 who wondered why instead of making bigger and bigger chips you don 't make small chips put them in a viscous medium and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch  and that 's what you see here 
 on the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype we made 
 but there 's no frame buffer io processor any of that stuff it 's just this material unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully this is a raw
  material if you add twice as much of it you have twice as much display if you shoot a gun through the middle  nothing happens
 if you need more resource you just apply more computer so that 's the step after this of computing as a raw material
 that 's still conventional bits the step after that is this is an earlier prototype in the lab this is high speed video slowed down now integrating chemistry in computation where the bits are bubbles this is showing making bits this is
  showing once again slowed down so you can see it bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de multiplexing so now we can compute that the output arranges material as well as 
  information and ultimately these are some slides from an early project i did computing where the bits are stored quantum mechanically in the nuclei of atoms so programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules
 further and further and further not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms and they lead to the following recognition 
 we all know we 've had a digital revolution but what is that well shannon took us in the ' 40s from here to here from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance to the internet and he proved the
 first threshold theorem that shows if you add information and remove it to a signal 
 you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device  and that 's when we got the internet von neumann in the ' 50s did the same thing for computing he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state to make it perfect  
 this was the last great analog computer at mit  a differential analyzer and the more you ran it the worse the answer got after von neumann
 we have the pentium where the billionth transistor is as reliable as the first one but all
  fabrication is down in this lower left corner a state of the art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal or you maybe melt some plastic a 10 billion dollar chip fab uses a process a village artisan would recognize you spread stuff around and bake it 
 all the intelligence is external to the system the materials don 't have information yesterday you heard about molecular biology  which fundamentally computes to build it 's an information processing system
 we 've had digital revolutions in communication and computation but precisely the same idea precisely the same math shannon and von neuman did hasn 't yet come out to the physical world 
 so inspired by that colleagues in this program the center for bits and atoms at mit
 which is a group of people like me who never understood the boundary between physical science
  i would even go further and say computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened to either computers or to science
  many of them are great but the canon of computer science prematurely froze a model of computation based on technology that was available in one thousand nine hundred and fifty and nature 's a much more powerful computer than that 
 so you 'll hear  
 tomorrow from saul griffith he was one of the first students to emerge from this program 
 we started to figure
  how you can compute to fabricate this was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically where you write a code much like protein folding  that specifies their structure 
 so there 's no feedback to a tool metrology  the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways that protein are fabricated 
 the video on the upper right i won 't show for time shows 
  templating so something can make something that can make something 
 and we 're doing that now over maybe nine orders of magnitude those ideas have been used to show the best fidelity and direct rate dna to make an organism in functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails that code for their assembly so much like the
  printers that digitally fabricate functional systems all the way up to building buildings not by having blueprints but having the parts code for the structure of the building 
 so these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication 
 computers that don 't control tools but computers that are tools where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits
  do that with your tax dollars thank you
 i bought all these machines we made a modest proposal to the nsf we wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale
  all in one place because you can 't segregate digital fabrication by a discipline or a length scale  so we put together focused nano beam writers and supersonic water jet cutters and
  systems  
 but i had a problem once i had all these machines i was spending too much time teaching students to use them  
 so i started teaching a class modestly called how to make almost anything 
 and that wasn 't meant to be provocative it was just for a few research students but the first day of class looked like this you know hundreds of people came in begging all my life i 've been waiting for this class i 'll do anything to do it then they 'd ask can you teach it at mit it seems too useful
  they were there because they wanted to make stuff they had no conventional
 technical background at the end of a semester they integrated their skills i 'll show an old video kelly was a sculptor and this is what she did with her semester project
 where you really have to scream  but you can 't because you 're at work or you 're in a
 classroom or you 're watching your children or you 're in any number of situations where it 's just not permitted well 
 scream buddy is a portable space for screaming when a user screams into scream buddy their scream
  is also recorded for later release where when and how
  einstein would like this this student made a web browser for parrots lets parrots surf the net and talk to other parrots
 this student 's made an alarm clock you wrestle to prove you 're awake this is one that defends a dress that defends your personal space this isn 't technology for communication it 's technology to prevent it
 this is a device that lets you see your
  who made a machine that makes machines  
 and he made it by making lego bricks that do the computing just year after year and i finally realized the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication
 is products for a market of one person you don 't need this for what you can get in wal mart you need this for what makes you unique ken olsen famously said nobody needs a computer in the home
 but you don 't use it for inventory and payroll dec is now twice bankrupt  you don 't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it  you need it for what makes you unique just like personalization 
 so with that in turn  twenty million dollars today does this twenty years from now we 'll make star trek replicators that make anything
  the students hijacked all the machines i bought to do personal fabrication today  when you spend that much of your
  there 's a government requirement to do outreach which often means classes at a local school a website stuff that 's just not that exciting 
 so i made a deal with my nsf program managers that instead of talking about it i 'd give people the tools  
 this wasn 't meant to be provocative or important but we put together these fab labs it 's about twenty thousand dollars in equipment
 that approximate both what the twenty million dollars does and where it 's going a laser cutter to do press fit assembly with
  a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics a micron scale  numerically controlled milling machine for precise structures programming tools for
 less than a dollar 100 nanosecond microcontrollers it lets you work from microns and microseconds on up 
 and they exploded around the world this wasn 't scheduled but they went from inner city boston to pobal in india to  secondi takoradi on ghana 's coast to soshanguve in a township in south africa to the far north of norway 
 uncovering 
  uncover for all the attention to the digital divide we would find unused computers in all these places
  a farmer in a rural village a kid needs to measure and modify the world not just get information about it on a screen that there 's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide bigger than the digital divide 
 and the way you close it is not
  for the masses but it development for the masses 
 so in place after place we saw this same progression  that we 'd open one of these fab labs where we didn 't this is too crazy to think of we didn 't think this up that we would get pulled 
  to these places we 'd open it the first step was just empowerment you can see it in their face just this joy of i can do it this is a girl in inner city boston who had just done a 
  craft sale in the inner city community center it goes on from there to serious hands on technical education informally
  out of schools in ghana we had set up one of these labs  we designed a network sensor and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab there was a girl
 who insisted we stay late at night kids i love
 the fab lab so she insisted on fabbing the board learning how to stuff it learning how to program it  she didn 't
  really know what she was doing or why she was doing it but she knew she just had to do it there was something electric about it this is late at you know eleven o 'clock at night
 and i think i was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time and i 've shown this to engineers at big companies and they say they can 't do this
  any one thing she 's doing they can do better but it 's distributed over many people and many sites and they can 't do in an afternoon what this little girl in rural ghana is doing
  then these labs started doing serious problem solving instrumentation for agriculture in india
  steam turbines for energy conversion in ghana high gain antennas in thin client computers
  and then in turn businesses started to grow like making these antennas and finally the lab started doing invention we 're learning more from them than we 're giving them  
 i was showing my kids in a fab lab how to use it they invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box which as you see up there
  that 's becoming a business but their design was better than saul 's design at mit so there 's now three students at mit doing their theses on scaling the work of eight year old children
 because they had better designs real invention is happening in these labs  and i still kept so in the last year i 've been spending time with heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this and i keep saying but this isn 't the real thing wait like twenty years and then we 'll be done 
 and i finally got what 's been going on this is kernigan and ritchie inventing unix on a pdp  pdps came between
  mainframes and minicomputers they were tens of thousands of dollars hard to use but they brought computing down to work groups and everything we do today happened there these fab labs are the cost and complexity of 
  a pdp the projection of digital fabrication isn 't a projection for the future we are now in the pdp era we talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then it was very chaotic it
  sort of clear what was going on in the same sense we are now today in the minicomputer era of digital fabrication 
 the only problem with that is it breaks everybody 's boundaries in dc i go to every agency that wants to talk you know in the bay area i go to every organization you can think of they 
  all want to talk about it  but it breaks their organizational boundaries in fact it 's illegal for them in many cases 
  invention coming from this community surprised me it 's the social engineering that the lab in far north of norway this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground rather than the sky because that 's where the satellites are
 the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in it was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains but it outgrew it so they built this extraordinary
  a university it 's not a company it 's essentially a village for invention it 's a village for the outliers in society 
 and those have been growing up around these fab labs all around the world so this program has split into
 an ngo foundation a fab foundation to support the scaling a micro vc fund
 the person who runs it nicely describes it as machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses it 's a cross between
  and vc to do fan out and then the research partnerships back at mit for what 's making it possible so
 i 'd like to leave you with two thoughts there 's been a sea change in aid from 
 to bottom up grassroots micro finance investing in the roots so that everybody 's got that that 's what works but we still look at technology as 
  energy for the rest of the planet are these 
 if this room full of heroes is just clever enough you can solve the problems  
 the message coming from the fab labs is that the other five billion people on the planet aren 't just technical sinks they 're sources the real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems 
 i thought that 's the projection twenty years hence into the future  but it
  for the rest of the planet
