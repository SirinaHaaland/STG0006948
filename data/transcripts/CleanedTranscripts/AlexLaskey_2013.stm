  how many of you have checked your email today come on raise your hands how many of you are checking it right now 
 laughter and how about finances anybody check that today  credit card  investment account
  now how about your household energy use  anybody check that today  this week last week a
 few energy geeks spread out across the room  it 's good to see you guys  but the rest of us
 this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this
  and even we aren 't paying attention to the energy use that 's driving climate change 
 the woman in the photo with me is harriet  we met her on our first family vacation harriet 's paying attention to her energy use  and she is decidedly not an energy geek 
 this is the story of how harriet came to pay attention 
 this is coal the most common source of electricity on the planet  and there 's enough energy in this coal
 to light this bulb for more than a year  
 but unfortunately between here and here most of that energy is lost to things like transmission leakage and heat 
 in fact only ten percent ends up as light 
 so this coal will last a little bit more than a month if you wanted to light this bulb for a year you 'd need
 this much coal
  the bad news here is that for every unit of energy we use  we waste nine 
 that means there 's good news because for every unit of energy we save  we save the other nine
  so the question is how can we get the people in this room
 and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we 're using and start wasting less of it
 the answer comes from a behavioral science experiment that was run one hot summer  ten years ago  and only ninety miles from here 
 in san marcos california  
 graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood asking people to turn off their air conditioning and turn on their fans  
 one quarter of the homes received a message that said did you know you could save fifty four dollars a month this summer
  off your air conditioning turn on your fans  another group got an environmental message  and still a third group got a message about being good citizens preventing blackouts 
 most people guessed that money saving message would work best of all 
 in fact  none of these messages worked they had zero impact on energy consumption it was as if the grad students hadn 't shown up at
  but there was a fourth message  and this message simply said when surveyed seventy seven percent of your neighbors
 said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans please join them turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans 
 and wouldn 't you know it they did 
 the people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing 
 so what does this tell us well if something is inconvenient
  if we believe in it  moral suasion financial incentives  don 't do much to move us but social pressure that 's powerful stuff  
 and harnessed correctly it can be a powerful force for good 
 in fact it already is 
 inspired by this insight my friend dan yates and i started a company called opower  we built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy
  we deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar sized homes 
 just like those effective door hangers we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors and then we give everyone targeted recommendations to help them save  
 we started with paper  we moved to a mobile application  web  and now even a controllable thermostat  and for the last five years we 've been running the largest behavioral
  science experiment in the world  
 and it 's working  
 ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than two hundred and fifty million dollars on their energy bills  and we 're just getting started 
 this year alone in partnership with more than eighty utilities in six countries we 're going to generate another two terawatt hours of electricity savings
  the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours but for the rest of us two terawatt hours is more than enough energy to power every home in st louis and salt lake city combined for more than a year  
 two terawatt hours  it 's roughly half what the u s solar industry produced last year  and two terawatt hours 
 in terms of coal we 'd need to burn thirty four of these wheelbarrows
 every minute around the clock every day for an entire year to get two terawatt hours of electricity
  and we 're not burning anything we 're just motivating people to pay attention and change their behavior  
 but we 're just one company and this is just scratching the surface
  twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted  and when i say wasted i don 't mean that people have inefficient lightbulbs they may 
 i mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms  and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody 's home
 that 's forty billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well being
 but does contribute to climate change that 's forty billion with a b
 every year in the u s alone  that 's half our coal usage right there 
 now thankfully  some of the world 's best material scientists are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources like these
  this is both fantastic and essential 
 but the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future it isn 't on this slide  
 it 's in this room it 's you  and it 's me  and we can harness this resource with no new material science
 simply by applying behavioral science we can do it today  we know it works and it will save us money right away
 so what are we waiting for well 
 in most places utility regulation hasn 't changed much since thomas edison 
 utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy they ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it  
 but this story is much more than about household energy use  take a look at the prius
 it 's efficient not only because toyota invested in material science but because they invested in behavioral science 
 the dashboard that shows drivers how much energy they 're saving in real time makes former speed demons drive more like cautious grandmothers  
 which brings us back to harriet  
 we met her on our first family vacation she came over to meet my young daughter  and she was tickled to learn that my daughter 's name is also harriet
 she asked me what i did for a living and i told her i work with utilities to help people save energy it
 was then that her eyes lit up 
 she looked at me  and she said you 're exactly the person i need to talk to you see two weeks ago my husband and i got a letter in the mail from our utility 
 it told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors
  think about talk about  and even argue about is what we should be doing to save energy we did everything that letter told us to do  and still i know there must be more 
 now i 'm here with a genuine expert tell me what should i do to save energy 
 there are many experts who can help answer harriet 's question my goal is to make sure we are all asking it thank you
