  the old story about climate protection is that it 's costly or it would have been done already  
 so government needs to make us do something painful to fix it  the new story about climate protection is that
  not costly but profitable this was a simple sign error because it 's cheaper to save fuel than to buy fuel 
 as is well known to companies that do it all the time for example dupont sd micro electronics
  many other firms ibm are reducing their energy intensity routinely six percent a year by fixing up their plants and they get their money back
 in two or three years that 's called a profit  now
  the old story about oil
 is that
 if we wanted to save very much of it it would be expensive or we would have done it already because markets are essentially perfect if of course that were true 
 there would be no innovation and nobody could make any money 
 but the new story about oil is the government doesn 't have to force us to do painful things to get off oil
 not just incrementally but completely
 quite the contrary  the united states for example can
  completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time 
 led by business for profit because it 's so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it 
 this process will also be catalyzed by the military for its own reasons of combat effectiveness
 and preventing conflict  particularly over oil this thesis is set out in a
  book called winning the oil endgame that four colleagues and i wrote and have posted for free at
 about one hundred and seventy thousand downloads so far  and it was co sponsored by the pentagon it 's independent it 's peer reviewed and all of the
 backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal now a bit of economic history i think may be helpful here
  one of the biggest u s industries was whaling and whale oil lit practically every building but in the nine years before drake struck oil in 
  that whale oil illuminating market disappeared  thanks to fatal competitors  chiefly oil and and gas made from coal 
 to which the whalers had not been paying attention
  out of customers before they ran out of whales  the remnant whale populations were saved by technological innovators and 
  capitalists 
 and it 's funny it it feels a bit like this now for oil we 've been spending the last few decades accumulating a very powerful backlog of technologies for saving and substituting for oil and no one had bothered to add them up before so when we did we found some
  surprising things now there are two big reasons to be concerned
 about oil both national competitiveness and national security are at risk on the competitiveness front 
 we all know that toyota has more market cap than the big three put together
  and serious competition from europe from korea and next is china which will soon be a major net exporter of cars how
  do you think it will take before you can drive home your new
 shanghai automotive super efficient car  maybe a decade according to my friends in detroit china has
 an energy policy based on radical energy efficiency and leap frog technology they 're not going to export your uncle 's buick 
 and after that comes india  the point here is these cars are going to be made super
  efficient the question is who will make them 
 will we in the united states continue to import efficient cars to replace foreign oil  or will we make efficient cars and import neither the oil nor the cars 
 that seems to make more sense
  the more we keep on using the oil particularly the imported oil  the more we face a very obvious array of problems 
 our analysis assumes that they all cost
  nothing  but nothing is not the right number it could well be enough to double the oil price for example  and
 one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil  
 if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than than countries that don 't have oil 
 and
 our military
 get quite unhappy with having to stand
  guard on pipelines in far off istan when what they actually signed up for was to protect american citizens  they don 't like fighting over oil  they don 't like being in the sands
 and they don 't like where the oil money goes and what sort of instability it creates 
 now in order to avoid these problems whatever you think they 're worth it 's actually not that complicated we can save half the oil by using it more efficiently at a cost
 of twelve dollars per saved
  barrel and then we can replace the other half
 with a combination of advanced bio fuels and safe natural gas and that costs on average under eighteen dollars a barrel 
 and compared with the official forecast that oil will cost twenty six dollars a barrel in two thousand and twenty five which is half of what we 've been paying lately  
 that will save seventy billion
  in order to do this we need to invest about one hundred and eighty billion dollars half of it to retool the car truck and plane industries half of it to build the advanced bio fuel industry in the process 
 we will gain about a million good jobs mainly rural  and protect another million jobs now at risk mainly in auto making 
 and we 'll also get returns over one hundred and fifty billion dollars a year  so that 's a very handsome return
  in the private capital market  but if you want it for the reasons i just mentioned to happen sooner and with higher confidence  then
 and also to expand choice and manage risk
 then you might like some light handed public policies that support rather than distorting or opposing the business logic and
  subsidies or mandates they make a little net money for the treasury  they have a broad trans ideological appeal and because we want them actually to happen  
 we figured out ways to do them
 that do not require much if any federal legislation  and
 can indeed be done administratively or at a state level just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem namely light vehicles here are four
  four
 concept cars
 with low drag  and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive you can sort of have it all with these things for example  
 this opel two seater does one hundred and fifty five miles an hour at ninety four miles a gallon  
 this muscle car from toyota
  four hundred and eight horsepower in an ultra light that does zero to sixty in well under four seconds and still gets thirty two miles a gallon i 'll say more later about this
 and in the upper left a pioneering
 effort fourteen years ago by gm
 eighty four miles a gallon without even using a hybrid in a four seater 
 well saving that fuel sixty nine percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about fifty seven cents per saved gallon
  but it 's even a better deal for heavy trucks where you save a
 similar amount
 at twenty five cents a gallon with better aerodynamics and tires and engines and so on and taking out weight so you can put it into payload 
 so you can you can double efficiency with a sixty percent internal rate of return
  then you can go even further almost tripling efficiency with some operational improvements double the big haulers ' margins  and we
  intend to use those numbers to create demand pull and flip the market in the airplane business it 's
 again a similar story where the first twenty percent fuel saving is free as boeing is now demonstrating in its new dreamliner 
 but then the next generation of planes
 saves about half again much cheaper than buying the fuel  and if you go over the next fifteen years or so to
  kind of a flying wing with internal engines then you get about a factor three efficiency improvement at comparable or lower cost
 let me focus a minute on the light
 vehicles the cars and light trucks because we we all know the most about those probably everybody here drives one 
 and yet we may not realize that in a standard sedan of all the fuel energy you feed
  never gets to the wheels it 's lost first in the engine  idling at zero miles a gallon  the power train and accessories  
 so then of the energy that does get to the wheels only an eighth of it 
 half of that goes to heat the tires on the road or to heat the air the car pushes aside and only this little bit only six percent actually ends up accelerating the car and then heating the brakes when you stop  
  percent of the weight you 're moving is the car not the driver less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver this is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort 
 of the fuel use is caused by the weight of the car and it 's obvious from the diagram that every unit of energy you save at the wheels is going to
  wasting another seven units of energy getting that energy to the wheels so there 's huge leverage
 for making the car a lot lighter and the reason this has not been very seriously examined before is there was a common assumption in the industry
 that well then it might not be safe if you got whacked by a heavy car 
 and it would cost a lot more to make because the only way we know how to make cars much lighter was to use expensive light metals like aluminum and
  but these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials for example  we use a lot of  carbon fiber composites in
 sporting goods  and it turns out that
 these are quite remarkable for safety here 's a
 handmade mclaren slr carbon car
 that got t boned by a golf the golf was totaled the mclaren just popped off and scratched the side panel they 'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later but if this mclaren were to run into a wall
  at sixty five miles an hour 
 the entire crash energy would be absorbed by a couple of woven carbon fiber composite cones weighing a total of fifteen pounds  hidden in the front end 
 because these materials could actually absorb six to twelve times as much energy per pound as steel and do so a lot more smoothly 
 and this means we 've just cracked the conundrum of safety and weight
  we could make cars
 bigger which is protective but make them
 light whereas if we made them heavy they 'd be both hostile and inefficient and when you make them light in the right way 
 that can be
 simpler and cheaper to make you can end up saving money and lives and
  and the process needed to make it
  is actually coming toward the market quite nicely we figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer for this very
 stiff  strong carbon composite material  and then ways to thermoform it  because it 's a
 combination of carbon and nylon into whatever complex shapes you want like the one just
 shown at the auto show by one of the tier one suppliers  and the manufacturing you can do this way gets radically simplified  because the auto body has only say
  fourteen parts instead of one hundred one hundred and fifty 
 each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set instead of four expensive ones for stamping steel  
 each of the parts can be easily lifted with no hoist they snap together like a kid 's toy
  so you got rid of the body shop and if you want you can lay color in the
  and get rid of the paint shop those are the two hardest and costliest parts of making a car so you end up with at least two fifths lower capital intensity
 than the leanest plant in the industry  which gm has in lansing the
 plant also gets smaller 
 now when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil including buildings industry feedstocks and so on 
 you find that of the twenty eight million barrels a day the government says we will need
  about eight of that can be
 removed by efficiency by then with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over 
 at an average cost of only twelve bucks a barrel instead of twenty six for buying the oil and then another six
 can be made robustly competitively from cellulosic ethanol and a little bio diesel without
  interfering at all with the water or land needs of crop production there is a huge amount of gas to be saved about half the projected gas at about an eighth of its price  
 and here are some no brainer substitutions of it with lots left over so much in fact that after you 've
 handled the domestic oil forecast from areas already approved you have only this little bit left and let 's see how we can meet that because there 's a pretty flexible menu of ways  
 we could of course buy more
  efficiency  maybe you ought to buy efficiency at twenty six bucks instead of twelve or wait to capture the second half of it 
 or we could of course  just get this little bit by continuing to import some canadian and mexican oil  or the
 ethanol the brazilians would love to sell us but they 'll sell it to japan and china instead because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers and
  we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance  or if we used it as hydrogen which is more profitable and efficient we 'd get rid of the domestic oil too  
 and that doesn 't even count for example that available land in the dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country 
 so we have lots of options  
 and the choice of menu and timing is quite flexible now
  to make this happen quicker and with higher confidence there is a few ways government could help for example fee bates a combination of a fee and a rebate
 in any size class of vehicle you want 
 can increase the price of inefficient vehicles and correspondingly pay you a rebate for efficient vehicles you 're not paid to 
 change size class you are paid to pick efficiency within a size class in a way equivalent to looking at all fourteen
  years
 of  life cycle fuel savings rather than just the first two or three this expands choice rapidly in the market and actually makes more money for automakers as well 
 i 'd like to deal with the lack of affordable personal mobility in this country
 by making it very cheaply possible for low income families to get
  new cars
 that they could otherwise never get and for each car so financed scrap almost one clunker preferably the dirtiest ones this creates a new
  market for detroit from customers they weren 't going to get otherwise because they weren 't creditworthy and could never afford a new car and
 detroit will make money on every unit it turns out that if say african american and white households had the same car ownership  it would cut employment disparity
  about in half by providing better access to job opportunities so this is a huge social win too governments buy
 hundreds of thousands of cars a year  there are smart ways to buy them and to aggregate that purchasing power to bring very efficient vehicles into the market faster  
 and we could even do an x prize style golden carrot that 's worth stretching further for for
  prize for the first u s automaker to sell two hundred thousand really advanced vehicles like some you saw earlier  then
 the legacy airlines can 't afford to buy the efficient new planes they desperately need to cut their fuel bills but if you felt philosophically you wanted to do anything about that 
 there are ways to finance it 
 and at the same time to scrap inefficient old
  if they were otherwise to come back in the air they would waste more oil and block the uptake of efficient new planes those
 part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive we ought to take them out back and shoot them and put bounty hunters after them 
 then there 's an important military role that in creating
 the move to
  commercial production of these kinds of materials or for that matter ultra light steels that are a good
  technology
 the military can do the trick it did in turning darpanet into the internet just turn it over to the private sector and we have an internet the same for gps
  the same for the modern semi conductor industry that is military science and technology that they need
  cluster that transforms its civilian economy and gets the country off oil which would be a huge contribution
 to eliminating conflict over oil and advancing national and global security then we need to retool
 the car industry and do retraining and shift the
 convergence of the energy and ag value chains to shift faster from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates and get out of our own way in other ways  and make the transition
 to more efficient vehicles go faster
  how the whole thing fits together instead of official forecasts of oil use and oil imports going forever up they can turn down
 with the twelve dollars a barrel efficiency down steeply by adding the supply side substitutions at eighteen bucks 
 all implemented at slower rates than we 've done before when we paid attention  and if we start adding tranches of hydrogen in there 
 we are rapidly off imports and completely off oil
  oil in the 2040s and the one thing i 'd like to point out here is that we 've done this before in this 
  when we last paid attention
 the economy grew twenty seven percent 
 oil use fell seventeen percent oil imports fell fifty percent oil imports from the persian gulf fell eighty seven
  would have been gone if we 'd kept that up one more year 
 well  that was with very old technologies and delivery methods  we could rerun that play a lot better now and yet what we proved then
 is the u s has more market power than opec ours is on the demand side we are the saudi arabia of nega barrels we can use less oil faster than they can conveniently sell less oil
  reason for wanting to do this whether you 're concerned about national security or price volatility
