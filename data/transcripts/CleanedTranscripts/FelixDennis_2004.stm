  i was the better at getting and keeping  you were the better at
  i was the better at grubbing and heaping  but who was the better man
 in the end yes who was the better man  
 my friend  you were the better with lords and ladies  i was the better at pillaging troy  
 you were the better at
 kissing the babies  i was the better at search and destroy  but who was the better man
  old boy who was the better man  i was the better at improvisation  you were the better
 at spinning the plates  i was the better at
 procrastination  you were the better at quiet debate  but who was the better man
  you were the better at rolling a reefer  i was the better at coke and rum
 remember that night on the beach in ibiza the maori twins
 with the tattooed bum  
 but who was the better man  old chum who was the better man
 now we come down
  relatives grieving out in the hall with their crocodile tears  now that you 're out of it  now that you 're leaving now
 that they 've sealed your arse and your ears what i 've been meaning to tell you for years
  wrote this next poem for my mother every one of us had a mother only one probably the most important person
  in your life if you 're lucky enough to know them 
 my mother was certainly the most important in mine  let me try and describe
 her to you she 's eighty six years old she 's frail white  platinum hair 
 why do they do that why do old ladies go
 to those hair shops and
 make
  those helmets bright as a button all the ducks in a row  looks
 like a much prettier version
 of margaret thatcher 
 but without any of the soft bits in margaret 's character 
  i wrote this poem for her  these are not my beliefs  but my mother has lived by this creed
 all her life never go back 
 never go back  never go back  never return to the haunts of your youth keep to the track  to the beaten
  memory holds all you need of the truth  
 never look back  never look back  never succumb to the gorgon 's stare
  keep to the track  to the beaten track
 no one is waiting and nothing is there never go back  never go back  never surrender the future you earned
  to the beaten track  never return to the bridges you 've burned 
 never look back  
 never look back  never retreat to the ' glorious past ' keep to the track  to the beaten track  treat every day of your life as your last
 never go back  never go back never acknowledge
  up on me hobbyhorse if every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon were tied end to end along a railroad track
  me  stoking the train without a qualm in the world  ladies don 't do it 
 don 't do it  
 you think we want you to do it but we don 't want you to do it  stop it  tell them to go to hell  
 you bodies are wonderful as they are just leave them alone
  to a beautiful lady
 of a certain age 
 lady lady do not weep what is gone is gone  
 now sleep  turn your pillow  dry your tears  count thy sheep
 and not thy years nothing good can come of this time rules all
 my dearest ' tis but folly to be waging war on one who never lost before 
 lady 
 this is all in vain youth can never come again  
 we have drunk the summer wine none can make a stitch in time nip and tuck till
  what is foretold in the womb may not be foresworn with gold  nor may time be bought
 or sold dearest  
 do i love thee less 
 do i shrink from thy caress think you i could cease to care never was there one
  lady lady do not weep
 what is gone is gone  now sleep  
 lean against me  calm your fears  count thy blessings 
 not thy
  has done more for me financially than britain
 ever has or ever could have done  i was born in britain as you have probably guessed  
 even when on its worst behavior i find myself automatically defending the usa from the sneers of green eyed europhiles playing their greek card to roman trumps 
 america is an empire
 hope you know that now 
 all empires by definition are bumbling  shambolic  bullying  bureaucratic affairs 
 as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy as they are corrupted by power in their dotage 
 i am no historian ladies and gentlemen  but it seems to be that the usa
  's sins  compared to those of many previous empires are of a more moderate  
 if more pervasive kind
 let me put this bluntly 
 if americans are so fat  stupid and ignorant  my dear friends from birmingham  how come they rule the world
 hail to the gods of america 
 hail to the gods of america  hail to the gods of the dream  invictus e pluribus unum  
 but which of them reigns supreme  which is america 's jupiter 
 the brahmins of capital hill a sorcerer 's profit on wall street
 they eye
 of a dollar bill  
 or is it celebrity status the worship of those we hate or the cult of living forever  if only we 'd watch our weight  
 what of the titans of media  or hollywood 's siren call  what of the temples of justice  
 whose servants enslave us all
 what of the brand and the label  what of the upstart sport  
 and what of the constitution that bully of last resort  
 hail to the god of america  whose power
  and if you would like to know why i am not a father i who by a miracle have twenty two godchildren
 the answer is in this poem
  which upsets me every time i read it love came to visit me 
 love came to visit me  shy as a fawn  but finding me busy
  she fled with the dawn
  at twenty the torch of resentment was lit my rage at injustice waxed hot as the pits
 the flux of its lava cleared all in its path comrades and enemies fled from its wrath  
 yet lovers grew wary  once novelty waned
 to lie with a bloody man  his terror unfeigned 
 at thirty my powers seemed mighty to me
  the fruits of my rivals i shook from the tree by guile and by bluster 
 by night and by day  i battered and scattered the fools from my way  
 and women grew willing
 to sham and to bluff their trinkets and baubles
 cost little enough 
 from forty to fifty
 grown easy and sly i wined them and dined them like pigs in a sty  we feasted and reveled
 and rutted in muck forgetting our peril forgetting to duck forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives  
 grown sick to our stomachs 
 and sick of our lives 
 love came to visit me
 shy as a fawn  but finding me busy  she fled
 with the dawn um
 there are
 i 've got far too much money and i have far too much fun
 in my businesses 
 so poetry came as a complete shock to me ladies and gentlemen a complete shock i was a little ill okay i was ill okay 
 i had a life threatening illness you know  
 i was in a clinic i wasn 't allowed to make telephone calls  
 i wasn 't allowed to see any of my
  nurse  and from another nurse  i begged a pencil  pen  and i i didn 't know what else to do so i started to write poetry that was in october
 of two thousand  
 i 'm not an evil man  but sometimes i try to put myself in an evil man 's position i 'm not a glorious and
  men fall down you know when she walks in a room  but sometimes i try to put myself in that position 
 not with much success but it 's interesting to me i love to write historical verse  
 i love to think what they thought what it was like because although
 many of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience although you guys can not only go to the moon you know you 're going to totally transform everything cloning will transform everything voice navigation will transform everything
  guys are so clever and women you can do it all but human nature doesn 't change mate  my friends human nature is exactly the same as it was
 when my ancestor
 probably it was my ancestor
 got his hands around the neck of the last neanderthal and battered
 the bastard to death
  think we didn 't do that oh we did we killed every single one of them 
 inch by inch
 we killed them we hunted them down wherever they were  rivals for meat  rivals for berries we
 're still doing it with all of the genius assembled in this room
 our natures haven 't changed a single iota and they never will  
 even when we 've got off this
 little
 planet  and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets  
 and i am as bad as you 
 i spent eight years
  running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world  and at seven o 'clock every night i took me some more
 girls  already corrupted i never did anything to anyone that wasn 't 
 and i took crack cocaine every single night for seven years 
 it was like dante 's
 one of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection for about four hours  
 and you stay up for twelve 
 it was absolutely unbelievable
 twenty two godchildren i 've got what do i say to them 
 i only stopped
  because i thought if i got caught what would happen to my mother  if you 're a woman remember that 
 the love of your son can utterly transform anything he does 
 our lady in white pale she was listless and soft
  to the touch a generous mistress whom many loved much shoulder to shoulder night after night we hoarded and sold her our lady in white  
 we breathed but to savor
 her crystal caress  we craved but to favor the hem of her dress
  we dabbled and babbled denying our thirsts
  but always we scrabbled
 to lie with her
 first  absent  we missed her grew haggard
 and limp  toyed with her sister  or threatened her pimp 
 came word out of babel the lady returns and there on the table we
  the power that tyranny craves there in that hour  she made us her slaves many there were 
 to covet her kiss 
 my shame as a spur i fled
