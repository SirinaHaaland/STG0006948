  and how to help people to overcome traumatic experiences and how to help
  them to regain some confidence in the time ahead in the future and how to participate again in everyday life  
 so i am a jungian psychoanalyst  
 and i went to afghanistan in january two thousand and four by chance on an assignment for medica mondiale  
 jung in afghanistan you get the picture 
 afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world
  seventy percent of the people are illiterate  
 war and malnutrition kills people together with hope 
 you may know this from the media  but what you may not know is that the average age of the afghan people is seventeen years old which means they grow up in such an environment and i repeat myself in thirty years of war
  ethnic conflicts bad health shame fear and cumulative traumatic experiences 
 local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non governmental organizations and people had hope
  until they realized their situation worsens every day either because they are being killed or because 
 somehow they are poorer than eight years ago 
 one figure for that fifty four percent of the children under the age of five years suffer from malnutrition 
 yet  there is hope  one day a man told me my future does not look brilliant  but i want to have a brilliant future for my son
 this is a picture i took in two thousand and five walking on fridays over the hills in kabul  
 and for me it 's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation 
 so doctors prescribe medication and
 donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads
 military collect weapons  and depression stays intact 
 why  because people don 't have tools
 to cope with it to get over it 
 so soon after my arrival i had confirmed something which i had already
  that my instruments come from the heart of modern europe yes however what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds they are universal 
 and the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom
 in this specific cultural context 
 after a counseling session a woman said to me because you have felt me  i can feel myself again  and i want to participate again in my family life
  was very important because the family is central
 in afghans '
 social system  no one can survive alone  
 and if people feel used  worthless and ashamed  because something horrible has happened to them  
 then they retreat and they fall into social isolation  and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones because they do not want to burden
  them and very often violence is a way to cope with it  
 traumatized people also easily lose control symptoms are hyper arousal and memory flashbacks so people are in a constant fear
 that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event might come back unexpectedly  suddenly  and they cannot control it 
 to compensate this loss of inner control
 they try to control the outside very understandably mostly the family and unfortunately this fits very well
 into the traditional side  
 regressive side repressive side restrictive side of the cultural context  
 so  husbands start
  mothers and fathers beat their children and afterward they feel awful they did not want to do this it just happened they lost control 
 the desperate try
 to restore order and normality  
 and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt and partly this is already happening  
 so everybody needs a sense for the future and the afghan sense of the future is
 shattered  but
 let me repeat the words of the woman because you have felt me  i can feel myself again 
 so the key here is empathy 
 somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you somebody has to feel how you felt and somebody has to see you and listen to you
  everybody must be able to know what
 he or she has experienced is true  and this only goes with another person  
 so everybody must be able to say this happened to me and it did this with me  but i 'm able to live with it to cope with it  and to learn from it  and i want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children
  and i will not marry off my thirteen year old daughter what happens too often in afghanistan  
 so something can be done even in such extreme environments as afghanistan  and i started thinking about a counseling program but of course i needed help and funds and one evening i was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in kabul
  i thought would be good in afghanistan  and i explained to him quickly i would
 train  psycho social counselors i would open centers and i explained to him why  
 this man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening and said if you want to do this call me 
 at that time it was the head of caritas germany  so 
 i was able to launch a three year project with caritas germany and we trained thirty afghan women and men and we opened fifteen
  centers in kabul  
 this was our sign it  's hand painted and we had forty five all over kabul  
 eleven thousand people came more than that  and seventy percent regained their lives  this was a very exciting time  developing this with my wonderful afghan team  and they are working with me up to today  
 we developed
  thousand and eight up until today a substantial change and step forward has
 been taking place the european union delegation in kabul came into this and hired me to work inside the ministry of public health to lobby this approach we succeeded 
 we revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding
  psycho social counselors to the system  
 this means certainly to retrain all health staff but for that we already have the training manuals which are approved by the ministry and moreover this approach is now part of the mental health strategy
 in afghanistan 
 so we also have implemented it already in some selected clinics in three provinces and you are the first to see the results we
  wanted to know if what is being done is effective and here you can see
 the patients all had symptoms of depression  moderate and severe  
 and the red line is the treatment as usual medication with a medical doctor  
 and all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse 
  the green line is treatment with  psycho social counseling only without medication and you can see the symptoms
 almost completely go away and the  psycho social stress has dropped significantly  
 which is explicable because you cannot take away the  psycho social stresses but you can learn how to cope with them  
 so this makes us very happy because now we also have some evidence
 that this is working so
 here you see this is a health facility in northern afghanistan and every morning it looks like
  this all over 
 and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients but now this will change 
 they go to the clinics because they want to cure their immediate symptoms and they will find somebody to talk to and discuss these issues and talk about what is burdening them and find solutions develop their resources 
  to solve their family conflicts and gain some confidence in the future and
 i would like to share one short vignette one hazara
 said to his pashtun counselor if we were to have met some years ago  
 then we would have killed each other and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future 
 and another counselor said to me after the training you know i never knew why i survived the killings in my
  village  but now i know because i am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in afghanistan so i believe
 this kept me running  and this is a really
 emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation  and also i think
 without
  and without considering this in all
 humanitarian projects we cannot build up civil societies 
 i thought it was an idea worth spreading  and i think it must be can be could be replicated elsewhere i thank you for your attention
