  my name is jarrett krosoczka  and i write and illustrate books for children for a living  so i use my imagination as my full time job  
 but well before my imagination was my vocation my imagination saved my life
  when i was a kid i loved to draw and the most talented artist i knew
 was my mother but my mother was addicted to heroin  
 and when when your parent is a drug addict it 's kind of like charlie brown trying to kick the football 
 because as much as you want to love on that person as much as you want to receive love from that person every time you open your heart you end up on your back
  so throughout my childhood my mother was incarcerated
 and i didn 't have my father because i didn 't even learn his first name until i was in the sixth grade  
 but i had my grandparents my maternal grandparents joseph and shirley who adopted me just before my third birthday
 and took me in as their own after they had already raised five children so two people who grew up in the great depression
  there in the very very early ' 80s took on a new kid  i was the cousin oliver of the sitcom of the krosoczka family 
 the new kid who came out of nowhere  
 and i would like to say that life was totally easy with them 
 they each smoked two packs a day each nonfiltered and by the time i was six i could order a southern comfort manhattan dry with a twist rocks on the side
  the ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink  
 but they loved the hell out of me they loved me so much  and they supported my creative efforts because my grandfather was a self made man  
 he ran and worked in a factory my grandmother was a homemaker  
 but here was this kid who loved transformers
 and snoopy
 and the ninja turtles  and the characters
  that i read about i fell in love with  and they became my friends  
 so my best friends in life were the characters i read about in books 
 i went to gates lane elementary school in worcester massachusetts and i had wonderful teachers there most notably in first grade mrs alisch  and
  i can just remember the love that she offered
 us as her students when i was
 in the third grade a
 monumental event happened an author visited our school jack gantos a published author of books came to talk to us about what he did for a living  
 and afterwards  we all went back to our classrooms and we drew our own renditions of his main character
  and suddenly the author appeared in our doorway  and i remember him sort of sauntering down the aisles going from kid to kid looking at the desks not saying a word  
 but he stopped next to my desk  and he tapped on my desk and he said nice cat 
 and he wandered away two words
 that made a colossal difference in my life when i was in the third grade i wrote a book for the first time
  the owl who thought he was the best flyer 
 we had to write our own greek myth 
 our own creation story so i wrote a story about an owl who challenged hermes to a flying race  
 and the owl cheated
  and hermes being a greek god 
 grew angry and bitter and turned the owl into a moon so the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon while he watched his family and friends play at night
 my book had a title page  
 i was clearly worried about my intellectual property when i was eight 
 and it was a story that was told with words and pictures exactly what i do now for a living  
 and i sometimes let the words have the stage on their own and sometimes
 i allowed the pictures to
  work on their own to tell the story  my favorite page is the about the author page 
 so i learned to write about myself in third person at a young age
 so i love that last sentence he liked making this book and i liked making that book because i
  loved using my imagination and that 's what writing is writing is using your imagination on paper  and i do get so scared because i travel to so many schools now and that seems like such 
  a foreign concept to kids that writing would be using your imagination on paper 
  and i would fill those blank pages with words and pictures
 just because i loved using my imagination and
 so these characters would become my friends there was an egg a tomato a head of lettuce and a pumpkin  and they all lived in this refrigerator city  
 and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house that was filled with so many dangers like an evil blender who tried to chop them up 
 an evil toaster
 who tried to kidnap the bread couple
  and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend who was a stick of butter 
 and i 'd make my own comics too  and this was another way for me to tell stories through words and through pictures 
 now when i was in sixth grade  the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets in the worcester public school system i went from having art
 once a week
 to twice a month
  to once a month
 to not at all and my grandfather  he was a wise man and he saw that as a problem because he knew that was like the one thing i had i didn 't play sports  
 i had art 
 so he he walked into my room one evening  and he sat on the edge of my bed  and he said jarrett it 's up to you but if you 'd like to we 'd like to send you to the classes at the worcester art museum and i
 was so thrilled so from sixth
 once twice sometimes three times a week i would take classes at the art museum  and i was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw other kids who shared a similar passion 
 now my publishing career began when i designed the cover for my eighth grade yearbook  
 and if you 're wondering about the style of dress i put our mascot in i was really into bell biv devoe and mc hammer and vanilla ice at the time
  and to this day i still can do karaoke to ice ice baby without looking at the screen  don 't tempt me because i will do it 
 so i get shipped off to private school k through eight public schools but for some reason my grandfather was upset that somebody at the local high school had been stabbed and killed  
 so he didn 't want me to go there  
 he wanted me to go to a private school and he gave me an option
  go to holy name which is coed or st john 's  which is all boys 
 very wise man because he knew i would i felt like i was making the decision on my own  and he knew i wouldn 't choose st john 's so i went to holy name high school which was a tough transition because like i said  i didn 't play sports  
 and it was very focused on sports  but i took solace
  just flourished here 
 i just couldn 't wait to get to that classroom every day  so how did i make friends  i drew funny pictures of my teachers 
 and i passed them around 
 well in english class in ninth grade  my friend john who was sitting next to me laughed a little bit too
  instantly saw that i was
 the cause of the commotion  and for the first time in my life  i was sent to the hall and i thought oh no i 'm doomed
  my grandfather 's just going to kill me and he came out to the hallway and he said let me see the paper
  and i handed it to him and we sat in silence for that brief moment  and he said to me you 're really talented 
 you 're really good  you know the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist and you should be the cartoonist just stop drawing in my class 
 so my parents never found out about it  i didn 't get in trouble  i was introduced to mrs casey who ran the school
  newspaper  and i was for for three and a half years
 the cartoonist
 for my school paper  handling such heavy issues as seniors are mean freshmen
 are nerds  the prom bill is so expensive  i can 't believe how much it costs to go
  and i took the headmaster to task
 and then i also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named wesley
 who was unlucky in love  and i just swore up and down that this wasn 't about me  but all these years later it was totally me  
 but it was so cool because i could write these stories i could come up with these ideas  and they 'd be published in the school paper and people who i didn 't know
  could read them and i loved that thought of being able to share my ideas through the printed page 
 on my 14th birthday my grandfather and my grandmother gave me the best birthday present ever a drafting table
 that i have worked on ever since here i am twenty years later  and i still work
 on this table every day on the evening of my 14th birthday
  i was given this table and we had chinese food  and this was my fortune 
 you will be successful in your work i taped it
 to the top left hand of my table and as you can see it 's still there 
 now i never really asked my grandparents for anything well two things rusty who was a great hamster and lived a great long life when i was in fourth grade
  video camera 
 i just wanted a video camera  and after begging and pleading for christmas i got a second hand video camera  and i instantly started
 making my own animations
 on my own 
 and all throughout high school i made my own animations i convinced my 10th grade english teacher to allow me to do my book report on stephen king 's misery as an animated short
 laughter and i kept making comics i kept making comics and
 at the worcester art museum i was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator i was ever given mark lynch
 he 's an amazing teacher and he 's still a dear friend of mine  and i was fourteen or fifteen  and i walked into his comic book class halfway through the course
  excited i was beaming i had this book that was how to draw comics in the marvel way and it taught me how to draw superheroes how to draw a woman how to draw muscles just the way they were supposed to be if i were to ever draw for x men or spiderman 
 and all the color just drained from his face  
 and he looked at me and he said forget everything you
  i didn 't understand he said you have a great style celebrate your own style don 't draw the way you 're
 being told to draw draw the way you 're drawing and keep at it because you 're really good 
 now when i was a teenager  
 i was angsty as any teenager was but after seventeen years of having a mother who was in and out of my life like a yo yo and a father who was faceless  i was
  and when i was seventeen i met my father for the first time upon which i learned i had a brother and sister i had never known about 
 and on the day i met my father for the first time i was rejected from the rhode island school of design  my one and only choice for college 
 but it was around this time i went to camp sunshine to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids kids with leukemia  and this kid eric changed my life eric didn 't live to see his sixth birthday 
 and eric lives with me every day
  so after this experience my art teacher mr shilale he brought in these picture books and i thought picture books for kids and i started writing books
 for young readers
 when i was a senior in high school well i eventually got to the rhode island school of design  i transferred to risd as a sophomore  and it was there that i took
  every course that i could on writing 
 and it was there that i wrote a story about a giant orange slug who wanted to be friends with this kid the kid had no patience for him  and i sent this book out to a dozen publishers and it was rejected every single time  
 but i was also involved with the hole in the wall gang camp 
 an amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses  and it 's those kids at the camp that read my stories  and i read to them and i saw that they responded to my work  
 i graduated from risd my grandparents were
  very proud  
 and i moved to boston  and i set up shop i set up a studio and i tried to get published i would send out my books i would send out hundreds of postcards to editors and art directors 
  but they would go unanswered and my grandfather would call me every week and he would say jarrett how 's it going do you have a job yet 
  job i write and illustrate children 's books and he said well 
 who pays you for that and i said no one no one no one just yet but i know it 's going to happen now i used to work the weekends at the hole in the wall
  off season programming to make some extra money as i was trying to get my feet off the ground and this kid
 who was just this really hyper kid i started calling him monkey boy and i went home and wrote a book called
  night monkey boy and i sent out one last batch of postcards  
 and i received an email from an editor at random house with a subject line nice work exclamation point 
 dear jarrett i received your postcard i liked your art so i went to your website
 and i 'm wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories because
  like your art and it looks like there are some stories that go with them  please let me know if you 're ever in new york city 
 and this was from an editor at random house children 's books so the next week i happened to be in new york 
 and i met with this editor  and i left new york
 for a contract for my first book good night monkey boy which was published on june twelve  two thousand and one and my local paper
 celebrated the news
  the local bookstore
 made a big deal of it 
 they sold out of all of their books my friend described it as a wake but happy  
 because everyone i ever knew was there in line to see me but i wasn 't dead  i was just signing books  my grandparents they were in the middle of it they were so happy they couldn 't have been more
  alisch was there mr shilale was there mrs casey was there mrs alisch cut in front of the line and said i taught him how to read 
 and then something happened that changed my life  i got my first piece of significant fan mail where
 this kid loved monkey boy so much that he wanted to have a monkey boy birthday cake 
 for a two year old that is like a tattoo you
  you only get one birthday per year  and for him it 's only his second
  and i got this picture and i thought this picture is going to live within his consciousness for for his entire life  he will forever have this photo
 in his family photo albums 
 so that photo since that moment is framed in front of me while i 've worked on all of my books i have ten picture books out
  in the lunch lady series which is a graphic novel series about a lunch lady who fights crime 
 i 'm expecting the release of a chapter book called platypus police squad the frog who croaked 
 and i travel the country visiting countless schools  letting lots of kids know
 that they draw great cats  and i meet
  lunch ladies treat me really well
  and
 i got to see my name in lights because kids put my name in lights  
 twice now the lunch lady series has won the children 's choice book of the year in the third or fourth grade category  and those winners were displayed
 on a jumbotron screen in times square punk farm 
  are in development to be movies so i am a movie producer
 and i really do think  thanks to that video camera i was given
 in ninth grade i 've seen people have punk farm birthday parties people have dressed up as punk farm for halloween 
 a punk farm baby room which
 makes me a little nervous for the child 's well being in the long term
  and i get the most amazing fan mail  and i get the most amazing projects and the biggest moment for me came last halloween
  the doorbell rang and it was a trick or treater dressed as my character  it was so cool now
 my grandparents are no longer living  so to honor them i started a scholarship at the worcester art museum
 for kids who are in  are in difficult situations but whose caretakers can 't afford the classes and it displayed the work
  my first ten years of publishing and you know who was there to celebrate
