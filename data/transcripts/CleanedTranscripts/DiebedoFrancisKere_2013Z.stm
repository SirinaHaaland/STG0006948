  would like to show you how architecture has helped
 to change the life of my community and has opened opportunities to hope i
 am a native of burkina faso
  to the world bank burkina faso is one of the poorest countries in the world but what does it look like
 to grow up in a place like that i am an example of that i was born in a little village called 
 there was no electricity no access to clean drinking water
 and no school  but my father wanted me
 to learn how to read and write  for this reason  i had to leave my family when i was seven
 and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family in this place
 i sat
 in a class like
  that
 with more than one hundred and fifty other kids  and for six years 
 in this time it just happened to me to come to school
 to realize that my classmate
  village people still are dying in burkina faso  and access to clean drinking water is still a big problem
 i
 had luck
 i was lucky  because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that  but i was lucky i
 had a
  scholarship i could go to germany to study  so now 
 i suppose  i don 't need to explain to you how great
 a privilege
 it is for me to be standing before you today  from  gando my home village in burkina faso 
 to berlin in germany
  to become an architect is a big big step  but what to do with this
 privilege  
 since i was a student i wanted
 to open up better opportunities to other kids in gando i just wanted to use my skills and build a school  
 but how do you do it when you 're still a
  student and you don 't have money  oh yes i started to make drawings
 and asked for money  fundraising was not an easy task i
 even asked my classmates to spend less money on coffee and
  collect fifty thousand u s dollars  
 when i came home to gando
 to bring the good news my people were over the moon 
 but
 when they realized
 that i was planning to use clay they were shocked a clay building is not able to stand a rainy season
  and francis wants us to use it and build a school is this the reason why he spent so much time in europe studying
 instead of working in the field with us 
 my people build all the time with clay  but they don
  i started to speak
 with the community and
 i could convince everybody  and we could start to work  
 and the women  the men everybody from the village was part of this building process i was allowed to use even
 traditional techniques  so clay floor
  they start polishing it with a stone for hours  and then
  this is the school  built with the community  the walls are totally made out of compressed clay blocks from gando the roof
 structure is made with cheap
 steel bars normally hiding
  inside concrete
 and the classroom  the ceiling is made out of both of them used together in this school there was a simple idea 
 to create comfort
 in a classroom don 't forget it can be forty five degrees in burkina faso
  so with simple ventilation  i wanted to make the classroom
 good for teaching and learning and this is the project today  
 twelve years old still in best condition  and the kids 
 and for me and my community this project was a huge
 success it has opened up opportunities to do
  projects in gando so i could do a lot of projects  and here i am going to share with you only three of them 
 the first one is the school extension of course how do you explain drawings
 and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write  i started to build a prototype like that the innovation was to build a clay
  clay vault  so  then i jumped
 on the top like that with my team  and it works  the community is looking it still works so we can build 
 and we kept building and that is the result  the kids
 are happy  and they love it the community is very proud we made it and even
  animals like these donkeys love our buildings 
 the next project is the library in gando and
 see now we tried to
 introduce different ideas in our buildings  but we often don 't have so much material  
 something we have in
  pots we wanted to use them
 to create openings so we just bring them like you can see to the building site 
 we start cutting them  and then we place them on top of the roof
 before we pour the concrete  and you have this result  the openings are letting the hot air out
 and light in very simple
  my most recent project
 in gando is a high school project i would like to share with you this the innovation in this project is to cast mud
 like you cast concrete  how do you cast mud  we start making a lot of mortars like you can see and when
 when everything is ready when you know what is the best recipe and the best form you start
 working with the community and sometimes i can leave they will do it themselves  i came to speak to you like that 
 another factor in gando is rain when the
 rains come we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain 
  don 't confound with
 christo and jeanne claude it is simply how we protect our walls 
 the rain in burkina comes very fast  and after that you have floods everywhere in the country 
 but for us the rain is good it brings sand and gravel
 to the river
 we need to use to build  we just wait for the rain to go we take the sand we mix it with
 clay and we keep building that is it the gando project was always connected to training the people  because
 i just wanted one day when i fall down
 and die that at least one person from gando keeps doing this work
  my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves  
 usually for a young man from gando to earn money you have to leave the country
 to the city sometimes leave the country and some never come back
  can stay in the country and work on different building sites and earn money to feed their family there 's a new quality in this work  
 yes you know it i have won a lot of awards through this work
  for sure it has
 opened opportunities  i have become myself known
  why i do what i do is my community 
 when i was a kid  i was going to school  i was coming back every holiday to gando 
 by the end of every holidays  i had to say goodbye to the
  open their clothes like that and give me the last penny 
 in my culture this is a symbol of deep affection  
 as a  seven year old guy  i was impressed  i just asked my mother one day why
  they are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful
 and one day come back and help
 improve the quality of life of the community i hope now that i was able to make my community proud
 through this work  and i hope i was able to
  prove you the power of community and to show you that architecture
 can be inspiring for communities to shape their own future
