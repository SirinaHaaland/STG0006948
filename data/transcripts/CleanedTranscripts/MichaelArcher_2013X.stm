  i do want to test this question we 're all interested in does extinction have to be forever  
 i 'm focused on two projects i want to tell you about one is the thylacine project the other one is the lazarus project and that 's focused on the gastric brooding frog  
 and it would be a fair question to ask
  we focused on these two animals well  point number one 
 each of them represents a unique family of its own we 've lost a whole family that 's a big chunk
 of the global genome gone i 'd like it back  the second reason
 is that we killed these things in the case of the thylacine 
  we shot every one that we saw  we slaughtered them 
 in the case of the gastric brooding frog  
 we may have fungicided it to death there 's a dreadful fungus that 's moving through the world that 's called the chytrid fungus and it 's nailing frogs all over the world we think that 's probably what got this frog and humans are spreading this fungus  
 and this introduces a very important ethical point and i think you will have heard this many times when this topic comes up 
 what i think is important
 is that
  if it 's clear that we exterminated these species then i think we not only have
 a moral obligation to see what we can do about it but i think we 've got a moral imperative to try to do something if we can 
 ok  let me talk to you about the lazarus project  it 's a frog and you think frog  yeah  but this was not
  unlike a normal frog which lays its eggs in the water and goes away and wishes its froglets well 
 this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs swallowed them into the stomach where it should be having food 
 didn 't digest the eggs and turned its stomach into a uterus 
 in the stomach the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles 
 and in the stomach  the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs  and they grew in the stomach until eventually the poor old frog was
  at risk of bursting apart it
 has a little cough and a hiccup and out comes sprays of little frogs now  when biologists saw this they were agog they thought this is incredible 
 no animal  let alone a frog has been known to do this to change one organ in the body into another and you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as
  we could understand how that frog is managing the way its tummy works is there information here that we need to understand or could usefully use
 to help ourselves now i 'm not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stomach  
 but i am suggesting it 's possible we might want to manage gastric secretion in the gut and just as everybody got excited about it bang  it was extinct 
 i called up my
  professor mike tyler in the university of adelaide he was the last person
 who had this frog  a colony of these things in his lab  and i said mike by any chance this was thirty or forty years ago by any chance
 had you kept any frozen tissue of this frog 
 and he thought about it 
 and he went to his deep freezer minus twenty degrees centigrade  and he poured through everything in the freezer and there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these
  this was very exciting but there was no reason why we should expect that this would work  because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it 
 cryoprotectants to look after it
 when it was frozen and normally when water freezes as you know it expands and the same thing happens in a cell if you freeze tissues the water expands  damages or bursts the cell walls well
 we looked at the tissue under the microscope it actually didn 't
  the cell walls looked intact so we thought  let 's give it a go 
 what we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation 
 we took the eggs of a related species a living frog and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg we used ultraviolet radiation to do that 
 and then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog and we inserted those nuclei into that
  is kind of like a cloning project like what produced dolly but it 's actually very different because dolly was live sheep into live sheep cells that was a miracle but it was workable  
 what we 're trying to do is take a dead nucleus from an extinct species and put it into a completely different species and expect that to work well we had no real reason to expect it would and we tried hundreds and hundreds of these 
 and just last february the last time we did these trials i saw
 a miracle starting to
  happen what we found was
 most of these eggs didn 't work but then suddenly one of them began to divide that was so exciting and then the egg divided again  
 and then again  and pretty soon we had  early stage embryos with hundreds of cells
 forming those we even dna tested some of these cells and the dna of the extinct frog is in those cells so we 're very excited
 this is not a tadpole it 's not a frog  but it 's a long way along the journey to producing or bringing back an extinct species and this is news  we haven 't announced this publicly before
  we 're excited we 've got to get past this point we now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate to turn in so that it will produce the other tissues
  go on and produce
 a tadpole and then a frog  watch this space i think we 're going to have this frog hopping glad to be back in the world again thank you 
 we haven 't done it yet but keep the applause ready
  the second project i want to talk to you about is the thylacine project the thylacine looks a bit to most people like
  or maybe like a tiger because it has stripes  but it 's not related to any of those it 's a marsupial it raised its young in a pouch like a koala or a kangaroo would do 
 and
 it has a long history a long fascinating history that goes back twenty five million years but it 's also a tragic history  
 the first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain forests of australia
  million years ago  and the national geographic society is helping us to explore these fossil deposits this is riversleigh  
 in those fossil rocks are some amazing animals we found marsupial lions  we found
 carnivorous kangaroos it 's not what you usually think about as a kangaroo but these are meat eating kangaroos  
 we found the biggest bird in the world bigger than that thing that was in madagascar  and it too was a flesh eater it was a giant weird duck 
 and crocodiles were not behaving at
  that time either you think of crocodiles as doing their ugly thing sitting in a pool of water 
 these crocodiles were actually out on the land and they were even climbing trees and jumping on prey
 on the ground  we had in australia drop crocs they really do exist but what they were dropping on was not only other
  were five different kinds of thylacines in those ancient forests and
 they ranged from great big ones to middle sized ones
 to one that was about the size of a of a chihuahua paris hilton would have been able to carry one of these things around in a little handbag until a drop croc landed on her at
 any rate it was a fascinating place but unfortunately australia didn 't stay this way climate change has affected the world for a long period of time and gradually
 the forests disappeared  the country began to dry out and the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline until by five million years ago only one left 
 by ten thousand years ago  they had disappeared from new guinea  
 and unfortunately  by
 four thousand years ago somebodies we don 't know who this was introduced dingoes this is a very archaic kind of a dog into australia and as you can see
  are very similar in their body form to thylacines that similarity meant
 they probably competed they were eating the same kinds of foods it 's even possible that aborigines were keeping some of these dingoes
 as pets  and therefore they may have had an advantage in the battle for survival all we know is soon after the dingoes were brought in thylacines were extinct in the australian mainland 
 and after that they only survived in tasmania
  then  unfortunately the next sad part of the thylacine story is that europeans arrived in one thousand seven hundred and eighty eight and they brought with them the things they valued and that included sheep  
 they took one look at the thylacine in tasmania and they thought  hang on  this is not going to work  that guy is going to eat all our sheep
  that was not what happened actually wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep  but the thylacine got a bad rap  but immediately the government said that 's it  
 let 's get rid of them  and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw 
 by the early 1930s 
 three thousand to four thousand thylacines had been murdered  it was a disaster and they were about to hit the wall 
 have a look at
  it makes me very sad because while it 's a fascinating animal and it 's amazing to think
 that we had the technology to film it before it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction 
 we didn 't unfortunately at this same time have a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species  these are photos of the last surviving thylacine benjamin who was in the beaumaris zoo in hobart 
 to add insult to injury having
  swept this species nearly off the table
  this animal when it died of neglect the keepers didn 't let it into the hutch on a cold night in hobart  
 it died of exposure and in the morning when they found the body of benjamin  they still cared so little for this animal that they threw the body in the dump  
 does it have to stay this way
  was in the australian museum i was fascinated by thylacines i 've always been obsessed with these animals  and i was studying skulls trying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals  
 and i saw this jar and here in the jar was a little girl thylacine pup  perhaps six months old 
 the guy who had found it and killed the mother had pickled the pup and they pickled it in alcohol
  still knew alcohol was a dna preservative but this was one thousand nine hundred and ninety  and i asked my geneticist friends couldn 't we think about going into this pup
 and extracting dna if it 's there  
 and then somewhere down the line in the future we 'll use this dna to bring the thylacine back  the geneticists laughed  but this was six years before dolly  
 cloning was science fiction it had not happened  but then suddenly cloning
  did happen  and i thought when i became director of the australian museum  i 'm going to give this a go i put a team together  we went into that pup
 to see what was in it and we did find thylacine dna it was a eureka moment we were very excited  
 unfortunately  
 we also found a lot of human dna every old curator who 'd been in that museum had seen this wonderful specimen put their hand in the jar pulled it out and
  wow look at that plop dropped it back in the jar  contaminating this specimen  
 and that was a worry  if the goal here was to get the dna out and use the dna down the track to try to bring a  thylacine back 
 what we didn 't want happening when the information was shoved into the machine and the wheel turned around and the lights flashed 
 was to have a wizened old horrible curator pop out the other end of the machine 
 it would 've kept the curator very happy but it wasn 't going to
 so we went back to these specimens and we started digging around and particularly we looked into the teeth of skulls  hard parts where humans had not been able to get their fingers 
 and we found much better quality dna  
 we found nuclear mitochondrial genes it 's there so we got it ok  what could we do with this stuff well george church
  has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing to work with fragmented dna 
 we would hope that we 'll be able to get that dna back into a viable form and then much like we 've done with the lazarus project get that stuff into an egg of a host species it has to be a different species what could it be 
 why couldn 't it be a tasmanian devil they 're related distantly to thylacines 
 and then the tasmanian devil is going to pop a thylacine out the south end 
 critics of this project say
 tasmanian devil  that 's going to hurt no
 it 's not these are marsupials  they give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean  that tasmanian devil 's not even going to know it gave birth 
 it is shortly going to think it 's got the ugliest tasmanian devil baby in the world so maybe it 'll
  andrew pask and his colleagues have demonstrated this might not be a waste of time and it 's sort of in the future we haven 't got there yet but it 's the kind of thing we want to think about  
 they took some of this same pickled thylacine dna
 and they spliced it into a mouse genome but they put a tag on it so that anything that this thylacine dna produced
 would appear
  in the mouse baby in other words if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine dna it would be able to be recognized when the baby popped up it was filled with 
  blue green tissues  and that tells us if we can get that genome back together get it into a live cell it 's going to produce thylacine stuff 
 is this a risk you 've taken the bits of one animal and you 've mixed them into the cell of a different
 a frankenstein 
 some kind of weird hybrid chimera  and the answer is no if the only nuclear dna that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine dna that 's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil  
 ok  if we can do this 
 could we put it back this is a key question for everybody  does it have to stay in a laboratory or could we put it back where it belongs could we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in tasmania restore that ecosystem
 has tasmania changed so much that that 's no longer possible i 've been to tasmania
 i 've been to many of the areas where the thylacines were common  i 've even spoken to people like peter carter here who when i spoke to him was ninety years old but in 
 this man and his father and his brother caught thylacines they trapped them  and when i spoke to this man  i was looking in his eyes and thinking
  behind those eyes is a brain that has memories
 of what thylacines feel like what they smelled like 
 what they sounded like he led them around on a rope he has personal experiences that i would give my left leg
 to have in my head 
 we 'd all love to have this sort of thing happen anyway i asked peter by any chance could he take us back to where he caught those thylacines my interest was in whether the environment had changed
  he thought hard it was nearly eighty years before this that he 'd been at this hut at any rate he led us down this bush track and there right where he remembered was the hut  
 and tears
 came into his eyes he looked at the hut we went inside there were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut where he and his father and his brother had slept at night and he
  it all was flooding back in memories he said i remember the thylacines going around the hut
 wondering what was inside and he said
 they made sounds like yip yip yip all of these are parts of his life and what he remembers  
 and the key question for me was to ask peter has it changed and he said no the southern beech forests surrounded his hut just like it was when he was there in one thousand nine hundred and twenty six 
 the grasslands were sweeping away that 's
  and the animals in those areas were the same that were there when the thylacine was around so could we put it back yes 
 is that all we would do  and this is an interesting question
  sometimes you might be able to put it back but is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again and i don 't think so 
 i think gradually as we see species all around the world  it 's kind of a mantra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild we 'd love to think it is but we know it isn 't we need other parallel
  strategies coming online and this one interests me some of the thylacines that were being turned in to zoos sanctuaries even at the museums had collar marks on the neck 
 they were being kept as pets  and we know a lot of bush tales and memories of people who had them as pets and they say they were wonderful friendly this particular one came in out of the
  to lick this boy and curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep a wild animal 
 and i 'd like to ask the question we need to think about this 
 if it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then 
 would the thylacine be extinct now  and i 'm positive it wouldn 't we need to think about this in today 's world 
 could it be that getting animals close to us
 so that we value them maybe they won 't go extinct and this is such a
  critical issue for us
 because if we don 't do that we 're going to watch more of these animals plunge off the precipice 
 as far as i 'm concerned this is why we 're trying to do these kinds of de extinction projects 
 we are trying to restore that balance of nature that we have upset  thank you
