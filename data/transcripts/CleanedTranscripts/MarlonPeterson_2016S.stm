  when i become famous  i will tell everyone that i know a hero named marlon peterson 
 heroes rarely look like me in fact  i 'm what garbage looks
  not the most appealing way to open a talk or start a conversation and perhaps you have some questions going through your head about that 
 why would this man say such a thing about himself what does he mean 
 how can someone view him as a as a hero when he sees himself as garbage  
 i believe we learn more from questions than we do from answers  
 because when we 're questioning something we 're invested in taking in some sort of new information or grappling with some sort of ignorance that makes us feel
  uncomfortable and that 's why i 'm here to push us to question even when it makes us uncomfortable
 my parents are from trinidad and tobago 
 the southernmost island in the caribbean trinidad is also home to the only acoustic instrument invented in the 20th century the steel pan  
 deriving from the african drums and evolving from the genius of one of the ghettos in trinidad
  a city called laventille and the disregard of the american military well i should
 tell you america during wwii had military bases set up in trinidad and when the war ended they left the island littered with empty oil drums
 their trash so people from 
 repurposed the old drums left behind into the full chromatic scale the steel pan
  playing music now from from beethoven to bob marley to fifty cent those people literally made music
 out of garbage  twelve days before my 20th birthday  i was arrested for my role in a violent
 robbery attempt in lower manhattan  while people were sitting in a coffee shop  four people were shot 
 two were killed
 five of us were arrested  
 we were all the products of trinidad and tobago  
 we were the bad immigrants or the anchor babies that trump and millions of americans easily malign  
 i was discarded  like waste material
 and justifiably so to many i eventually served ten years two months and seven days of a prison sentence
 i was sentenced to
 a decade of punishment in a correctional institution  i was sentenced to irrelevance
 the opposite of humanity  
 interestingly 
 it was during those years in prison that a series of letters redeemed
 me helped me move beyond the the darkness and the guilt associated with the worst moment of my young life it
 gave me a sense that i was useful
 she was thirteen years old she had wrote that she saw me as a hero 
 i remember reading that and i remember crying when i read those words 
 she was one of over fifty students and one hundred and fifty letters that i wrote during a mentoring correspondence program
 that i co designed with a friend who was a teacher at a middle school in brooklyn my hometown  we called it the young scholars program
 every time those young people shared their shared their stories with me their struggles  
 every time they they drew a picture of their favorite cartoon character character and sent it to me  
 every time they said they depended on my letters or my words of advice 
 it boosted my sense of worthiness  
 it gave me a sense of what i could contribute to this planet it transformed my life
  those letters
 and what they shared with me their stories of teen life  they gave me the permission 
 they gave me the courage to admit to myself that there were reasons not excuses but that there were reasons for that fateful day in october of one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine 
 that the trauma associated with living in a community where guns are easier to get than sneakers 
 that the trauma associated with being raped
 at gunpoint
 at the age of fourteen that those are reasons for me
 why making that decision that fatal decision was not an unlikely proposition  
 because those letters mattered so much to me because writing and receiving and having that communication with those folks
 so hugely impacted my life i decided to share the opportunity with some friends of mine who were also inside with me
  my friends bill and cory and arocks all in prison for violent crimes also shared their words of wisdom with the young people as well and received the sense of relevancy in return 
 we are now published writers and youth program innovators and trauma experts and gun violence prevention advocates and ted talkers and and good daddies 
 that 's what i call a positive return of investment
  all else what building that program taught me was that when we when we sow when we invest in the humanity of people no matter where they 're at 
 we can reap amazing rewards 
 in this latest era of criminal justice reform i often question and wonder why why is it that so many believe that only
 those who have been convicted of nonviolent drug offenses merit empathy
  and recognized humanity  criminal justice reform is human justice am i not human 
 when we invest in resources that amplify the relevancy of people in communities like laventille or parts of brooklyn or a ghetto near you  we can literally create the communities that we want  
  we can do better we can do better than investing solely in law enforcement as a resource because
 they don 't give us a sense of relevancy that is at the core of why so many of us do so many harmful things in the pursuit
 of mattering see gun violence is just a visible display of a lot of underlying traumas 
 when we invest in the redemptive value of relevancy we can render a return of both personal responsibility
 and healing that 's the people work i care about
 because people work  
 family i 'm
 asking you to do the hard work 
 the difficult work 
 the churning work of bestowing undeserved kindness upon those who we can relegate as garbage who we can disregard and discard easily  
 i 'm asking myself 
 over the past
  two months i 've lost two friends to gun violence both innocent bystanders 
 one was caught in a drive by while walking home 
 the other was sitting in a caf while eating breakfast while on vacation in miami i
 'm asking myself to see the redemptive value of relevancy in the people that murdered them  because of the hard work of seeing the value
  i 'm pushing us to challenge our own capacity to fully experience our humanity by understanding the full biography of people who we can easily choose not to see  
 because heroes are waiting to be recognized and music is waiting to be made  thank you
