  when most people think about the beginnings of aids they 're gonna think back to the 1980s 
 and certainly this was the decade in which we discovered aids and the virus that causes it hiv  
 but in fact this virus crossed
 crossed over into humans many decades before from chimpanzees where the virus originated into humans who hunt these apes  
 this photo was taken before the great depression in brazzaville congo at this time there were thousands of individuals we think that were infected with hiv 
 so i have a couple of really important questions for you 
 if this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point  why was it the case that it took us until one thousand nine hundred and eighty four to be able to discover this
  had we seen this disease had we understood exactly what was going on with it how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved 
 in fact this is not unique to hiv the vast majority of viruses come from animals  and you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses
 from animals into human populations but only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human nevertheless we spend the vast majority of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid 
 trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings that are going to be very very difficult to address as we 've seen in the case of hiv so during the last fifteen years i 've been working 
  to actually study the earlier interface here what i 've labeled viral chatter which was a term coined by my mentor don burke  this is the idea that we can study the sort of pinging of these
  viruses into human populations the movement of these agents over into humans and by capturing this moment we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early  
 ok so this is a picture and i 'm going to show you some pictures now from the field  this is a picture of a central african hunter it 's actually a fairly common picture one of the things i want you to note from it is
  blood that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact this was absolutely key for us this is a very intimate form
  of connection  so if we 're going to study viral chatter  we need to get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals and so we 've been studying people like this individual we 
  collect blood from them other specimens we look at the diseases which are in the animals as well as the humans  
  these individuals but to establish thousands of individuals in these populations that we would monitor continuously on a regular basis when they were sick we would collect specimens from them 
 we would actually enlist them which we 've done now to collect specimens from animals we give them these little pieces of filter paper when they sample from animals they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify 
  viruses from exactly the right animals the ones that are
  actually being hunted 
 deep in a remote region of cameroon two hunters stalk their prey their names are patrice and patee they 're searching for bush meat  
 forest animals they can kill to feed their families  patrice and patee set out most days to go out hunting in the forest around their homes they
 have a series of traps
  of snares that they 've set up to catch
 wild pigs  snakes monkeys  rodents anything they can really  
 patrice and patee have been out for hours but found nothing 
 the animals are simply gone  we stop for a drink of water
  a rustle in the brush a
 group of hunters approach  
 their packs loaded with wild game  there 's at least three viruses
 that you know about which are in this particular monkey nathan wolfe this species yeah  and there 's many many more pathogens that are present in these animals these individuals are at specific risk
  particularly if there 's blood contact they 're at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses narrator 
 as the hunters display their kills something surprising happens 
 they show us filter paper they 've used to collect the animals ' blood the blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses part of a program dr wolfe has spent
  every person who has one of those filter papers has at least at a minimum been through our basic health education about the risks associated with these activities  which presumably from our perspective gives them 
 the ability to decrease their own risk and then obviously the risk to their families  the village the country and the world nw 
  ok and you can consider all sorts of different bush meat i 'm going to be talking about this 
 when your children and grandchildren sort of pose questions to you about this period of time one of the things they 're gonna ask you is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives some of the most valuable and endangered species on our
 planet to go extinct because we weren 't able to address some of the issues of poverty in these parts of the world  but in fact that 's not the only question they 're going to ask you about this
 they 're also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that hiv entered into the human population 
 and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this why did we let these behaviors continue why did we not find some other solution to this they 're going to say in regions of profound instability throughout 
  the world where you have intense poverty where populations are growing and you don 't have sustainable resources like this this is going to lead to food insecurity
 but they 're also going to ask you probably a different question it 's one that i think we all need to ask ourselves  which is why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual 
  here now this is the individual you can see just right up over his right shoulder this is the individual that hunted the monkey from the last picture that i showed you ok take a look at his shirt 
  is occurring in our population right now in humanity on this planet  
 but it can 't be the fault of somebody like this ok and solving it cannot be his responsibility alone 
 there 's no easy solutions but what i 'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem at our own peril  so in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight along with my
  we went to actually start this work in central africa to work with hunters in this part of the world 
 and my job at that time i was a post doctoral fellow  and i was really tasked with setting this up  
 so i said to myself ok great we 're gonna collect all kinds of specimens we 're gonna go to all these different locations it 's going to be wonderful you know
 i looked at the map i picked out seventeen sites i figured no problem 
 laughter needless to say i was drastically wrong this is challenging work to do
  fortunately  i had and continue to have an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team and that 's the only way that this work can really occur  
 we have a whole range of challenges about this work one of them is just obtaining trust from individuals that we work with in the field 
 the person you see on the right hand side is paul  delong minutu he 's one of the best communicators that i 've really ever dealt with when i arrived i didn 't speak a word of french and i still seemed to understand what it was he was saying
  paul worked for years on the cameroonian national radio and television and he spoke about health issues he was a health correspondent so we figured we 'd hire this person when we got there he could be a great 
  communicator when we would get to these rural villages though what we found out is that no one had television so they wouldn 't recognize his face  
  potential to spread aspects of our message whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention  
 often we run into obstacles this is us coming back from one of these very rural sites with specimens from two hundred individuals that we needed to get back to the lab within forty eight hours i like to 
  show this shot this is ubald tamoufe who 's the lead investigator in our cameroon site  ubald laughs at me when i show this photo because of course you can
  see his face  but the reason i like to show the shot is because you can see that he 's about to solve this problem which which he did  which he did 
 just a few quick before and after shots this was our laboratory before
  this is what it looks like now 
 early on in order to ship our specimens we had to have dry ice to get dry ice we had to go to the breweries beg borrow steal to get these folks to give it to us
  now we have our own liquid nitrogen  i like to call our laboratory the coldest place in central africa it might be 
 and here 's a shot of me this is the before shot of me 
 no comment 
 so what happened so during the ten years that we 've been doing this work we actually surprised ourselves  we made a number of discoveries  
 and what we 've found is that if you look in the right place
  place you can actually monitor the flow of these viruses into human populations that gave us a tremendous amount of hope what we 've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals including 
  new viruses in the same group as hiv so brand new retroviruses and let 's face it any new retrovirus in the human population it 's something we should be aware of it 's something we should be following
  it 's not something that we should be surprised by
 needless to say in the past these viruses entering into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct that 's no longer the case logging roads provide access to urban areas  
 and
 critically what happens in central africa
 doesn 't stay in central africa 
 so once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monitoring we decided to move this from research to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort
  through generous support and partnership scientifically with google org and the skoll foundation we were able to start the global viral forecasting initiative and begin work in four different sites in africa and asia  
 needless to say different populations from different parts of the world have different sorts of contact so it 's not just hunters in
  it 's also working in live animal markets these wet markets which is exactly the place where sars emerged in asia  but really this is just the beginning from our perspective our objective right now in 
  addition to deploying to these sites and getting everything moving is to identify new partners because we feel like this effort needs to be extended to probably twenty or more sites throughout the world to 
  viral hotspots because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net so that we can catch these things ideally before they make it to blood banks
  networks airplanes and that 's really our objective 
 there was a time not very long ago when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible awe for us it had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves  and thought about ourselves  
 many people i think on our planet right now despair  and they think
  we 've reached a point where we 've discovered most of the things i 'm going tell you right now please don 't despair 
 if an intelligent extra terrestrial was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet twenty seven out of thirty of these volumes would be devoted to bacteria and virus 
 with just a few of the volumes left for plants  fungus and animals humans being a footnote
  this is honestly the most exciting period ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet the dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing 
  about and yet finally we have the tools which will allow us to actually explore that world and and understand them
