  cultural evolution is a dangerous child for any species to let loose on its planet  
 by the time you realize what 's happening the child is a toddler up and causing havoc  and it 's too late to put
  we humans are earth 's pandoran species  we 're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box  and we can 't push it back in 
 we 're seeing the consequences all around us now
 that i suggest is the view that comes out of taking memetics seriously  
 and it gives us a new way of thinking about not only what 's going on on our planet  but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos
 so first of all i 'd like to say something about memetics and the theory of memes  and secondly how this might answer questions about who 's out there  
 if indeed anyone is 
 so memetics 
 memetics is founded on the principle of universal darwinism 
 darwin had this amazing idea indeed some people say it 's the best
  idea anybody ever had isn 't that a wonderful thought that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had
 all design in the universe  
 i would say not just biological design  but all of the design that we think of as human design it 's all just the same thing happening what did darwin say  i know you know the idea  natural selection  but let me just paraphrase
 the origin of species one thousand eight hundred and fifty nine in a few sentences
  what darwin said was something like this 
 if you have creatures that vary 
 and that can 't be doubted i 've been to the galapagos and i 've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on and so on and one hundred pages later 
 and if there is a struggle for life such that nearly all of these creatures die
 and this can 't be
  i 've read malthus and i 've calculated how long it would take for elephants to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted and so on and so on and another one hundred pages later  
 and if
 the very few that survive pass onto their offspring whatever it was that helped them survive then those offspring must be better adapted to the circumstances in which all this happened
 than their parents were you see the idea if if if then he had no
  concept of the idea of an algorithm  but that 's what he described in that book and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm  the principle is
 you just need those three things variation selection and heredity  
 and as dan dennett puts it if you have those then you must get evolution  
 or design out of chaos  without the aid of mind
  there 's one word i love on that slide what do you think my favorite word is
  anything else if there 's something that is copied with variation and it 's selected then you must get design appearing out of nowhere
 you can 't stop it must is my favorite word there  
 now what 's this to do with memes  well  the principle here
 applies to anything that is copied with variation and selection  we 're so used to thinking in
  terms of biology we think about genes this way  
 darwin didn 't of course he didn 't know about genes he talked mostly about animals and plants but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct  
 but the principle of universal darwinism is that any information that is varied and selected will produce design and this is what richard dawkins
  the information that is copied he called the replicator it selfishly copies 
 not meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going i want to get copied 
 but that it will get copied if it can regardless of the consequences it doesn 't care about the consequences because it can 't because it 's just information being copied  
 and he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes and so he said is there another
  replicator out there on the planet ah yes there is look around you
 here will do in this room 
 all around us  still clumsily drifting about in its primeval soup of culture is another replicator information that we copy from person to person  by imitation  
 by language by talking by telling stories by
 wearing clothes by doing things this is
  information copied with variation and selection this is
 is design process going on he wanted a name for the new replicator 
 so he took the greek word mimeme which means that which is imitated  
 remember that that 's the core definition that which is imitated  and abbreviated it to meme just because it sounds good and made a good meme an effective spreading meme 
 so that 's how the idea came
  about 
 it 's important to stick with that definition
  the whole science of memetics is is much maligned much misunderstood much feared but a lot of these problems can be
 avoided by remembering the definition a meme is not equivalent to an idea it 's not
 an idea it 's not equivalent to anything else really stick with the definition  it 's that which is imitated
  or information which is copied from person to person  
 so  let 's see some memes  well  you sir you 've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way  
 i wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself or copied it from someone else  if you copied it from someone else  it 's a meme  and what about oh i can 't see any interesting memes here 
  who 's got some interesting memes for me  
 oh well your earrings i don 't suppose you invented the idea of earrings you probably went out and bought them there are plenty more in the shops that 's something that 's passed on from person to person
 all the stories that we 're telling well of course  ted is
 a great meme fest masses of memes  the way to think about memes though is to think why do they spread they 're selfish
  will get copied if they can 
 but some of them will be copied because they 're good or true or useful  or beautiful  some of them will be copied even though they 're not some it 's quite hard to tell why
  there 's one particular curious meme which i rather enjoy  and i 'm glad to say as i expected i found it when i came here and i 'm sure all of you found it too you go to your nice posh  international hotel somewhere 
  all memes but they 're sort of useful ones and then there 's this one 
 what is this one doing 
 this has spread all over the world it 's not surprising that you all found it when you arrived
  in your bathrooms here  but i took this photograph
 in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco camp in the jungle in assam 
 who folded that thing up there  and why 
 laughter some people get carried away 
  other people are just lazy and make mistakes 
 some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes with a little sticker 
 what is this all about
  i suppose it 's there to tell you that somebody 's cleaned cleaned the place and it 's all lovely and you know  actually all it tells you is that another person has potentially spread spread germs from place to place 
 laughter so think of it this way  imagine a world full of brains and far more memes than can possibly find homes the
  memes are all trying to get copied trying in inverted commas
 that 's the shorthand for if they can get copied they will they
 're using you and me as their propagating copying machinery  and we are the meme machines 
 now why is this important why is this useful
 what does it tell us 
 it gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human 
 all conventional theories of cultural evolution of the origin of humans and what makes us so different from other species  
 all other theories explaining the big brain and language and tool use and all these things that make us unique 
 are based upon genes  language must have been useful for the genes  tool use must have enhanced our survival mating and so on it
  always comes back as richard dawkins complained all that long time ago  it always comes back to genes  the point of memetics is to say oh no it doesn 't 
 there are two replicators now on this planet 
 from the moment that our ancestors perhaps two and a half million years ago or so  began imitating 
 there was a new copying
  with variation and selection a new replicator was let loose  
 and it could never be right from the start it could never be that human beings who let loose this
 this new creature could just copy the useful  beautiful true things and not copy the other things  while their brains were
 having an advantage from being able to copy lighting fires keeping fires going
  techniques of hunting these kinds of things inevitably they were also copying
 putting feathers in their hair  or wearing strange clothes or painting their faces or whatever so you get an arms race between
 the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains and
 not waste their time copying all this stuff and the memes themselves like the sounds that people made and copied
 in other words what turned out to be language competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger
  so the big brain on this theory is driven by the memes this is why in the meme machine i called it memetic drive 
 as the memes evolve as they inevitably must  they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes that
 that are doing the driving this is why we 've ended up with such peculiar
  that we like religion and music and art 
 language is a parasite that we 've adapted to not something that was there originally for for our genes on this view 
 and like most parasites it can begin dangerous  but then it  coevolves and adapts  and we end up with a symbiotic relationship with this new parasite 
 and so from our perspective we don 't realize that that 's how it began 
  is a view of what humans are 
 all other species on this planet are gene machines only they don 't imitate at all well  hardly at all 
 we alone are gene machines and meme machines as well  
 the memes took
 a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine  but that 's not all we have a new kind of memes now  
 i 've been wondering for a long time since i 've been thinking about memes a lot is there a difference between the memes that we copy the words we speak to each other the
  gestures we copy the human things and all these technological things around us i have always until now 
 called them all memes  but i
 i do honestly think now we need a new word for technological memes let 's call them techno memes or temes 
 because the processes are getting different 
 we began perhaps five thousand years ago with writing we put
 the
 the storage of memes out there on on a clay tablet  
 but in order to get true temes and true teme machines you need to get the variation the selection and the copying all done outside of humans  and we 're getting there we 're at this extraordinary 
  point where we 're nearly there  that there are machines like that and indeed in the short time i 've already been at ted i see we 're even closer than i thought we were before
 actually  now the temes  are are forcing our brains to become more like teme machines our children are growing up
 very quickly learning to read learning to use machinery  
 we 're going to have all kinds of implants drugs that force us to stay awake all the time we 'll think we 're choosing these things 
 but the temes are making us do it 
 so we 're at this cusp now
 of having a third
  replicator on our planet now what about
 what else is going on out there in the universe 
 is there anyone else out there  
 people have been asking this question for a long time we 've been asking it here at ted already in one thousand nine hundred and sixty one frank drake made his famous equation  
 but i think he concentrated on the wrong things it 's been very productive that equation he wanted to estimate
  n the number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy  and he included in there the rate of
 star formation the rate of planets but crucially intelligence i think that 's the wrong way to think about it 
 intelligence appears all over the place in all kinds of guises human intelligence is only one kind of a thing  but what 's really important is the replicators you have and the levels
  of replicators one feeding on the one before  so  i would suggest
 that we don 't think intelligence we think replicators 
 and on that basis i 've suggested a different kind of equation a very simple equation  n  the same thing the number of
 communicative civilizations out there [ that ] we might expect in our galaxy just start with the the number of planets there are in our
  galaxy
  the fraction of those which get a first replicator  
 the fraction of those that get the second replicator  
 the fraction of those that get the third replicator  because it 's only the third replicator that 's going to reach out sending information sending probes getting out there and communicating with anywhere else 
  so if we take that equation  why haven 't we heard from anybody out there  
 because every step is dangerous 
 getting a new replicator is dangerous you can pull through  we have pulled through  but it 's dangerous 
 take the first step 
 as soon as life appeared on this earth  we may take the gaian view i loved peter ward 's talk yesterday it 's not gaian all the time actually life forms produce things that kill themselves
  well  we did pull through on this planet  but then a long time later billions of years later we got the second replicator the memes 
 that was dangerous all right think of the big brain
 how many mothers do we have here you know all about big brains they are dangerous to give birth to are agonizing
  my cat gave birth to four kittens purring all the time ah mm slightly different 
 but not only is it painful  it kills lots of babies it kills lots of mothers 
 and it 's very expensive to produce the genes are forced into producing all this myelin all the fat to myelinate the brain 
 do you know sitting here your brain is using about twenty percent of your body
 's energy output for two percent of your body weight it 's a really expensive organ to run why because it 's it 's producing the memes now it could have killed us off  
 it could have killed us off and maybe it nearly did but you see we don 't know  
 but maybe it nearly did has it been tried before  what about all those other species  louise leakey talked yesterday
 about how we 're the only one in this in this branch left  what happened to the others
  could it be that this experiment in imitation this experiment in a second replicator is dangerous enough to kill people off  
 well we did pull through  and we adapted  but now we 're hitting as i 've just described we 're hitting the third replicator point 
 and this is even more dangerous well  it 's dangerous again why  because the temes are selfish replicators and they don 't care about
  just information why would they 
 they are using us to suck up the planet 's resources to produce more computers and more of all these amazing things we 're hearing about here at ted 
 don 't think oh  we created the internet for our own benefit that 's how it seems to us think temes
 spreading because they must we are the old machines 
  are we going to pull through  what 's going to happen what does it mean to pull through  
 well there are kind of two ways of pulling through  
 one that is obviously happening all around us now 
 is that the temes turn us into teme machines with these implants with the drugs with us merging with the technology 
 and why would they do that because we are 
 we have babies we make new ones and so it 's convenient to piggyback on us
  because we 're not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable although it 's closer i heard this morning it 's closer than i thought it was 
 where the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves  
 that way  it wouldn 't matter
 if the planet 's climate was utterly destabilized  and it was no longer possible for humans to live here
  because those teme machines they wouldn 't need they 're not squishy wet
  we got the second
