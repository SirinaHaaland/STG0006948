  mott hall bridges academy in two thousand and ten my goal was simple 
 open a school to close a prison now to
  this was an audacious goal because our school is located in the brownsville section of brooklyn
 one of the most underserved and violent neighborhoods in all of new york city  
 like many urban schools with high poverty rates 
 we face numerous challenges  like finding teachers who can empathize with the complexities
 of a disadvantaged community  lack of funding for technology
  parental involvement
 and neighborhood gangs that recruit children
 as early as fourth grade so here i was the founding principal
 of a middle school that was a district public school and i only had
  kids to start  thirty percent of them had special needs
 eighty six percent of them were below grade level in english and in math and one hundred percent were
 living below the poverty level 
 if our children are not in our classrooms  how will they learn  and if they 're not learning
  where would they end up it was evident when i would ask my 
 young man  where do you see yourself
 in five years and his response i don 't know if i 'm gonna live that long 
 or to have a young woman say to me
 that she had a lifelong goal of working in
  unacceptable 
 it was also evident that they had no idea that there was a landscape of opportunity that existed beyond their neighborhood 
 we call our students scholars because they 're lifelong learners  
 and the skills that they learn today will prepare them for college and career readiness 
 i chose the royal colors
 of purple and black  
 because i want them to be reminded that they are descendants of greatness  and that through education  they are future engineers  scientists 
  entrepreneurs and even leaders who can and will take over this world 
  this is nearly two hundred children who are now going to some of the most competitive high schools
  it was a cold day in january when my scholar 
  met brandon stanton 
 the founder of the popular blog humans of new york brandon shared the story of a young man from brownsville
 who had witnessed violence firsthand
  by witnessing a man being thrown off of a roof  yet he can still be influenced by a principal
 who had opened up a school that believes in all children  
 vidal embodies the story of so many of our underprivileged children
 who are struggling to survive which is why we must make education a priority
 brandon 's post created a global sensation
 that touched the lives of millions this resulted in one point four million dollars being raised
 for our scholars to attend field trips to colleges and universities  
 summer steam programs as well as college scholarships
  need to understand that when two hundred
 young people from brownsville visited harvard 
 they now understood that a college of their choice was a real possibility  
 and the impossibilities that had been imposed upon them
 by a disadvantaged community were replaced by hope and purpose
  the revolution in education is happening in our schools with adults
 who provide love  structure  support
 and knowledge  these are the things that inspire children but it is not an easy task
  are high demands
 within an education system that is not perfect  but i have a dynamic group of educators
 who collaborate as a team to determine what is the best curriculum 
 they take time beyond their school day  and come in on weekends and even use their own money
 to often provide resources
 when we do not have it and as the principal
 i have to inspect what i expect  so i show up in classes
 and i conduct observations to give feedback  
 because i want my teachers to be just as successful as the name mott hall bridges academy  
 and i give them access to me every single
  which is why they all have my personal cell number  including my scholars and those who graduated
 which is probably why i get phone calls and text messages at three o 'clock in the morning 
 but we are all connected to succeed and good leaders do this 
 tomorrow 's future is sitting in our classrooms  and they are our responsibility 
 that means everyone in here and those who are watching the
  screen we must believe in their brilliance  and remind them by teaching them
 that there indeed is power in education
