  anger in me against corruption
 made me to make a big career change last year becoming a full time practicing lawyer my experiences
 over the last eighteen months as a lawyer has seeded in me a new
 entrepreneurial idea which i believe is indeed worth spreading  
 so i share it with all of you here today though the idea itself is getting crystallized and i 'm still writing up the business plan of course it helps
 that fear of public failure diminishes as the number of ideas which have failed
 increases  i 've been a huge
  fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since one thousand nine hundred and ninety three 
 i 've explored  experienced and experimented enterprise and capitalism to my heart 's content  
 i built  along with my two brothers 
 the leading real estate company in my home state kerala  and then worked professionally with two of india 's biggest businessmen but in their startup enterprises
  two thousand and three when i stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector to work on so called social sector issues  
 i definitely did not have any grand
 strategy or plan to pursue and find for profit solutions
 to addressing pressing public issues  when life brought about a series of death and
 experiences within my close circle which highlighted the need
 for an emergency medical response service in india similar to nine hundred and eleven in usa to address this i along with four friends  founded ambulance access for all 
 to promote life support ambulance services in india 
 for those from the developing world  there is nothing absolutely nothing new in this idea
  idea  but as we envisioned it we had three key goals  providing world class life support ambulance service which is fully self sustainable from its own revenue streams 
 and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency  irrespective of the capability to pay 
 the service which grew out of this  
 with one ambulance in two thousand and four now has a hundred plus ambulances in three states  and has transported over one hundred thousand patients and victims since inception 
 the service is fully self sustainable
 from its own revenues  without accessing any public funds  and the cross subsidy model actually works
  the rich pays higher  poor pays lower and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge 
 the service responded effectively and efficiently during the unfortunate twenty six eleven mumbai terror attacks
 and as you can see from the visuals 
 the service was
 responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off
 the incident
  locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike 
 we ended up being the first medical response team in every
 incident location and transported one hundred and
  over the last one year  we have actually helped a pakistani ngo aman foundation to set up
 life support ambulance service in karachi  facilitated
  it 's a small message from us in our own small way
 to the enemies of humanity of islam 
 of south asia of india  and of pakistan that humanity will continue to bloom  irrespective of such
  two other social enterprises one is education access for all setting up schools in small town india  and the other is moksha yug access which is integrating rural supply chain
 on the foundations of 
 microfinance i guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right  because diligent investors and venture funds
 have committed over seven point five million dollars in funding with the significance being
  these funds have come in as a qt capital not as grant or as philanthropy  
 now i come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that i 'm exploring corruption bribes and lack of transparency you may be surprised to know that eight speakers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their
  bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side with the supply side being mostly of greedy corporate unethical businesses and hapless
 common man and the demand side being mostly politicians bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them  
 according to world bank estimate one trillion dollars is paid in bribes every year  worsening the condition of the already worse off 
 yet if you analyze the common man
 he or she does not wake up every day and say hmm let me see who i can pay a bribe to today or let me see who i can corrupt today 
 often it is the constraining or the back to the wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe 
 in the modern day world where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably
  tough the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life now
 let me ask you another question  imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day to day life to get something done  what do you do 
 of course you can call the police but what is the use if the police department is in itself
 steeped in corruption 
 most definitely you don 't want to pay the bribe  but you also don 't have the time resources  expertise or wherewithal to fight this 
 unfortunately 
 many of us in this room are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in pay a fee  and
  such a service simply do not exist 
 one image that has haunted me from my early business days is of a grandmother seventy plus years being harassed by the bureaucrats
  in the town planning office all she needed was permission to build three steps to her house from ground level making it easier for her to enter and exit her house  
 yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe 
 even though it pricked my conscience then i could not or rather i did not tend to her or assist her  because i was busy building my real estate company i don 't want to be haunted by such images any more 
 a group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address
 individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement  and in all forty two cases where we have pushed back such demands
 using existing and legitimate tools like the right to information act 
 video  audio or peer pressure we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe and with the cost of these tools being substantially
  lower than the bribe demanded i believe that these tools that worked in these forty two pilot cases can be consolidated
 in standard processes
 in a bpo kind of environment and made available on web call center and franchise physical offices for a fee to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe 
  market is as tempting as it can get it can be worth up to one trillion dollars being paid in bribes every year  or equal to india 's gdp and it is an absolutely virgin market 
 i propose to explore this idea further to examine the potential of creating a
  corruption i do realize that the fight for justice against corruption
 is never easy it never has been and it never will be in my last eighteen months as a lawyer battling small and large scale corruption  including the one perpetrated by india 's biggest corporate scamster  through his charities
 i have had three police cases filed against me alleging trespass
  and intimidation 
 the battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves our families our friends  and even our kids  yet i believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place 
 what gives us the courage as my close friend replied when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project
 that it is an impossible task and
  are insane to chalk up their  blue chip jobs i quote of course we cannot fail in this at least in our own minds for we are insane people  trying to do an impossible task and an insane person does not know what an impossible task is
  give us a sense of of the numbers here a typical bribe and a typical fee i mean what 's in your head sm so let me  let me give you an example  somebody who
  who had applied for the passport  the officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around three thousand rupees in bribes and
 he did not want to pay  so we actually used the right to information act which is equal to the freedom of information act in the united states  and
 pushed back the officers
 in this particular case  and in all these forty two cases  when we kept pushing them back there was three kinds of reaction a set of people actually say
  just grant it to them and
 run away from it some people actually come back and say oh you want to screw me 
 let me show you what i can do and he will he will push us back so you take the next step or use the next tool available in what what we are putting together  
 and then he relents by the
  what fee would you have to charge and can you actually make the business work sm well actually the cost that we incurred was less than
 two hundred rupees so it actually works ca that 's a high gross margin business i like
  so these are provisional numbers  no pricing guarantee  if you can pull this off you will be a global hero i mean this could be huge  thank you so much for sharing this idea
