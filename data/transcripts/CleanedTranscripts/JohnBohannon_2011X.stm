  good afternoon as you 're all aware we face difficult economic times i come to you with a modest proposal
 for easing the financial burden this idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at mit he was struggling to explain
  something to me a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter  
 now he confused me from the very start because light doesn 't cool things down  it makes it hotter it 's happening right now  
 the reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than one hundred quintillion photons and they 're moving randomly through the space  near the speed of light 
 all of them are different colors
  rippling with different frequencies  and they 're bouncing off every surface including me and some of those are flying directly into your eyes  and that 's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here 
 now a laser is different 
 it also uses photons  but they 're all synchronized  
 and if you focus them into a beam what you have is an incredibly useful
  the control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye 
 you can use it to store massive amounts of data  and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain 
 first you trap atoms in a special bottle  it uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment  
 and the atoms themselves are quite violent  but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency an atom will briefly absorb
  those photons and tend to slow down little by little
 it gets colder
 until eventually it approaches absolute zero  
 now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough something truly bizarre happens  
 it 's no longer a solid a liquid or a gas  it enters a new state of matter called a superfluid  
 the atoms
  lose their individual identity  and the rules from the quantum world take over  and that 's what gives superfluids such
 spooky properties for example if you shine light through a superfluid  
 it is able to slow photons down to sixty kilometers per hour
  another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction so if you were to take the lid off that bottle  it won 't stay inside 
 a thin film will creep up the inside wall  flow over the top
 and right out the outside now of course  the moment that it does hit the outside environment  and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree  
 it immediately turns back into normal matter
 superfluids are one of the most fragile things we 've ever discovered  
 and this is the great pleasure of science the defeat of our intuition through experimentation  
 but the experiment is not the end of the story because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people 
 i have a ph d in molecular biology  i still barely understand what most scientists are talking about 
 so as my friend was trying to explain that experiment
  it seemed like
 the more he said  the less i understood  
 because if you 're trying to give someone the big picture of a complex idea to really capture its essence  
 the fewer words you use the better 
 in fact the ideal may be to use no words at all i remember thinking my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance of course there never seem to be any dancers
  around when you need them  
 now the idea is not as crazy as it sounds  i started a contest four years ago called dance your ph d 
 instead of explaining their research with words scientists have to explain it with dance 
 now surprisingly  it seems to work dance really can make science easier to understand 
 but don 't take my word for it go on the internet and search for dance your
  of dancing scientists waiting for you 
 the most surprising thing that i 've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research 
 for example at the university of minnesota  there 's a biomedical engineer named david odde and he works with dancers to study how cells move 
 they do it by changing their shape when a chemical signal washes up on one side  it triggers the cell to expand its
  shape on that side because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment  so that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions  
 but what seems so slow and graceful from the outside
 is really more like chaos inside  because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers  and those fibers are constantly falling apart  
 but just as quickly as they explode more proteins
  attach to the ends and grow them longer so it 's constantly changing just to remain exactly the same  
 now david builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab  but before he does that he works with dancers to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place  
 it 's basically efficient brainstorming and when i
  visited david to learn about his research he used dancers to explain it to me
 rather than the usual method powerpoint  
 and this brings me to my modest proposal i think that bad powerpoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy
 but one estimate has put the drain at two hundred and fifty million dollars per day  
 now that assumes half hour presentations for an average audience of four people with salaries of thirty five thousand dollars  
 and it conservatively assumes that about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time 
 and given that there are some apparently thirty million powerpoint presentations created every day 
 that would indeed
  add up to an annual waste of one hundred billion dollars of course that 's just the time we 're losing sitting through presentations 
 there are other costs  
 because powerpoint is a tool  and like any tool it can and will be abused to borrow a concept from my country 's cia  
 it helps you to soften up your audience 
 it distracts them with pretty pictures
 irrelevant data  it allows you to create the illusion of competence  the illusion of simplicity  
 and most destructively  the illusion of understanding  
 so now my country is fifteen trillion dollars in debt our leaders are working tirelessly
  to try and find ways to save money one idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts 
 for example our national endowment for the arts with its $ one hundred and fifty million budget  slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt by about one one one thousandth of a percent  
 one certainly can 't argue with those numbers  however  
 once we eliminate public
 funding for the arts  there will be some drawbacks the artists on the street will swell
  the ranks of the unemployed  
 many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution  and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods 
 all of this could wipe out the savings we 're hoping to make in the first place  
 i shall now therefore  humbly propose my own thoughts  which i hope will not be liable to the least objection  
 once we eliminate public funding for the artists let 's put them back to work by using them instead of powerpoint
 as a test case  i propose we start with american dancers after all they are the most perishable of their kind prone to injury and very slow to heal due to our health care system 
 rather than
 dancing our ph ds we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems  
 imagine our politicians using dance to explain why we must invade a foreign country
  or bail out an investment bank  it 's sure to help
  that you can perform
