  i 'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation  
 now  usually when i mention suspended animation  people will flash me the vulcan sign and laugh  but now i 'm not talking about gorking people out to fly to mars or even pandora
  much fun as that may be i 'm talking about
 the concept of using suspended animation
 to
 help people out in trauma 
 so what do i mean when i say suspended animation it is the process by which
 animals
  appear dead and then can wake up again without being harmed  ok  so
 here is the sort of big idea if you look out at nature  
 you find that as you tend to see suspended animation  you tend to see immortality  
 and so  what i 'm going to tell you about is a way
 to tell a person
  who 's in trauma
 find a way to de animate them a bit so they 're a little more immortal
 when they have that heart attack an example of an organism or two that happens to be
 quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores these creatures
  are some of the most immortal life forms on our planet  and
 they tend to spend most of their time in suspended animation  
 bacterial spores are thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive but in suspended animation for as long as two hundred and fifty million years 
 to suggest that this all sort of about little tiny creatures
 i want to bring it close to home 
 in the immortal germ line of human beings that is the eggs that sit in the ovaries
 they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation for up to fifty years in the life of each woman 
 so then there 's also my favorite example of suspended animation  this is
  those of you with children you know about them 
 you go to the pet store or the toy store and you can buy these things you just open the bag and you just dump them into the plastic aquarium and in about a week or so you 'll have little shrimps swimming around  
 well i wasn 't so interested in the swimming i was interested in what was going on in the bag  the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely 
 so
  these ideas of suspended animation are not just about cells and weird little organisms occasionally human beings are briefly de animated and the stories 
 of people who are briefly de animated that interest me the most are those having to do with the cold  
  and she was there for two hours before they extracted her she was extremely cold  and she had no heartbeat for all intents and purposes she was dead frozen  
 seven hours later  
 still without a heartbeat they brought her back to life  and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treated her 
 a couple of years later so i get really excited about these things about a couple of years later there was
 she was from canada her father had gone out in the wintertime he was working night shift and she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper  
 and they found her hours later  frozen lifeless  and they brought her back to life 
 there was a 65 year old woman in duluth minnesota last year
 that was found frozen and without a pulse in her front yard one morning in the winter  and they brought her back to life the next day she was doing
  so well they wanted to run tests on her she got cranky and just went home 
 so these are miracles right these are truly miraculous things that happen  doctors have a saying
 that in fact you 're not dead until you 're warm and dead 
 and it 's true  it 's true in the new england journal of medicine there was a study published that showed that with appropriate rewarming people who had suffered
  without a heartbeat heartbeat for three hours could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems that 's over fifty percent  
 so what i was trying to do is think of a way
 that we could study suspended animation to think about a way to reproduce maybe what happened to the skier well
 i have to tell you something very
 odd and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill  
 so  in this room there 's twenty percent oxygen or so and if we reduce the oxygen concentration 
 we will all be dead and in fact the animals we were working with in the lab
 these little garden worms nematodes they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen and here 's the thing that should freak you out 
 and that is that when we lower the oxygen concentration further by one hundred
  times to ten parts per million they were not dead  they were in suspended animation  and we could bring them back to life without any harm  
 and this precise oxygen concentration ten parts per million that caused suspended animation  is conserved 
 we can see it in a variety of different
  one of the creatures we see it in is a fish  and we can turn its heartbeat on and off
 by going in and out of suspended animation like you would a light switch  so
 this was pretty shocking to me 
 that we could do this  and so i was wondering when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier that we noticed that of course she had no
  and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation  but of course she was also extremely cold so we wondered what would happen if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold  and so what we found 
  out was that if you take animals that are animated like you and i  and you make them cold that is these were the garden worms now they 're dead  but if you have them in suspended animation  and move them into the cold  they 're all
  and there 's the very important thing there if you want to survive the cold you ought to be suspended  
 right  it 's a really good thing  
 and so we were thinking about that about this relationship between these things and thinking about whether or not that 's what happened to the skier  
 and so we wondered might there be some agent that is in us something that we make ourselves that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility
  in such a way as to be able to survive when we got extremely cold and might otherwise pass away i
 thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things  you know  
 i should mention briefly here that physiology textbooks that you can read about will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest
  we have from the time we are slapped on the butt until we take our last dying
  're newborn to when we 're dead we we cannot reduce our metabolic rate below what 's called a standard or basal metabolic rate 
 but i knew that there were examples of creatures also mammals that do reduce their metabolic rate such as ground squirrels and bears  they reduce their metabolic rate in the wintertime when they hibernate 
 so i wondered might we be able to find some agent or trigger that might induce such a state in us  and so we went looking for such things
  this was a period of time when we failed tremendously
  ken robinson is here he talked about the glories of failure well we had a lot of them we tried many different chemicals and agents  and we failed over and over again so one time i was at home
 watching television on the couch while my wife was putting our child to bed and
 i was watching a television show it was a television show it was a nova show
  show
 on pbs about caves in new mexico  
 and this particular cave was lechuguilla  and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans the researchers had to suit up just to enter it it 's filled with this toxic gas hydrogen sulfide  
 now hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us  we make it ourselves  the highest concentration is in our brains
  yet it was used as a chemical warfare agent in world war i 
 it 's an extraordinarily toxic thing  in fact in chemical accidents hydrogen sulfide
 is known
 to if you breathe too much of it you collapse to the ground you appear dead  but if you were
  you go into the research institute and you say hi  i 'd like to buy some concentrated compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas
 because i have these ideas
  see about wanting to suspend people  it 's really going to be ok so that that 's kind of a tough day but i said there really is
 some basis for thinking why you might want to do this as i said this agent is in us  
 and in fact here 's a curious thing it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds and where you burn it and that you do this burning to live  and so
  we thought like in a game of musical chairs might we be able to
 give a person
 some hydrogen sulfide and might it be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind and because you can 't bind the oxygen 
 maybe you wouldn 't consume it and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen i mean who knows so
 laughter so there 's the bit about the dopamine and being
 a little bit what do you call it delusional  and you might suggest that was it and so we wanted to find out might we be able to use
 hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in
  and when we get cold  we shake and we shiver right  we try to keep our core temperature at thirty seven degrees by actually burning more oxygen  
 so 
 it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse
  when it was also cold because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold  it stopped moving 
 it appeared dead its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold and here 's the really important point  
 i told you hydrogen sulfide is in us it
 's rapidly metabolized  and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de animation is simply put the thing out in room air and it warms up and it 's none the worse for wear
  now  this was cosmic really because we had found a way to 
 a mammal  and it didn 't hurt it now we 'd found a way to reduce its oxygen consumption
 to rock bottom levels and it was
  in this state of de animation it could not go out dancing  but
 it was not dead and it was not harmed  
 so we started to think 
 is this the agent that might have been present in the skier  and might have she had more of it than someone else  and might that have been able to reduce 
 her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died as we found out with our worm experiments
  so we wondered can we do anything useful with this
 capacity to control metabolic flexibility and
 one of the things we wondered i 'm sure some of you out there are economists and you know all about supply and demand and when supply is equal to demand 
  but when supply falls in this case of oxygen and demand stays high you 're dead  so what i just told you is we can now reduce
 demand  we ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal 
 and with money we got from darpa 
 we could show just that if you give mice hydrogen sulfide you can lower their demand for oxygen  and you can put them into oxygen
 that are as low as five thousand feet above the top of mt everest  and they can sit there for hours and there 's no problem  
 well this was really cool we also found out that we could subject animals to otherwise lethal blood loss and we could save them
 if we gave them hydrogen sulfide  so these proof of concept experiments led
  i should found a company  and we should take this out to a wider playing field i founded a company called ikaria
 with others ' help  and
 this company the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide
 an injectable form that we could put in and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine and the results are incredibly positive 
 in one model of heart attack animals given hydrogen sulfide
  seventy percent reduction in heart damage compared to those who got the standard of care that you and i would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today 
 same is true for organ failure when you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney of liver  acute respiratory distress syndrome and damage suffered in cardiac bypass surgery 
  these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine all over the world saying this is true so it seems
 that exposure to hydrogen sulfide decreases damage that you receive from being exposed to otherwise lethal low oxygen 
 and i should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit
 are low incredibly low in fact so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit i just mentioned
  adopting this you don 't want to be gorking people out just to save them it 's really confusing so 
 i want to say that we 're in human trials  now  and so 
 thank you the phase one safety studies are over and we 're doing fine we 're now moved on we have to
  get to phase two and phase three it 's going to take us a few years this has all moved very quickly  
 and the mouse experiments of hibernating mice happened in two thousand and five the first human studies were done in two thousand and eight  and we should know in a couple of years whether it works or not  
 and
 this all happened really quickly because of a lot of help from a lot of people i want to mention that first of all my wife without whom this talk and my work would not be possible so thank you very
  much also 
 the brilliant scientists who work at my lab and also others on staff the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle washington wonderful place to work 
 and also the wonderful scientists and businesspeople at ikaria one thing those people did out there was take this technology of hydrogen sulfide which
  company that 's burning venture capital very quickly  and they fused it with another company that sells another toxic gas that 's more toxic than
 hydrogen sulfide  and they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die
 from a failure to be able to oxygenate their tissues properly  
 and this gas that is delivered in over a thousand critical care hospitals worldwide  now is approved on label and saves thousands of babies a year
 from certain death
  so
 it 's really
 incredible for me to be a part of this and i want to say that i think we 're on the path of understanding metabolic flexibility in a fundamental way  
 and that
 in the not too distant future an emt might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide or some related compound
  to a person suffering severe injuries  and that person might de animate a bit they might become a little more immortal 
 their metabolism will fall
  as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home  and then 
 they will have the time that will buy them the time to be transported to the hospital
 to get the care they need
  and then after they get that care like the mouse like the skier  like the 65 year old woman
 they 'll wake up a miracle  we hope not or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common
