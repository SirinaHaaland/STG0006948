  when dorothy was a little girl  she was fascinated by her goldfish her father explained to her that fish swim by quickly wagging their tails to propel themselves through the water  
 without hesitation little dorothy responded yes daddy  and fish swim backwards by wagging their heads
  in her mind  it was a fact as true as any other fish swim backwards by wagging their heads  she believed it 
 our lives are full of fish swimming backwards  
 we make assumptions and faulty leaps of logic we harbor bias  we know that we are right and they are wrong 
 we fear the worst we strive for unattainable perfection 
 we tell ourselves what we can and cannot do 
 in our minds
  fish swim by in reverse frantically wagging their heads and we don 't even notice them i
 'm going to tell you five facts about myself one fact is not true 
 one i graduated from harvard at nineteen with an honors degree in mathematics 
 two i currently run a construction company
  i starred on a television sitcom 
 four i lost my sight to a rare genetic eye disease  
 five i served as a law clerk to two us supreme court justices  which fact is not true  
 actually they 're all true yeah they 're all true
  point most people really only care about the television show 
 laughter i know this from experience 
 ok so the show was nbc 's saved by the bell the new class and
 i played weasel wyzell who was the sort of dorky nerdy character
  which made it a very major acting challenge for me as a 13 year old boy 
 now  did you struggle with number four my blindness why is that 
 we make assumptions about so called disabilities 
 as a blind man i confront others ' incorrect assumptions about my abilities every day 
 my point today is not about my blindness however  it 's about my vision
  going blind taught me to live my life eyes wide open  
 it taught me to spot those backwards swimming fish that our minds create going blind cast them into focus 
 what does it feel like to see  it 's immediate and passive you open your eyes and there 's the world seeing is believing sight is truth
  's what i thought then from age twelve to twenty five my retinas progressively deteriorated 
 my sight became an increasingly bizarre carnival funhouse hall of mirrors and illusions 
 the salesperson i was relieved to spot in a store was really a mannequin  
 reaching down to wash my hands i suddenly saw it was a urinal i was touching not a sink when my fingers felt its true shape
  a friend described the photograph in my hand and only then i could see the image depicted objects appeared  morphed and disappeared
 in my reality  it was difficult and exhausting to see  
 i pieced together fragmented transitory images  consciously analyzed the clues  searched for some logic in my crumbling kaleidoscope 
 until i saw nothing at all
 i learned that what we see is not
 universal truth  it is not objective reality  
 what we see is a unique personal virtual reality
 that is masterfully constructed by our brain  
 let me explain with a bit of amateur neuroscience your visual cortex takes up about thirty percent of your brain that 's compared to approximately
  eight percent
 for touch and two to three percent for hearing  
 every second your eyes can send your visual cortex as many as two billion pieces of information 
 the rest of your body can send your brain only an additional billion 
 so sight
 is one third of your brain by volume
 and can claim about two thirds of your brain 's processing resources  it 's no surprise then
  that the illusion of sight is so compelling  but make no mistake about it sight is an illusion  
 here 's where it gets interesting 
 to create the experience of sight 
 your brain references your conceptual understanding of the world other knowledge your memories opinions emotions mental attention all of these things and far more
 are linked in your brain to your sight these linkages work both ways and
  occur subconsciously  so for example  what you see impacts how you feel and the way you feel can literally change what you see  
 numerous studies demonstrate this 
 if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example  
 your answer will be different if you 're told to think about cheetahs or turtles 
 a hill appears steeper if you 've just exercised
 and a landmark appears farther away if you 're wearing a heavy backpack 
 we have arrived at a fundamental contradiction 
 what you see is a complex mental construction of your own making 
 but you experience it passively as a direct representation of the world around you 
 you create your own reality  and you believe it 
 i believed mine until
  it broke apart the deterioration of my eyes shattered the illusion you see sight is just one way
 we shape our reality  we create our own realities in many other ways  
 let 's take fear as just one example  
 your fears distort
  under the warped logic of fear anything is better than the uncertain 
 fear fills the void at all costs  passing off what you dread for what you know offering up the worst in place of the ambiguous  
 substituting assumption for reason  
 psychologists have a great term for it
  need to look outside yourself and think critically 
 fear beats a retreat deep inside your mind  shrinking and distorting your view  drowning your capacity for critical thought with a flood of disruptive emotions  
 when you face a compelling opportunity to take action fear lulls you into inaction enticing you to passively watch its prophecies fulfill themselves
  i was diagnosed with my blinding disease  i knew
 blindness would ruin my life blindness was a death sentence for my independence  it was the end of achievement for me 
 blindness meant i would live an unremarkable life  small and sad and likely alone  
  this was a fiction born of my fears  but i believed it it was a lie  but it was my reality  just like those backwards swimming fish in little dorothy 's mind  
 if i had not confronted the reality of my fear i would have lived it  i am certain of that 
 so how do you live your life eyes wide open  it is a learned discipline  it can be taught  it can be practiced
 i will summarize very briefly hold yourself accountable
 for every moment  every thought every detail 
 see beyond your fears  recognize your assumptions harness your internal strength  silence your internal critic  
 correct your misconceptions about luck and about
  accept your strengths and your weaknesses  and understand the difference open your hearts to your bountiful blessings  
 your fears  your critics your heroes your villains
 they
 are your excuses  rationalizations  shortcuts  justifications  your surrender 
 they are fictions you perceive as reality  
 choose to see through them  choose to let them go
  you are the creator
 of your reality  
 with that empowerment comes complete responsibility  
 i chose to step out of fear 's tunnel into terrain uncharted and undefined  
 i chose to build there a blessed life 
 far from alone  i share my beautiful life with dorothy my beautiful wife with our
  triplets whom we call the tripskys 
 and with the latest addition to the family  sweet baby clementine what do you fear  
 what lies do you tell yourself 
 how do you embellish your truth and write your own fictions what reality are you creating for yourself 
 in your career and personal life in your relationships  and in your heart and
  soul your backwards swimming fish do you great harm 
 they exact a toll in missed opportunities and unrealized potential  and they engender insecurity and distrust where you seek fulfillment
 and connection  i urge you to search them out 
 helen keller said that the only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no
  vision  
 for me going blind was a profound blessing  because blindness gave me vision  
 i hope you can see what i see  thank you
  audience of entrepreneurs of doers of innovators you are a ceo of a company down in florida and
 many are probably wondering how is it to be a blind ceo what kind of specific challenges do you have and how do
  in my leadership team meetings  i don 't see facial expressions or gestures  
 i 've learned to solicit a lot more verbal feedback i basically
 force people to tell me what they think and in this respect
  it 's become like i said a real blessing for me personally and for my company  
 because we communicate at a far deeper level  we avoid ambiguities  
 and most important my team knows that what they think truly matters
