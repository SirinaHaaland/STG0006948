  the honorary perpetual secretary of l 'academie francaise the french academy he is splendidly attired in his
 the
 correct
 usage in french and perpetuating the language 
 the french academy has two main tasks  it compiles a dictionary of official french they 're now working on their
 ninth edition which they began in one thousand nine hundred and thirty and they 've reached the letter p they also legislate on correct usage such as
 the proper term for
  what the french call email which ought to be courriel the world wide web the french are told ought to be referred to as 
 the global spider web recommendations that the french gaily ignore  now this is one model of
 how language comes to be
  it 's legislated by
 an academy but anyone who looks at language realizes that this is a
 rather silly conceit that language  rather emerges from human minds interacting from one another  
 and this is visible in the unstoppable change in language the fact that by the time the academy finishes their dictionary it will already be well out of date we see it in the
 constant
  appearance of slang and jargon of the historical change in languages in divergence of dialects and the formation of new languages  
 so language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature so much as a window onto human nature 
 in a
 book that i 'm currently working on i hope to use language to shed light on a
 number of aspects of  human nature including the cognitive machinery with which humans conceptualize the world and the relationship types
  that govern human interaction and i 'm going to say a few words about each one this morning
 let me start off with a technical problem in language that i 've worried about for quite some time and
 indulge me in
 my passion for verbs and how they 're used the problem is 
 which verbs go in which constructions  the verb is the chassis of the sentence it 's the framework onto which the other parts are
  bolted let me
 give you a a quick reminder of something that you 've long forgotten an intransitive verb such as dine 
 for example can 't take a direct object you have to say sam dined not sam dined the pizza a transitive verb
 mandates that there has to be an object there sam devoured the pizza you can 't just say sam
  dozens or scores of verbs of this type each of which shapes its sentence so a problem in explaining how children learn language a problem in
 teaching language to adults so that they don 't make grammatical errors and a problem in programming computers to use language is which verbs go in which constructions  
 for example  the dative construction in english you can say give a muffin to a
  and so on hundreds of verbs can go both ways  
 so a tempting generalization for a child for an adult for a computer is that any verb that can appear in the construction
 can also be expressed as 
 handy thing to have because language
  you can 't just parrot back the sentences that you 've heard you 've got to extract generalizations so you can produce and understand new sentences this would be an example of how to do that 
 unfortunately there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions you can say biff drove the car to chicago but not biff drove chicago the car 
 you can say sal gave jason a headache but it 's a bit odd to say sal gave a headache
  the solution is that these constructions despite initial appearance are not synonymous that when you crank up the microscope on human cognition you see that there 's a subtle difference in meaning between them 
 so give the x to the y 
 that construction corresponds to the thought cause x to go to y whereas give the y the x corresponds to the thought cause y to have x now  many events
 can be subject to either construal kind of like the classic
 figure ground reversal illusions in which you can
 either pay attention to the
 particular object in which case the space around it recedes from attention or you can see the faces in the empty space in which case the object
 recedes out of consciousness 
 how are these construals reflected in language well in both cases the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object the
  noun after the verb 
 so when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere where you 're doing something to the muffin you say give the muffin to the mouse when you construe it as cause the mouse to have something 
 you 're doing something to the mouse  and therefore you express it as give the mouse the muffin 
  the problem with which i began depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion or a kind of possession change 
 to give something involves both causing something to go and causing someone to have to drive the car only causes something to go because chicago 's not the kind of thing that can possess something only humans can possess things 
 and to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache but it 's not as if you 're taking the headache out of your head and causing it to go to the other person and implanting it in them  you may just be loud or
  obnoxious or some other way causing them to have the headache so that 's
 an example of the kind of thing that i do in my day job  so why should anyone care 
 well there are a number of interesting conclusions i think from this
 and many similar kinds of analyses of
 hundreds of english verbs 
  there 's a level of fine grained conceptual structure which we automatically and unconsciously compute every time we produce or utter a sentence that governs our use of language you can think of this as the language of thought or mentalese 
 it seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs not only in english but in all other languages
 fundamental concepts such as
  causation and human intention such as what is the means and what is the ends these are reminiscent of the kinds of categories that immanuel kant
 argued are the basic framework for human thought  and it 's interesting that our unconscious use of language seems to reflect these kantian categories doesn 't care about 
 perceptual qualities such as color texture weight and speed which virtually never differentiate
 differentiate the use of verbs in different constructions an additional twist is that all of the constructions in english are used not only literally but in a
  way  for example this construction the dative is used not only to transfer things but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas as when we say she told a story to me or told me a story max taught spanish to the students or taught the students spanish
  exactly the same construction but no muffins no mice nothing moving at all 
 it evokes the container metaphor of communication in which we conceive of ideas as objects sentences as containers and communication as a kind of sending 
 as when we say we gather our ideas to put them into words and if our words aren 't empty or hollow we might get these ideas across to a listener who can unpack our words to extract their 
  and indeed this kind of verbiage is not the exception but the rule it 's very hard to find any example of abstract language that is not based on some concrete metaphor  
 for example  you can use the verb 
 go and the prepositions to and from in a literal spatial sense the messenger went from paris to istanbul you can also say biff went from sick to well 
 he needn 't go anywhere he could have been in bed the whole time but it 's as if his health is a point in state space that you conceptualize as moving or
  meeting went from three to four in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line likewise we use force to indicate
 not only physical force as in rose forced the door to open but also interpersonal force as in rose forced sadie to go not necessarily by manhandling her but by
 issuing a threat or rose forced herself to go as if there were two entities inside rose 's head engaged in a tug of
  war
 second conclusion is that the ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways  such as cause something to go to someone and causing someone to have something i think is a fundamental
 feature of human thought and it 's the basis for much human argumentation in which people don 't differ so much
  i think the biggest picture of all would take seriously the fact that so much of our verbiage about abstract events is based on a
 concrete metaphor and see human intelligence itself as consisting of a repertoire of concepts such as objects space time  causation and intention which are useful in a social knowledge intensive species whose evolution you can well
 imagine and a process of metaphorical abstraction that allows us to bleach these concepts of their original conceptual content
 space time and force and apply them to new abstract domains therefore allowing a
  species that evolved to deal with rocks and tools and animals to conceptualize mathematics physics  law and
 other abstract domains well
 i said i 'd talk about two windows on human nature the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world and now i 'm going to say a few words about the relationship types that govern human social interaction again as reflected in language and
 i 'll start out with a puzzle the puzzle of indirect speech acts
 now i 'm sure most of you have seen the movie fargo and you might remember the scene in which the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer is asked to show his driver 's license and holds his wallet out with a 50 dollar bill
 extending at a slight angle out of the wallet and he says i was just thinking that maybe we could take care of it
  including the audience interprets
 as a veiled bribe  this kind of indirect speech is rampant in language  for example
  in polite requests if someone says if you could pass the guacamole  that would be awesome we know exactly what he means even though that 's a rather bizarre
 concept being expressed 
 would you like to come up and see my etchings i think most people
  understand the intent behind that and likewise  if someone says nice store you 've got there it would be a real shame if something happened to it 
 we understand that as a veiled threat rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities so the puzzle is why are bribes polite requests solicitations and threats so often veiled
  no one 's fooled both parties know exactly what the speaker means and the speaker knows the listener knows that the speaker knows that the listener knows 
 etc etc so what 's going on i think
 the key idea is that language is a way of negotiating relationships and human relationships fall into a number of types there 's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist alan fiske in which relationships can be categorized
  more or less into communality which works on the principle what 's mine is thine what 's thine is mine the kind of
 mindset that operates within a family for example  dominance whose principle is don 't mess with me 
 reciprocity you scratch my back i 'll scratch yours and sexuality in the immortal words of cole porter let 's do it 
 now relationship types can be negotiated  even though there are default situations in which one of these mindsets can be applied
 they can be stretched and extended  for example communality applies most naturally within family or friends but it can be used to try to transfer the
 mentality of sharing to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it for example in brotherhoods fraternal organizations  
  the family of man you try to get people who are not related to use the
 relationship type that would ordinarily be appropriate to
 close kin 
 now mismatches when one person assumes one relationship type and another assumes a different one can be awkward if you went over and you helped yourself to a shrimp off your boss  ' plate 
  for example that would be an awkward situation  or if a dinner guest after the meal pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal  that would be rather awkward as well
  in
 less blatant cases there 's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on 
 in the workplace for example there 's often a tension over whether an employee can socialize with the boss  or refer to him or her on a first name basis 
 if two friends have a reciprocal transaction like selling
  it 's well known that this can be a source of tension or awkwardness 
 in dating the transition from friendship to sex can lead to notoriously various forms of awkwardness and as can sex in the workplace in which we call the conflict between
 a dominant and a sexual relationship sexual harassment well what does this have to do with language well language  as a social interaction has to satisfy two conditions
  you have to convey the actual content here we get back to the container metaphor you want to express the bribe the command the promise the
 solicitation and so on but you also have to negotiate and maintain the kind of relationship you have with the other person  
 the solution i think is that we use language at two levels the literal form signals the safest relationship with the listener  whereas the implicated content the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform
 allows the listener to derive
  the interpretation which is most relevant in context which possibly initiates a changed relationship the simplest example of this is in the polite request 
 if you express your request as a conditional 
 if you could open the window that would be great even though the content is an imperative the fact that you 're not using the imperative voice means that you 're not
 acting as if you 're in a relationship of dominance
  you could presuppose the compliance of the other person on the other hand you want the damn guacamole by expressing it as an if then statement you can get the message across without appearing to boss another person around 
 and in a more subtle way i think this works for all of the
 veiled speech acts involving plausible deniability
  the bribes threats propositions solicitations and so on 
 one way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language where it could only be used literally and you can think of it in terms of a
 game theoretic payoff matrix put yourself in the position of the
 kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer there 's a high stakes in
 the two possibilities of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer  if you don 't bribe the officer then
 you will get a traffic ticket or as is the case of fargo worse whether the honest officer is honest or dishonest  nothing ventured nothing gained in that case the consequences are rather
 severe on the other hand if you extend the bribe  if the officer is dishonest you get a huge payoff of going free  if the
 officer is honest you get a huge penalty of being arrested for bribery
  this is a rather fraught situation  
 on the other hand with indirect language if you issue a veiled bribe  then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe in which case you get the payoff of going free the honest officer can 't
 hold you to it as being a bribe and therefore you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket so you get
  and a similar analysis i think can apply to the potential awkwardness of a sexual solicitation 
 and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset i think this affirms something that 's long been known by diplomats namely that the vagueness of language 
  far from being a bug or an imperfection actually might be a feature of language one that we use to our advantage in
 social interactions 
 so to sum up language is a collective human creation reflecting human nature  how we conceptualize reality  how we relate to one another and then by analyzing 
  the various quirks and complexities of language  i think we can get a window onto what makes us tick thank you very much
