  to be here we 've heard a lot about the promise
 of technology  and the peril  i 've been quite interested in both 
 if we could convert zero point zero three percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy we could meet
 all of our projected needs for
 we can 't do that today because solar panels are heavy expensive and very inefficient there are nano engineered designs 
 which at least have been analyzed theoretically that show the potential to be very lightweight very inexpensive very
 efficient and we 'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way nano engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where it 's needed  
 that 's a key trend
  is decentralization moving from centralized nuclear power plants and liquid natural gas tankers to decentralized
 resources that are environmentally more friendly a lot
 more efficient
 and capable and safe from disruption bono spoke very eloquently that we have the tools for the first time to
 address
  of disease and poverty most regions of the world are
 moving in that direction in one thousand nine hundred and ninety in east asia and the pacific region there were five hundred million people
 living in poverty that number now is under two hundred million the world bank projects by two thousand and eleven it will be under twenty million which is a reduction of ninety five percent
  we hung around harvard square  but we do have the potential to
 overcome disease and poverty and i 'm going to talk about those issues if we have the will kevin kelly talked about the acceleration of technology
  that 's been a strong interest of mine and a theme that i 've
 developed for some thirty years i realized that my technologies had to make sense
 when i finished a project  that invariably the world was a different place
 when i would introduce a technology and i noticed that most inventions fail not because the r & d department can 't get it to work
 if you look at most business plans  they will actually succeed if given
  opportunity to build what they say they 're going to build
 and ninety percent of those projects or more will fail because the timing is wrong not all the enabling factors will be in place
 when they 're needed so i began to be an ardent student of technology trends and track where technology would be at different points in time and began to build
 build the mathematical models of that it 's kind of taken
  life of its own i 've got a group of ten people that work with me to gather data
 on key measures of technology in many different areas and we build models and you 'll hear people say well we can 't predict the future  and if you ask me 
 will the price of google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now that 's very hard to say will wimax 
 be the wireless standard three years from now that 's hard to say  but if you ask me what will it cost for one mips of computing in two thousand and ten or the cost to sequence a
  base pair of dna in two thousand and twelve or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in two thousand and fourteen it turns out that
 those are very predictable  
 there are remarkably smooth exponential curves that govern price performance capacity  bandwidth and i 'm going to show you a small sample of this 
 but there 's really a theoretical reason
 why technology
  develops in an exponential fashion  and a lot of people when they think about the future think about it linearly they think they 're going to continue to develop
 a problem or
 address a problem using today 's tools at today 's pace of progress and fail to take into consideration this exponential growth
 the genome project was a controversial project in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety  
 we had our best ph d students our most advanced equipment around the world we got one 10 000th of the project done so how 're we going to get this done in fifteen years and ten years
 into the project  the skeptics were still going strong says you 're two thirds through this project  and you 've managed to only sequence
 a very tiny percentage of the whole genome but it 's the nature of exponential growth that once it reaches the knee of the curve it explodes most of the project was done in the last
 few years of the project  it took us fifteen years to sequence
  we are gaining the potential to overcome these problems i 'm going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is the actual 
  the rate of adopting new ideas is doubling every decade according to our models these are all logarithmic graphs 
 so as you go up the levels it represents generally multiplying by factor of ten or one hundred it took us half a
  cell phones were adopted in about eight years  if you put different
 communication technologies on this logarithmic graph television radio  
 telephone were adopted in decades  recent technologies like the pc the web cell phones were under a decade  
 now this is an interesting chart and this really gets at the fundamental reason why an evolutionary process and both biology and technology are evolutionary processes
 accelerate they work through interaction they create a capability and then it uses that capability to bring on the next stage so the first step in biological evolution  the 
  evolution of dna actually it was rna came first took billions of years but then evolution used that
  backbone to bring on the next stage so the cambrian explosion when all the
 body plans of the animals were
 evolved took only ten million years it was two hundred times faster 
 and then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions and biological evolution kept accelerating it 's an inherent nature
 of an evolutionary process so homo sapiens the first technology creating species the species that combined a cognitive
 function with an opposable appendage and by the way chimpanzees don 't really have a very good opposable thumb
 so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination and
  use our mental models to actually change the world and bring on technology but anyway the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years  
 and then working through interaction evolution used 
 essentially the technology creating species to bring on the next stage which were the first steps in technological evolution and the first step took tens of thousands of years
 stone tools fire the wheel kept accelerating we always used then the latest generation of technology to create the next generation 
 printing press took a century to be adopted the first computers were designed pen on paper now we use computers  and we 've had a continual acceleration
 of this process now by the way if you look at this on a linear graph it looks like everything has just happened  but some
 observer says well kurzweil just put points on this graph that fall
  took fifteen different lists from key thinkers like the encyclopedia britannica the museum of natural history carl sagan 's cosmic calendar
 on the same and these people were not trying to make my point these were just lists in reference works and i
 think that 's what they thought the key events were in biological evolution and technological evolution 
 and again it forms the same straight line you have a little bit of thickening in the line because people do have
 disagreements what the key points are there 's differences of opinion when agriculture started or how long the cambrian explosion
  took but you see a very clear trend there 's a basic profound acceleration of this evolutionary process 
 information technologies double their capacity price performance bandwidth 
 every year  and that 's a very profound explosion of exponential growth a
 personal experience when i was at mit computer taking up about the size of this room less powerful than the
  computer in your cell phone  but moore 's law  which is very often identified with this exponential growth is just one example of many because it 's basically
 a property of the evolutionary process of technology 
 i put forty nine famous computers on this logarithmic graph by the way a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth
 that 's another exponential  it took us three years to double our price
  performance of computing in one thousand nine hundred two years in the middle we 're now doubling it every one year
 and that 's
 exponential growth through five different paradigms moore 's law was just the last
 part of that where we were shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit but we had
 electro mechanical calculators relay based computers that cracked the german enigma code vacuum tubes in the 1950s predicted the election of eisenhower
  discreet transistors used in the first space flights
  and then moore 's law every time one paradigm ran out of steam another paradigm came out of left field to continue the exponential growth they were shrinking vacuum tubes making them smaller and smaller that hit a wall they couldn 't shrink them and keep the vacuum 
 whole different paradigm transistors came out of the woodwork in fact when we see the end of the line for a particular paradigm it creates research pressure to create the next paradigm 
 and because we 've been predicting the end of moore 's law
  quite a long time the first prediction said two thousand and two until now it says two thousand and twenty two but by the teen years  the features of transistors will be a few atoms
 in width and we won 't be able to shrink them any more 
 that 'll be the end of moore 's law but it won 't be the end of the exponential growth of computing because chips are flat we live in a three dimensional world we might as well use the third dimension we will go into the
  molecular circuits to work we 'll have those ready
 well before moore 's law runs out of steam  supercomputers same thing
  processor performance on intel chips 
 the average price of a transistor one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight you could buy one transistor for a dollar  
 you could buy ten million in two thousand and two
 it 's pretty remarkable how smooth
 an exponential process process that is  i mean you 'd think this is the result of some tabletop experiment but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior
 countries accusing each other of dumping products ipos bankruptcies marketing programs you would think it would be a very erratic
 process and you have a very
  outcome of this chaotic process 
 just as we can 't predict what one molecule in a gas will do it 's hopeless to predict a single molecule yet we can predict the properties of the whole gas using thermodynamics 
 very accurately it 's the same thing here we can 't predict any particular project  
 but the result of this whole worldwide chaotic unpredictable
 activity of competition and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable
 and we can predict these trends far into
  the future  
 unlike gertrude stein 's roses it 's not the case that a transistor is a transistor 
 as we make them smaller and less expensive  the electrons have less distance to travel they 're faster  so you 've got exponential growth in the speed of transistors so the cost
 of a cycle of one transistor has been coming down with a halving rate of one point one years  you add other forms of innovation and processor design
  you get a doubling of price performance of computing every one year  and that 's basically
 deflation
 fifty percent deflation and it 's not just computers i mean it 's true of dna sequencing it 's true of brain scanning  it 's true of the world wide web i mean anything that we can quantify we have
 hundreds of different measurements of different
  double every twelve thirteen fifteen months depending on what you 're looking at 
 in terms of price performance that 's a forty to fifty percent deflation rate 
 and economists have actually started worrying about that we had deflation during the depression but that was collapse of the money supply collapse of consumer confidence a completely different phenomena 
 this is due to greater productivity but the economist says but there 's no way you 're going to be able to keep up with that if you have fifty percent deflation people may
 increase their volume thirty forty percent but they won 't keep up with it but what we 're actually seeing is that
 we actually more than keep up with it we 've had twenty eight percent per year compounded growth in dollars in information technology over the last fifty years i mean people didn 't build
 ipods for ten thousand dollars ten years ago  as the price performance
 makes new applications feasible
  new applications come to the market  and this is a very widespread phenomena  magnetic data storage that 's not moore 's law it 's shrinking magnetic spots different engineers different companies same exponential process 
 a key revolution is that we 're understanding our own biology
 in these information terms we 're understanding the software programs that
 make our body run  these were evolved in very different
  like to actually change those programs one little software program called the fat insulin receptor gene basically says hold onto every calorie because the next hunting season may not
 work out so well that was in the interests of the species
 tens of thousands of years ago we 'd like to actually turn that program off they tried that in animals 
 and these mice ate ravenously and remained slim and got the health benefits of being slim they didn 't get diabetes  
 they didn 't get heart disease they lived twenty percent longer  they got the health benefits of caloric restriction without the restriction
 four or five pharmaceutical companies have noticed this felt that would be
 interesting drug for the human market  and that 's just one of the thirty thousand
 genes that that affect our biochemistry  we were evolved in an era where it wasn 't in the interests of people at the age of most people at this conference like
  to live
 much longer because we were using up the precious resources which were better deployed towards the children and those caring for them 
 so life long lifespans like that is to say much more than thirty
 weren 't selected for  but
 we are learning to actually manipulate and change these software programs through the biotechnology revolution 
 for example we can inhibit genes now with rna interference  there are exciting new forms of gene therapy that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material in the right place
  on the chromosome  there 's actually a for the first time now something going to human trials that actually cures pulmonary hypertension a fatal disease
 using gene therapy so we 'll have not just designer babies but designer baby boomers  and this technology is also accelerating 
 it cost ten dollars per base pair in one thousand nine hundred and ninety 
  a penny in two thousand it 's now under a 10th of a cent the amount of genetic data basically this shows that smooth exponential growth doubled every year
  enabling the genome project to be completed another major revolution the communications
 revolution the price performance bandwidth capacity of
 of communications measured many different ways wired wireless
 is is growing exponentially the internet has been doubling in power and continues to measured many different ways this is based on the number
  of hosts  miniaturization we 're shrinking the size of technology at an exponential rate 
 both wired and wireless these are some designs from eric drexler 's
 book which we 're now showing are feasible with super computing simulations where actually there are scientists building molecule scale robots one has one that actually walks
  that 's built out of
 molecules there are little machines doing things in experimental bases  the most exciting
 opportunity is actually to go inside the human body
 and perform therapeutic and diagnostic functions and this is less futuristic than it may sound  
 these things have already been done in animals there 's one nano engineered device that cures type one diabetes it 's blood cell sized they put
 tens of thousands of these in the blood cell they tried this in rats it lets insulin out in a controlled
  fashion and actually cures type one diabetes  what you 're watching is a
 design
 of a robotic red blood cell and it does bring up the issue that our biology is actually very sub optimal even though it 's remarkable in its intricacy 
 once we understand its principles of operation and the pace with which we are  reverse engineering biology is accelerating
  we can actually design these things to be
 thousands of times more capable an analysis of this respirocyte designed by rob freitas indicates if you replace ten percent of your red blood cells with these robotic versions  
 you could do an olympic sprint for fifteen minutes without taking a breath  you could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours
 so honey i 'm in the pool will take on a whole new meaning it will be interesting to see what we do in our olympic trials
  have the specter of teenagers in their high schools gyms routinely out performing the
 olympic athletes  freitas has a design for a robotic white blood cell these are 
 scenarios but they 're not as futuristic as it may sound there are four major conferences on building blood cell sized devices there are many experiments in animals there 's actually one going
  this is feasible technology
 if we come back to our exponential growth of computing one thousand dollars of computing is now somewhere between an insect and a mouse brain it will intersect
 human intelligence in terms of capacity in the 2020s 
 but that 'll be the hardware side of the equation where will we get the software well
 it turns out we can see inside the human brain and in fact not surprisingly the spatial and temporal resolution of brain scanning is doubling
 every year and with the new generation of scanning tools
  the first time we can actually see individual inter neural fibers and see them
 processing and signaling in real time
 but then the question is ok we can get this data now but can we understand it doug hofstadter wonders well maybe our intelligence just isn 't
 great enough to understand our intelligence and if we were smarter well then our brains would be that much more complicated
  and we 'd never catch up to it it turns out that
 we can understand it this is a block diagram of of a model and simulation of the human auditory cortex
 that actually works quite well in applying psychoacoustic tests gets very similar results to human auditory perception there 's another
 simulation of the cerebellum that 's more than half the neurons in the brain again works very similarly to human skill formation this is at an early stage but
 you can show with the
 exponential growth of the amount of information about the brain and the exponential improvement in in the resolution of brain scanning  
 we will succeed in  reverse engineering the human brain by the 2020s we 've already had very good models and simulation of about fifteen regions out of the several hundred 
 all of this is
  exponentially growing economic progress  we 've had productivity go from thirty dollars to one hundred and fifty dollars per hour
 of labor in the last fifty years e commerce has been growing exponentially it 's now a trillion dollars you might wonder well wasn 't there a boom and a bust  that was strictly a  capital markets phenomena  wall street noticed
 that this was a revolutionary technology which it was but then six months later when it hadn 't revolutionized all business models  they figured well that was wrong and then
 we had this bust
 technology that we put together using some of the technologies we 're involved in
 'll be so small they 'll be embedded in our clothing in our environment images will be written directly to our retina  
 providing full immersion virtual reality augmented real reality we 'll be interacting with virtual personalities 
 but if we go to two thousand and twenty nine we really have the full maturity
 of these trends and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations
  greater price performance capacity and bandwidth of these technologies which is pretty phenomenal it 'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today we 'll have completed the reverse engineering of the human brain 
 one thousand dollars of computing will be far more powerful than the human brain in terms of basic
 raw capacity  computers will combine the subtle
  powers of human intelligence
 with ways in which machines are already superior in terms of doing analytic thinking remembering billions of facts accurately machines can share their knowledge very quickly  
 but it 's not just an alien invasion of intelligent machines 
 we are going to merge with our technology  these nano bots i mentioned will first be used for
 medical and health applications  cleaning up the environment providing
 powerful fuel cells and widely distributed decentralized
 solar panels and so on in the environment  
 but they 'll also go inside our brain interact with our biological neurons we 've demonstrated the key principles of being able to do this 
 so for example full immersion virtual reality from within the nervous system the nano bots shut down the signals coming from your real senses replace them with the signals that your brain would be receiving if you were in the virtual environment and then it
 'll feel like you 're in that virtual environment you can go there with other people have any kind of experience
 with anyone
  involving all of the senses 
 experience beamers i call them will put their whole flow of sensory experiences in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the internet 
 you can plug in and experience what it 's like to be someone else  but most importantly  it 'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology 
 which in some sense we 're doing already we routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology
 human life expectancy is expanding it was thirty seven in one thousand eight hundred and with this sort of
 biotechnology nano technology revolutions this will move up very rapidly in the years ahead my main message is that
 progress in technology is exponential not linear many even
  if you really look at the power of exponential growth you 'll see that these things are pretty soon at hand and information technology is increasingly encompassing
 all of our lives from our music to our manufacturing to our biology
 to our energy to materials we 'll be able to manufacture almost anything we need in the
 2020s from information in very inexpensive raw materials using
 nano technology these are very powerful technologies they both empower our promise and our peril
  so we have to have the will to apply them to the right problems thank you very much
