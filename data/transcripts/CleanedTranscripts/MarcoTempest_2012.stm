  what i 'd like to show you today is something in the way of an experiment  today 's its debut it 's a demonstration of augmented reality 
 and the visuals you 're about to see are not
  they are live and reacting to me in real time i like to think of it as a kind of technological magic so
 fingers crossed and keep your eyes on the big screen 
 augmented reality
 is the melding of the real world with computer generated imagery  it seems the perfect medium to investigate
 magic
 and ask why
  a technological age  we continue to have
 this magical sense of wonder magic
 is deception but
 it is a deception we enjoy to enjoy being deceived an audience must first suspend its disbelief  it was the poet
  produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that for a moment  constitutes poetic faith mt this
 faith in the fictional
 is essential for any kind of theatrical experience  
  a script
 is just words augmented reality
 is just the latest technology  and sleight of hand
 is just an artful demonstration of dexterity 
 we are all very good at suspending our disbelief  we do it every day while reading novels  watching television
 or going to the movies  we willingly enter fictional worlds where we cheer our heroes and cry for friends we never
  had  without this ability there is no magic it was 
 france 's greatest illusionist who first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller  he said something that i 've posted on the wall of my studio
  trick
 is a story the tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction  there are tales of
 creation and loss  death and resurrection  and obstacles
 that must be overcome  now many of them are intensely dramatic magicians play with fire and steel  defy the fury of the
  dare to catch a bullet or attempt
 a deadly escape  but audiences don 't come to see the magician die  they come to see him live  because the best stories
 always have a happy ending the tricks of magic have one special element
 they are stories with a twist 
  now edward de bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines  he said that magicians deliberately exploit
 the way their audiences think edward de bono stage magic relies
 almost wholly on the momentum error 
 the audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable  but do not in fact match what is being done in front of them mt 
 in that respect magic tricks are like
 jokes
  us down a path to an expected destination
  but when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected  we laugh 
 the same thing happens when people watch magic tricks 
 the finale
 defies logic gives new insight into the problem and audiences express their amazement with
  laughter  it 's fun to be fooled 
 one of the key qualities of all stories is that they 're made to be shared  
 we feel compelled to tell them when i do a trick at a party 
 laughter that person will immediately pull their friend over and ask me to do it again  they want to share the
  makes my job more difficult because if i want to surprise them i need to tell a story that starts the same  but ends differently
 a trick with a twist
 on a twist 
 it keeps me busy  now experts believe that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained  
 we think in narrative structures  we connect events
 and emotions and instinctively transform them into a
  that can be easily understood  
 it 's a uniquely human achievement  we all want to share our stories whether it is the trick we saw at the party  
 the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation  
 today thanks to technology  
 we can share those stories as never
  the tools of social networking
 these are the
 digital campfires around which the audience gathers
 to hear our story 
 we turn facts into similes and metaphors and even fantasies  we polish the rough edges of our lives so that they feel whole 
 our stories make us the people we are
 and sometimes
  the people we want to be they give us our identity and
 a sense of community and if the story is a good one it might even
 make us smile
