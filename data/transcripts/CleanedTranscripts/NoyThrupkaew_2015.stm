  ten years ago i went through a little bit of a hard time 
 so i decided to go see a therapist i had been seeing her for a few months when she looked at me one day and said who actually raised you until you were three
  i don 't think that 's actually the case because if it were we 'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this it
 sounded like the setup to a joke  but i knew she was serious  
 because when i first started seeing her i was trying to be the funniest person in the room  and i would try and crack these jokes but she caught on to me really quickly  
 and whenever i tried to make a joke she would look at me and say
 that is actually really sad 
 so i knew i had to be serious  and i asked my parents who had actually raised me until i was three  and to my surprise they said
 my primary caregiver had been a distant relative of the family  i had called her my auntie  i remember my auntie so
  clearly it felt like she had been part of my life when i was much older  
 i remember the thick straight hair and how it would come around me like a curtain when she bent to pick me up 
 her soft southern thai accent  the way i would cling to her even if she just wanted to go to the bathroom or get something to eat 
 i loved her but [ with ] the ferocity that a child has sometimes before she understands that love
  also requires letting go  
 but my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie is also one of my first memories of life at all  
 i remember her being beaten and slapped by another member of my family  
 i remember screaming hysterically and wanting it to stop as i did every single time it happened for things as minor as wanting to go out with her
  friends or being a little late  
 i became so hysterical over her treatment that eventually she was just beaten behind closed doors 
 things got so bad for her that eventually she ran away  
 as an adult i learned later that she had been just nineteen when she was brought over from thailand to the states to care for me on a tourist visa
  she wound up working in illinois for a time before eventually returning to thailand which is where i ran into her again at a political rally in bangkok  
 i clung to her again as i had when i was a child  and i let go and then i promised that i would call  
 i never did  though  because i was afraid if i said everything that she meant to me
 that i owed perhaps the best parts of who i became to her care 
 and that the words i 'm sorry were like a thimble to bail out all the guilt and shame and rage i felt
 over everything she had endured to care for me for as long as she had
 i thought if i said those words to her i would never stop crying again
  had saved me and i had not saved her  
 i 'm a journalist and i 've been writing and researching human trafficking for the past eight years or so  
 and even so i never put together this personal story with my professional life until pretty
  i think this profound disconnect actually symbolizes most of our understanding about human trafficking  
 because human trafficking is far more prevalent complex and close to home than most of us realize  
 i spent time in jails and brothels  interviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement ngo workers  and when i think about what we 've done about human trafficking
  partly because we don 't even talk about the problem right at all 
 when i say human trafficking most of you probably don 't think about someone like my auntie 
 you probably think about a young girl or woman who 's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp  
 that is real suffering  and that is a real story that story makes me angry for far more than just the reality of that situation
 as a journalist i really care about how we relate to each other through language and the way we tell that story with all the gory violent detail the salacious aspects
 i call that look at her scars journalism 
 we use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl that story lets us off the hook
 it takes away all the societal context that we might be indicted for for the structural inequality or the poverty or the barriers to migration  
 we let ourselves think that human trafficking is only about forced prostitution  
 when in reality human trafficking is embedded in our everyday lives 
 let me show you what i mean forced prostitution accounts for
  human trafficking  
 ten percent is in state imposed forced labor 
 but a whopping sixty eight percent is for the purpose of creating the goods and delivering the services that most of us rely on every day 
 in sectors like agricultural work domestic work and construction  
 that is food and care and shelter 
 and somehow these most essential
  workers are also among the world 's most underpaid and exploited today  
 human trafficking is the use of force  fraud or coercion to compel another person 's labor 
 and it 's found in cotton fields  and coltan mines and even car washes in norway and england 
 it 's found in u s military bases in iraq and afghanistan it 's found in thailand 's fishing industry
  industry  that country has become the largest exporter of shrimp in the world  
 but what are the circumstances behind all that cheap and plentiful shrimp 
 thai military were caught selling burmese and cambodian migrants onto fishing boats 
 those fishing boats were taken out the men put to work and they were thrown overboard if they made the mistake of falling sick or
  trying to resist their treatment  
 those fish were then used to feed shrimp the shrimp were then sold to four major global retailers  
 costco  tesco walmart and carrefour 
 human trafficking is found on a smaller scale than just that and in places you would never even imagine 
 traffickers have forced young people to drive ice cream trucks
  to sing in touring boys ' choirs 
 trafficking has even been found in a hair braiding salon in new jersey  the scheme in that case was incredible  the traffickers found
 young families who were from ghana and togo  and they told these families that your daughters are going to get a fine education in the united
  they then located winners of the green card lottery  and they told them we 'll help you out we 'll get you a plane ticket we 'll pay your fees 
 all you have to do is take this young girl with you say that she 's your sister or your spouse  
 once everyone arrived in new jersey the young girls were taken away and put to work for 14 hour days  seven days a week for five years 
 they made their traffickers nearly four million dollars
 this is a huge problem so what have we done about it we 've mostly turned to the criminal justice system 
 but keep in mind most victims of human trafficking are poor and marginalized they 're migrants people of color sometimes they 're in the sex trade  
 and for populations like
  criminal justice system is too often part of the problem rather than the solution 
 in study after study in countries ranging from bangladesh to the united states  between twenty and sixty percent
 of the people in the sex trade who were surveyed said that they had been raped or assaulted by the police in the past year alone 
 people in prostitution including people who have been trafficked into it regularly receive multiple convictions for prostitution
  having that criminal record makes it so much more difficult to leave poverty  leave abuse or leave prostitution if that person so desires 
 workers outside of the sex sector if they try and resist their treatment  they risk deportation 
 in case after case i 've studied employers have no problem calling on law enforcement
 to try and threaten or deport their striking trafficked
  workers 
 if those workers run away  they risk becoming part of the great mass of undocumented workers who are also subject to the whims of law enforcement if they 're caught 
 law enforcement is supposed to identify victims and prosecute traffickers 
 but out of an estimated twenty one million victims of human trafficking in the
  world they have helped and identified fewer than fifty thousand people that 's like comparing
 the population of the world to the population of los angeles proportionally speaking 
 as for convictions 
 out of an estimated five thousand seven hundred convictions in two thousand and thirteen fewer than five hundred were for labor trafficking 
 keep in mind that labor
  trafficking accounts for sixty eight percent of all trafficking but fewer than ten percent of the convictions 
 i 've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets greed 
 i 'd like to add one more element to that 
 trafficking happens in sectors where workers are excluded from protections and denied the right to organize
  trafficking doesn 't happen in a vacuum it happens in systematically degraded work environments 
 you might be thinking oh she 's talking about failed states or war torn states or i 'm actually talking about the united states  
 let me tell you what that looks like 
 i spent many months researching a trafficking case called global
  involving hundreds of thai farm workers they were sent all over the states to work in hawaii pineapple plantations and washington apple orchards and anywhere the work was needed  
 they were promised three years of solid agricultural work 
 so they made a calculated risk  they sold their land  they sold their wives ' jewelry to make thousands in recruitment fees for this company global horizons  
  they were brought over 
 their passports were confiscated some of the men were beaten and held at gunpoint  they worked so hard they fainted in the fields  
 this case hit me so hard 
 after i came back home  i was wandering through the grocery store and i froze in the produce department  
 i was remembering the over the top meals the global horizons survivors would make for me every time i showed up to interview them 
  finished one meal with this plate of perfect long stemmed strawberries and as they handed them to me they said 
 aren 't these the kind of strawberries you eat with somebody special in the states  
 and don 't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you 
 as i stood in that grocery store weeks later  i realized i had no idea
  of who to thank for this plenty and no idea of how they were being treated 
 so like the journalist i am i started digging into the agricultural sector  
 and i found there are too many fields and too few labor inspectors 
 i found multiple layers of plausible deniability between grower and distributor and processor
  god knows who else 
 the global horizons survivors had been brought to the states on a temporary guest worker program 
 that guest worker program ties a person 's legal status to his or her employer and denies that worker the right to organize  
 mind you none of what i am describing about this agricultural sector or the guest worker program is actually
  is merely what we find legally tolerable  
 and i would argue this is fertile ground for exploitation 
 and all of this had been hidden to me before i had tried to understand it 
 i wasn 't the only person grappling with these issues  pierre omidyar  founder of ebay is one of the biggest anti trafficking philanthropists
  even he wound up accidentally investing nearly ten million dollars in the pineapple plantation cited as having the worst working conditions in that global horizons case 
 when he found out he and his wife were shocked and horrified  and they wound up writing an op ed for a newspaper saying that it was up to all of us to learn everything we can about the labor and supply chains of the products that we support
 totally agree 
 what would happen if each one of us decided that we are no longer going to support companies if they don 't eliminate exploitation from their labor and supply chains 
 if we demanded laws calling for the same  
 if all the ceos out there decided that they were going to go through their
  if we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers if we decided that guest workers should have the right to organize without fear of retaliation  
 these would be decisions heard around the world  
 this isn 't a matter of buying a fair trade peach and calling it a day  buying a guilt free zone with your money that 's not how it works
  this is the decision to change a system that is broken  and that we have unwittingly but willingly allowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long 
 we often dwell on human trafficking survivors ' victimization  
 but that is not my experience of them 
 over all the years that i 've been talking to them they have
  taught me that we are more than our worst days each one of us is more than what we have lived through 
 especially trafficking survivors 
 these people were the most resourceful and resilient and responsible in their communities  
 they were the people that you would take a gamble on you 'd say i 'm gong to sell my rings because i have the chance to send you off to a better future  
 they were the emissaries of hope 
  survivors don 't need saving  
 they need solidarity  because they 're behind some of the most exciting social justice movements out there today  
 the nannies and housekeepers who marched with their families and their employers ' families their activism got us an international treaty on domestic workers
  the nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade
 they came together and they decided that they were going to make the world 's first anti trafficking organization actually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves 
 these indian shipyard workers were trafficked to do post hurricane katrina reconstruction 
 they were threatened with deportation but they broke out of their work compound and they marched from new orleans to washington d c to protest labor
  exploitation  they cofounded an organization called the national guest worker alliance  and through this organization  they have wound up helping other workers
 bring to light exploitation and abuses in supply chains in walmart and hershey 's factories  and although the department of justice declined to take their case 
 a team of civil rights lawyers won the first of a dozen civil suits this
  february and got their clients fourteen million dollars 
 these survivors are fighting for people they don 't even know yet  
 other workers  and for the possibility of a just world for all of us 
 this is our chance to do the same  
 this is our chance to make the decision that tells us who we are as a people and as a society  that our prosperity
  is no longer prosperity as long as it is pinned to other people 's pain  
 that our lives are inextricably woven together  
 and that we have the power to make a different choice  
 i was so reluctant
 to share my story of my auntie with you  before i started this ted process and climbed up on this stage
  told literally a handful of people about it 
 because like many a journalist i am far more interested in learning about your stories than sharing much if anything about my own  
 i also haven 't done my journalistic due diligence on this i haven 't issued my mountains of document requests and interviewed everyone and their mother  
 and i haven 't found my auntie yet  i don 't know her story of what happened
  and of her life now 
 the story as i 've told it to you is messy and unfinished  
 but i think it mirrors the messy and unfinished situation we 're all in when it comes to human trafficking  
 we are all implicated in this problem 
 but that means we are all also part of its solution  
 figuring out
  to build a more just world is our work to do and our story to tell 
 so let us tell it the way we should have done from the very beginning let us tell this story together  thank you so much
