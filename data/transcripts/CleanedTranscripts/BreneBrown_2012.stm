  a little bit about my tedxhouston talk i woke up the morning after i gave that talk
 with the worst vulnerability hangover of my
  and i actually didn 't leave my house for about three days
  the first time i left was to meet a friend for lunch  and when i walked in she was already at the table i sat down and she said god you look like hell
  researcher to avoid vulnerability and that when being vulnerable emerged from my data 
 as absolutely essential to whole hearted living 
 i told these five hundred people that i had a breakdown  i had a slide that said ' breakdown ' at what point did i think that was a good idea
  it was
 not really you it was a little different than what you usually do but it was great 
 and i said this can 't happen youtube they 're putting this thing on youtube  and we 're going to be talking about six hundred seven hundred people
  remember when we were in college really wild and kind of dumb she said yeah i said remember when we 'd leave a really bad message on our ex boyfriend 's answering machine 
 then we 'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape
  what are you doing why did you bring this up have you lost your mind your sisters would be perfect for this 
 so i looked back up and she said are you really going to try to break
  in
 and steal the video before they put it on youtube 
 and i said i 'm just thinking about it a little bit 
 she said  you 're like the worst vulnerability role model ever laughter
 then i looked at her and i said something that at the time felt a little dramatic but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic
  if five hundred turns into one thousand or two thousand my life is over 
 i had no contingency plan for four million 
 and my life did end when that happened
  and maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that i
 learned something hard about myself and that was that 
 as much as i would be frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small 
 staying right under the radar  
 but i want to talk about what i 've learned there 's two things that i 've learned in the last year
  the first is  
 vulnerability is not weakness  and that myth
 is profoundly dangerous 
 let me ask you honestly and i 'll give you this this warning  i 'm trained as a therapist so i can out wait you uncomfortably
 so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome
 how many of you honestly when you 're thinking about doing or saying something vulnerable think 
 god vulnerability is weakness how many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously 
 the majority of people now let me ask you this question this past week at ted 
 how many of you when you saw vulnerability up here thought it was pure courage
  vulnerability is not weakness  i define vulnerability as
 emotional risk  exposure  uncertainty  
 it fuels our daily lives and i 've come to the belief this is my 12th year doing this research
 that vulnerability is our most accurate
 measurement of courage
  to be vulnerable to let ourselves be seen to be honest 
 one of the weird things that 's happened is  after the ted explosion i got a lot of offers to speak all over the country
 everyone from schools and parent meetings to fortune five hundred companies  and so many of the calls
  we loved your ted talk we 'd like you to come in and speak we 'd appreciate it if you wouldn 't mention vulnerability or shame 
 what would you like for me to talk about 
 there 's three big answers this is mostly to be honest with you from the business sector innovation  creativity
 and change
  so let me go on the record
 and say vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation  creativity
 and change 
 to create is to make something that has never existed before 
 there 's nothing more vulnerable than that adaptability to change
 is all about vulnerability  the second thing in addition to really finally understanding
 the relationship between vulnerability and courage the second thing i learned is this  
 we have to talk about shame 
 and i 'm going to be really honest with you
  and that became the focus because of the ted talk and i 'm not kidding i 'll give you an example about
 three months ago i was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that
 parents buy at the sporting goods store about from a hundred feet away this is what i hear vulnerability ted vulnerability ted
  our family motto is lock and load i am not a natural vulnerability researcher  
 so i 'm like just
 keep walking she 's on my six
 i 'm so worn out at this point in my life i look at her and i actually say it was a fricking spiritual awakening 
 and she looks back and does this i know and she said 
 we watched your ted talk in my book club then we read your book and we renamed ourselves ' the breakdown babes
  you can only imagine what it 's like for me in a faculty meeting 
 so when i became vulnerability ted like an action figure
 like ninja barbie but i 'm vulnerability ted
 i thought i 'm going to leave that shame stuff behind because
  i spent six years studying shame before i started writing and talking about vulnerability 
 and i thought  thank god because shame is this horrible topic no one wants to talk about it it 's the best way to shut people down on an airplane what do you do
  surviving this last year  
 i was reminded of a cardinal rule not a research rule but a moral imperative from my upbringing 
 you 've got to dance with the one who brung ya 
 and i did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability i
  learned about these things from studying shame  
 and so i want to walk you in to shame jungian analysts call shame
 the swampland of the soul 
 and we 're going to walk in and the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there it
  it is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around 
 here 's why  
 we heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country  
 and i think globally around race right  
 yes  we heard that yes  cannot have that conversation without shame  because you cannot talk about
  race without talking about privilege  and when people start talking about privilege  they get paralyzed by shame  we heard a brilliant simple solution
 to not killing people in surgery which is have a checklist 
 you can 't fix that problem without addressing shame  because when they teach those folks how to suture they also teach them
  folks don 't need checklists 
 and i had to write down the name of this ted fellow so i didn 't mess it up here  myshkin ingawale i
 hope i did right by you 
 i saw the ted fellows my first day here and he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia because people were dying
  unnecessarily  
 and he said i saw this need so you know what i did i made it 
 and everybody just burst into applause and they were like yes and he said and it didn 't work 
 and then i made it thirty two more times  and then it worked you know what the big secret about ted is i can 't wait to tell people
  you know why this place is amazing  because very few people here are afraid to fail 
 and no one who gets on the stage so far that i 've seen has not failed i 've failed miserably 
  i don 't think the world understands that because of shame  
 there 's a great quote that saved me this past year by theodore roosevelt a lot of people refer to it as the man in the arena quote 
 and it goes like this it is not the critic who counts 
 it is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles the credit goes to the man in the arena
 whose face is marred with dust
  and blood
 and sweat  but when he 's in the arena at best 
 he wins and
 at worst he loses  but when he fails when he loses  he does so daring greatly 
 and that 's what this conference to me is about life is about about daring greatly about being in the arena when you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on
  the door and you think i 'm going in and i 'm going to try this shame is the gremlin who says uh uh 
 you 're not good enough  
 you never finished that mba your wife left you  i know your dad really wasn 't in luxembourg he was in sing sing  
 i know those things that happened to you growing up  i know you don 't think that you 're pretty smart talented or powerful enough
 i know your dad never paid attention even when you made cfo 
 shame is that thing  and if we can quiet it down and walk in
 and say i 'm going to do this 
 we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing ninety nine percent of the time is
  shame drives two big tapes never good enough and if you can talk it out of that one who do you think you are 
 the thing to understand about shame is it 's not guilt  
 shame is a focus on self guilt is a focus on behavior  shame is i am bad guilt is i did something bad 
  you did something that was hurtful to me would be willing to say i 'm sorry i made a mistake how many of you would be willing to say that 
 guilt  i 'm sorry i made a mistake shame  i 'm sorry  i am a mistake  
 there 's a huge difference between shame and guilt  and here 's what you need to know shame is highly highly correlated with addiction depression violence 
  and here 's what you even need to know more guilt  inversely correlated with those things 
 the ability to hold something we 've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive it 's uncomfortable  but it 's adaptive  
 the other thing you need to know about shame is it 's absolutely organized by gender
  if shame washes over me and washes over chris it 's going to feel the same 
 everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame  
 we 're pretty sure that the only people who don 't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy  
 which means yes i have a little shame no i 'm a sociopath so i would opt for yes you have a little shame
  feels the same for men and women  but it 's organized by gender for women 
 the best example i can give you is enjoli the commercial 
 i can put the wash on the line pack the lunches hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine 
 i can bring home the bacon fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you 're a man 
 for women shame is
  do it all do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat  
 i don 't know how much perfume that commercial sold  but i guarantee you it moved a lot of antidepressants and 
 shame  for women is this web of unobtainable
  competing expectations about who we 're supposed to be 
 and it 's a straight jacket 
 for men  shame is not a bunch of competing conflicting expectations shame is one do not be perceived as what 
 weak  
 i did not interview men for the first four years of my study  it wasn 't until a man looked at me after a book signing and said i love what say about shame  
 i 'm curious why you didn 't mention men
  and i said i don 't study men and he said that 's convenient 
 and i said why and he said because
 you say to reach out tell our story be vulnerable  but you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters
  on top of my white horse than watch me fall down 
 when we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us 
 and don 't tell me it 's from the guys and the coaches and the dads  
 because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else 
 so i started interviewing men and asking questions  and what i learned is
  this  
 you show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear i 'll show you a woman who 's done incredible work  
 you show me a man who can sit with a woman
 who 's just had it she can 't do it all anymore and his first response is not i unloaded the
  but he really listens
 because that 's all we need i 'll show you a guy who 's done a lot of work shame is an epidemic in our culture 
 and to get out from underneath it
 to find our way back to each other  we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we 're parenting the way we 're working the way we 're looking at each other
  quickly some research by mahalik at boston college  he asked  what do women need to do to conform to female norms the top answers in this country 
 nice thin modest and use all available resources for appearance when he asked about men what do men in this country need to do
 to conform with male norms  the answers were always show emotional control
 work is first pursue status and violence  if we 're going to find our way back to each other we have to understand
 and know empathy  because empathy 's the antidote to shame  
 if you put shame in a petri dish it needs three things to grow exponentially  secrecy silence and judgment 
 if you put the same amount in a petri dish and douse it with empathy it can 't survive the two most
  powerful words when we 're in struggle me too 
 and so i 'll leave you with this thought  if we 're going to find our way back to each other 
 vulnerability is going to be that path  
 and i know it 's seductive to stand outside the arena because i think i did it my whole
  and think to myself  i 'm going to go in there and kick some ass when i 'm bulletproof and when i 'm perfect  
 and that is seductive but the truth is that never happens 
 and even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster
 when you got in there that 's not what we want to see 
 we want you to go in we want to be with you and across from you
  and we just want for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with to dare greatly  so thank you all very much i really appreciate
