  when we park in a big
 parking lot how do we remember where we parked our car here 's the problem facing homer  
 and we 're going to try to understand what 's happening in his brain  so we 'll start with the hippocampus shown
  which is the organ of memory if you have damage there like in alzheimer 's you can 't remember things including where you parked your car it 's named after latin for seahorse which it resembles and like the rest of the brain  
 it 's made of neurons so the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it 
 and the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other the hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells which are very densely interconnected  and scientists have begun to
  understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in
 rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food  
 so we 're going to imagine we 're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of of this rat here  and when it fires a little spike of electricity there 's going to be a red dot and a
  so what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment 
 and it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike  
 so we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal 's location  
 and if we record from lots of different neurons we 'll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment like in this square box shown here  
 so together they form a map for the rest of the brain
 telling the brain continually where am i now within my environment 
 place cells are also being recorded in humans so epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring  
 and some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town  and place cells in their hippocampi would fire  become active start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town
 so how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment  well these two cells here
 show us that the the boundaries of the environment are particularly important  
 so the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of of the box that their rat 's in and when you expand the box the firing location
  the one below likes to fire whenever there 's a wall close by to the south  and if you put another wall inside the box then the cell fires in both place wherever there 's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box
  so this predicts that
 sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you extended buildings and so on is particularly important for the hippocampus  and indeed on the inputs to the hippocampus cells are found which project into the hippocampus  which do respond
 exactly to detecting boundaries or edges
 at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it 's exploring around so the cell on the left you can see it fires whenever the animal gets near to
  a wall or a boundary to the east whether it 's the edge or the the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table which the animals are running around
  and the cell on the right there fires whenever there 's a boundary to the south whether it 's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart so that 's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it 's exploring around we can also test
 where we think objects are like this goal flag in simple environments or
  your car would be  so we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember  
 and then if we put them back in the environment generally they 're quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was  
 but on some trials we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell 
 in that case we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment 
 and what you see
  example if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment 
 and then if you ask people where it was but you 've made the environment bigger where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out it 's as 
  if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across across all of your place cells at that location and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match
  match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern that guides you back to the location that you want to remember  
 but we also know where we are through movement  
 so if we take some outbound path perhaps we park and we wander off we know because our own movements which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back and place cells also get this kind of path integration input
 from a kind of cell
  called a grid cell 
 now grid cells are found again on the inputs to the hippocampus  and they 're a bit like place cells  but now as the rat explores around 
 each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations
 which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid 
 and if you record from several grid cells shown here
  in different colors each one has a grid like firing pattern across the environment and each cell 's grid like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells  
 so the red one fires on this grid
 and the green one on this one
 and the blue on on this one so together it 's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you 'd find on a map
 but using triangles  
 and as it moves around the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is so that it can use its own movements to know
 where it is in its environment 
 do people have grid cells  
 well because all of the grid like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry the same orientations of grid shown in orange here  it means that the net activity
  of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we 're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between  so we can put people 
 in an mri scanner and have them do a little video game like the one i showed you and look for this signal  
  which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats so back to homer
  he 's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked  and that would be represented by the firing of boundary detecting cells he
 's also remembering the path he took out of the car park 
 which would be represented in the firing of grid cells now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire  and he can return to the location where he parked
  by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern
 where he parked his car  and that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car 's actually there  maybe it 's been towed  
 but he knows where it was so he knows to go and get it 
 so beyond spatial memory  if we look for this grid like firing pattern
 throughout the whole brain we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks like remembering the last time 
  you went to a wedding for example  so it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery
  to us when we want to imagine them  so if this was happening your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary 
  cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint and grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space another kind of cell head direction cells which i didn 't mention yet they fire like a compass according to which way you 're facing they could define the viewing
  direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding for example  so this is just one example
 of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we 're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even 
  think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains  thank you very much
