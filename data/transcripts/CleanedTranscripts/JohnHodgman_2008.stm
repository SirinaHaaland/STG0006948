  went to lunch at los alamos national laboratory and joined some colleagues there and asked them a question
  colleagues obviously  because they were sitting right there with him 
 and then he had to clarify that he wasn 't talking about them he was talking about the space aliens you see this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at roswell new mexico  
 and even though that turned out to be nothing nothing at all
  merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men
 with slits for mouths 
 still america had gone saucer mad even famous scientists who were eating lunch fermi 's reasoning if i may paraphrase badly is that the universe is so 
 vast that it stands to reason there should be other intelligent life out there and the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve
  we should have some evidence of their existence by now  and yet to the best of our knowledge we are alone where is everybody asked fermi and his colleagues had no answer 
 fermi then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies  sasquatch
  god  the possibility of love and thereafter as you know enrico fermi ate alone
 now  
 i am not a scientist 
 i have never built an atomic pile  although i might argue that technically every pile is atomic 
 laughter however with respect i might point out two possibilities that enrico fermi perhaps did not consider one is that the aliens might
  be very far away  perhaps  i dare say even on other planets
  the other possibility is perhaps enrico fermi himself
 was an alien 
 think about it isn 't
  a little convenient that in the midst of the world war out of nowhere suddenly an italian scientist showed up
 with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after 
 and isn 't it a little strange that he required no payment for this
 that he asked for only one thing a gift of two healthy sperm whales 
 that 's that 's not true  but it is strange
 and if enrico fermi were indeed a space alien wouldn 't he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here 
 for it is given in certain ufo ology or ufology circles that the aliens are
  already here and have been for millennia that they have walked among us in disguise observing us guiding our evolution from ape to man
 if you believe in that sort of thing
 and occasionally kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids 
 it 's a difficult theory to discount  i think you 'll agree 
 for even in my own life there are memories i have that are difficult to
  explain
 happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird  that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life 
 for how else will you explain
 the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that i had and will describe to you now encounter one ocean
  this was the summer when the special edition of close encounters of the third kind was released and i went on vacation with my parents to the jersey shore within twelve hours  i was horribly sunburned 
 just like richard dreyfuss in the movie 
 and so i spent the rest of the vacation
 largely sitting outside our little rental house at night the sidewalk still warm from the sun watching the skies for ufos what did i see stars satellites
 occasionally kids would come and join me and watch but their necks soon got sore and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans  
 i was pretty good at the video games  i was not very good at the other part so i stayed
 alone with the cosmos  and that 's when it happened an elderly couple came
 walking down the street i would say they were in their late seventies and i would say that they were on a date  because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie a brown suit and she was 
  wearing a cardigan because it was now fully night and a chill was coming in off the ocean  
  to admit that 's a pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date  
 but what was stranger still and even i realized it at the time  as a nine year old child was that they stopped at all that this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child
  and then his girlfriend joined in too 
 there 's no such thing as space men she said there 's no such thing and then they both laughed ha ha ha 
 i looked around 
 the street was entirely empty  
 i had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean 
 it was as though time had stopped  i did not know why they were teasing me  i looked into their strangely angry faces
  faces and i remember wondering are they wearing rubber masks 
 and what would be behind those rubber masks if they were 
 giant  almond shaped unblinking eyes  slits for mouths  
 the old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun  and then he made laser sounds 
  and they turned at once and walked away  the old man reached out his knobbly claw
 for the for the woman 's hand  and found it and left me alone now you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding a strange encounter among humans  
 maybe it was swamp gas  but 
 i know what i saw 
  i went to see the movie dune and a girl talked to me now on its face 
 this is impossible on its face i realize but it is absolutely true it was opening night  naturally  i went with my friend tim mcgonigal who sat on my left on my right was the girl in question she had long curly black hair a
 blue jean jacket i remember she had some sort of injury to her ankle an ace bandage and she had crutches  she was very tall i would say i was starting high school at the time i would say 
  she was a junior  but i had never seen her before she didn 't go to my school i didn 't know her name  and i never will 
  then it got stranger that 's when she turned to me and said are you looking forward to seeing the movie 
 first of all i was embarrassed because i had not read the novel dune at that time  i was merely a connoisseur of movies featuring desert planets as i still am 
 but it was also the tone of how she asked the question apropos of nothing like she didn 't even care about the answer as though
  she just wanted to talk to me  i did not know what to say i said yes i did not even turn my head 
 the movie began  i need not remind you that this was david lynch 's version of dune 
 in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time 
  there was a character called the third stage guild navigator 
 which was a kind of giant floating fetus creature that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist of
 psychedelic spice swirling around him allowing him to bend space and time he could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world he had become in his isolation 
 so deformed and so sexy that he had to talk through a kind of old timey radio to the outside world and could never touch them
  i mean i liked him a lot better than the sandworms the sandworms were fine but your favorite character please 
 when the movie ended  
 everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible
  except for the girl as i walked out her pace slowed  perhaps it was
  it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again  when i say it out loud it sounds so ridiculous 
 but i can only come to the conclusion that it was what in the alien abductee community they call a screen memory a ridiculous false recollection designed 
  by their brain to cover up some trauma say of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid
  sure am glad i did not slow down to talk to her i sure am glad i never saw her again
 close encounter three  philadelphia  pennsylvania 
 the novelist whitley strieber wrote a book called communion 
 in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens  and he also described the phenomenon known in this community as
  lost time 
 where whitley strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes or the previous ten hours or the previous ten days  
 and would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him
 and giving him rectal probes 
 this book became  naturally an enormous best seller this image by ted joseph was from that book and was his sort of police sketch of what the
  creatures looked like that whitley strieber had described to him 
 and it was so successful that they made it into a movie 
 and in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine the way i remember it i was in philadelphia visiting my girlfriend and we decided apropos of nothing to go see this movie  
 and the way i remember it the movie featured these details one  
 whitley strieber was played by christopher walken 
 two the alien was played by a
  rubber puppet 
 laughter three there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives christopher walken a rectal probe 
 this was being shown in a regular movie theater in center city philadelphia  five all of which is to say they made a movie out of the book communion and it starred christopher walken does something seem strange about this to you
 something odd  something off something wrong with this picture  think about it yes  the answer is i had a girlfriend what 
 how did this happen
  when did this happen  
 i remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact as we walked hand in hand and pondering these very same questions and to this day i have no answer
 close encounter four  the algarve portugal one thousand nine hundred and ninety one some years later 
 i and this woman we 'll call her catherine fletcher 
 went traveling through the south of portugal together  
 we stayed in old  crumbling walled cities in tiny little hotels and we would climb up to the roof and drink vinho
 and watch the sun set and play checkers what did we do this really  does anyone do this 
 we went to some topless beaches excuse me no 
 not in my life 
 for what it 's worth we went to sagres which was considered at the time to be the end of the world and there i was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock  
 and the lead dog bit me on the ass  requiring me to go to a strange portuguese clinic and receive
 an ass shot make of that what you will 
 our last day in portugal we were in the district capital of faro 
 and catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time  
 now faro is a bustling little city and to get to the beach she explained you would have to take
 a bus and then a boat and did i want to come
  i remember what she looked like
 before she left  the freckles had grown
 and multiplied on her face and shoulders  clustering into a kind of a tan a tan we were both tan is this true 
 her eyes were extra bright and extra blue as a result she was smiling  
 she was a single woman about to go alone into a country not even speaking the language
 to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen i loved her and then she went out
 into that strange alien land 
 it took me some time to come to my senses  i had my own lost time moment where i woke up and suddenly realized
 it was very late in the
  and she had not come back  nervous i went down to the street to look for her now i did not speak portuguese
 i did not know where the beach was 
 i could not call her on a cell phone because this was one thousand nine hundred and ninety one and the aliens had not given us that technology yet 
 i realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes either catherine would come back to the hotel or she would never come back to the hotel 
 and so i sat down to wait i did not watch the
  skies but the very end of the street
 where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along and i watched those constellations shift  hoping that they would part and i would see her face 
 it was at that moment  in that very small town of thirty thousand or so 
 that i truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it 
 and that 's when the
  liberians came along  five young men all laughing happy traveling together coming back to this hotel where they were staying one of them was named joseph and he asked me
 what was i doing and i explained  
 and he said don 't worry he was sure that catherine would be safe  but he did not seem so very sure for he sat down to wait with me 
 and for the next two hours  they all waited with me taking turns going up to their room coming back telling me jokes distracting me
  hours  they gave me a message we are not alone  and then in the middle of a sentence at the very birth of twilight i turned
 and looked down the street 
 the stars aligned  and she came back  
 she was smiling  she did not understand why i was so worried neither did the liberians although
 there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back  and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street holding hands
  an event like this leaves a scar on the memory  much like a piece of alien technology that has been inserted into your buttocks by a portuguese doctor 
 and even now a decade and a half later  even now that we are married  i look for her still whenever she is not in the room 
 and even though i think you 'll agree it is probable
 that during the time she was away she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone i love her and wait for her still thank you for your kind attention
