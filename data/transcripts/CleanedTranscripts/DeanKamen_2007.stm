  almost exactly a year ago a little over a year ago from a very senior person at the department of defense  came to see me and said one thousand 
 six hundred of the kids that we 've sent out have come back missing at least one full arm
  arm  shoulder disarticulation 
 and we 're doing the same thing we did for more or less  
 that we 've done since the civil war a stick and a hook  and they deserve more than that 
 and literally this guy sat in my office in new hampshire and said i want you to give me something that we can put on these kids
 that 'll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table
  they 'll be able to put it in their mouth
 without destroying either one and they 'll be able to know the difference without looking at it you know had efferent afferent and haptic response 
 he finishes explaining that and i 'm waiting for the big
 three hundred pound paper proposal and he said that 's what i want from
  's just not available right now  and it can 't be done 
 not in an envelope of a human arm with twenty one degrees of freedom  from your shoulder to your fingertips 
 he said about two dozen of these one thousand six hundred kids have come back bilateral you think
 's bad to lose one arm that 's an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone 
 i got a day job  
 and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like 
 let 's supply water to the world and power to the world and educate all the kids which chris i will not talk about 
 i don 't need another mission  
 i keep thinking about these kids with no arms
  says to me we 've done some work around the country we 've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people 
 i said i 'll take a field trip i 'll go see what you got 
 over the next month i visited lots of places some out here around the country found the best of the best i went down to washington  
 i saw these guys and said i did what you asked me i looked at what 's out there i still think you 're nuts  
  nuts as i thought 
 i put a team together a little over thirteen months ago got up to twenty some odd people  we said we 're going to build a device
 that does what he wants we have fourteen out of the twenty one degrees of freedom you don 't need the ones in the last two fingers 
 we put this thing together a couple of weeks ago we took it down to walter reed which is unfortunately more in the news these days we showed it to a
  bunch of guys  one guy who described himself as being lucky because
 he lost his left arm  and he 's a righty he
 sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys said he was lucky  because he had his good arm  and then he pushed himself back from the table he had no legs 
 these kids have attitudes that you just can 't believe  
 so i 'm going to show you now without the skin on it
 'm done 
 but understand what you 're looking at we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female  
 so that we could put it in any of these people 
 it 's going to go inside something that we use in cat scans and mris of whatever is their good arm to make silicon
  exact mirror image of their other limb  
 so you won 't see all the really cool stuff that 's in this series elastic set of fourteen actuators each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure 
 it also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on so the more they put themselves under load 
 the more it attaches they take the load off and it becomes again compliant 
 i 'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in washington can we look at this thing
