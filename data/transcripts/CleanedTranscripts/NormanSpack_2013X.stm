  i want you all to think about the third word that was ever said about you
 or if you
  it shows you that i also deal with issues where there 's not certainty of whether it 's
  the mixed answer was very  very appropriate of course now the answer often comes not at birth but at the ultrasound  unless the
 prospective parents choose to be surprised like we all were  but i want you to think about what it is
 that leads to that statement
 on the third word because the third word
 is a description
 of your sex  
 and by that i mean made by a description of your genitals 
 now as a pediatric endocrinologist 
 i used to be very very involved and still somewhat am in cases in which
 there are mismatches
  in the externals or between the  externals and the internals  
 and we literally have to figure out
 what is the description of your sex  
 but there is nothing that is definable at the time of birth
 that would define you
  and when i talk about definition i 'm talking about
 your sexual orientation we don 't say it 's a gay boy 
 a lesbian girl 
 those situations don 't really define themselves more until the second decade of life  
 nor do they
  define your gender which as different from your anatomic sex  describes
 do you see yourself as a male or female or somewhere in the spectrum in between
  shows up
 in the first decade of life  
 but it can be very confusing for parents because it is quite normative
 for children
 to act in a  cross gender play and way  and in fact there are studies that show that even eighty percent
 of children who act in that fashion
 will not persist
 in wanting to be the opposite gender
 at the time when puberty begins but at the time that puberty begins
 that means between about age ten to twelve in girls twelve to fourteen in boys
 with breast
  budding or
 two to three times  ' increase in the gonads in the case of genetic males 
 by that particular point the child who says they are in the absolute wrong body
 is almost certain to be transgender and is
  those feelings no matter how anybody tries reparative therapy or any other noxious things 
 now this is relatively rare  
 so i had relatively little personal experience with this  and my experience was more typical only because i had an adolescent
  genetically female went through harvard with three male roommates who knew the whole story a registrar who always listed
 his name on course lists as a male name  and came to me after graduating 
 saying help me  
 i know you know a lot of endocrinology and indeed i 've treated a lot of people who were born without gonads this wasn 't rocket science but i made a deal with him i 'll treat you if you teach me
 and so he did 
 and what an education i got from taking care of all the members of his support group  
 and then i got really confused 
 because i thought it was relatively easy at that age to just give people the hormones of the of the gender in which they were affirming 
 but then my patient married
  he married a woman
 who had been born as a male had married as a male had two children then went through a transition
 into female  and now this delightful female
 was attached to my male patient in fact  got legally married because they showed
  up as a man and a woman and who knew
  right  sexual orientation is who you go to bed with gender identity is who you go to bed as 
 and i subsequently learned from the many adults i took care of about two hundred adults
 i learned from them
 that if i didn 't peek as to who their partner was in the waiting room  i would never be able to guess better than chance
 whether they were gay straight bi or asexual in their affirmed gender 
 in other words one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other 
 and the data show it 
 now 
 as i took care of the two hundred adults i found it
  had to give up
 so much of their lives sometimes their parents would reject them 
 siblings their own children  and then their divorcing spouse would
 forbid them from seeing their children 
 it was so awful but why did they do it at forty and fifty because they felt they had to affirm themselves
  before they would kill themselves  and indeed the rate of suicide among untreated transgendered people is among the highest
 in the world 
 so what to do 
 i was intrigued  in going to a conference in holland where they are experts in this 
 and saw the most remarkable thing 
 they were treating
  young adolescents after giving them the most intense psychometric testing
 of gender  and they were treating them by blocking the puberty that they didn 't want 
 because basically kids look about the same each sex  until they go through puberty 
 at which point if you feel you 're in the wrong sex you feel like pinocchio becoming a donkey 
 the fantasy that you had
  that your body will change to be who you want it to be with puberty actually is nullified by the puberty you get
 and they fall apart  so that 's why putting the puberty on hold
 why on hold you can 't just give them the opposite hormones that young  they 'll end up stunted in
  and you think you can have a meaningful conversation about the fertility effects of such treatment with a 10 year old girl
 a 12 year old boy  so this buys time in the diagnostic process for four or five years so that they can work it out  
 they can
 have more and more testing they can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them and then in a program they
  around age twelve is when they give the blocking hormones  and then at age sixteen with retesting 
 to receive now remember the blocking hormones are reversible 
 but when you give the hormones of the opposite sex you now start spouting breasts and facial hair and voice change depending on what you 're using and those effects are permanent 
 or require surgery to remove or electrolysis  and you can never really affect the voice
  so this is serious and this is 
  stuff  
 and then at eighteen they 're eligible for surgery 
 and while there 's no good surgery for females to males genitally the male to female surgery has fooled gynecologists 
 that 's how good it can be  so
 i looked at how the patients were doing  and i looked at patients
  who just looked like everybody else   except they were pubertally delayed 
 but once they gave them the hormones consistent with the gender they affirm  they look beautiful  
 they look normal they had normal heights you would never be able to pick them out in a crowd  
  i decided i 'm going to do this this is really where the pediatric endocrine realm comes in 
 because in fact if you 're going to deal with it in kids aged ten to fourteen that 's pediatric endocrinology  
 so
 i
 brought some kids in 
 and this now became the standard of care and the [ boston ] children 's hospital was behind it by my showing them the kids
 before and after people who never got treated and people
  who wished to be treated and pictures of the dutch
 they came to me and said you 've got to do something for these kids well  where were these kids before 
 they were out there suffering is where they were  so
 we started a program in two thousand and seven it became the first program of its kind but it 's really of the dutch kind
 in north america and since then we have one hundred and sixty patients did they come from afghanistan
  percent of them came from within one hundred and fifty miles of boston  and
 some came from england  jackie had been abused in the midlands
 england  she 's twelve years old there she was living as a girl but she was being beaten up it was a horror show they had to homeschool her  
 and the reason the british were coming was because they would not treat anybody with anything under age sixteen  which means they were consigning them to an adult body
 no matter what happened even if they tested them well
  jackie on top of it was by virtue of skeletal markings  destined to be six feet five
  and yet she had just begun a male puberty well i did something a little bit
 innovative because i do know hormones  and that estrogen is much more
  the growth plates and stopping growth than testosterone is so we blocked her testosterone with a blocking hormone
  but we added estrogen not at sixteen but at thirteen 
 and so here she is at sixteen  on the left and
 on her 16th birthday she went to thailand where they would do a genital plastic surgery they will do it at eighteen now  and she ended up five ' eleven
  than that she has normal breast size because by blocking testosterone every one of our patients has normal breast size if they get to us at the appropriate age
 not too late  
 and on the far right there she is she went public
 semifinalist in the miss england competition
  and one of them quipped i 'm told but she has more natural self than half the other contestants 
 and
 some of them have been rearranged a little bit but it 's all her dna  and she 's become a remarkable spokeswoman
  and she was offered contracts as a model at which point she teased me when she said you know i might have had a better chance as a model if you 'd made me six feet one 
 go figure  so
 this picture i think says it all it really says it all these are nicole and brother jonas identical
  and proven to be identical
 nicole had affirmed herself as a girl as early as age three at age seven they changed her name  
 and came to me at the very beginnings of a male puberty 
 now you can imagine looking at jonas at only fourteen that male puberty is early in this family  
 because he looks more like a  16 year old 
 but it makes the point all the more of why you have to be conscious of where the patient is
 nicole is on pubertal blockade in here  
 and jonas is just going biologic control  this is what nicole would look like if we weren 't doing what we were doing 
 he 's got a prominent adam 's apple he 's got angular bones to the face a
 mustache  and you can see there 's a height difference because he 's gone through a growth spurt that she won 't get now nicole is on estrogen she
  has a bit of a form to her 
 this family went to the white house last spring  because of their work in overturning an
 there was a bill that would block the right of transgender people in maine to use public bathrooms  and
  it looked like the bill was going to pass and that would have been a problem  but nicole went personally to every legislator in maine
 and said i can do this 
 if they see me they 'll understand why i 'm no threat in the ladies ' room  but i can be threatened in the men 's room and then they finally got it 
 so where do we go from here  well  we still have a ways to go in terms
  there are only seventeen states that have an 
  law against discrimination in housing employment public accommodation
 only seventeen states and five of them are in new england 
 we need less expensive drugs they cost a fortune  and we need to get this condition out of the dsm 
 it is as much a psychiatric disease as being gay and lesbian 
 and that went out the window in
 and this isn 't going to break anybody 's budget this is not that common but the risks of not doing anything for them
 not only puts all of them
 at risk of losing their lives to suicide  but it also
 says something about whether we are a truly inclusive society  thank you
