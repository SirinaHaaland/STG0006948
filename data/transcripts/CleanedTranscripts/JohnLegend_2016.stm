  at free america we 've done a listening and learning tour  we visited
 not only with prosecutors but with legislators with inmates in our
 state and local prisons  we 've gone to immigration detention centers
  we 've met a lot of people and
 we 've seen that redemption
 and transformation
 can happen in our prisons our jails
 and our immigration detention centers  giving hope to those who want to create a better life after serving their time  
  imagine if we also considered the front end of this prison pipeline 
 what would it look like if we intervened with rehabilitation as a core value with love and compassion as core values 
 we would have a society that is safer  healthier and worthy of raising our children in 
 i want to introduce you to james cavitt james served twelve years
 in the san quentin state prison and is being released in eighteen months
  james like you and me is more than the worst thing he 's done 
 he is a father a husband a son a poet he committed a crime he 's paying his debt and working hard to build the skills
 to make the transition back to a productive life
 when he enters the civilian population again now james like millions of people behind bars is an
  example of what happens if we believe that our failings don 't define who we are that we are all worthy of redemption and if we support those impacted by mass incarceration  we can all heal together 
 i 'd like to introduce you to james right now and he 's going to share his journey of redemption
  welcome to san quentin 
 the talent is abundant behind prison walls  future software engineers  entrepreneurs  craftsmen  musicians and artists  
 this piece is inspired by all of the hard work that men and women are doing on the inside to create better lives and futures for themselves after they serve their time
  this piece is entitled where i live 
 i live in a world where most people are too afraid to go  
 surrounded by tall concrete walls steel bars where razor wire have a way of cutting away at the hopes for a brighter tomorrow 
 i live in a world that kill people who kill people in order to teach people that killing people is wrong
  imagine that 
 better yet imagine a world where healed people helped hurt people heal and become strong 
 maybe then we would all be singin ' redemption song 
 i live in a world that has been called hell on earth by those trapped inside 
 but i 've come to the stark realization that prison
 it really is what you make it
  you see in spite of the harshness of my reality there is a silver lining 
 i knew that my freedom was gonna come it was just a matter of time and so i treated my first steps as if they were my last mile and i
 realized that you don 't have to be free in order to experience freedom  
 and just because you 're free doesn 't mean that you have freedom  many of us for years have been battling our inner demons
 we walk around smiling when inside we 're really screamin ' freedom  
 don 't you get it we
 're all serving time we 're just in different places 
 as for me i choose to be free from the prisons i 've created the key  forgiveness  action 's my witness if we want freedom  
 then we gotta think different 
 because freedom
 it isn 't a place it 's a mind setting
  we forward in this generation
  these songs of freedom
  for atomic energy
  these songs of
  these songs of freedom
