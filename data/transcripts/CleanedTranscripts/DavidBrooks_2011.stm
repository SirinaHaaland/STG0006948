  got my current job i was given a good piece of advice which was to interview three politicians every day  
 and from that much contact with politicians i can tell you they 're all emotional freaks of one sort or another  
 they have what i called 
  which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane 
 laughter but what they do have is incredible social skills when you meet them they lock into you they look you in the eye they invade your personal 
  space they massage the back of your head i had dinner with a republican senator several months ago who kept his hand on my inner thigh throughout the whole meal squeezing it 
  other and they were laughing and their faces were like this far apart  and they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other and i was like get a room i don 't want to see this 
 but they have those social skills another case  
 last election cycle i was following mitt romney
 around new hampshire and he was campaigning with his five
  he 's going into a diner
 and he goes into the diner introduces himself to a family and says what village are you from in new hampshire and then he describes the home he owned in their village and
 so he goes around
 the room and then as he 's leaving the diner  he first names almost everybody he 's just met i was like okay
  but the paradox is when a lot of these people slip into the policy making mode that social awareness vanishes and they start talking like accountants so in the course of my career i have covered a series of failures 
 we sent economists in the soviet union with privatization plans when it broke up and what they really lacked was social trust  
 we invaded iraq with a military oblivious to the cultural and psychological realities  we had a financial regulatory regime
  based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn 't do anything stupid 
 for thirty years i 've been covering school reform and we 've basically reorganized the bureaucratic boxes charters private schools vouchers
 but we 've had disappointing results year after year  and the fact is people learn from
 people they love  
 and if you 're not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student you 're not talking about that reality  but that reality is expunged from our policy making process  
 and so that 's led to a question for me  why are the most 
 people on earth completely dehumanized when they think about policy  
 and i came to the conclusion this is a symptom of a larger problem that for centuries we 've inherited a view of
  nature based on the notion that we 're divided selves 
 that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions  
 and it 's led to a view of human nature that we 're rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives
  and it 's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure
 how human behavior is  
 and it 's produced a great amputation a shallow view of human nature we
 're really good at talking about material things but we 're really bad at talking about emotions we 're really good at talking about skills and safety and
  really bad at talking about character  
 alasdair macintyre the famous philosopher  said that we have the concepts of the ancient morality of virtue  honor  goodness  but we no longer have a system by which to connect them 
 and so this has led to a shallow path in politics but also in a whole range of human endeavors 
 you can see it in the way we raise our young kids you go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon
 and you watch the kids come out
  and they 're wearing these 80 pound backpacks
 if the wind blows them over they 're like beetles stuck there on the ground you see these cars that drive up
 usually it 's saabs and audis and volvos because in certain neighborhoods it 's socially acceptable to have a luxury car so long as it comes from a country hostile to u s foreign policy that 's fine  
 they get
 picked up by these creatures i 've called uber moms who are highly successful career women
  have taken time off to make sure all their kids get into harvard and you can usually tell the uber moms because they actually weigh less than their own children so at
 the
 moment of conception they 're doing little butt exercises  babies flop out they 're flashing mandarin flashcards at the things  
 driving them home
  they want them to be enlightened so they take them to ben & jerry 's ice cream company with its own foreign policy
 in one of my books i joke that ben & jerry 's should make a pacifist toothpaste doesn 't kill germs just asks them to leave it would be a big seller 
 and they go to whole foods to get their baby formula and whole foods is one of those progressive grocery stores where all the cashiers look like they 're on loan from amnesty international 
  snacks there called veggie booty with kale which is for kids who come home and say mom mom i want a snack that 'll help prevent 
 and so the kids are raised in a certain way  jumping through achievement hoops of the things we can measure sat prep oboe  soccer practice they 
  get into competitive colleges they get good jobs  and sometimes they make a success of themselves in a
  and they make a ton of money and sometimes you can see them at vacation places like jackson hole or aspen and they 've become elegant and slender they don 't really have thighs they just have one elegant calve on top of another 
 they have
 kids of their own and they 've achieved a genetic miracle by marrying beautiful people so their grandmoms look like gertrude stein their daughters looks like halle berry i don 't
  they get there and they realize
 it 's fashionable now to have dogs a third as tall as your ceiling heights so they 've got these furry  160 pound dogs all look like velociraptors 
 all named after jane austen characters  
 and then when they get old they haven 't really developed a philosophy of life but they 've decided i 've been successful at everything  i 'm just not going to die 
 and so they hire personal trainers  they 're popping cialis like breath mints
  you see them on the mountains up there they 're cross country skiing up up the mountain with these grim expressions that make dick cheney look like jerry lewis 
 and as they whiz by you it 's like being passed by a little iron raisinet
 going up the hill 
 and so this is part of what life is but it 's not all of what life is and over the past few
  years  i think we 've been given a deeper view of human nature and a deeper view of who we are  and it 's not based on theology or philosophy it 's in the study 
  of the mind across all these spheres of research from neuroscience to the cognitive scientists behavioral economists psychologists  sociology  we 're developing a revolution in consciousness 
  and far from being a coldly materialistic view of nature  it 's a new humanism  it 's a new enchantment  
 and i think when you synthesize this research you start with three key insights  
 the first insight is that while the conscious mind writes the autobiography of our species the unconscious mind does most of the work and
 so one way to formulate that is the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute of which it can
  be consciously aware of about forty  
 and this leads to oddities one of my favorite is that people named dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists 
 people named lawrence become lawyers because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar  
 which is why i named my daughter president of the united states brooks 
 another finding is that the unconscious far from being
  dumb and sexualized is actually quite smart  so one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture it 's really hard to imagine a sofa how it 's going to look in your house  and the way you should do that is
 study the furniture let it marinate in your mind distract yourself  and then a few days later go with your gut because unconsciously you 've figured it out  
 the second insight is that emotions are at the center of our thinking
  people with strokes and lesions in the emotion processing parts of the brain are not super smart  they 're actually sometimes quite helpless  and the giant in the field is in the room tonight and is speaking 
  tomorrow morning antonio damasio  and one of the things he 's really shown us is that emotions are not separate from reason  but they are the foundation of reason because they tell us what to
  and so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom  
 now i 'm a middle aged guy i 'm not exactly comfortable with emotions one of my favorite brain stories described these middle aged guys they put them into a
 a brain scan machine this is apocryphal by the way but i don 't care and they had them watch a horror movie  and then they had
 them describe their feelings toward their wives  and the the brain scans were identical in both activities
  sheer terror 
 so me talking about emotion is like gandhi talking about gluttony  
 but it is the central organizing process of the way we think it tells us what to imprint the brain is the record of the feelings of a life  
 and the third insight
 is that we 're not primarily self contained individuals we 're social
  not rational animals  we emerge out of relationships and we are deeply interpenetrated one with another  
 and so when we see another person we reenact in our own minds what we see in their minds when we watch a car chase in a movie it 's almost as if we are subtly having a car chase  
 when we watch pornography it 's a little like having sex  though probably not as good 
 and we see this
  when lovers walk down the street  when a crowd in egypt or tunisia gets caught up in an emotional contagion the deep interpenetration  
 and this revolution in who we are
 gives us a different way of seeing i think politics a different way most importantly of seeing human capital 
 we are now children of the french enlightenment  we believe that reason is the highest of the faculties
  but i think this research shows that the british enlightenment or the scottish enlightenment with david hume  adam smith actually had a better handle on who we are that reason is often weak our sentiments are strong  and our sentiments are often trustworthy  
 and this work corrects that bias in our culture  that dehumanizing bias it gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive
  in this life  when we think about human capital we think about the things we can measure easily
 things like grades sat 's degrees the number of years in schooling 
 what it really takes to do well to lead a meaningful life are things that are deeper 
 things we don 't really even have words for  and so let me list just a couple of the things i think this research points us
 toward trying to understand  the first gift or talent is mindsight
 the ability to
  enter into other people 's minds and learn what they have to offer  
 babies come with this ability meltzoff who 's at the university of washington leaned over a baby who was forty three minutes old 
 he wagged his tongue at the baby the baby wagged her tongue back 
 babies are born to interpenetrate into mom 's mind and to download what they find their models of how to understand reality in the united states
  percent of babies have a deep two way conversation with mom and they learn models to how to relate to other people 
 and those people who have models of how to relate have a huge head start in life scientists at the university of minnesota did a study in which they could predict with seventy seven percent accuracy 
 at age eighteen months who was going to graduate from high school based on who had good attachment with mom  
 twenty percent of kids do not have those
  relationships  they are what we call avoidantly attached they have trouble relating to other people they go through life like sailboats tacking into the wind wanting to get close to people but not really having the models of how to do that  
 and so this is one skill of how to hoover up knowledge  one from another a second skill is equipoise 
 the ability to have the serenity to read the biases and failures in your own
  mind so for example we are overconfidence machines ninety five percent of our professors report that they are above average teachers
 ninety six percent of college students say they have above average social skills  time magazine asked americans are you in the top one percent of earners nineteen percent of americans are in the top one percent
  because men think they can swim across that lake  
 but some people have the ability and awareness of of their own biases their own overconfidence they have epistemological modesty 
 they are open minded in the face of ambiguity they are able to adjust strength of the conclusions to the strength of their evidence  they are curious and these traits are often unrelated and uncorrelated with iq 
 the third trait is metis
 what we might call street smarts it 's a greek word it 's a sensitivity to the physical environment  the ability to pick out patterns in an environment derive a gist 
 one of my colleagues at the times did a great story about soldiers in iraq who could look down a street and detect somehow whether there was an ied a landmine in the street  they couldn 't tell you how they
  but they could feel cold they felt a coldness  and they were more often right than wrong 
 the third is what you might call sympathy the ability to work within groups 
 and that comes in tremendously handy  because groups are smarter than individuals and face to face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically  because ninety 
  percent of our communication is non verbal and the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the iq of the group it 's determined
 by how well they communicate how often they take turns in conversation  
 then you could talk about a trait like blending  any child can say i 'm a tiger pretend to be a tiger it seems so elementary 
 but in fact it 's phenomenally complicated to take a concept i and a concept tiger and blend them together
  but this is the source of innovation what picasso did for example was take the concept western art and the concept african masks and blend them together not only the geometry  but the moral systems entailed in them 
 and these are skills again we can 't count and measure and then the final thing i 'll mention is something you might call limerence  
 and this is not an ability it 's a drive and a motivation 
 the conscious mind hungers for success and prestige  the unconscious mind hungers for those moments of
  transcendence when the skull line disappears and we are lost in a challenge or a task when a craftsman feels lost in his craft  when a naturalist 
  feels at one with nature  when a believer feels at one with god 's love 
  've come across in this research
 of how minds interpenetrate was written by a great theorist and scientist named douglas hofstadter at the university of indiana 
 he was married to a woman named carol 
 and they had a wonderful relationship when their kids were five and two carol had a stroke and a brain tumor and died suddenly  
 and hofstadter wrote a book called i am a strange loop 
 in the course of that book he describes a
  moment
 just months after carol has died he comes across her picture on the mantel or on a bureau in his bedroom and here 's what he wrote 
 i looked at her face  and i looked so deeply that i felt i was behind her eyes 
 and all at once i found myself saying as tears flowed '
 that 's me that 's me '
 and those simple words brought back many thoughts that i had had before
 about the fusion of our souls into one higher level entity about the fact that at the core of both our souls
 lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children  
 about the notion that those hopes were not separate or distinct hopes 
 but were just one hope one clear thing that defined us both that welded us into a unit
 the kind of unit i had but dimly imagined before being
  married and having children 
 i realized that though carol had died that core piece of her had not died at all 
 but had had lived on very determinedly in my brain 
 the greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom  through his suffering hofstadter understood how deeply interpenetrated we are  
 policy failures of the last thirty years  we have come to acknowledge i think how shallow our view of human nature has been 
 and now as we confront that shallowness and the failures that derive from our inability to get the depths of who we are 
 comes this revolution in consciousness these people in so many fields
 exploring the depth of our nature and coming away with this enchanted this
  and when freud discovered his sense of the unconscious  it had a vast effect on the climate of the times 
 now we are discovering a more accurate vision of the unconscious of who we are deep inside  and it 's going to have a wonderful and profound and humanizing effect on our culture
