  i want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time in a very short time
  let 's tune into the conversation of the principals in adam 's temptation 
  life is temptation  it 's all about yielding resisting yes no now
  present focus and future focus promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage thank you george bush
 the majority sixty percent yielded to sexual temptations within one year  and most of them did so without using birth control  
 so much for promises now lets tempt four year olds 
 giving them a treat they can have one marshmallow now but if they wait until the experimenter comes back they can have two of course it pays if you like
  marshmallows to wait 
 what happens is two thirds of the kids give in to temptation  they cannot wait the others of course wait  they resist the temptation they delay the now for later  
 walter mischel my colleague at stanford went back fourteen years later  
 to try to discover what was different about those kids there were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded in many ways 
 the kids who resisted scored two
  hundred and fifty points higher on the sat that 's enormous that 's like a whole set of different iq points
  they didn 't get in as much trouble they were better students they were self confident and determined  and the key for me today the key for you is they were future focused rather than present focused 
 so what is time perspective  that 's what i 'm going to talk about today time perspective
  is the study of how individuals all of us 
 divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories and you do it automatically and non consciously 
 they vary between cultures between nations between individuals between social classes between education levels and
 the problem is that they can become biased because you learn to over use some of them and under use the others 
 what determines any decision you make you make a decision on which you 're going to base an action for some people it 's only about what is in the immediate situation
  what other people are doing and what you 're feeling 
 and those people when they make their decisions in that format we 're going to call them present oriented because their focus is what is now for others the present is irrelevant 
 it 's always about what is this situation like that i 've experienced in the past so that their decisions are based on past memories 
 and we 're going to call those people 
 because they focus on what was for others it 's not the past it 's not the present it 's only about the future
  focus is always about anticipated consequences cost benefit analysis we
 're going to call them future oriented their focus is on what will be 
 so time paradox i want to argue the paradox of time perspective 
 is something that influences every decision you make you 're totally unaware of namely the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives 
 well there is actually six of them there are two ways to be present oriented there is two ways to be
 two ways to be future you can focus on
 or past negative you can be present hedonistic namely you focus on the joys of life or  present fatalist it doesn 't matter your life is controlled 
 you can be future oriented setting goals or you can be transcendental future namely life begins after death  
 developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation that 's what you 've got to learn to do
 so very quickly what is the optimal time profile 
 high on past positive moderately high on future and moderate on present hedonism and always low on past negative and present fatalism 
 so the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past
 past past positive gives you roots you connect your family identity and your self  what you get from the future is wings to soar to new destinations new challenges what you get from the present hedonism
 is the energy the energy to to explore yourself  places people sensuality 
 any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives what do futures sacrifice for success  
 they sacrifice family time  they sacrifice friend time they sacrifice fun time they sacrifice personal
  they sacrifice hobbies  and they sacrifice sleep so it affects their health  and they live for work  achievement and control  
 i 'm sure that resonates with some of the tedsters 
 and it resonated for me i grew up as a poor kid in the south bronx ghetto a sicilian family everyone lived in the past and present 
 i 'm here as a future oriented person who went over the top who did all these sacrifices because
  and made me future oriented told me don 't eat that marshmallow because if you wait you 're going to get two of them until i learned to balance out 
 i 've added present hedonism i 've added
 a focus on the
  years old i am more energetic than ever more productive and i 'm happier than i have ever been  
 i just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems changing the drop out rates of school kids combating addictions enhancing teen health curing vets ' ptsd with time
  metaphors getting miracle cures promoting sustainability and conservation reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50 percent drop out rate 
 altering appeals to suicidal terrorists and modifying family conflicts as
