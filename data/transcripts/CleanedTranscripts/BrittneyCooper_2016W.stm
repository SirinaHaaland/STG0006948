  what if i told you
 that time
 has a race a race in the contemporary way that we understand race in the united states  typically  we talk about race in terms
  about our perpetual lateness to church to cookouts to family events and even to our own funerals  remains  
 i personally am a stickler for time  it 's almost as if my mother
  when i was growing up said we will not be those black people so we typically arrive to events thirty minutes early  
 but today  i want to talk to you more about the political nature of time  for if time had a race it would be white 
 white people
 own time  i know i
  we go ahead with our enlightened progressive selves and relegate useless concepts like race to the dustbins of history 
 how will we ever get over racism if we keep on talking about race  
 perhaps we should lock up our concepts of race in a time capsule
  bury them and dig them up in a thousand years  peer at them with the clearly more enlightened raceless versions of ourselves that belong to the future 
 but you see there that desire to mitigate the impact of race and racism shows up in how we attempt to manage time  
 in the ways we narrate history in the ways we attempt to shove the negative truths of the present into the past  in the ways we attempt to argue
  that the future that we hope for is the present in which we 're currently living 
 now when barack obama became president of the us in two thousand and eight  many americans declared that we were 
  from the academy where we 're enamored with being
  terms to mark the way we were but prefixes alone don 't have the power to make race and racism
 a thing of the past the us was never pre race 
 so to claim that we 're post race when we have yet to grapple with the impact of race on black people  latinos or the indigenous
 is disingenuous just about the moment we were preparing to celebrate our
 our political conditions became the most racial they 've been in the last fifty years 
 so today i want to offer to you three observations 
 about the past the present and the future of time as it relates to the combating of racism
 and white dominance first the past  time
  has a history and so do black people
 but we treat time as though it is timeless as though it has always been this way 
 as though it doesn 't have a political history bound up with the plunder of indigenous lands the genocide of indigenous people
 and the stealing of africans from their homeland  
 when white male european philosophers first thought to conceptualize time and history one famously declared
  is no historical part of the world 
 he was essentially saying that africans were people outside of history who had had no impact on time or the march of progress  
 this idea that black people have had no impact on history is one of the foundational ideas of white supremacy 
 it 's the reason that carter  g woodson created negro history
  it 's the reason that we continue to celebrate black history month in the us every february 
 now  we also see this idea that black people are people
 either alternately outside of the bounds of time or stuck in the past 
 in a scenario where much as i 'm doing right now a black person stands up and insists that racism still matters  
 and a person
  usually white says to them why are you stuck in the past  why can 't you move on 
 we have a black president we 're past all that 
 william faulkner famously said the past is never dead it 's not even past 
 but my good friend professor kristie dotson says our memory is longer than our lifespan
  we carry all of us  family and communal hopes and dreams with us  
 we don 't have the luxury of letting go
 of the past  but sometimes our political conditions are so troubling that we don 't know if we 're living in the past
 or we 're living in the present take for instance when black lives matter protesters go out to protest unjust killings of black citizens by police and the pictures
  emerge from the protest
 look like they could have been taken fifty years ago 
 the past won 't let us go but still let us press our way into the present 
 at present i would argue
 that the racial struggles we are experiencing are clashes over time
  and space what do i mean well
 i 've already told you that white people own time  
 those in power dictate the pace of the workday they dictate how much money our time is actually worth 
 and professor george  lipsitz argues
 that white people even dictate the pace of social inclusion they dictate how long it will actually take for
  minority groups to receive the rights that they have been fighting for let me loop back to the past quickly to give you an example 
 if you think about the civil rights movement and the cries of its leaders for freedom now 
 they were challenging the slow pace of white social inclusion by 
 the year the voting rights act was passed 
 there had been a full one hundred years between the end of the civil war and the conferral of voting rights on african american communities despite the urgency of a war
  it still took a full one hundred years for actual social inclusion to occur  
 since two thousand and twelve  
 conservative state legislatures across the us have ramped up attempts to roll back african american voting rights by passing restrictive voter id laws and curtailing early voting opportunities 
 this past july a federal court struck down north carolina 's voter id law saying it
 african americans with surgical precision 
  african american inclusion in the body politic
 is a primary way
 that we attempt to manage and control
 people by managing and controlling time  but another place that we see these time space clashes
 is in gentrifying cities like atlanta  brooklyn philadelphia new orleans and
  washington dc
 places that have had black populations for generations 
 but now  in the name of urban renewal and progress  these communities are pushed out in service of bringing them into the 21st century
 professor sharon holland asked  what happens when a person who exists in time
 meets someone who only occupies space
  these racial struggles are battles over those who are perceived to be  space takers and those who are perceived to be
 those who control the flow and thrust of history are considered world makers who own and master time
 in other words white people but when hegel famously said that africa was no historical part of the world  he implied that
  it was merely a voluminous land mass taking up space at the bottom of the globe africans were 
 so today  white people continue to control the flow and thrust of history while too often treating black people as though we are merely
 taking up space to which we are not entitled time and the march of progress is used to justify a stunning degree of violence towards our
  most vulnerable populations who being perceived as
 rather than world makers are moved out of the places where they live in service of bringing them into the 21st century  
 shortened life span according to zip code is just one example of the ways that time and space cohere in an
  unjust manner in the lives of black people 
 children who are born in new orleans zip code seventy thousand one hundred and twenty four 
 which is ninety three percent white 
 can expect to live a full twenty five years longer than children born in new orleans zip code seventy  thousand one hundred and twelve 
 which is sixty percent black 
 children born in washington dc 's wealthy maryland suburbs
 can expect to live a full twenty years longer
 than children born in its downtown
  neighborhoods ta nehisi coates argues that the defining feature of being drafted into the black race
 is the inescapable robbery of time 
 we experience time discrimination he tells us not just as structural  but as personal 
 in lost moments of joy  lost moments of connection  
 lost quality of time with
  loved ones and lost years of healthy quality of life 
 in the future do you see black people  do black people
 have a future  
 what if you belong to the very race of people who have always been pitted against time  what if your group is the group for whom a future
  imagined  these time space clashes between protesters and police between gentrifiers and residents
 don 't paint a very pretty picture of what america hopes
 for black people 's future if the present is any indicator our children will be under educated health maladies will take their toll
 and housing will continue to be unaffordable so if we 're really ready
  to talk about the future  perhaps we should begin by admitting
 that we 're out of time 
 we black people have always been out of time time does not belong to us our lives are lives of perpetual urgency 
 time is used to displace us or conversely we are urged into complacency through endless calls to just be patient
  but if past is prologue let us seize upon the ways in which we 're always out of time anyway
 to demand with urgency
 freedom now  
 i believe the future is what we make it  but first  we have to decide that time belongs to all of us 
 no we don 't all get equal time  but we can decide that the time we do get is just and free we can
  stop making your zip code the primary determinant of your lifespan  
 we can stop stealing learning time from black children through excessive use of suspensions and expulsions  
 we can stop stealing time from black people through long periods of incarceration for nonviolent crimes 
 the police can stop stealing time and black lives
 through use of excessive force  i believe the future is what we make it
  but we can 't get there on colored people 's time or white time or your time or even my time
