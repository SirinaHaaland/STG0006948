  i 'd begin with a scene of war  there was little to warn of the danger ahead the iraqi insurgent had placed
 the ied an improvised explosive device along the side of the road with great care by two
  thousand and six there were more than two thousand five hundred of these attacks every single month  
 and they were the leading cause of casualties among american soldiers and iraqi civilians 
 the team that was hunting for this ied is called an eod team explosives ordinance disposaland they 're the pointy end of the spear in the american effort to suppress these roadside bombs 
 each eod team goes out on about six
  hundred of these bomb calls every year 
 defusing about two bombs a day perhaps the best sign of how valuable they are to the war effort is that the iraqi insurgents put a $ fifty thousand bounty on the head of a single eod soldier 
 unfortunately  this particular call would not end well  by the time the soldier advanced close enough to see the telltale wires of the bomb  it exploded in a
 wave of flame  
  close you are and how much
 explosive has been packed into that bomb  
 it can cause death or injury you have to be as far as fifty yards away to escape that the blast is so strong it can even break your limbs even if you 're not hit 
 that soldier had been on top of the bomb  
 and so when the rest of the team advanced they found little left  and that night the unit 's commander did a sad duty  
 and he wrote a condolence letter back to the united states and he talked about how hard the loss had been on his unit about the fact that they had lost their
  soldier a soldier who had saved their lives many a time  and he apologized
 for not being able to bring them home  
 but then he talked up the silver lining that he took away from the loss 
 at least as he wrote when a robot dies  you don 't have to write a letter to its mother 
 that scene sounds like science fiction but is battlefield reality already
  the soldier in that case was a 42 pound robot called a packbot  
 the chief 's letter went not to some farmhouse in iowa like you see in the old war movies  but went to the irobot company  
 which is named after the asimov novel and the
  out carrying out mundane chores and then they started taking on  life and death decisions  that 's a reality we face today what we 're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show 
  you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage it 's just to give you a taste 
  anything that 's powered by vulcan technology or teenage teenage wizard hormones or anything like that this is all real so why don 't we go ahead and start those pictures 
 something big is going on in war today  and maybe even the history of humanity itself the u s military went into iraq with a handful of drones in the air  
 we now have five thousand three hundred 
 we went in with zero unmanned ground systems  we now have twelve thousand and the tech term
  application takes on new meaning in this space  
 and we need to remember that we 're talking about the model t fords  the wright flyers compared to what 's coming soon 
 that 's where we 're at right now  one of the people that i recently met with was an air force three star general  and he said basically where we 're headed very soon
 is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts and these numbers matter because we 're not just talking
  about
 tens of thousands of today 's robots but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow 's robots because of course one of the things that 's operating in technology is moore 's law that 
  you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots and so flash forward around twenty five years if moore 's law holds true those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today
  and so what that means is the kind of things that we used to only talk about at science fiction conventions like comic con
 have to be talked about in the halls of power and places like the pentagon 
 a robots revolution is upon us 
 now i need to be clear here i 'm not talking about a revolution where you have to worry about the governor of california showing up at your door
  when historians look at this period they 're going to conclude that we 're in a different type of revolution a revolution in war
  like the invention of the atomic bomb  but it may be even bigger than that because our unmanned systems don 't just affect the how of war fighting 
 they affect the who of fighting at its most fundamental level  that is every previous revolution in war  be it the machine gun be it the
  was about a system that either shot faster went further had a bigger boom 
 that 's certainly the case with robotics  but they also change the experience of the warrior and even the very identity of the warrior  
 another way of putting this is that mankind
  monopoly on the fighting of war is breaking down in our very lifetime 
 i 've spent the last several years going around meeting with all the players in this field from the robot scientists
 to the science fiction authors who inspired them to the 19 year old drone pilots who are fighting from nevada to the four star generals who command them to even the iraqi insurgents who they are targeting and what they think about our systems 
 and what i found interesting is not just their stories  but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our
  in our law and our ethics etc and so what i 'd like to do with my remaining time is basically flesh out a couple of these 
 so the first is that the future of war  even a robotics one is not going to be purely an american one 
 the u s is currently ahead in military robotics right now  
 but we know that in technology there 's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage in a quick show of hands how many people
  's the same thing in war  the british and the french invented the tank  
 the germans figured out how to use it right  
 and so what we have to think about for the u s is that we are ahead right now  but you have forty three other countries out there working on military robotics and they include all the interesting countries like russia  china pakistan iran and
 this raises a bigger worry for me 
 how do we move forward in this
  revolution given the state of our manufacturing and the state of our science and mathematics training in our schools 
 or another way of thinking about this is what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in china and software is written in india  
 but just as software has
  so has warfare  
 unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb  you don 't need a massive manufacturing system to build robotics a lot of it is off the shelf  a lot of it 's even do it yourself one of those things you just saw flashed 
  before you was a raven drone the handheld tossed one for about a thousand dollars  you can build one yourself equivalent to what the soldiers use in iraq that raises another wrinkle when it comes to war and conflict 
  this cross between robotics and things like terrorism is going to be fascinating and even disturbing and we 've already seen it start  
 during the war between israel  a state and hezbollah a non state actor the non state actor flew four different drones against israel 
 there 's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an ied in iraq while sitting at your home computer
 and so i think what we 're going to see is two trends take place with this first is you 're going to reinforce the power of individuals against governments  
 but then the second is that we are going to see an expansion in the realm of terrorism 
 the future of it may be a cross between al qaeda two point zero and the next generation of the unabomber and another way of thinking about this is the fact that
  remember  you don 't have to convince a robot that they 're gonna receive seventy two virgins after they die to convince them to blow themselves up  
 but the ripple effects of this are going to go out into our politics one of the people that i met with was a former assistant secretary of defense for ronald reagan  and he put it this way 
 i like these systems because they save
  but i worry about more marketization of wars more shock and awe talk to defray discussion of the costs 
 people are more likely to support the use of force if they view it as costless 
 robots for me take certain trends that are already in play in our body politic 
 and maybe take them to their logical ending point  we don 't have a draft  
 we don 't have
 declarations of war anymore  we don 't buy war bonds anymore  
 and now we have the fact that we 're converting more and more of our american soldiers that we would send into harm 's way into machines  
 and so we may take those already lowering bars to war
 and drop them to the ground but
 the future of war is also going to be a youtube war  
 that is our new technologies don 't merely remove humans from risk they also record everything that they see
 so they don 't just delink the public 
 they reshape its relationship with war  
 there 's already several thousand video clips of combat footage from iraq on youtube right now  most of it gathered by drones 
 now  this could be a good thing it could be building connections between the home front and the war front as never before 
 but remember this is taking place in our
  weird world  and so inevitably the ability to download these video clips to you know your ipod or your zune
 gives you
 the ability to turn it into entertainment 
 soldiers have a name for these clips  they call it war porn  the typical one that i was sent was an email that had an attachment
 of video of a predator strike taking out an enemy site  missile hits
  bodies burst into the air with the explosion it was set to music  it was set to the pop song i just want to fly by sugar ray  
 this ability to watch more but experience less
 creates a wrinkle in the public 's relationship with war  i think about this with a sports
  a professional basketball game on tv where the athletes are tiny figures on the screen 
 and being at that basketball game in person and realizing what someone seven feet really does look like but we have to remember 
 these are just the clips these are just the espn sportscenter version of the game
  they lose the context  they lose the strategy  they lose the humanity war just becomes slam dunks and smart bombs  
 now the irony of all this is that while the future of war may involve more and more machines  it 's our human psychology
 that 's driving all of this it 's our human failings that are leading to these wars  
 so one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we 're fighting against radical
  groups what is the message that we think we are sending with these machines versus what is being received in terms of the message 
 so one of the people that i met was a senior bush administration official who had this to say about our unmanning of war
  it plays to our strength  the thing that scares people is our technology
  but when you go out and meet with people for example in lebanon it 's a very different story one of the people i met with there was a news editor and we 're talking as a drone is flying above him  and this is 
  what he had to say this is just another sign of the coldhearted cruel israelis and americans who are cowards because they send out machines to fight us they don 't want to fight us like real men  but they 're afraid to fight 
  the future of war also is featuring a new type of warrior 
 and it 's actually redefining the experience of going to war you can call this a cubicle warrior this is what one predator drone pilot described of his experience fighting in the iraq war while never leaving nevada you
 're going to war for twelve hours  shooting weapons at targets  directing kills on enemy combatants
 and then you get in the car and you drive home and within twenty minutes you 're sitting at the dinner table talking to your kids about their homework 
 now the psychological balancing of those experiences is incredibly tough and in fact those drone pilots have higher rates of ptsd than many of the units physically in iraq  
 but some have worries that this disconnection will lead to something else that it might make the
  of war crimes a lot easier when you have this distance it 's like a video game is what one young pilot described to me
 of taking out enemy troops from afar 
 as anyone who 's played grand theft auto knows we do things in the video world that we wouldn 't do face to face 
 so much of what you 're hearing from me is that there 's another side to technologic revolutions
  shaping our present and maybe will shape our future of war  
 moore 's law is operative  but so 's murphy 's law 
 the fog of war isn 't being lifted the enemy has a vote we 're gaining incredible new capabilities  but we 're also seeing and experiencing new human dilemmas 
 now  sometimes these are just oops moments which is what the head of a robotics company described it you just have
  are oops moments with robots in war  well sometimes they 're funny  sometimes they 're like that scene from the eddie murphy
 movie best defense playing out in reality 
 where they tested out a machine gun armed robot and during the demonstration it started spinning in a circle and pointed its machine gun at the reviewing stand of
  fortunately the weapon wasn 't loaded and no one was hurt  
 but other times oops moments are tragic  such as last year in south africa  where an anti aircraft cannon had a software glitch 
 and actually did turn on and fired  and nine soldiers were killed 
 we have new wrinkles in the laws of war and accountability what do we do with things like unmanned slaughter 
 what is unmanned slaughter  we 've already had three instances of predator drone
  strikes where we thought we got bin laden  and it turned out not to be the case 
 and this is where we 're at right now  this is not even talking about armed autonomous systems with full authority to use force 
 and do not believe that that isn 't coming 
 during my research i came across four different pentagon projects on different aspects of that  
 and so you have this question what does this lead to issues like war crimes
  robots are emotionless so they don 't get upset if their buddy is killed  they don 't commit crimes of rage and revenge  
 but robots are emotionless 
 they see an 80 year old grandmother in a wheelchair the same way they see a t 80 tank  
 they 're both just a series of zeroes and ones  
 and so we have this question to figure out
 how do we catch up our 20th century laws of war  that are so old right now that they could qualify for medicare to these 21st century technologies  
 and so in conclusion 
 i 've talked about what seems the future of war  but notice that i 've only used real world examples and you 've only seen real world pictures and videos  
 and so this sets a great challenge for all of us
  that we have to worry about well before you have to worry about your roomba sucking the life away from you are we going to let the fact that what 's unveiling itself right now in war
 sounds like science fiction and therefore keeps us in denial 
 are we going to face the reality of 21st century war is our generation going to make the same mistake that a past generation did with atomic weaponry 
 and not deal
  the issues that surround it until pandora 's box is already opened up 
 now  i could be wrong on this and one pentagon robot scientist told me that i was he said there 's no real social ethical  moral issues when it comes to robots 
 that is he added unless the machine kills the wrong people repeatedly
  then it 's just a product recall issue 
 and so the ending point for this is that actually  we can turn to hollywood 
 a few years ago hollywood gathered all the top characters and created a list of the top one hundred heroes and top one hundred villains of all of hollywood history 
 the characters that represented the best and worst of humanity  
 only one character made it onto both lists  
 the terminator
  a robot killing machine  
 and so that points to the fact that our machines can be used for both good and evil  but for me it points to the fact that there 's a duality of humans as well  
 this week is a celebration of our creativity our creativity has taken our species to the stars our creativity has created works of arts and literature to express our love  
 and now we 're using our creativity
  in a certain direction to build fantastic machines with incredible capabilities  maybe even one day an entirely new species 
 but one of the main reasons that we 're doing that
 is because of our drive to destroy each other  and so the question we all should ask is it our machines or is it us that 's wired for war
