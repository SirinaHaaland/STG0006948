  make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy social media and the end of gender  let me connect the dots 
 i 'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love or love to hate
 are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender  
 i think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle
 some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes that we see in media and advertising about gender  if you
  our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender and i think that 's going to change  
 now most media companies television radio  publishing games you name it
 they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences it 's old school demographics 
 they come up with these very restrictive labels to define us
  now the crazy thing
 is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways you have certain taste that you like certain things  
 and so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture
 is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics 
 age demographics
  has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the 
 when the baby boomers were still young  
 now they 've aged out of that demographic but it 's still the case that powerful ratings companies like nielson don 't even take into account viewers of television shows over age fifty four 
 in our media environment it 's as if they don 't even exist  
 now if you watch mad men like i do it 's a
  popular tv show in the states dr faye miller does something called psychographics which
 first came about in the 1960s where you create these complex psychological profiles of consumers  
 but psychographics really haven 't had a huge impact on the media business it 's really just been basic demographics  
 so i 'm at the norman lear center at usc and we 've done a lot of research over the last seven
  years
 on demographics and how they affect media and entertainment in this country and abroad  and in the last three years we 've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed and we 've discovered some very interesting things 
 all the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand them  
  categories mean even less now than they did before  because with online networking tools it 's much easier for us to
 escape some of our demographic boxes we
 're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online and we can lie about our age online too pretty easily 
 we can also connect with people based on our very specific interests
  we don 't need a media company
 to help do this for us so the traditional media companies of course are paying very close attention to these online communities they know this is the mass audience of the future 
 they need to figure it out but they 're having a hard time doing it because they 're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them  because that 's how ad rates are still determined  
 when they 're monitoring your clickstream
  you know they are
 they have a really hard time figuring out your age your gender and your income they can make some educated guesses  
 but they get a lot more information about what you do online what you like what interests you that 's easier for them to find out than who you are and even though that 's still sort of creepy
  there is an upside to having your taste monitored suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn 't been before  it had been presumed before  
 so when you look online at the way people aggregate they don 't aggregate around age gender and income  
 they aggregate around the things they love the things that they like  and if you think about it shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories
  i 'd much rather know whether you like buffy the vampire slayer rather than how old you are that would tell me something more substantial about you 
 now there 's something else that we 've discovered about social media that 's actually quite surprising 
 it turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution
  if you look at the statistics these are worldwide statistics in every single age category 
 women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies  
 and then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites 
 they truly dominate the social media space  which is a space that 's having a huge impact
 on old media the question is what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture
 and what 's it going to mean for women 
 if the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media then does that mean that women are going to take 
  over global media are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on tv shows
  will the next big budget blockbuster movies
 actually be chick flicks  
 could this be possible that suddenly our media landscape will become a feminist landscape  
 well i actually don 't think that 's going to be the case 
 i think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women because they realize this is important for their business and i think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere
  think women are actually going to be ironically enough responsible for driving a stake through the heart
 of cheesy genre categories like the chick flick and all these other genre categories that presume
 that certain demographic groups like certain things that hispanics like certain
  that young people like certain things this is far too simplistic 
 the future entertainment media that we 're going to see is going to be very data driven and it 's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online  where women are really driving the action 
 so you may be asking well why is it important that i know
 what entertains people why should i know this of course  old media companies and advertisers need to know this but my argument is
  that if you want to understand the global village it 's probably a good idea that you figure out what they 're passionate about what amuses them what they choose to do in their free time 
 this is a very important thing to know about people i 've spent most of my professional life
  i do it not just because it 's fun
 though actually it is really fun
 but also because our research has shown over and over again
 that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people 's lives for instance on their political beliefs and on their health  
 and so if you have any interest in understanding the world looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start
  a media atmosphere that isn 't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics can you even imagine what that looks like 
 i can 't wait to find out what it looks like  thank you so much
