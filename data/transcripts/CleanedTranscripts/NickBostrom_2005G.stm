  talk today about
 i 've been asked to take the long view  and i 'm going to
 tell you what i think are the three biggest problems for humanity
 from this long point of view some of these have already been touched
  upon by other speakers which is encouraging
  it seems that there 's not just one person who thinks that these problems are important the first is death is a big problem  if you
 look at the statistics  the odds are not very favorable to us so far most people who have lived have also died roughly ninety percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now  
 so the
 annual death rate adds up to one hundred and fifty thousand sorry the daily death rate one hundred and fifty thousand people per day  
 which is a huge number by any standard the
 annual death rate then becomes fifty six million if we just look at the single  biggest cause of death aging
 it accounts for roughly
  people who die that adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of canada  sometimes we don 't see a problem because either
 it 's too familiar or it 's too big can 't see it because it 's too big i think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem
  this is not statistical points these are
 let 's see how far have i talked i 've talked for
 three minutes  so that would be 
 roughly three hundred and twenty four people have died since i 've begun speaking people like it 's roughly the population in this room has just died
  now  the human cost of that is obvious once you start to think about it the suffering the loss it 's
  i just look at the information and knowledge and experience that is lost
 due to natural causes of death in general and aging in particular suppose we approximated one person with one book now of course this is an underestimation 
 a person 's lifetime of
 learning and experience
 is a lot more than you could put into a single book but let
  people die of natural causes each year corresponds 
  to fifty two million
 volumes destroyed  library of congress holds eighteen million volumes 
 we are upset about the burning of the library of alexandria it 's one of the great cultural tragedies
 that we remember even today  but this is the equivalent of three libraries of congress burnt down forever lost each year
  first big problem  and i wish godspeed to aubrey de grey  and other
 people like him to try to do something about this as soon as possible
  existential risk the second big problem  existential risk is a threat to human survival or to the long term potential of our species now 
 i say that this is a big problem well let 's first look at the
 probability and this is very very difficult to estimate
 but there have been only four studies on this in recent years which is surprising you would think
 that it would be of some interest
 to try to find out more about this given that
 the stakes are so big but it 's a very neglected area but there have been four studies one by john lesley wrote a book on this he estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current
  century fifty percent similarly  
 the astronomer royal  whom we heard speak yesterday also has a fifty percent probability estimate 
 another author doesn 't give any numerical estimate but says the probability is significant that it will fail i wrote a long paper on this
  i said
 i said assigning a less than twenty percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have now  
 the exact figures here we should take with a big grain of salt but there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees  now if we think about 
  what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point
  living people the current generation now one percent of six billion people is
 equivalent to sixty million  so that 's a large number if we were to take into account future generations
 that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up then the figure becomes astronomical if we could
 eventually colonize a chunk of the universe the virgo supercluster maybe it will take us
  one hundred million years to get there but if we go extinct we never will then even a one percentage point reduction in
 the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number ten to the power of thirty two 
 so if you take into account future generations as much as our own  
 every other
  moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant the only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest
 decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other
 benefit you could hope to achieve and
 even if you just look at the current people and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct  it should still have a high priority  now let me
  the rest of my time on the third big problem because it 's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp 
 think about some time in your life
 some people might never have experienced it but some people there are just those moments that you have experienced where
 life was fantastic it might have been
 at the moment
  inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage or when you understood something you had never done before or
 perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love or an aesthetic experience a sunset or a
 great piece of art  
 every once in a while we have these moments and we realize just how good life can be when it 's at its best  and you wonder  why can 't it
 be like that all the time you just want to cling onto this
  and then of course it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades and it 's really difficult to recall 
 in a normal frame of mind just how good life can be at its best or how bad it can be at its worst  
 the third big problem is that life isn 't usually as wonderful as it could be i think that 's a big 
  it 's easy to say what we don 't want here are a number of things that
 we don 't want illness involuntary death  unnecessary suffering cruelty  stunted growth
  memory loss ignorance absence of creativity  suppose we fixed these things
 we did something about all of these we were very successful we got rid of all of these things we might end up with something like this which is i mean
  it 's a heck of a lot better than that but is this really the best
 we can dream of is this the best we can do or is it possible to find something
 a little bit more inspiring
 to work towards  and if we think about this i think it 's very clear that there are
  ways in which we could change things not just by eliminating negatives but adding positives 
 on my wish list at least would be much longer healthier lives greater
 subjective well being enhanced cognitive capacities more knowledge and understanding  
 unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits better relationships an unbounded potential
  for spiritual moral and intellectual development if we want to
 achieve this what in the world would have to change
  and this is the answer
 we would have to change not just the world around us  
 but we ourselves not just the way we think about the world  but the way we are our very biology 
 human nature would have to change  now when we think about changing human nature the first thing that comes to mind are these
  human modification technologies growth hormone therapy cosmetic surgery  stimulants like ritalin adderall 
 anabolic steroids artificial hearts  it 's a pretty pathetic list
  they do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition but for most people they
 don 't really transform
 what it is to be human 
 and they also all seem a little bit most people have this instinct that well sure there needs to be anti depressants for the really depressed people but there 's a kind of queasiness that these are
 unnatural in some way  it 's worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use we have
 skin enhancements clothing as far as i can see all of you are users of this enhancement technology
  in this room  so that 's a great thing
  mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial caffeine  alcohol  nicotine immune system enhancement  
 vision enhancement  anesthetics we take that very much for granted but just think about how
 great progress that is like having an operation before anesthetics was not fun
 and
 brain reprogramming techniques that sounds ominous but the distinction between
 what is a technology a gadget would be the archetype and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle so
 if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read you 're actually literally rewriting your own brain you 're changing the
  microstructure of your brain as you go along  so in a broad sense we don 't need to think about technology as only little gadgets like these things here but
 even institutions
 and techniques psychological methods and so forth forms of organization
 can have a profound impact on human nature looking ahead there is
  range of technologies that
 are almost certain to be developed sooner or later we are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws 
 laws of chemistry etc  it 's possible to assume  
 setting aside a possibility of catastrophe that sooner or later we will develop all of these  and even just
 a couple of these would be enough to
  's look at some of the dimensions of
 human nature that
 seem to leave room for improvement health span is a big
 and urgent thing because if you 're not alive then all the other things will be to little avail  intellectual capacity let 's take that box which
 falls into a lot of different
  why we value these traits is
 that they make us better at competing with other people they 're positional goods  but part of the reason and that 's the reason why we have
 ethical ground for pursuing these is that they 're also intrinsically valuable  it 's just
 better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with and to remember
 what you have learned
  modalities and special faculties now the human mind is not a single unitary
 information processor but it has a lot of different special 
 evolved modules that do specific things for us if you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning music humor 
  chatting with people
 all of these very likely 
 are enabled by a special circuitry that that we humans have but that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these we 're just lucky that we have
 the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it 
 all of these would enable in principle be amenable to enhancement some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have
 it 's also interesting to think about what other things are
 so if these all enabled great values 
 why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be 
 imagine a species that just didn 't have this neural machinery for processing
  they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance like the one we just heard because of
 people making stupid movements and they would be really irritated and wouldn 't see what we were up to but maybe they have another faculty something else that would seem equally irrational to us but 
 they actually tap into some great possible value there but we are just literally deaf to that that kind of value so we could think of adding on different new sensory capacities
  and mental faculties bodily functionality and morphology
 and affective self control greater subjective well being be
 able to switch between relaxation and activity being able to go slow when you need to do that and to speed up able to switch back and forth more easily would be
 a neat
 thing to be able to do easier to achieve the flow state when you 're totally immersed in something you are
  conscientiousness and sympathy the ability to it
 's another interesting application that would have large social ramification perhaps if you could actually
 choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person undiminished through time so that wouldn 't have to love would never have to fade if you didn 't want it
  that 's probably not all that difficult it might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this  
 it 's been done in
 in voles you can engineer
 a prairie vole to become monogamous when it 's naturally polygamous it 's just a single gene might be more complicated in humans but perhaps not that much this is the last picture
  being here would be a way of life a way of being experiencing thinking seeing  
 interacting with the world  down here in this little corner here we have
 the little sub space of this
 larger space that is accessible to human beings beings with our biological capacities  it 's a part of the space that 's
 accessible to animals since we are animals we are a subset of that
 and then you can imagine
 some enhancements of human capacities  
 there would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for say two hundred years  then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not
 possible for humans as we currently are so then you move off to this larger
  and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being
