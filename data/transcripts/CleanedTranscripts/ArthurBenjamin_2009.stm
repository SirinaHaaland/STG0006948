  invited me to be the next
 czar of mathematics
 then i would have a suggestion for him that i think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country and it would be easy to implement and
  inexpensive 
 the mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra  and everything we learn after that is building up 
 towards one subject and at top of that pyramid  it 's calculus 
  school graduate should know should be statistics probability and statistics 
 i mean  
 don 't get me wrong calculus is an important subject it 's one of the great products of the human mind the laws of nature are written in the language of calculus and every student who studies math
  they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college  but i 'm here to say as a professor of mathematics that very few people actually use 
  calculus in a conscious meaningful way in their day to day lives on the other hand statistics that 's a subject that you could and should use on daily basis right  it 's risk
  it 's reward it 's randomness  it 's understanding data i think if our students if our high school students if all of the american citizens knew about probability and statistics we wouldn 't be in the economic mess that we 're in today 
 applause not only thank you not only that but if it 's taught properly  it can be a lot of fun i mean probability and statistics it 's the mathematics of games and
  it 's analyzing trends it 's predicting the future 
 look the world has changed from analog to digital  and it 's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital from the more
 classical continuous mathematics to the more modern  discrete mathematics the mathematics of uncertainty of randomness 
  that being probability and statistics
