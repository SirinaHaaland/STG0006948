  it 's easy to forget that last night one billion people went to sleep without access to electricity one billion people 
 two and a half billion people did not have access to clean cooking fuels
 or clean heating fuels
  those are the problems in the developing world 
 and it 's easy for us not to be empathetic with those people who seem so distanced from us  but even in our own world the developed world  
 we see the tension of stagnant economies
 impacting the lives of people around us  we see it in whole pieces of the economy  where the people involved have lost hope about the future
  and despair about the present  we see that in the brexit vote  we see that in the sanders trump campaigns in my own country  
 but even in countries as recently turning the
 the corner towards being in the developed world  in china  we see the difficulty that president xi has as he
  so many people in his coal and mining industries
 who see no future for themselves as we as a society figure out how to manage the problems of the developed world
 and the problems of the developing world  we have to look at how we move forward
 and manage the environmental impact of those decisions we 've been working on this problem for twenty five years since
  the kyoto protocols our most recent move is the paris treaty 
 and the resulting climate agreements that are being ratified by nations around the world  i think we can be very hopeful
 that those agreements which are bottom up agreements where nations have said what they think they can do 
 are genuine and forthcoming for the vast majority of the parties  
 the unfortunate thing
 is that now as we look at the independent
  analyses of what those climate treaties are liable to yield 
 the magnitude of the problem before us becomes clear  this is the united states energy information agency 's assessment
 of what will happen if the countries implement the climate commitments that they 've made in paris
  around the world over the next thirty years  
 there are three things that you need to look at and appreciate 
 one co2 emissions are expected to continue to grow for the next thirty years 
 in order to control climate co2 emissions
  have to literally go to zero
 because it 's the cumulative emissions that drive heating on the planet 
 this should tell you that we are losing the race to fossil fuels  
 the second thing you should notice is that the bulk of the growth comes from the developing countries 
 from china from india from the rest of the world  which includes south africa and indonesia and brazil 
 as most of these countries move their people
 into the
  lower range of lifestyles that we literally take for granted
 in the developed world  the final thing that you should notice
 is that each year about ten
 gigatons of carbon are getting added to the planet 's
 atmosphere and then diffusing into the ocean and into the land that 's on top of the five hundred and fifty
 gigatons that are in place today  
 at the end of thirty years  we will have put eight hundred and fifty gigatons of carbon into the air  
 and that probably goes a long way towards locking in a 2 4 degree c increase in global mean surface temperatures 
 locking in ocean acidification
 and locking in sea level rise
 now this is a projection made by men
 by the actions of society  
 and it 's ours to change not to accept but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate 
 different nations make different energy choices it 's a function of their natural resources
  it 's a function of their climate  it 's a function of the development path that they 've followed as a society  
 it 's a function of where on the surface of the planet they are are they where it 's dark a lot of the time or are they at the 
 many many things go into the choices of countries  and they each make a different choice  
 the overwhelming thing that we need to appreciate is the choice that china has made china
 has made
 the choice  and will make the choice to run on coal 
 the united states has an alternative it can run on natural gas as a result of the inventions of fracking and shale gas which we have here 
 they provide an alternative 
 the oecd europe has a choice
  it has renewables that it can afford to deploy in germany because it 's rich enough to afford to do it the french and the british show interest in
 nuclear power 
 eastern europe still very heavily committed to natural gas and to coal and with natural gas that comes from russia with all of its entanglements 
 china has many fewer choices and a much harder row to hoe 
 if you look at china
  you ask yourself why has coal been important to it you have to remember what china 's done 
 china brought people to power not power to people 
 it didn 't do rural electrification  
 it urbanized  
 it urbanized by taking low cost labor and low cost energy creating export industries that could fund a tremendous amount of growth 
  look at china 's path all of us know that prosperity in china has dramatically increased 
 in one thousand nine hundred and eighty eighty percent of china 's population
 lived below the extreme poverty level below the level of having $ one point nine per person per day by the year two thousand
  only twenty percent of china 's population lived below the extreme poverty level
 a remarkable feat admittedly with some costs in civil liberties that would be tough to accept in the western world  
 but the impact of all that wealth allowed people to get massively better nutrition  
 it allowed water pipes to be placed  it allowed sewage pipes to be placed
  in diarrheal diseases at the cost of some outdoor air pollution  
 but in one thousand nine hundred and eighty and even today  the number one killer in china is indoor air pollution 
 because people do not have access to clean cooking and heating fuels  in fact in two thousand and forty  
 it 's still estimated
 that two hundred
  million people in china will not have access to clean cooking fuels  they have a remarkable path to follow 
 india also needs
 to meet the needs of its own people and it 's going to do that by burning coal when we look at the eia 's projections
  of coal burning
 in india india will supply nearly four times as much of its energy
 from coal as it will from renewables  
 it 's not because they don 't know the alternatives  it 's because rich countries can do what they choose  
 poor countries do what they must  
 so what can we do to stop coal 's emissions in time what can we do that changes
 this forecast that 's in front of us because it 's a forecast that we can change if we have the will to do it 
 first of all we have to think about the magnitude of the problem 
 between now and two thousand and forty  eight hundred to one thousand six hundred new coal plants are going to be built
 around the world 
  coal plants are being turned on around the world that 's
 happening regardless of what we want because the people that rule their countries 
 assessing the interests of their citizens have decided it 's in the interest of their citizens to do that 
 and that 's going to happen
 unless they have
  and every one hundred of those plants will use up between one percent
 and three percent
 of the earth 's climate budget  
 so every day that you go home thinking that you should do something about global warming 
 at the end of that week remember somebody fired up a coal plant
 that 's going to run for fifty years and take away your ability
  what we 've forgotten is something that vinod khosla used to talk about a man of indian ethnicity but an american venture capitalist  
 and he said back in the early 2000s that if you needed to get china and india off of fossil fuels  
 you had to create a technology that passed the chindia test 
 chindia being the appending of the two words  
 it had to be first of all viable  meaning that technically they could implement it in their country
  and that it would be accepted by the people in the country two it had to be
 a technology that was
 scalable that
 it could deliver the same benefits on the same timetable
 as fossil fuels  so that they can enjoy the kind of life again that we take for granted  and third it had to be
 without subsidy or without mandate  it had to stand on its own two feet it could not be maintained for that many people
 if in fact those countries had to go begging
 or had some foreign country say i won 't trade with you in order to get the technology shift to
  if you look at the chindia test  we simply have not come up with alternatives that meet that test 
 that 's what the eia forecast tells us 
 china 's building eight hundred gigawatts of coal four hundred gigawatts of hydro 
 about two hundred gigawatts of nuclear and on an energy equivalent basis adjusting
  about one hundred gigawatts of renewables 
 eight hundred gigawatts of coal  they 're doing that knowing the costs better than any other country  knowing the need better than any other country  
 but that 's what they 're aiming for in two thousand and forty unless we give them a better choice 
 to give them a better choice it 's going to have to meet the chindia test  if you look at all the alternatives that are out
  are really two that come near to meeting it 
 first is this area of new nuclear that i 'll talk about in just a second 
 it 's a new generation of nuclear plants that are on the drawing boards around the world and the people who are developing these say we can get them in position to demo by 
 and to scale by two thousand and thirty  if you will just let us  the second alternative that could be
  backed up with natural gas which we can use today  versus the batteries which are still under development 
 so what 's holding new nuclear back 
 outdated regulations and yesterday 's mindsets  
 we have not used our latest scientific thinking on radiological health to think how we communicate with the public and govern the testing of new nuclear reactors  we have new scientific
 that we need to use in order to improve the way we regulate nuclear industry  
 the second thing is we 've got a mindset that it takes twenty five years and two to five billion dollars to develop a nuclear power plant that comes from the historical 
 military mindset
 of the places nuclear power came from these new nuclear ventures are saying that they
  deliver power for five cents a kilowatt hour they can deliver it for one hundred gigawatts a year they can demo it by 
 and they can deliver it in scale by two thousand and thirty  if only we give them a chance  
 right now we 're basically waiting for a miracle what we need is a choice  if they can 't make it safe if they can 't make it cheap it should
  not be deployed  
 but what i want you to do is not carry an idea forward but write your leaders write the head of the ngos you support and tell them to give you the choice  
 not the past  thank you very much
