  i was here four years ago and i remember at the time that the talks weren 't put
 online  i think they were given to tedsters in a box a box set of dvds which they put on their shelves where they are now
  and actually chris called me a week after i 'd given my talk and said we 're going to start putting them online can we put yours online and i said sure 
 and four years later  it 's 
  been downloaded four million times  so i suppose you could multiply that by twenty or something to get the number of people who 've seen it and as chris says  there is a hunger
 for videos of me 
 don 't you feel 
 so this whole event has been an elaborate build up
 to me doing another one for you so here
 laughter al gore spoke at the ted conference i spoke at four years ago
 and
 talked about the climate crisis and i referenced that at the end of my last talk  so i want to pick up from there because i only had eighteen minutes frankly 
 so as i was saying
  he 's right i mean there is a major climate crisis  obviously  and i think if people don 't believe it they should get out more 
 laughter but i believe there is a second climate crisis  which is as severe
  which has the same origins and that we have to deal with with the same urgency  and 
  you may say by the way look i 'm good  i have one climate crisis  i don 't really need the second one 
 but this is a crisis of not natural resources though i believe that 's true
 but a crisis of human resources 
 i believe fundamentally as many speakers have said during the past few days that we make very poor use
  our talents 
 very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be or if they have any to speak of  
 i meet all kinds of people who
 don 't think they 're really good at anything actually  i kind of divide the world into two groups now  jeremy bentham the great
  once spiked this argument he said there are two types of people in this world those who divide the world into two types and those who do not well
 i do 
 i meet all kinds of people
 who don 't enjoy what they do they simply go through their lives getting on with it
  they get no great pleasure from what they do  they endure it rather than enjoy it and wait for the weekend  
 but i also meet people who love what they do
 and couldn 't imagine doing anything else if you said don 't do this anymore they 'd wonder what you 're talking about it isn 't what they do it 's who they are they say
  it would be foolish to abandon this because it speaks to my most authentic self and
 it 's not true of enough people in fact on the contrary i think it 's still true of a minority of people  
 and i think there are many possible explanations for it and high among them is education  
 because education in a way  dislocates very many people from their natural talents and human resources are like
  natural resources they 're often buried deep  
 you have to go looking for them they 're not just lying around on the surface  you have to create the circumstances where they show themselves  
 and you might imagine education would be the way that happens but too often it 's not 
 every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment
 and it 's not
  is no use anymore because that 's simply improving a broken model what we need and the word 's been used many times in the past few days
 is not evolution 
 but a revolution in education 
 this has to be transformed into something else 
 one of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education
  education  innovation is hard 
 because it means doing something that people don 't find very easy for the most part it means challenging what we take for granted 
 things that we think are obvious 
 the great problem for reform or transformation
 is the tyranny of common sense things
  i came across a great quote recently from abraham lincoln who i thought you 'd be pleased to have quoted at this point 
 laughter he said this in december one thousand eight hundred and sixty two to the second annual meeting of congress 
 i ought to explain that i have no idea what was happening at the time
  we don 't teach american history
  we suppress it  you know this is our policy laughter
 no doubt something fascinating was happening 
  which the americans among us
 will be aware of but he said this the dogmas of the quiet past
 are inadequate to the stormy present the occasion is piled high with difficulty  and we must
  rise with the occasion i love that not rise to it  rise with it 
 as our case is new so we must think anew
 and act anew we must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country 
  you know what it means that there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to 
 which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things the way things are 
 and many of our ideas have been formed not to meet the circumstances of this century  but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries but our minds are still hypnotized by them  
 and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them
  doing this is easier said than done it 's very hard to know by the way what it is you take for granted  and the reason is that you take it for granted laughter
 let me ask you something you may take for granted how many of you here are over the age of twenty five 
 that 's not what you take for granted i 'm sure you 're familiar with that are
 there any people here under the age of twenty five great now  those over twenty five could you put your hands up if you 're wearing your wristwatch 
 now that 's a great deal of us
 isn 't it ask a room full of teenagers the same thing 
 teenagers do not wear wristwatches  i don 't mean they can 't they just often choose not to 
 and the reason is we were brought up in a pre digital culture those of us over twenty five and so for us if you want to know the time you have to wear something to tell it  
 kids now live in a world which is digitized and the time for them is everywhere  they see no reason
  to do this and by the way you don 't need either it 's just that you 've always done it
 and you carry on doing it  my daughter never wears a watch my daughter kate who 's twenty she doesn 't see the point as she says
  there are things we 're enthralled to in education  a couple of examples one of them is the idea of linearity 
 that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right you will end up
 set for the rest of your life 
 everybody who 's spoken
  at ted has told us implicitly or sometimes explicitly a different story  that life is not linear it 's organic 
 we create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us 
 but you know  we have become obsessed with this linear narrative and probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college  
 i think we are obsessed with getting people to college
  certain sorts of college i don 't mean you shouldn 't go but not everybody needs to go or go now  maybe they go later  not right away and
 i was up in san francisco a while ago doing a book signing there
 was this guy buying a book
  it was a problem for me at school because at school  everybody wanted to be a fireman he said 
 but i wanted to be a fireman  
 and he said when i got to the senior year of school
  my teachers didn 't take it seriously this one teacher didn 't take it seriously  he said i was throwing my life away
 i chose to do with it 
 that i should go to college i should become a professional person that i had great potential and i was wasting my talent to do that 
 he said it was humiliating it was in front of the whole class and i felt dreadful  but it 's what i wanted and as soon as i left school  i applied to the fire service and i was accepted  
 you know i was thinking about that guy recently just a few minutes ago when you were speaking about this teacher because six months ago  i saved his
  he was in a car wreck  and i pulled him out gave him cpr  and i saved his wife 's life as well he said i think he thinks better of me
  and at the heart of our challenges 
 at the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence 
 this linearity thing is a problem 
 when i arrived in l a about nine years ago  i came across a
 policy statement
  if we had time i could go into this but we don
  as we just heard in this last session there 's such competition now to get into kindergarten to get to the right kindergarten that people are being interviewed for it
 at three  
 kids sitting in front of
  the other big issue is conformity  we have built our education systems on the model of fast food 
 this is something jamie oliver talked about the other day  there are two models of quality assurance in catering one is fast food where everything is
  like zagat and michelin restaurants where everything is not standardized  they 're customized to local circumstances and we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education and it 's impoverishing 
 our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies 
 applause we have to recognize a couple of things here one is
  that human talent is tremendously diverse people have very different aptitudes i worked out recently that i was given a guitar
 as a kid at about the same time that eric clapton got his first guitar 
 laughter it worked out for eric that 's all i 'm saying in a way
 it did not for me i could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard i blew into it
  it 's not only about that it 's about passion 
 often people are good at things they don 't really care for 
 it 's about passion  and what excites our spirit and our energy and if you 're doing the thing that you love to do that you 're good at 
 time takes a different course entirely 
 my wife 's just finished writing a novel  and
 i think it 's a great book  but she disappears for hours on end  you know this if you 're doing something you love an hour feels like five minutes 
 if you 're doing something that doesn 't resonate with your spirit  five minutes feels like an hour 
 and the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn 't feed their spirit  it doesn 't feed their energy or their passion  so i think we have to change metaphors  
 we have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education a manufacturing model which
  is based on linearity and conformity and batching people we have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture 
 we have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process  it 's an organic process  
 and you cannot predict the outcome of human development all you can do like a farmer is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish
 so when we look at reforming education and transforming it  it isn 't like cloning a system  there are great ones like kipp 's it 's a great system  there are many great
 models  it 's about customizing to your circumstances and personalizing education to the people you 're actually teaching  
 and doing that i think is the answer to the future because
 it 's not about scaling a new solution  it 's about creating a
  movement in education
 in which people develop their own solutions  but with external support based on a personalized curriculum now in this room there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business in multimedia 
 in the internet these technologies  combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers provide an opportunity to revolutionize education and i urge you to get involved
 because it 's vital not just to ourselves but to the future of our children but we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model where each school can be flourishing
  tomorrow that 's where children experience life or at home if that 's what they choose to be educated with their families or friends  
  and i wanted to just very quickly
 i was very struck by natalie merchant 's songs last night recovering old poems i wanted to read you a quick very short poem from w b yeats who some of you may know  
 he wrote this to his
 love maud gonne  and he was
 bewailing the fact that he couldn 't really give her what he thought she wanted from him  and he says i 've got something else but it may not be for you he says this
  heavens ' embroidered cloths enwrought with gold and silver light 
 the blue and the dim and the dark cloths of night and light and the half light 
 i would spread the cloths under your feet  
 but i being poor have only my dreams i have spread my dreams
 under your feet
 tread softly
 because you tread on my dreams 
 and every day  everywhere our children spread their dreams beneath our feet  and we should tread softly
