  it was run by the great and powerful parents  and the people were helpless and hopeless naughty children 
 if any of the more rowdier children questioned the authority of the parents
 they were scolded 
 if they went exploring into the parents ' rooms  or even into the secret filing cabinets  they were punished  
 and told that for their own good they must never go in there again 
 then one day a man came to town with boxes and boxes of secret documents stolen from the parents ' rooms look what they 've been hiding from you
  said 
 the children looked and were amazed there were maps and minutes from meetings where the parents were slagging each other off  
 they behaved just like the children  
 and they made mistakes too just like the children  
 the only difference was their mistakes were in the secret filing cabinets  
 well there was a girl in the town
  and she didn 't think they should be in the secret filing cabinets  
 or if they were there ought to be a law to allow the children access and so she set about to make it so
  well  i 'm the girl in that story and the secret documents that i was interested in were located in this building the british
  data that i wanted to get my hands on were the expense receipts of members of parliament  
 i thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy 
 it wasn 't like i was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker or anything like that but the amount of resistance i got from this
 freedom of information request  you would have thought i 'd asked something
  i fought for about five years doing this  and it was it was one of many hundreds of requests that i made not i didn 't hey look i didn 't set out honestly to revolutionize the british parliament 
 that was not my intention i was just making these requests as part of research for my first book  
  high court judges waiting for their ruling about whether or not parliament had to release this data  
 and i 've got to tell you i wasn 't that hopeful because i 'd seen the establishment i thought it always sticks together i am out of luck 
 well guess what i won hooray 
 well  that 's not exactly the story because the problem was that parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data
  and then they tried to retrospectively change the law so that it would no longer apply to them  
 the transparency law they 'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else they tried to keep it so it didn 't apply to them 
 what they hadn 't counted on was digitization  
 because that meant that all those paper receipts had been scanned in electronically  and it was very easy for somebody to just copy that entire database 
  disk  and then just saunter outside of parliament which they did  and then they shopped that disk to the highest bidder which was the daily telegraph  and then you all remember 
 there was weeks and weeks of revelations everything from porn movies and bath plugs and new kitchens and mortgages that had never been paid off
  the end result was
 six ministers resigned  the first speaker of the house in three hundred years was forced to resign 
 a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency one hundred and twenty mps stepped down at that election  and
 so far four mps and two lords have done jail time for fraud
  tell you that story because it wasn 't unique to britain it was an example of a culture clash that 's happening all over the world between bewigged and bestockinged 
 officials who think that they can rule over us without very much prying from the public  and then suddenly confronted
  public who is no longer content with that arrangement  
 and not only not content with it now more often  armed with official data itself  
 so we are moving to this democratization of information  and i 've been in this field for quite a while  slightly embarrassing admission 
 even when i was a kid i used to have these little spy books and i would like see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down i think that was a pretty good indication about my future
  career as an investigative journalist  
 and what i 've seen from from being in this access to information field for so long is that it used to be quite a niche a niche interest  and it 's gone mainstream everybody increasingly 
 around the world wants to know about what people in power are doing they want a say in decisions that are made in their name
  and it has many of the same principles of the first enlightenment  
 it 's about searching for the truth not because somebody says it 's true because i say so no it 's about trying to find the truth based on what you can see and what can be tested 
 that in the first enlightenment led to questions about the right of kings  the divine right of kings to rule over people or that women should be subordinate to men or that the church was
  the official word of god  
 obviously the church weren 't very happy about this  and they tried to suppress it 
 but what they hadn 't counted on was technology  and then they had the printing press which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply far and fast 
 and people would come together in coffee houses discuss the ideas plot revolution
  in our day we have digitization that strips all the physical mass out of information so now it 's almost zero cost to copy and share information 
 our printing press is the internet our coffee houses are social networks we
 're moving to what i would think of as a fully connected system  
 and we have global decisions to make in this system decisions about climate about finance systems about resources 
 and think about it if we want to make an important decision about
  buying a house we don 't just go off  
 i mean i don 't know about you but i want to see a lot of houses before i put that much money into it and if we 're thinking about a finance system  we need a lot of information to take in it 's just not possible
 for one person to take in the amount the volume of information and analyze it to make good decisions 
 so that 's why we 're seeing increasingly this demand for access to information
  that 's why we 're starting to see more disclosure laws come out so for example on the environment there 's the aarhus convention which is a european directive that gives people a very strong right to know  so if your water company is dumping water
 into your river  sewage water into your river  you have a right to know about it 
 in the finance industry you now have more of a right to know about what 's going on so we have different
 anti bribery laws money regulations  increased corporate disclosure so you can now track assets across borders  and it 's getting harder to hide
 assets  tax avoidance pay inequality  so that 's great we 're starting to find out more and more about these systems  
 and they 're all moving to this central
  this fully connected system 
 all of them except one can you guess which one  
 it 's the system which underpins all these other systems  it 's the system by which we organize and exercise power and there i 'm talking about politics  because in politics we 're back to this system this  top down hierarchy  
 and how is it possible that the volume of information can be processed that needs to in this
  that 's it  and i think this is largely what 's behind the crisis of legitimacy in our
 in our different governments right now 
 so i 've told you a bit about what i did to try and drag parliament kicking and screaming into the 21st century  and i 'm just going to give you a couple of examples of what a few other people i know are doing  
 so this is a guy called seb bacon he 's a computer programmer
  and he built a site called alaveteli  
 and what it is 
 it 's a freedom of information platform it 's open source with documentation  and it allows you to make a freedom of information request 
 to ask your public body a question so
 it takes all the hassle out of it  and i can tell you that there is a lot of hassle making these requests so it takes all of that hassle out 
 and you just type in your question for example how many police officers have a criminal record
 it zooms it off to the appropriate person
  it tells you when the time limit is coming to an end it keeps track of all the correspondence it posts it up there and it becomes an archive of public knowledge  
 so that 's open source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of freedom of information law so there 's a list there of the different countries that have it  and then there 's a few more coming on board
  of you out there like the sound of that and have a law like that in your country i know that seb would love to hear from you about collaborating and and getting that into your country 
 this is birgitta jnsdttir she 's an icelandic mp  
 and quite an unusual mp in iceland she was one of the protesters who was outside of parliament
 when
  collapsed  and then she was elected
 on a reform mandate and she 's now spearheading this project it 's the icelandic modern media initiative  and they 've just got funding to make it an international modern media 
  project and this is taking all of the best laws around the world about freedom of expression protection of
  source protection and trying to make iceland a publishing haven 
 it 's a place where your data can be free so when we think about increasingly how governments want to access user data what they 're trying to do in iceland is make this safe haven where it can happen 
 in my own field of investigative journalism we 're also having to start thinking globally so this is a site called investigative dashboard
  if you 're trying to track a dictator 's assets for example hosni mubarak 
 you know he 's just funneling out cash from his country when he knows he 's in trouble and what you want to do to investigate that is you need to have access to all of the world 's as many as you can 
 companies ' house registrations databases  so this is a website that tries to
 agglomerate all of those databases into one place so you can start
  his relatives his friends the head of his security services you can try and find out how he 's moving out assets from that country  
 but again when it comes to
 the decisions which are impacting us the most perhaps the most important decisions
 that are being made about war and so forth again we can 't just make a freedom of information request it 's really difficult  so we 're still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information through leaks
  so when the guardian did this investigation about the afghan war you know they can 't walk into the department of defense
 and and ask for all the information you know they 're just not going to get it so this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches that were written by american soldiers
 about the afghan war and leaked  and then they 're able to do this investigation
  rather large investigation
 is around world diplomacy  again this is all based around leaks two hundred and fifty one thousand u s diplomatic cables  
 and i was involved in this investigation because
 i got this leak
 through a leak from a disgruntled wikileaker
  ended up going to work at the guardian  
 so i can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access to this leak it was amazing i mean it was amazing it reminded me of that scene in the wizard of oz do you know the one i mean where the 
 little dog toto runs across to where the wizard [ is ] and he pulls back the dog 's pulling back the curtain and don 't look behind the screen don 't look at the man behind the screen it was just like that because what you started to see is that all of these grand statesmen
  they were just like us  they all bitched about each other i mean  quite gossipy those cables 
 okay but i thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp these are human beings just like us they don 't have special powers they 're not magic they are not our parents
  beyond that what i found most
 fascinating was the level of endemic corruption that i saw across all different countries  and particularly centered around the heart of power
 around public officials who were embezzling the public 's money for their own personal enrichment and allowed to do that because of official secrecy  
 so i 've mentioned wikileaks  because surely what could be more open than publishing all the material
 because that that is what julian assange did he wasn 't content with the way the newspapers published it to be safe and legal he threw it
 all out there that did end up with
 vulnerable people in afghanistan being exposed it also meant that the belarussian dictator was given a handy list of all the pro democracy campaigners in that country who had spoken to the u s government 
 is that radical openness i say it 's not because for me what it means it doesn 't mean abdicating power responsibility
 accountability it 's actually being a partner with power  it 's about sharing responsibility  sharing accountability  
 also the fact that he threatened to sue me because i got a leak of his leaks i thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency in ideology to be honest as well 
 laughs the other thing is that power is incredibly seductive and you must have two real qualities  i think
  you come to the table 
 when you 're dealing with power talking about power because of its seductive capacity you 've
 got to have skepticism and humility 
 skepticism  because you must always be challenging i want to see why do you you just say so that 's not good enough i want to see the evidence behind why that 's so 
 and humility because we are all human we all
  and if you don 't have skepticism and humility then it 's a really short journey to go from reformer to autocrat  
 and i think you you only have to read animal farm to get that message
 about how power corrupts people 
 so what is the solution  
 it is i believe to embody within the rule of law rights to information at the moment our rights are incredibly weak
 in a lot of countries we have official secrets acts including in britain here we have an official secrets act with no public interest test so that means it 's a crime people
 are punished quite severely in a lot of cases for
 publishing or giving away official information 
 now wouldn 't it be amazing  and really this is what i want all of you to think about if we had an official disclosure act where officials
 were punished if they were found to have suppressed or hidden information that was in the public interest  so that yes yes 
 my power pose 
 i would like us to work towards that so it 's not all bad news i mean there
  progress on the line but i think what we find is that the closer that we get right into the heart of power  
 the more opaque  closed it becomes so it was only just the other week that i heard london 's metropolitan police commissioner
 talking about why the police need access to all of our communications  
 spying on us without any judicial oversight  and he said it was a matter of life and death he actually said that it was a matter of life and death
 there was no evidence he presented no evidence of that it was just because i say so 
 you have to trust me take it on faith well i 'm sorry people but we are back to the pre enlightenment church 
 and we need to fight against that 
 so he was talking about the law in britain which is the communications data
  bill an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation in america you have the cyber intelligence sharing and protection act you 've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance 
  you have the national security agency building the world 's giantest spy center it 's just this colossal it 's five times bigger than the u s capitol in which they 're going to intercept
