  billion people in the world today do not have access to all season roads one billion people one seventh of the earth 's population
 are totally cut off for some part of the year  we cannot get medicine to them reliably  they cannot get critical supplies
  they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income 
 in sub saharan africa for instance eighty five percent of roads are unusable in the wet season 
 investments are being made  but at the current level  it 's estimated it 's going to take them fifty years to catch up 
  there 's more than four million miles of roads  
 very expensive to build very expensive to maintain infrastructure with a huge ecological footprint  and yet very often  congested
 so we saw this and we thought  can there be a better way can we create a system using today 's most advanced technologies
 that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way they 've done with mobile telephones in the last ten years many of those nations
  have excellent telecommunications today without ever putting copper lines in the ground  could we do the same for transportation  
 imagine this scenario  
 imagine you are in a maternity ward in mali  and have a newborn in need of urgent medication  what would you do today  
 well you would place a request via mobile phone  and someone would get the request immediately that 's
  part that works the medication may take days to arrive though because of bad roads that 's the part that 's broken  we believe we can deliver it within hours
 with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this 
 this can transport a small payload today about two kilograms over a short distance about ten kilometers but it 's part
  a wider network that may cover the entire country maybe even the entire continent  it 's an ultra flexible automated logistics network  
 it 's a network for a transportation of matter  we call it matternet  
 we use three key technologies the first is electric autonomous flying vehicles 
 the second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and
  or pick up or deliver loads and the third is the operating system that manages the whole network  
 let 's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail first of all 
 the uavs eventually we 're going to be using all sorts of vehicles for different payload capacities and different ranges today  we 're using small quads  
 these are able to transport two kilograms over ten kilometers in just about fifteen minutes  compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world or even being stuck in traffic
 in a developed world country  
 these fly autonomously this is the key to the technology  so they use gps and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations 
 every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations
  they dock swap a battery automatically and go out again 
 the ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground  they secure the most vulnerable part of the mission which is the landing 
 they are at known locations on the ground so the paths between them are also known which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network  
 apart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles  eventually they 're going to be becoming commercial hubs where people can take out loads or put loads into the network
 the last component is the operating system that manages the whole network 
 it monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system
 to avoid adverse weather conditions  avoid other risk factors  and optimize the use of the resources throughout the network  
 i want to show you what one of those flights looks like 
 here we are flying
  in haiti last summer where we 've done our first field trials  we 're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the two thousand and ten earthquake 
 people there love this 
 and i want to show you
 what one of those vehicles looks like up close  so this is a $ three thousand vehicle  costs are coming down very rapidly
  we use this in all sorts of weather conditions  
 very hot and very cold climates very strong winds they 're very sturdy vehicles  
 imagine if your life depended on this package somewhere in africa or in new york city
  after sandy 
 the next big question is what 's the cost  well 
 it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over ten kilometers with this vehicle
 is just 
 's counterintuitive  but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today  and we 're just at the beginning of this
 when we saw this we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world so
 okay how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world and we looked at setting up a network in lesotho for transportation of hiv aids samples
  the problem there is how do you take them from clinics where they 're being collected
 to hospitals where they 're being analyzed  and we said what if we wanted to cover
  an area spanning around one hundred and forty square kilometers that 's roughly one and a half times the size of manhattan  
 well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars  
 compare this to normal infrastructure investments we think this can be
 this is the power of a new paradigm
  here we are a new idea about a network for transportation that is based on the ideas of the internet  
 it 's decentralized  it 's peer to peer it 's bidirectional highly adaptable with very low infrastructure investment very low ecological footprint  
 if it is a new paradigm though  
 there must be other uses for it it can be used perhaps in other places in the world so let 's look at the other end of the spectrum
  our cities and megacities  
 half of the earth 's population lives in cities today  
 half a billion of us live in megacities  we are living through an amazing urbanization trend  china alone is adding a megacity the size of new york city every two years  
 these are places that do have road infrastructure  but it 's very inefficient  congestion is a huge problem  so we think it makes sense in those places to
  set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the internet  initially for lightweight urgent stuff  
 and over time  we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation
 that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem  it 's ultimately scalable with a very
 small ecological footprint  operating in the background
 so
 when we started this a couple of years ago now 
 we 've had a lot of people come up to us who said this is a very interesting but crazy idea  and certainly not something that you should engage with
 anytime soon 
 and of course we 're talking about drones right a technology that 's not only unpopular in the west but one that has become a very very unpleasant fact of life for
  many living in poor countries especially those engaged in conflict  so why are we doing this  
 well  we chose to do this one
 not because it 's easy  
 but because it can have amazing impact  
 imagine one billion people being connected to physical goods in the same way that mobile telecommunications connected them
  imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter 
 in the developing world  we would hope to reach millions of people with better vaccines 
 reach them with better medication it would give us an unfair advantage against battling hiv aids tuberculosis
  we would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions
 lifting millions of people out of poverty 
 in the developed world and the emerging world  we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable
 so for those that still believe that this is science fiction i firmly say to you that it is not 
 we do need to engage though in social fiction to make it happen
