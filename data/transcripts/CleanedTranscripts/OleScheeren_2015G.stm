  for much of the past century architecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine 
 form follows function had become modernity 's ambitious manifesto and detrimental straitjacket as it liberated
  from the decorative but condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose 
 of course architecture is about function 
 but i want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by bernard tschumi  and i want to propose a completely different quality  
 if form follows fiction 
 we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories stories of the people that live there of the people that work in these buildings
  and we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create in this sense i 'm interested in fiction not as the implausible
 but as the real as the reality of what architecture means for the people that live in it and with it 
 our buildings are prototypes  ideas for how the space of living or how the space of working could be different and what a space of culture
  or a space of media could look like today 
 our buildings are real they 're being built they 're an explicit engagement in physical reality and conceptual possibility 
 i think of our architecture as organizational structures at their core is indeed structural thinking like a system 
 how can we arrange things in both a functional and experiential way
 how can we create structures that generate a series of relationships and narratives 
 and how can fictive stories of the inhabitants and users of our buildings script the architecture 
 while the architecture scripts those stories at the same time  
 and here comes the second term into play what i call
  of multiple simultaneous stories that unfold throughout the buildings we create  so we could think of architecture
 as complex systems of relationships both in a programmatic and functional way
 and
 in an experiential and emotive or social way 
 this is the headquarters for china 's national broadcaster which i designed together with rem koolhaas at oma when i first arrived in
  beijing in two thousand and two the city planners showed us this image  a forest of several hundred skyscrapers to emerge in the central business district  except at that time only a handful of them existed  
 so we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about except one thing it would all be about verticality 
 of course the skyscraper is vertical
 it 's a profoundly hierarchical structure the top always the best the bottom the worst and
 the taller you are the better so it seems  
 and we wanted to ask ourselves could a building be about a completely different quality could it undo this hierarchy  
 and could it be about a system that is more about collaboration rather than isolation so we took this needle and bent it back into itself into a loop of interconnected activities 
 our idea was to bring all aspects of
 into one single structure news program production broadcasting research and training administration all into a circuit of interconnected activities where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration 
 i still very much like this image it reminds one of biology classes if you remember the human body with all
  organs and circulatory systems like at school and suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance but as an organism as a life form 
 and as you start to dissect this organism you can identify a series of primary technical clusters
 program production broadcasting center and news those are tightly intertwined with social clusters meeting rooms  canteens
  chat areas informal spaces for people to meet and exchange 
 so the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid between the technical and the social the human and the performative 
 and of course we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity 
 with four hundred and seventy three thousand square meters
 it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world 
 it has a population of over ten thousand people and of course this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension of many things and the scale of typical architecture  so we stopped work 
  for a while and sat down and cut ten thousand little sticks and glued them onto a model just simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant  
  is
 the people it is a community that inhabits the building  and in order to both comprehend this but also script this architecture we identified five characters hypothetical characters  and we followed them throughout their day
 in a life in this building  
 thought of where they would meet what they would experience  so it was a way to script and design the building but of course also to communicate its experiences
 this was part of an exhibition with the museum of modern art in both new york and beijing 
 this is the main broadcast control room  a technical installation so large it can broadcast over two hundred channels simultaneously  
 and this is how the building stands
 in beijing today its first broadcast live was the london olympics two thousand and twelve after it had been completed from the
  outside for the beijing olympics  
 and you can see at the very tip of this 75 meter cantilever those three little circles and they 're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building they
 're a piece of glass that you can stand on and watch the city pass by below you in slow motion 
 the building has become part of everyday life in beijing it is there
  it has also become a very popular backdrop for wedding photography 
 but its its most important moment is is maybe sill this one that 's beijing is similar to time out a magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the
  and suddenly you see the building portrayed no longer as physical matter  but actually as an urban actor as part of a series of personas that define the life of the city 
 so architecture suddenly assumes the quality
 of a player of something that writes stories and performs stories and i think that
 could be one of of its primary meanings
 that we believe in but of course there 's another story
  to this building it is the story of the people that made it four hundred engineers and architects that i was guiding over almost a decade of collaborative work that we spent together in scripting this building 
 in imagining its reality and ultimately getting it built
 in china 
 this is a residential development in singapore large scale if we look
  at singapore like most of asia and more and more of the world of course  it is dominated by the tower 
 a typology that indeed creates more isolation than connectedness  and i wanted to ask how could we think about living not only in terms of the privacy and individuality of ourselves and our apartment
  in an idea of a collective 
 how could we think about creating a communal environment in which sharing things was as great as having your own 
 the typical answer to the question we had to design one thousand and forty apartments would have looked like this 24 story height limit given by the planning authorities twelve towers with nothing but residual in between
 a very tight system that although the tower isolates you it doesn 't even give you privacy because you 're so close to the
  next one that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be 
 so i proposed to topple the towers  throw the vertical into the horizontal and stack them up 
 and what looks a bit random from the side if you look from the viewpoint of the helicopter you can see its organizational structure is actually a hexagonal grid in which these horizontal building blocks are stacked up
 to create huge outdoor courtyards central spaces for the community programmed with a variety of amenities and functions  
 and you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces they 're open permeable they 're interconnected we called the project the interlace 
 thinking that we interlace and interconnect
 the human beings and the spaces alike and the
  quality of everything we designed was about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants and in fact it was a system where we would layer
 primarily communal spaces stacked to more and more individual and private spaces  so we would open up a spectrum between
 the collective and the individual a little piece of math  if we count all the green that we left on the ground
  minus the footprint of the buildings  
 and we would add back the green of all the terraces  we have one hundred and twelve percent green space so more nature than not having built a building 
 and of course this little piece of math shows you that we are multiplying the space available to those who live there 
 this is in fact the 13th floor of one of these terraces so you see new datum planes new grounds planes for social
 we paid a lot of attention
 to sustainability in the tropics the sun is the most important thing to pay attention to and in fact it is seeking protection from the sun  
 we first proved that all apartments would have sufficient daylight through the year  
 we then went on to optimize the glazing of the facades to minimize the energy consumption of the building  
 but most importantly we could prove
  that through the geometry of the building design 
 the building itself would provide sufficient shading to the courtyards so that those would be usable throughout the entire year  we further placed water bodies along the prevailing wind corridors 
  so that evaporative cooling would create microclimates that again would enhance the quality of those spaces available
 this variety of choices of freedom
 to think where you would want to be where you would want to escape maybe  within the own complexity of the complex in which you live 
 but coming from asia to europe a building for a german media company based in berlin  
 transitioning from the traditional print media to the digital media
  its ceo asked a few very pertinent questions  
 why would anyone today still want to go to the office because you can actually work anywhere and how could a digital identity of a company be embodied
 in a building we created not only an object but at the center of this object we created a giant space and this
  was about the experience of a collective the experience of collaboration and of togetherness  communication interaction
 as the center of a space that in itself
 would float like what we call the collaborative cloud in the middle of the building  surrounded by an envelope of standard modular offices  
 so with only a few steps from your quiet work desk you could participate in the giant collective experience of the central space
 finally  we come to london 
 a project commissioned by the london legacy development corporation of the mayor of london 
 we were asked to undertake a study and investigate the potential of a site out in stratford in the olympic park in the 19th century  prince
  the idea was to bring together some of britain 's greatest institutions some international ones and to create a new system of synergies  
 prince albert as yet created albertopolis in the 19th century  thought of showcasing all achievements of mankind bringing arts and science closer
  and he built exhibition road  a linear sequence of those institutions  
 but of course  today 's society has moved on from there  we no longer live in a world in which everything is as clearly delineated or separated from each other  we live in a world in which
 boundaries start to blur between the different domains and in which collaboration and interaction becomes far more important
  so we wanted to think of a giant culture machine a building that would orchestrate and animate
 the various domains but allow them to interact and collaborate 
 at the base of it is a very simple module  a ring module  it can function as a double loaded corridor has daylight has ventilation  it can be glazed over and turned into a giant exhibitional performance
  these modules were stacked together with the idea that almost any function could over time  occupy any of these modules so institutions could shrink or contract 
 as of course  the future of culture is in a way the most uncertain of all 
 this is how the building sits  adjacent to the aquatics centre opposite the olympic stadium  and you can see how its
  project out and engage the public space and how its courtyards animate the public inside 
 the idea was to create a complex system in which institutional entities could maintain their own identity 
 in which they would not be subsumed in a singular volume here 's a scale comparison to the centre pompidou in paris 
 of a heterogeneous structure in which different entities can interact without losing their own identity  
 and it was this thought to create an organizational structure that would allow for multiple narratives to be scripted for those in the educational parts that
 create
 and think
  for those that present the visual arts the dance and for the public to be admitted into all of this with a series of possible trajectories to script their own reading of these narratives and their own experience  
 and i want to end on a project
 that is very small in a way very different a floating cinema in the ocean of thailand friends of mine had founded
 a film festival  and i thought  if we think of
  the stories and narratives of movies  we should also think of the narratives of the people that watch them 
 so i designed a small modular floating platform 
 based on the techniques of local fishermen how they built their lobster and fish farms we collaborated with the local community
 and built out of recycled materials of their own this fantastical floating platform that gently moved in the ocean as we watched films
  films from the british film archive [ one thousand nine hundred and three ] alice in wonderland for example 
 the most primordial experiences of the audience merged with the stories of the movies  
 so i believe that architecture exceeds the domain of physical matter of the built environment but is really about how we want to live our lives how we script our own stories and those of others
