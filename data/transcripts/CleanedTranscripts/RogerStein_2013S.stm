  so this is a picture of
 my dad and me at the beach
 in far rockaway or actually rockaway park i 'm the one with the blond hair 
 my dad 's the guy with the cigarette it was the sixty 's a lot of people smoked back then in the summer of two thousand and nine
  dad was diagnosed with lung cancer 
 cancer is one of those things that actually touches everybody 
 if you 're a man in the us you 've got about a one in two chance
 of being diagnosed with cancer during your lifetime if you 're a woman you 've got about a one in three chance of being diagnosed with cancer  
 everybody knows somebody who 's been diagnosed with cancer
  my dad 's doing better today and part of the reason for that is that he was able to participate in the trial of an experimental new drug
 that happened to be specially formulated and very good for his particular kind of cancer there are over two hundred kinds of cancer 
 and what i want to talk about today is how we can help more people like my dad
  change the way we think about raising money
 to fund cancer research 
 so a while after my dad was diagnosed i was having coffee with my friend andrew lo he
 's the head of the laboratory for financial engineering at mit where i also have a position  
 and we were talking about cancer and andrew had been doing his own bits of research and one of the things that he had been told and that he 'd learned from
 studying the the literature
 was that there 's actually a big bottleneck  it 's very difficult
  to develop new drugs  and the reason it 's difficult to develop new drugs is because in the early stages of drug development the drugs are very risky  and they 're very expensive  
 so andrew asked me if i 'd want to maybe work with him a bit work on some of the math and the analytics and see if we could figure out something we could do
  now i 'm not a scientist you know i don 't know how to build a drug
  and none of my coauthors andrew lo or jose maria fernandez or david  fagnan none of those guys
 are scientists either we don 't know the first thing about how to
 make a cancer drug  but we know a little bit about risk mitigation and a little bit about financial engineering and so we started thinking what could we do i 'm
 going to tell you about some work we 've been doing over the last couple years
 that we think could fundamentally change the way
 research for cancer and lots of other things gets done we want to let the
  research drive the funding not the other way around so in order to get started let me tell you how you get a drug financed  imagine that you 're in your lab
 you 're a scientist you 're not like me  and you 've developed a new new compound that you think might be therapeutic for for somebody with cancer well 
 what you do is  you test in animals you test in test
  but there 's this notion of going from the bench to the bedside and in order to get from the bench the lab to the bedside to the patients  you 've got to get the drug tested 
 and the way the drug gets tested is through a series of 
 basically experiments through these large they 're called trials that they do to determine whether the drug is safe and whether it works and all these things 
 so the fda has a very specific protocol in the first phase of this testing which is called testing for
  in the first phase you give the drug to healthy people and you see if it actually makes them sick in other
 words are the side effects just so severe that no matter how much good it does it 's not
 going to be worth it does it cause heart attacks kill people liver failure and it turns out that 's a pretty high hurdle 
 about a third of all drugs drop out at that point  
 in the next phase you test to see if the drug 's effective  
 and
  makes them better and that 's also a higher hurdle people drop out and in the third phase you test it on a very large sample and you 're trying to determine what the right dose is 
 is it better than what 's available today if not then why build it 
 when you 're done with all that what you have is a very small percentage of drugs that start the process actually come out the other side 
 so those blue bottles those blue bottles save lives
  and they 're also worth billions  sometimes billions a year  
 so now here 's a question if i were to ask you 
 for example to make a one time investment of say two hundred million dollars
 to buy one of those bottles  so two hundred million dollars up front one time to buy one of those bottles i won 't tell you which one it is and
 in ten years i 'll tell you whether you have one of the blue ones does
 that sound like a good
  and of course it 's a very very risky trial position and that 's why it 's very hard to get funding but to a first approximation that 's actually the proposal  
 you have to fund these things from the early stages on it takes a long time  
 so andrew said to me he said what if we stop thinking about these as drugs what if we start thinking about them as financial assets 
 they 've got really weird payoff structures and all that but
 's throw everything we know about financial engineering at them let 's see if we can use all the tricks of the trade to figure out how to make these drugs
 work as financial assets 
 let 's create a giant fund  
 in finance we know what to do with assets that are risky you put them in a portfolio and you try to smooth out the returns  so we did some math and it turned out you could make this work  
 but in order to make it work you need about eighty to one hundred and fifty drugs now the good news is there 's plenty of drugs that are waiting to be tested  we 've been told that there 's a backlog
  about twenty years of drugs
 that are waiting to be tested but can 't be funded 
 in fact that early stage of the funding process that phase i and preclinical stuff  that 's actually in the industry called the valley of death because it 's where drugs go to die  
 it 's very hard to for them to get through there and of course if you can 't get through there you can 't get to the the later stages  
 so we did this math
  that 's a fund of about three to fifteen billion dollars  
 so we kind of created a new problem by solving the old one 
 we got rid of the risk but now we need a lot of capital and you can only get that kind of capital in the capital markets  venture capitalists and philanthropies don 't have it  
 but we have to figure out how to get people in the capital markets who traditionally don 't invest in this to want to invest in this stuff
  financial engineering was helpful here  imagine the megafund starts empty and
 what it does is it issues some debt and some equity and that generates cash flow 
 that cash flow is used then to buy that big portfolio of drugs that you need 
 and those drugs start working their way through that approval process  and each time they go through a phase of approval they gain value  most of them don 't make it  but a few of them do  
 and with the ones that gain value  you can sell some
 and when you sell them you have money to pay the interest on those bonds but also to fund the next round of trials it 's almost self funding 
 you do that for the course of the transaction
 and when you 're done  you liquidate the portfolio pay back the bonds and you can
 give the equity holders a nice return that was the theory  and we talked about it we did a bunch of experiments and then we said let 's really try to test it  
 we spent the next two years doing research
  research  we talked to hundreds of experts in drug financing and venture capital  we talked to people who have developed drugs we talked to pharmaceutical companies 
 we actually looked at the data for drugs 
 over two thousand drugs that had been approved or denied or withdrawn  
 and we also ran millions of simulations 
 and all that actually took a lot of time
  it was feasible to structure that fund such that when you were done structuring it you could actually produce low risk bonds
 that would be attractive to bond holders that would give you yields of about five to eight percent  and you could produce equity
 that would give equity holders about a twelve percent return now those returns aren 't going to be attractive to a venture capitalist they want to make those big bets and get those billion dollar payoffs  
 but it turns out there are lots of other folks that would be
  interested that 's right in the investment sweet spot of pension funds
 and four hundred and one plans and all this other stuff  so we published some articles in the academic press in
 medical journals in finance journals  but it wasn 't until we actually got the popular press interested in this that we
 began to get some traction  we wanted to do more than just make people aware of it we wanted people to get involved
  computer code and made that available online under an open source license to anybody that wanted it and you guys can download it today
 if you want to run your own experiments to see if this would work and that was really effective because people that didn 't believe our assumptions
 could try their own and see how it would work now there
 's an obvious problem which is is there enough money in the world to fund this i 've told you there 's enough drugs  but is there enough money 
 there 's one hundred trillion dollars
  dollars of capital currently invested in fixed income securities  that 's a hundred thousand billion there
 's plenty of money 
 but we realized it 's more than just money that 's required we had to get people motivated involved and get them to understand
 this and we started thinking about all the different things that could go wrong what are all the challenges
  that might get in the way and
 we had a long list we assigned a bunch of people including ourselves different pieces of this problem  
 and we said could you start a work stream on credit risk could you start a work stream on the regulatory aspects could you start a work stream on
 how you would manage so many projects and we had all these experts get together and do these
  and then we held a conference the conference was held over this past summer it was 
  was sponsored by the american cancer society and done in collaboration with the
 national cancer institute 
 we had experts from every field we thought would be important including the government
 and people that run research centers and for two days they heard the reports from those five work streams and talked about it it was the first time
 the people who could make this happen sat across the table from each other and had these conversations
 now
 these conferences it 's typical to have a dinner  and at that dinner  you get to know each other sort of like what we 're doing here  i happened to look out the window and hand on my heart 
 the night of this conference it was the summertime and that 's what i saw a double rainbow so i 'd like to think it was a good sign  since the
  got people working between paris and san francisco lots of different folks working on this to try to see if we can really make it happen
  we 're not looking to start a fund but we want somebody else to do this 
 because again i 'm not a scientist  i can 't build a drug  i 'm never going to have enough money to fund even one of those trials  
 but all of us together 
 with our four hundred and one s with our five hundred and twenty nine plans with our pension plans all of us together can actually fund hundreds of trials and get paid well for doing it
 and save millions of lives like my dad thank you
