  i made a film that was impossible to make  but
 i didn 't know it was impossible and
 that 's how i was able to do it 
 mars et avril is a science fiction film it 's set in montreal some fifty years in the future  no one had done that
  kind of movie in quebec before because it 's expensive it 's set
 in the future and it 's got tons of visual effects and
 it 's shot on green screen  yet this is the kind of movie that i wanted to make ever since i was a kid really back when i was reading some comic books and
 dreaming about what the future might be  when american
  for only two point three million so you might wonder what 's the deal here how did i do this well
 it 's two things first it 's time  when you don 't have money you must take time and it took me seven years to do
 i got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved  and it seems like every department had nothing so they had to rely on our on our creativity and turn every problem 
  into an opportunity  and that brings me to the point of my talk actually how constraints big creative constraints can boost creativity 
  i did some graphic novels but they weren 't your usual graphic novels they were books telling a science fiction story through images and text and
 most of the actors who are now starring in the movie adaptation they were already involved in these in these books portraying characters into
 a sort of experimental  theatrical simplistic
  one of these actors is
 the great stage director and actor robert lepage and i just love this guy i 've been in love with this guy since i was a kid his
 career i admire a lot  and i wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project  and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of
  a
  he was a perfect fit for for the part and robert is actually the one who
 gave me my first chance he was the the one who believed in me and encouraged me to
 to do an adaptation of my books into a into a film and to write direct  and produce the film
  robert is actually the very first example of how constraints can boost creativity 
 because this guy is the busiest man on the planet i mean his agenda is booked until two thousand and forty two and
 he 's really hard to to get  and i wanted him to be in in the movie to reprise his role in the movie  
 but the thing is had i waited for for him until two thousand and forty two my film wouldn 't be a futuristic film anymore
 i just couldn 't do that right  but that 's kind of a big problem how do you get somebody who is too busy to star in a movie  
 well  i said as a joke in a production meeting and this is a true story by the way i said why don 't we turn this guy into a hologram  
 because you know he is everywhere and nowhere on the planet at the same time and he 's an illuminated being in my mind
  he 's in between
 reality and virtual reality so it would make perfect sense to turn this guy into a hologram 
 everybody around the table laughed  but the joke was kind of a good solution so that 's what we ended up doing 
 here 's how we did it we shot robert with six cameras he was dressed in green and he was like in a green aquarium  each camera was covering sixty
  degrees of his head so that in post production we could
 use pretty much any angle we needed and
 we shot only his head  six months later there was a guy on set a mime portraying the body the vehicle for the head  
 and he was wearing a green hood
 so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction and replace it with robert lepage 's head  so he became like a renaissance
  man and here 's what it looks like in the movie
  my second example of how constraints can boost creativity
 because i desperately needed these objects in my movie they are objects of desire they are imaginary
  instruments and they carry a nice story with them  actually  i knew what these
 things would look like in my mind for many many years  but
 my problem was i didn 't have the money to to pay for them  
 i couldn 't afford them  so that 's kind of a big problem too how do you get something that you can 't afford 
 and 
 you know i woke up one
  morning with a pretty good idea i said what if i have somebody else pay for them 
 but who on earth would be interested by seven not yet built musical instruments inspired by women 's bodies  
 and i thought of cirque du soleil in montreal
  who better to understand the kind of crazy poetry that i wanted to put on screen  so i found my way to guy lalibert cirque du soleil 's ceo and
 i presented my crazy idea to him with with sketches like this and visual references and something
 pretty amazing happened guy was
 interested by this idea not because i was asking for his money but because i came to him with a good idea
 in which everybody was happy it was kind of a
  perfect triangle in which the
 the
 art buyer was happy because he got the instruments at a cheaper price  because they weren 't even made he took a leap of faith  
 and the artist dominique engel  brilliant guy he was happy too because he had a dream project to work on for a year  
 and obviously i was happy because i got the instruments in my film for free which was
  kind of what i tried to do  so here they are and
 my last example of how constraints can boost creativity comes from
 the green because this is a
 weird color a crazy color and you need to replace the the green screens eventually and you must figure that out sooner rather than later  and i had again pretty much
  much  ideas in my mind as to what the the world would be  but
 then again i turned to my childhood imagination and went to
 the work of belgian comic book master  franois schuiten in belgium and this guy
 is another guy i admire a lot and i wanted him to be involved in the movie as a production designer  but people told me you know
  it 's impossible the guy is too busy and he will say no well i said you know what instead of
 mimicking his style i might as well call the real guy and ask him  and
 i sent him my books and
 he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be
 a big fish in a small aquarium in other words there was space for him to dream with me so here i was with
  of my childhood heroes drawing every single frame that 's in the film
 to turn that into montreal in the future  
 and it was an amazing collaboration to work with this great artist whom i admire  
 but then you know  eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality 
 so again my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that i could think of and there 's this
  guy in montreal another quebecois called carlos monzon and he 's a very good vfx artist this guy had been
 lead compositor on such films as avatar and star trek and transformers and other unknown projects like this and i knew he was the perfect fit for the job  and i had to convince him and
  instead of working on the next spielberg movie he accepted to work on mine  why because i offered him a space to dream so if you don 't have
 money to offer to people you must strike their imagination with
 something as as nice as you can think of so this is what happened on this movie and that 's how it got made and we went to this very nice
 postproduction company in montreal called vision globale and
 artists to work full time for six months to do this crazy film  so i want to tell you that if you have some
 crazy ideas in your mind  and that people tell you that it 's impossible to make well that 's an even better reason to want to do it because people have a tendency to see the problems rather than the
  if you start to deal with problems as being your allies rather than your opponents
 life will start to dance with you in the most amazing way i have experienced it 
 and you might end up doing some crazy projects and
 who knows you might even end up going to mars thank you
