  this is a representation of your brain  and your brain can be broken into two parts 
 there 's the left half which is the logical side and then the right half  which is the intuitive  
 and so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere then we can plot our brain  and for
  example this would be somebody who 's completely logical this would be someone who 's entirely intuitive  
 so where would you put your brain on this scale 
 some of us may have opted for one of these extremes  but i think for most people in the audience your brain is something like this with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time  it 's not like they 're mutually
  exclusive or anything you can be logical and intuitive  
 and so i consider myself one of these people along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists who
 need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas  
 but at the same time we
 need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work 
 how do we develop this intuition well we like to play with stuff  so we go out and play with it and then we see how it acts  and then we develop
  from there and really you do the same thing 
 so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time 
 i mean it can sound weird to think about
 one thing being in two different places at the same time  but you weren 't born with this notion you developed it 
 and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop
  just a toddler and he wasn 't very good at it and he kept falling over  but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson and that 's that large things don 't let you get right past them  
 and that they stay in one place  
 and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world  unless you 're a particle physicist it 'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don 't play with car stops they play with these little little weird particles
  and when they play with their particles they find they do all sorts of really weird weird things like they can fly right through walls or they can be in two different places at the same time  
 and so they wrote down all these observations  and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics  
 and so that 's where physics was at a few years ago you needed quantum mechanics to describe little tiny
  but you didn 't need it to describe the the large everyday objects around us 
 this didn 't really sit well with my intuition  and maybe it 's just because i don 't play with particles very often
  well i play with them sometimes but not very often  and i 've never seen them  i mean  nobody 's ever seen a particle 
 but it didn 't sit well with my logical side either because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics
  then shouldn 't everything just follow quantum mechanics 
 i don 't see any reason why it shouldn 't 
 and so i 'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics  so a few years ago i set off to do just that 
 so
 i made one this is the first object
 that you can see
 that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition 
 so what we 're looking at here is a tiny computer chip  and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle  and that 's this piece of metal i 'm going to be talking about in a minute 
 this is a photograph of of the object and here i 'll zoom in a little bit we 're looking right there in the center 
  're looking at is a little chunk of metal and it 's shaped like a diving board and it 's sticking out over a ledge  and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip i went into a clean room with 
  a fresh silicon wafer  and then i just cranked away at all the big machines for about one hundred hours for the last stuff i had to build my own machine to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device 
  needs a little help to do it here let me give you an analogy you
 know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator  i mean when i 'm in an elevator all alone i do all sorts of weird things but then other people
 get on board and i stop doing those things because
 i don 't want to bother them or frankly  scare them  
 so quantum mechanics quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way the fellow passengers for
  inanimate objects are not just people  but it 's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room  
 and so we knew if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically we 're going to have to kick out all the other passengers  and so that 's what we did 
 we turned off the lights and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air  and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero
  alone in the elevator the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted  and so we measured its motion we found it was moving in really weird ways  instead of just sitting perfectly still 
 it was vibrating and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this like expanding and contracting bellows and by giving it a gentle nudge we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time
  mechanics  so what i 'm telling you here is something truly fantastic 
 what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time  
 so let 's think about the atoms so in one case all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and
 at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down now it 's only at precise times
  they align the rest of the time they 're delocalized 
 that means that every atom is in two different places at the same time  which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places i think this is really cool 
 really it
 was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years
 because check this out the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you 
 so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time  that chunk of metal can be in two different places
 then why not you i mean
 this is just my logical side talking  
 so imagine if you 're in
  multiple places at the same time  what would that be like
 how would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space 
 there 's one more part to the story it 's when we warmed it up and
 we turned on the lights and looked inside the box we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece  and so i had to develop this new intuition
  that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space 
 you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected 
 well that 's not quite right it 's more than that 
 it 's deeper it 's that those connections your connections to all the things around you  literally define who you are 
 and that 's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics  thank you
