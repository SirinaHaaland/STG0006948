  for more than one hundred years the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments  
 for much of this time this assistance was manual surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand calls were recorded to tape  
 but as in
  so many other industries  computing has changed everything the telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks 
 i want that to sink in for a second our telephones and the networks that carry our calls
 were wired for surveillance first first and foremost so what that means is that when you 're talking to your spouse your
  children a colleague or your doctor on the telephone someone could be listening 
 now that someone might be your own government 
 it could also be another government a foreign intelligence service or a hacker or a criminal or a stalker or any other party that breaks into the surveillance system that hacks
  the surveillance system
 of the telephone companies 
 but while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority  silicon valley companies have not 
 and increasingly over the last couple years  silicon valley companies have built strong encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillance extremely difficult  
 for example many of you might have an iphone and if you use an iphone to send a text message to other people who have an iphone those
  text messages cannot easily be wiretapped  and in fact  according to apple  they 're not able to even see the text messages themselves  
 likewise if you use facetime to make an audio call
 or a video call with one of your friends or loved ones that too cannot be easily wiretapped  and it 's not just apple 
 whatsapp which is now owned by facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world also has built strong
  technology into its product which means that people in the global south can easily communicate without their governments  often authoritarian wiretapping their text messages 
 so  after one hundred years of being able to listen to any telephone call anytime  anywhere
 you might imagine that government officials are not very happy and in fact that 's what 's happening government officials
  are extremely mad and they 're not mad because these encryption tools are now available what upsets them the most is that the tech companies have built encryption features
 into their products and turned them on by default it 's the default piece that matters in short the tech companies have democratized encryption  
 and so government officials like british prime minister david cameron they believe
  that all communications emails texts voice calls all of these should be available to governments  and encryption is making that difficult  
 now look i 'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view we live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world  and there really are bad people out there there are terrorists and other serious national security threats that i suspect we all want the fbi and the
  but those surveillance features come at a cost 
 the reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop or a drug dealer 's cell phone 
 we all use the same communications devices 
 what that means is that if
 the drug dealers ' telephone calls or the terrorists ' telephone calls can be intercepted  then
 so can the rest of ours too and i think we really need to ask  should a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly 
 so the the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that i 've described this is not imaginary in two thousand and nine the surveillance systems that google 
 and microsoft built into their networks the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police those systems were compromised by the chinese government because the chinese
  government wanted to figure out which of their own agents the us government was monitoring  
 by the same token in two thousand and four the surveillance system built into the network of vodafone greece greece 's largest telephone company was compromised by an unknown entity  
 and that feature the surveillance feature was used to wiretap the greek prime minister and members of the greek cabinet 
 the foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught
 and really this gets to the very problem with with these surveillance features or backdoors  when you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology you have no way of controlling who 's going to go through it 
 you have no way of controlling whether it 'll be used by your side or the other side by good
  or by bad guys  and so for that reason i think that it 's better to build networks to be as secure as possible  
 yes this means that in the future encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult  it means that the police are going to have a tougher time catching bad guys  
 but the alternative would mean to live in a world where anyone 's calls or anyone 's text messages could be surveilled by criminals by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies  and i don 't want to live in that kind of world
  and so right now you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets 
 you just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are or how weak the other ways you 've used to communicate really are  
 and so my message to you is this 
 we need to use these tools  we need to secure our telephone calls we need to
  secure our text messages 
 i want you to use these tools i want you to tell your loved ones i want you to tell your colleagues use these encrypted communications tools don 't just use them because they 're cheap and easy  but use them because they 're secure
