  many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see 
 a blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task 
 until now hello my name is dennis hong  and we 're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired
 so before i talk about this car for the blind let me briefly tell you about another project that i worked on called the darpa urban challenge now this was about building a robotic car 
 that can drive itself you press start nobody touches anything and it can reach its destination fully autonomously 
  nfb  challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently  we decided to give it a try because we thought hey how hard could it 
  be we have already an autonomous vehicle we just put a blind person in it and we 're done right 
  active decisions and drive  so we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch  
 so to test this crazy idea  we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility 
 and in the summer of two thousand and nine we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin it was an absolutely amazing
  but the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment in a flat closed off parking lot even the lanes defined by red traffic cones  so with this success 
 we decided to take the next big step to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads  
  obviously the driver cannot see so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver for that we use an initial measurement unit so it measures acceleration angular acceleration 
 like a human ear inner ear  we fuse that information with a gps unit to get an estimate of the location of the car we also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the
  also use three laser range finders the lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles a car approaching from the front the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads  any obstacles around the vehicle 
 so all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer and the computer can do two things one is first of all process this information to have an understanding of the environment 
 these are the lanes of the road there 's the obstacles and convey this information to the driver 
  way to operate the car  so we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle but the problem is this how do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive  
 so for this we developed many different types of non visual user interface technology 
 so starting
  ping sound system a vibrating vest a
 click wheel with voice commands a leg strip even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot  but today we 're going to talk about three of these non visual user interfaces  
 now the first interface is called a drivegrip  so these are a pair of gloves and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer the direction and the intensity 
 another device is called speedstrip  so this is a chair as a matter of fact it 's actually a massage chair
  gut it out and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns  and we actuate them to convey information about the speed and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal 
 so over here you can see how the computer understands the environment and because you cannot see the vibration we actually put red  led 's on the driver so that you can see what 's happening this is the sensory data and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer  
 so these two
  devices  drivegrip and speedstrip are very effective but the problem is these are instructional cue devices so this is not really freedom right the computer tells you how to drive turn left turn right  speed up stop  we call this the backseat driver problem 
 so we 're moving away from the instructional cue devices  and we 're now focusing more on the informational
  a good example for this informational non visual user interface is called airpix  so think of it as a monitor for the blind so it 's a small tablet has many holes in it and compressed air comes 
  out  so it can actually draw images so even though you are blind you can put your hand over it you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles
 user interface 
 so here you can see the left camera the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the airpix for this we 're showing a simulator a blind person driving using the airpix 
 this simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non visual user interfaces  so basically that 's how it works  
 so just a month ago on january 29th we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the  world famous daytona international speedway during the rolex
 twenty four racing event  we also had some surprises  let 's take a look
 the
 the
 the
  so since we started this project we 've been getting hundreds of letters emails phone calls from people from all around the world letters thanking us but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one 
 now i understand why there is braille on a 
 but sometimes 
 but sometimes i also do get i wouldn 't call it hate
  mail but letters of really strong concern dr hong are you insane trying to put blind people on the road you must be out of your mind 
 but this vehicle is a prototype vehicle and it 's not going to be on the road until it 's proven as safe as or safer than today 's vehicle and i truly believe that this can happen  
 but still will the society  would they accept such a radical idea how are we going to handle insurance how are we going to issue driver 's licenses
 there 's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality 
 of course the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind but potentially more important than this is the the tremendous value of the spin off technology that
 can come from this project  the sensors that are used can see through the dark the
 fog and rain and together with this new type of interfaces  we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people 
 or for the blind everyday home appliances in the educational setting in the office setting 
 just imagine in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student
 can see what 's written and read using these non visual interfaces  this is priceless  so today the things i 've showed you today
  is just the beginning thank you very much
