  to tell you that we have a problem with boys  and it 's a serious problem with boys
  their culture isn 't working in schools and i 'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem 
 first i want to start by saying this is a boy and
 this is a girl  and this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl  
 if i essentialize gender for you today then you can dismiss what i have to say so i 'm not going to do that i 'm not interested in doing that this is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl
  so the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls 
 and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we
  think of as girls but in fact  most boys tend to be a certain way and most girls tend to be a certain way 
 and the point is that for boys the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace
 isn 't working well in schools now how do we know that the one hundred girls project tells us
 some really nice
  for example for every one hundred girls that are suspended from school there are two hundred and fifty boys that are suspended from school  
 for every one hundred girls who are expelled from school there are three hundred and thirty five boys who are expelled from school  
 for every one hundred girls in special education there are two hundred and seventeen boys for every one hundred girls with a learning disability there are two hundred and seventy six boys 
 for every one hundred girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed we have three hundred and twenty four boys and by the way all of these
  numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black  if you happen to be poor  if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school
 and if you are a boy you 're four times as likely to be diagnosed with adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
 now there is another side
  it is important that we recognize that
 women still need help in school  
 that salaries are still significantly lower  even when controlled for job types  and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years 
 that 's all true  nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and thirteen  
 and so we should in
  what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook  because
 the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic  they 've done a lot of good for girls in these situations 
 and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too
 in their younger years  
 even in their older years what we find is that there 's still a problem when we look at the universities sixty percent of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now
  which is a significant shift  and in fact university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea that we may be getting close to seventy percent female population in universities 
 this makes university administrators very nervous because girls don 't want to go to schools that don 't have boys  
 and so we 're starting to see the establishment of men centers and men studies to think about how do we
  engage men in their experiences in the university if you talk to faculty they may say ugh 
 yeah well they 're playing video games and they 're gambling online all night long and they 're playing world of warcraft and that 's affecting their academic achievement 
 guess what video games are not the
  video games are a symptom they were turned off a long time before they got here
 so let 's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of three and thirteen
  there are three reasons that i believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today  the first is zero tolerance a
 kindergarten teacher i know her son donated
 donated all of his toys to her and when he did she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns
 you can 't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing
 in a kindergarten classroom  what is it that we 're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun 
 i mean really  but here he stands as testament to the fact that you can 't roughhouse on
  not advocating for bullies i 'm not suggesting that we need to be
 allowing guns and knives in the school but when we say that an eagle scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it has to be suspended from school
 i think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys 
  a lot of classrooms today you 're not allowed to write about anything that 's violent you 're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games these topics are banned boy comes home from school and he says 
 i hate writing why do
 you hate writing son what 's wrong with writing now i have to write what she tells me to write ok  what is she telling you to write 
 poems i have to write poems  and little moments in my life i don 't want to write that stuff 
 well what do you want to write what do you want to write about
  want to write about video games i want to write about leveling up i want to write about this really interesting world  i want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody all
 right ok you tell a teacher that and they 'll ask you in all seriousness should we send this child to the psychologist
  and the answer is no he 's just a boy  he 's just a little boy
  it 's not ok to write these kinds of things in classrooms today  
 so that 's the first reason zero tolerance policies and the way they 're lived out the next reason that boys ' cultures are out of sync with school cultures
 there are fewer male teachers  anybody who 's over fifteen doesn 't know what this means because in the last ten years the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half  we went from fourteen
  percent to seven percent that means that ninety three percent of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women 
 now what 's the problem with this  women are great yep absolutely but
 male role models for boys that say it 's all right to be smart they 've got dads they 've got
  they 've got cub scout leaders but
 ultimately  six hours a day five days a week they 're spending in a classroom  
 and most of those classrooms are not places where men exist 
 and so they say i guess this really isn 't a place for boys  this is a place for girls  and i 'm not very good at this  so i guess i 'd better
 go play video games or get into sports or something like that because i obviously don 't belong here men don 't belong here that 's pretty obvious  so that may be a very direct
 way that we see it happen but less directly  the lack of male presence in the culture you 've got a
 teachers ' lounge and they 're having a conversation about
 joey and johnny who beat each other up on the playground what are we going to do with these boys the answer to that question changes depending on who 's sitting around that table are there men around that
  are there moms who 've raised boys around that table you 'll see the conversation changes depending upon who 's sitting around the table  
 third reason that boys are out of sync with school today  kindergarten is the old second grade folks  we have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there 
 when you 're three you better be able to write your name legibly or else we 'll consider it a developmental delay 
 by the time you 're in first grade you should be able to read paragraphs of text
 with maybe a picture maybe not in a book of maybe twenty five to
 twenty five to thirty pages  if you don 't we 're probably going to be putting you into a title i special reading program and if you ask title i teachers they 'll tell you
 they 've got about four or five boys for every girl that 's in their program in the elementary grades  the reason that this is a problem
 is because the message that boys are getting is you need to do
 what the teacher asks you to do all the time 
 the teacher 's salary depends on no child left behind and race to the top and accountability and testing and
 and all of this so she has to figure out a way
 to get all these boys through this curriculum and girls this compressed curriculum is bad for all
 active kids and what happens is she says
  do what you 're told follow the rules  manage your time focus be
 a girl that 's
 what she tells them  indirectly that 's what she tells them  
 and so this is a very serious problem where is it coming from it 's coming from us 
 laughter we want our babies to read when they are six months old have you seen the ads  we want to live in lake wobegon where
  every child is above average
 but what this does to our children is really not healthy it 's not developmentally appropriate and it 's particularly bad for boys  
 so what do we do we need to meet them where they are we need to put ourselves into boy culture we need to change the mindset
 of acceptance in boys in elementary schools more specifically
 we can do some very specific things we can design better games  most of the educational games that are out there today
 are really flashcards
 they 're glorified drill and practice  they don 't have the depth the rich narrative
 that really engaging video games have that the boys are really interested in so we need to design better games  
 we need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians we need to make sure that people see that
  we need more men in the classroom  we need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies do they make sense  
 we need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them 
 all of those conversations need to be happening there are some great examples out there of schools
 the new york times just talked about a school recently a game designer from the
  put together a wonderful video gaming school  
 but it only treats a few kids  
 and so this isn 't very scalable we have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today  
 we need to find more money for game design because
  good games really good games cost money and world of warcraft has quite a budget most of the educational games do not 
 where we started my colleagues mike petner shawn vashaw myself we started by trying to look at the teachers ' attitudes and find out how do they really feel about gaming 
 what do they say about it 
 and we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school  who talk about gaming in pretty demeaning ways
  they 're always talking about that stuff they 're talking about their little action figures and their little
 achievements or merit badges or whatever it is that
 they get and they 're always talking about this stuff and they say these things as if it 's ok but if it were your culture 
 think of how that might feel it 's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of
 language  they 're nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies they are sure that parents and administrators
  never accept anything so we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways
 to change the attitudes  so that teachers are much more open and and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms
 because ultimately if we don 't then we 're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying well i guess that was just a place for girls it wasn 't
  've got to do gaming or i 've got to do sports if we change these things if we pay attention to these things and we reengage boys in their learning they will leave the elementary schools saying
