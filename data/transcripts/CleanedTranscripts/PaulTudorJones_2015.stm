  this is a story about capitalism  
 it 's a system i love because of the successes and opportunities it 's afforded me and millions of others i started in
  cotton in particular 
 in the pits and if there was ever a free market free for all this was it where men wearing ties but acting like gladiators fought literally and physically for a profit
 fortunately i was good enough that by the time i was thirty i was able to move into the upstairs world of
 money management where i spent the next three decades as a
  a lot of crazy things in the markets  
 and i 've traded a lot of crazy manias and unfortunately 
 i 'm sad to report that right now we might be in the grips of one of the most disastrous  certainly of my career  and one consistent takeaway is manias never end well  
 now  over the past fifty
  we as a society
 have come to view our companies and corporations in a very narrow almost monomaniacal fashion
 with regard to how we value them  
 and we have put so much emphasis on profits on short term quarterly earnings and share prices at the exclusion of all else it 's like we 've ripped the humanity
 out of our companies now
  we don 't do that conveniently reduce something to a set of numbers that you can play with like lego toys we don 't do that in our individual life we don 't treat somebody or value them based on their monthly income
 or their credit score  but we have this double standard when it comes to the way that we value our businesses and you know what  it 's threatening the very underpinnings of our society
  and here 's how you 'll see this chart
 is corporate profit margins going back forty years as a percentage of revenues and you can see that we 're at a 40 year high
 of twelve point five percent  now hooray  if you 're a shareholder  but if you 're the other side of that and you 're the average american worker
  higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth what they actually do is they exacerbate income inequality 
 and that 's not a good thing  but intuitively that makes sense right because if the top ten percent of american families own ninety percent
  they take a greater share of corporate profits  then there 's less wealth left for the rest of society 
 again income inequality is not a good thing this next chart  made by the equality trust shows twenty one countries from austria to japan to new zealand 
 on the horizontal axis is income inequality the further to the right you go  the greater the income inequality
  on the vertical axis are nine social and health metrics  the more you go up that the worse the problems are and those metrics include life expectancy  teenage pregnancy literacy social mobility just to name a few  
 now those of you in the audience
 who are americans may wonder well  where does the united states rank where does it lie on that chart and guess what we 're literally off the chart
  that 's us with the greatest income inequality
 and the greatest social problems according to those metrics  
 now here 's a macro forecast that 's easy to make  and that 's
 that gap between the wealthiest and the poorest it will get closed  history always does it it typically happens in one of three ways  
 either through revolution  
 higher taxes or wars  none of those are on my bucket list
 there 's another way to do it  and that 's by
 increasing justness in corporate behavior 
 but the way that we 're operating right now that would require a tremendous change in behavior  
 and like an addict trying to kick a habit the first step is to acknowledge that you
  have a problem  
 and let me just say this profits mania that we 're on is so deeply entrenched that we don 't even realize how we 're harming society  here 's a small but startling example of exactly how we 're doing that 
 this chart shows corporate giving
 as a percentage
 of profits not revenues  over the last thirty years  juxtapose that to the earlier chart
 of corporate profit margins and i ask you
 does that feel right 
 in all fairness when i started writing this i thought oh wow what does my company what does tudor do and i realized
 we give one percent of corporate profits to charity every year and i
 'm supposed to be a philanthropist when i realized that i literally wanted to throw up
 but the point is this mania is so deeply entrenched that well intentioned people like myself don 't even realize that we 're part of it 
 now we 're not going to change corporate behavior by simply increasing
 corporate philanthropy or charitable contributions  and oh by the way we 've since quadrupled
  we can do it by driving more just behavior  and one way to do it is actually trusting the system that got us here in the first place  and that 's the free market system 
 about a year ago some friends of mine and i
 started a not for profit called just capital its mission is very simple to help companies and corporations learn how to operate in a more just fashion
  the public 's input to define exactly what the criteria are for just corporate behavior  
 now right now there 's no widely accepted standard that a company or corporation can follow  and that 's where just capital comes in because beginning this year and every year we 'll
  be conducting a nationwide survey of a representative sample of twenty thousand americans to find out exactly what they
  think are
 the criteria for justness in in corporate behavior 
 now this is a model that 's going to start in the united states but can be expanded anywhere around the globe  
 and maybe we 'll find out that the most important thing for the public
 is that we create living wage jobs or make healthy products or help not harm the environment
  at just capital we don 't know and it 's not for us to decide we 're but messengers  
 but we have one hundred percent confidence and faith in the american public to get it right 
 so we 'll release the findings this september for the first time  and then next year we 'll poll again and we 'll take the additive step this time
  of ranking the one thousand largest u s companies from number one to number one thousand and everything in between we
 're calling it the just index  and remember we 're an independent not for profit with no bias  
 and we will be giving the american public a voice  and maybe over time we 'll find out
 that as people come to know which companies are the most just human and economic resources will be driven
 towards them and they 'll become the most prosperous and help our country be the most prosperous  
 now capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation that 's made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in 
 capitalism has to be based on justice it has to be and now more than ever with economic divisions growing wider every day
  's estimated that forty seven percent of american workers can be displaced in the next twenty years i 'm
 not against progress i want the driverless car and the jet pack just like everyone else  
 but i 'm pleading for recognition
 that with increased wealth and profits
 has to come greater corporate social responsibility
  if justice is removed said adam smith  the father of capitalism 
 the great the immense fabric of human society must in a moment
 crumble
 into atoms now when i was young  and there was a problem my mama used to always sigh and shake her head and say
  have mercy 
 now 's not the time for us for the rest of us to show them mercy the time is now for us to show them fairness and we can do that 
 you and i by starting where we work in the businesses that we operate in 
 and when we put justness on par
  get the most wonderful thing
