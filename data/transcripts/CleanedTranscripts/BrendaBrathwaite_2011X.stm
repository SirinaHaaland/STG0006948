  when we think of games there 's all kinds of things maybe you 're ticked off or maybe you 're looking forward to a new game you 've been up too late playing a game all these things happen to me
  but when we think about games a lot of times we think about stuff like this first person shooters or the
 what we would call aaa games  or maybe you 're a facebook game player this is one my partner and i worked on maybe you play facebook games and that 's what we 're making right now this is a lighter form of game
  maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in thanksgiving situations 
 this would be one of the tragically boring board games that you can figure out or maybe you 're in your living room playing with the wii with the kids 
  there 's this whole range of games  and that 's very much what i think about i make my living from games i 've been lucky enough to do this since i was fifteen which also qualifies as i 've never really had a real job
  but we think about games as fun and that 's completely reasonable
  but let 's just think about this so this one here this is the one thousand nine hundred and eighty olympics now i don 't know where you guys were but i was in my living room it was practically a religious event  
 and this is when the americans beat the
  and this was yes it was technically a game hockey is a game  but really was this a game  i mean  people cried i 've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of
 so this was an amazing experience or if anybody here is from boston so when the boston red sox won the world series after i believe  three hundred and fifty one years 
 when they won the world series  it was amazing i happened to be living in springfield at the time and the best part of it was
  you would close the the women 's door in the bathroom and i remember seeing go sox and i thought really
  or the houses you 'd come out because every game well i think almost every game went into overtime right so we 'd be outside and all the other lights are on in the whole block
  and kids the the attendance was down in school kids weren 't going
  it 's ok it 's the red sox right i mean there 's education and then there 's the red sox and we know where they 're stacked  
 so this was an amazing experience and again yes it was a game  but they didn 't write newspaper articles people didn 't say you know really  i can die now because the red sox won 
 and many people did so games it means something more to us it absolutely means something more so now  this is an abrupt transition
  there was three years where i actually did have a real job sort of i was the head of a college department teaching games so again it was sort of a real job and now i got to talk about making them as opposed to making them
 part of the job of it when you 're a chair of a department is to eat
 and i did that very well and so i 'm out at a dinner with this guy
 called zig jackson so this is zig in this photograph this is also one of zig 's photographs he 's a photographer  
 and he goes all around the country taking pictures of
 himself
 you can see here he 's got zig 's indian reservation  and this particular shot
 this is one of the more traditional shots this is a rain dancer  
 and this is one of my favorite shots here  so you can look at this and maybe you 've even seen things like this this is an expression of culture right and this is actually from his degradation series and what was most fascinating to me about this series is just look at that little boy there can you imagine
  that that 's a traditional native american now i just want to change that guy 's race just imagine if that 's a black guy so honey come here let 's get you a picture with the black guy 
 right like seriously nobody would do this it baffles the mind  and so zig being indian likewise it baffles his mind his favorite photograph my favorite photograph of his which i don 't have in here is indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of indians
  to be at dinner with this photographer and he was talking with another photographer about a shooting that had occurred  and it was on an indian reservation he 'd taken his camera up there to photograph it but when he got there he discovered he couldn 't do it he just couldn 't capture the picture
 and so they were talking back and forth about this question do you take the picture or not  and that was fascinating to me as a game designer  because it never occurs to me should i make the game about this difficult topic
  or not because we just make things that are fun or will make you feel fear that visceral excitement
  but every other medium does it  
 so this is my kid this is maezza and when she was seven years old she came home from school one day and like i do every single day i asked her what did you do today so she said we talked about the middle passage now this was a big
  maezza 's dad is black and i knew this day was coming i wasn 't expecting it at seven i don 't know why but i wasn 't anyways so i asked her 
 how do you feel about that 
 so she proceeded to tell me and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here the ships start in england they come down from england they go to africa they go across the ocean that 's the middle passage 
  part they come to america where the slaves are sold she 's telling me  but abraham lincoln was elected president and then he passed the emancipation proclamation and now they 're free
  pause for about ten seconds can i play a game mommy and i thought
 that 's it  and so  you know this is the middle passage this is an incredibly significant event
  and she 's treating it like basically some black people went on a cruise this is more or less how it sounds to her 
 and so to me  i wanted more value in this so when she asked if she could play a game  i said
  yes 
 and so i happened to have all of these little pieces i 'm a game designer so i have this stuff sitting around my house i said yeah you can play a game and i give her a bunch of these and i tell her to paint them in different families these are pictures 
  of maezza when she was god it still chokes me up seeing these so she 's painting her little families so then i grab a bunch of them and i put them on a boat
  this was the boat it was made quickly obviously
 and so the basic gist of it is i grabbed a bunch of families and she 's like mommy but you forgot the pink baby and you forgot the blue daddy and you forgot all these other things 
 and she says they want to go and i said honey no they don 't want to go this is the middle passage nobody wants to go on the middle passage 
 so she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother 
 and as we 're going across the ocean following these rules she realizes that she 's rolling pretty high  and she says to me we 're not going to make it
  and she realizes  we don 't have enough food and so she asks what to do and i i say remember she 's seven we can either put some people in the water
 or we can hope that they don 't get sick and we make it to the other side 
 just the look on her face came over now mind you this is after a month of this is black history month right  
  this is her brother and sister if i came out of the woods avalon and donovan might be gone yes 
 but i 'd get to see them in america no but what if i saw them couldn 't we stay together so daddy could be gone yes 
 she was fascinated by this and she started to cry i started to cry her father started to cry and now we 're all crying he didn 't expect to come home from work to the middle passage but
  and so  we made this game and she she got it she got it because she spent time with these people it wasn 't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie
 and so it was just an incredibly powerful experience this is the game which i 've ended up calling the new world because i like the phrase i don 't think the new world felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on
  but when this happened i saw the whole planet i was so excited  i 'd been making games for 20 some years
 and then i decided to do it again my history is irish  so this is a game called sochn leat it 's peace be with you it 's the entire history of my family in a single game  
 i made another game called train i was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics and if you 're going to cover a difficult topic this is one you need to cover and i 'll let you figure out what that 's about on your own
  and i also made a game about the
  trail of tears  this is a game with fifty thousand individual pieces  i was crazy when i decided to start it but i 'm in the middle of it now  
 it 's the same thing i 'm hoping that i 'll teach culture through these games  
 and the one i 'm working on right now which is because i 'm right in the middle of it and these for some reason choke me up like crazy is a game called mexican kitchen workers and
 originally it was a math problem
  more or less here 's the economics of illegal immigration 
 and the more i learned about mexican culture my partner is mexican the more i learned that you know for all of us food is a basic need
 and it is obviously with mexicans too but it 's much more than that it 's an expression of love it 's an expression of
 god i 'm totally choking up way more than i thought i 'll look away from the picture
 it 's an expression of beauty it 's how they say they love you it 's how they say they care and you can 't hear somebody talk about their mexican grandmother without saying food in the first
  sentence
  and so to me  this beautiful culture this beautiful expression is something that i want to capture through games  and so games for a change it changes how we see topics it changes our perceptions about those people in topics  
 and it changes ourselves we change as people through games because we 're involved and we 're playing and we 're learning as we do so
