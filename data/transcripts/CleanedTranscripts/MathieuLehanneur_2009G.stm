  wilder penfield saw himself
 like this a weird freak with huge hands huge mouth  and a tiny bottom
  actually this creature
 is the result of the penfield research he named it homunculus 
 basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where
 each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain so of course  homunculus is definitely not a freak
  it 's you
 it 's our invisible reality  
 this visualization could explain for example why newborns  or smokers put instinctively their fingers in the mouth
  unfortunately
 it doesn 't explain why so many designers remain mainly interested in designing
  even if i do not understand science entirely for my design i essentially refer to it i 'm
 fascinated by its ability to deeply investigate the human being its way of working its way of feeling  and it really helps me to understand 
 how we see how we hear how we breathe  how our brain can inform or mislead us
  it 's a great tool for me to to understand what could be our real needs
 marketing people have never been able to do that  marketing reduces things marketing simplifies marketing creates user groups
  and scientists  amidst complexity amidst fluctuation and uniqueness what could be our
 real needs  maybe the silence  in our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds
 and you know all those kind of sound puts us in a kind of stressful state  and prevent us from being quiet and and focused so i wanted to create a kind of sound filter 
 able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution but i didn 't want it to make it by isolating people without any earmuffs or
  or those kind of things or neither with including complex technology  i just wanted to using the complexity and the
 technology of the brain of the human brain  
 so i worked with white noise db is basically db is the name of the product basically a white noise diffuser
 this is white noise the white noise is the sum of all frequencies
  perfect sound for our ears and our brain  so when you hear this sound you feel like a kind of shelter
  preserved from noise pollution  and when you hear the white noise your brain is immediately focused
  do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound it seems to be magic but it is just physiology it 's just in your brain  and in mine i hope 
 so
 in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive  i create a ball a rolling ball able to
 analyze and find where does aggressive
  emits white noise in order to neutralize it 
 it works 
  you feel the effect of the white noise
 it 's too in silence  if you make some noise you can feel the effect so
 even if this object even if this product includes some technology it includes some speakers it includes some microphones and some electronic devices  this object is not
 a very smart object and i don 't want to make
  want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot  i want to create an object like you and me so definitely not perfect so imagine for instance you are at home  
 a loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend you shout you say blah blah blah blah blah blah who is this guy and db will probably
 roll toward you and turning around you
  is a daylight receiver transmitter  
 so this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk  or on your piano where you are supposed to spend most of your time in the day  and this object will be able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day
  and able to give you the quantity of light you need this object is
 completely covered by fiber opticals and the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object for sure  but creates the idea of an
 eye sensibility
 of the object i want by this design
  better than you and probably before you what you really need you have to know that the lack of daylight can provoke some
 problem of energy or problem of libido so a huge problem 
 laughter most of the projects i work on i live in collaboration with scientists  i 'm just a designer so i need
  them  so there can be some
 biologists  psychiatrists mathematicians and so on  and i submit them my
 intuitions my hypothesis my first ideas and they react they told me what is possible what is impossible  and together we improve the original concept and we build the project to the end  
 and this kind of
  relationship between designer and scientist started when i was at school  indeed in my studies i was a guinea pig
 for a pharmaceutical industry
 and the irony for me was of course  
 i didn 't do that for the sake of science progress  i just do that to to make money  anyway  this project 
 or this experience make me start a new project on the design of medicine  
 you have to know that
 today  roughly one or two every drug pills is
  not taken correctly
  so even if the active constituents in pharmaceuticals made constant progress in terms of chemistry  target of stability
  the behavior of the of the patients goes more and more
 unstable so we took
 too many of them we took irregular dosage we do not follow instructions and so on
  i wanted to create a new kind of medicine  in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment  
 so i turned traditional pills into this i 'm going to give you some example  
 this one is an antibiotic and its purpose is to help patient to go
 to the end of the treatment  and the concept is to
 create
  a kind of onion a kind of structure in layers so you start with the darkest one  and
 you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment  and you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection  so
 the first day this is the big one  and
 you
  to peel and eat one layer a day  
 and your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer  and you 're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the christmas day  and
 you follow the treatment like like that to the end of the treatment  and here you can get the white core and
  i designed it to help kids
 to follow the treatment  
 so the idea of this one is to create a relationship between the patient of the treatment but a relationship of dependency  
 but in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient
  this is the kids will feel the therapeutic object needs him  so the idea is
 all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself including air and molecules  for sure  
 and when the kids wake up he can see the object needs him and he take him to his mouth  and breathe
 the air it contains so by this way the kid to take care of himself is
 to take care of this living object
  feel anymore it 's relies on asthma treatment  as the asthma treatment needs him 
 in this guise of
 living object approach i like the idea of a kind of invisible design 
 as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field
 just around the objects themselves
  a kind of soul of
 a ghost accompanying them  and almost a kind of
 poltergeist effect so when a passive object like this one seems to be alive because it
 is woosh starting to move  and i remember an exhibition design i made for john maeda and
  john maeda was supposed to show
 several graphic animations in this exhibition and my idea for this exhibition design was to create a real pong game like this one  
 and the idea was to create some  self moving benches in the main exhibition room  so the living benches would be exactly like the ball  and
 john was so excited by this idea
  and he told me after a long silence i wonder mathieu if people won 't be more fascinated by your benches than by my videos
 laughter it would be a great
 honor a great compliment for me  if he hadn 't decided to take all them off
 two hours before the opening so huge tragedy  i guess you won 't be surprised if i tell you that
 pinocchio is one of my great influences pinocchio is probably one of
  my favorite one  because it is a kind of object with a conscience able to to be modified by its surroundings and able to modify it as well  
 the other great influence is the mine 's canary
  in coal mines
  this canary was supposed to to be close to the miners and it was singing all day long and when it stops it means that it just died  so this canary was
  to say to the miners the air is too bad you have to go it 's an emergency 
 so it 's for me
 a great product  and i tried to design a kind of canary  andrea is one  andrea is a living air filter that
 absorbs toxic gasses from air
  so it uses some plants to do this job selected for 
 ability  
 you have to know 
 or you probably already know that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one  so while i 'm talking to you 
 the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas  
  you are currently breathing formaldehyde it 's the same for me with the carpet 
 and this is exactly the same at home because all the product we get constantly give away the volatile component
 of which they 're made of so let 's have a look
 at your home
  very toxic this is the reason why i created with david edward a scientist of harvard university an object able to absorb
  toxic
 elements using those kind of plants but
 the idea is to force the air to go in the effective part of the plants because the roots of the plant are not very effective bill wolverton from nasa
 analyzed it cleverly in the ' 70s 
 so the idea is to create an object able to force the air and to be in contact at the right speed at the right place in
  all the effective parts of the plant  so this is the final object  it will be launched next september 
 this one is
 kind of the same approach because i include in a product like andrea some plants and in this one plants are used for the water filtration ability  and it includes some fishes as well  but here
  unlike andrea here are supposed to be eaten  indeed this object is a domestic farm for fishes and green  so
 the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food  the locavores
 used to get food taken in a radius of one hundred miles local river is able to provide you food
  directly in your living room  so the principle of this object is to create an ecosystem
 called aquaponics  and the aquaponics is the dirty
 water of the fish 
 by a water pump  feeds the plants above  
 and the plants will filter by the roots the dirty water of the fish  after it goes back into the
  that you have two options or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your tv set  amazing channel
  or you start fishing  and you make some sushis
 with
 with a fish and the aromatic plants
 above because you can grow some potatoes no not potatoes but tomatoes 
 aromatic plants and so on so now we can breathe safely now we can
 eat local food now we can be treated by smart medicine  now we can be well balanced in our biorhythm with
 daylight but it was important to create a perfect place  so i tried to in order to work
 to work and create  so i designed for an american scientist based in paris  a very stimulative
 office i wanted to create a
 perfect place where you can work and play and where your body and your brain can work together so in this office 
 you do not work anymore at your desk  like a politician your seat your sleep and your play on a
 big geodesic island made of leather see like this one  in this office you
 do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper but
 you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave  like a prehistoric scientist so you  
 like that can make some sport during your work
 in this office
 you do not need to go out in order to be in contact with nature you include
  directly  the nature in the floor of the of the office you can see it there
