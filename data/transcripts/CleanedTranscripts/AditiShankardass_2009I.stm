  when i was ten years old a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school and as a special treat he took me to the pathology lab
 and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands  and there it was
 seat of human consciousness the powerhouse of the human body  sitting in my hands  
 and that day i knew that when i grew up i was going to become a brain doctor scientist something or the other  
 years later when i finally grew up my dream came true and it was while
  on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that i encountered a startling fact that i 'd like to share with you all today 
 it is estimated that one in six children that 's one in six children  suffer from some developmental disorder 
 this is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes
  which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder  
 but here 's what really perplexed me  
 despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain 
 most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis
  but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms without
 even doing an ecg or a chest x ray to look at the heart 
 it seemed so intuitive to me 
 to diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately  it would be necessary to look at the brain directly 
 looking at behavior alone can miss
 a vital piece of the puzzle
 and provide an incomplete or even a misleading picture of the child 's problems  
 yet despite all the advances in medical technology 
 the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited 
 and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical
  technology and finally applied it instead of in brain research towards diagnosing brain disorders in children 
 their groundbreaking technology records the eeg or the electrical activity of the brain in real time  
 allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions
 and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions
  vision attention language  audition 
 a program called brain electrical activity mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain 
 and another program called statistical probability mapping
 then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant  allowing us to provide a much more accurate
  neurological diagnosis of the child 's symptoms  and so i became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team 
 and we 're finally able to use this technology towards
 actually helping children with brain disorders and i 'm happy to say that i 'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in india 
 i 'd like to tell you about one such child whose story was also covered by
 seven year old justin senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism  
 like many autistic children his mind was locked inside his body  
 there were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time 
 and the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially  and he would
  probably never have too much language 
 when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin 's brain the results were startling 
 it turned out that justin was almost certainly not autistic he was suffering from brain seizures
 that were impossible to see with the naked eye  but that were actually causing symptoms that
  mimicked those of autism  
 after justin was given anti seizure medication the change in him was amazing  
 within a period of sixty days his vocabulary went from two to three words to three hundred words  
 and his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ
 research shows that fifty percent of children  almost fifty percent of children diagnosed with autism
 are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures these are the faces of the children that i have tested
 with stories just like justin all
  came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism attention deficit disorder mental retardation language problems 
 instead our eeg scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn 't possibly have been detected by their behavioral
 assessments so these eeg scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis
 and much more targeted
  treatment 
 for too long now children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen  
 and for too long these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation  
 but we are now in a new era of neuroscience
  one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects
 and find the true source of so many disabilities in children 
 so if i could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder 
 then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be
  solved one more mind will be unlocked  and one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system
 will finally realize his or her true potential while there 's still time for his or her brain to recover  
 and all this by simply watching the child 's brainwaves
