  we know it the kind of web the things we 're all talking about
 is already less than five thousand days old  so all of the things that we 've seen come about
  satellite images of the whole earth which
 we couldn 't even imagine happening before all these things rolling into our lives just this abundance of things
 that are right before us  sitting in front of our laptop or our desktop this kind of cornucopia of stuff just coming and
 never ending is amazing  and we 're not amazed  it 's really amazing that all this stuff is here
  it 's in five thousand days  all this stuff has come  and i know that ten years ago  if i had told you that this was all coming  
 you would have said that that 's impossible  there 's simply
 no economic model that that would be possible  and if i told you it was all coming for free you would say this is
  and yet it 's here 
 the other thing that we know about it was that ten years ago as i looked at what even wired was talking about 
 we thought it was going to be tv but better  
 that was the model that was what everybody was suggesting
 was going to be coming and it turns out that that 's not what it
  it was impossible and it 's not what it was  
 and so one of the things that i think we 're learning if you think about like wikipedia  it 's something that was simply impossible  
 it 's impossible in theory but possible in practice  
 and if you take all these things that are impossible i think one of the things that we 're learning from this era from this last decade is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible  
 because we 're unprepared for it 
  i 'm curious about what 's going to happen in the next five thousand days but if that 's happened in the last five thousand days what 's going to happen in the next five thousand days  
 so i have a kind of a simple story  and it suggests that that what we want to think about is this thing that we 're making this thing that has happened in five thousand days that 's all these computers 
 all these handhelds all these cell phones  all these laptops all these servers basically
  one machine  and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines but that
 we 're basically constructing a single global machine  
 and so i began to think about that and it turned out that this machine happens to be
 the most reliable machine that we 've ever made it has not crashed 
  and there 's almost no other machine that we 've ever made
 that runs the number the number of hours the number of days  five thousand days without interruption that 's just unbelievable and of course 
 the internet is longer than just five thousand days  the web is only five thousand days so i was trying to
 basically make
 measurements what are the dimensions of this machine  and
 i started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are all around the globe
  on all the computers  and there is a one hundred billion clicks per day  and there 's fifty five trillion links
 between all the web pages of the world  and so i began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions and i made a quick list was it
 chris jordan the photographer talking about numbers being so large that they 're
  hard to tell but there 's one billion pc chips
 on the internet if you count all the chips in all the computers on the internet there 's two million emails per second so it 's a very big number it 's just a huge machine and
 it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet 
 so here 's the specifications just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it 
 one hundred and seventy quadrillion transistors fifty five trillion links emails running at two megahertz itself
 text messaging two hundred and forty six exabyte storage that 's a big disk that 's a lot of storage  memory nine exabyte ram and
 the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second brewster was saying the library of congress is about twenty terabytes so every second half of the library of congress is swooshing around in this machine  
 it 's a big machine
  so i did something else  i figured out
 one hundred billion clicks per day fifty five trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain 
 a quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain so to a first approximation we have these things twenty petahertz synapse firings of
 course the memory is is really
  but to a first approximation  the size of this machine is the size
 and its complexity kind of to your brain  
 because in fact that 's how your brain works in kind of the same way that the web works however your brain isn 't doubling every two years  
 so
 if we say this machine right now that we 've made is about one hb
  one human brain 
 if we look at the rate that this is increasing thirty years from now there 'll be six billion hbs 
 so by the year two thousand and forty the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power
 of humanity in raw bits and stuff and this is i think where ray kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we 're going to cross 
  i have three kind of general things i would like to say  three
 consequences of this first that basically what this machine is doing is embodying we
 're giving it a body and that 's what we 're going to do in the next five thousand days we 're going to give this machine a body  and the second thing is we 're going to restructure its
  we 're going to become completely codependent upon it 
 so let me go through those three things first of all we have all these things in our hands 
 we think they 're all separate devices  but in fact every screen in the world is looking into the one machine
  these are all basically portals into that one machine the second thing is that that some people call this the cloud 
  and you 're kind of touching the cloud with this  and so in some ways all you really need is a cloudbook  
 and the cloudbook doesn 't have any storage  it 's wireless it 's always connected there 's many things about it it becomes very simple and basically what you 're doing is you 're just touching the machine  you 're touching the cloud and you 're
 going to compute that way so the machine is computing and in some ways it 's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing
  but everything all the cameras  and the microphones and the
 sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine  and everything will go through the web and we 're seeing that already with say phones 
 right now phones don 't go through the web but they are beginning to and they will 
 and if you imagine what say just as an example what google labs has in terms of
  all these things
 are going to become web based they 're going through the machine  
 and i am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the web  right now it 's not if you do spreadsheets and things at work a
 word document they aren 't on the web but they are going to be they 're going to be part of this machine they 're going to speak
 the web language they 're going to talk to the machine the web in some sense is kind of like a black hole that 's sucking up
 everything into it
 and so every thing will be part of the web so every item every artifact that we make will have embedded in it some little sliver of web ness and connection  
 and it will be part of this machine so that our environment kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense our environment becomes the
 it is it doesn 't really matter the point is is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine  and so we have basically an internet of things  
 so you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels and a
 car as a chip with wheels  because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars is the embedded intelligence
 and electronics in it and not the materials
 a lot of people think about the new economy as something that was going to be a disembodied  
 alternative virtual existence  
 and that we would have the old economy of atoms  but in fact 
 what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two where we embed the information  and the digital nature of things into the material world that 's what
 we 're looking forward to that is where we 're going
  convergence of
 the atomic and the digital  and so one of the consequences of that i believe is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now
 tv film video that basically becomes one media platform and while there 's many differences in some senses they will share more and more in common with each other so that the
  the laws of media such as the fact that copies have no value the value 's in the uncopiable things the immediacy the authentication
  the personalization 
 the media wants to be liquid 
 the reason why things are free is  so that you can manipulate them not so that they are free as in beer but free as in freedom 
 and the network effects rule meaning that the more you have the more you get the first fax machine the person who bought the first fax machine was an idiot
  there was nobody to fax to 
 but here she became an evangelist  
 recruiting others to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable those are the effects that we 're going to see attention is the currency  
 so those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media  
 and the other thing about about this embodiment is that there 's kind of what i call the mcluhan reversal mcluhan was saying
  machines are the extensions of the human senses and i 'm saying humans are now going to be the extended
 senses of the machine in a certain sense  so we have a trillion eyes and ears and touches through all our digital photographs and cameras and we see  that in things like flickr
 or photosynth 
  program from microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it in a certain sense the machine is seeing
 through the pixels of individual cameras  now the second thing that i want to talk about was this idea of restructuring 
 that what the web is doing is restructuring  and i have to warn you that what we 'll talk about is i 'm going to give my explanation of a term you 're hearing which is a semantic web 
 so first of all the first stage that we 've seen
 of the internet was that it was going to link computers  and that 's what we called the net that was the internet of nets  and we saw that where you have all the computers of the world and
 if you remember it was a kind of green screen with cursors and there was really not much to do and if you wanted to connect it you connected it from one computer to another computer  
 and what you had to do was if you wanted to participate in this you had to share packets of of information  
 so you were forwarding
  on you didn 't have control it wasn 't like a telephone system where you had control of a line you had to share packets the second stage
 that we 're in now is the idea of linking pages 
 so in the old one if i wanted to go on to an airline web page i went from my computer to an ftp site to another
 airline computer now we have pages the unit has been resolved into pages so one page links to another page and
  if i want to go in to book a flight i go into the airline 's flight page  the website of the airline  and i 'm linking to that page  
 and what we 're sharing were links  so you had to be kind of open with links  you couldn 't deny if someone wanted to link to you you couldn 't stop them  you had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody  
 so that 's what we were doing
  entering to the third stage which is what i 'm talking about and that is where we link the data  so i don 't know what the name of this thing is i 'm calling it the one machine  but we 're linking data so we 're going from
  machine to machine from page to page and now data to data  so the difference is is that
  on a page to another idea rather than to the other page  so every idea is basically being supported or every item  or every noun is being supported by the entire web it 's being resolved
 at the level of items or ideas  or words if you want so besides physically coming out again into this idea that it 's not just
 virtual it 's actually going out to things so
 something will will resolve
 down to the information about a particular person so every person will have a unique id every person every item will have a something that will be very specific and will link to a specific representation of that idea or item  
 so now in this new one when i
 link to it i would link to my particular flight my particular seat  
 and so giving an example of this
  i live in pacifica  rather than right now pacifica is just sort of a name on the web somewhere the web doesn 't know that that is actually a town and that it 's a specific town that i live in 
 but that 's what we 're going to be talking about it 's going to link directly to it will know the web will be able to read itself and know that that actually is a place 
  and that whenever it sees that word pacifica it knows that it actually has a place latitude longitude a certain population
  here are some of the technical terms all three letter things that you 'll see a lot more of all these things are about enabling this this idea of linking to the data
  so i 'll give you one kind of an example there 's like a billion social sites on the web  
 each time you go into there you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are why should you be doing that you should just do that once 
 and it should know who all your friends are so that 's what you want is all your friends are identified and you should just carry
  relationships around all this data about you should just be conveyed and you should do it once and that 's all that should happen and you should have all the networks
 of all the relationships between those pieces of data that 's what we 're moving into where it sort of knows these things down to that level a semantic web web three point zero 
 giant global graph we 're kind of trying out what we want to
  's doing is sharing data so you have to be open to having your data shared  which is a much bigger step than just sharing your web page or your computer  
 and all these things that are going to be on this are not just
 pages  they are things everything we 've described every artifact or place will be a specific representation will have a
  character that can be linked to directly so we have this database of things  
 and so there 's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to that we won 't see in the next ten years or five thousand days  but i think that 's where we 're going to  and as the internet of things
  where i 'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane that that physical thing becomes part of the web  and so we are in the middle of this thing that 's completely linked down to every object in the little sliver of a connection that it has
 so the last thing i want to talk about is this idea that we 're going to be codependent 
 it 's always going to be there  
 and the closer it is the better if you allow google to it will tell you your search history and i found out by looking at it
 that i search most at eleven o 'clock in the morning  
 so i am open and being transparent to that and i think total personalization in this new world will require total
  transparency  
 that is going to be the price if you want to have total personalization you have to be totally transparent 
 google i can 't remember my phone number i 'll just ask google 
 we 're so dependent on this that i have now gotten to the point where i don 't even try to remember things i 'll just google it it 's easier to do that and we kind of object at first saying oh 
 that 's awful but if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology called the alphabet and writing  
 we 're totally dependent
  transformed culture we cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing  
 and so in the same way we 're going to not imagine ourselves without this other machine being there  
 and what is happening with this is some kind of ai but it 's not the ai in conscious ai as being an expert larry page told me that that 's what they 're trying to do and that 's what they 're trying to do 
 but when six billion humans are googling who 's searching who
 goes both ways  so we are the web  that 's what this thing is we are going to be the machine  so the next five thousand days 
 it 's not going to be the web and only better
  just like it wasn 't tv and only better the next
 five thousand days it 's not just going to be the web but only better it 's going to be something different and i think
  's going to be smarter it 'll have an intelligence in there that 's
 not again conscious but it 'll anticipate what we 're doing 
 in a good sense  
 secondly it 's become much more personalized it will know us  and that 's good and again the price of that will be transparency  
 and thirdly  it 's going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment and we will be in the middle of it 
 and all these devices will be portals into that
 so the single idea that i wanted to leave with you is that
 we have to begin to think about this as not just the web only better but a new kind of stage in this development it looks more global if you take this whole thing 
 it is a very big machine  very reliable machine  more reliable than its parts
  we can also think about it
 as kind of a large organism  so we might
 respond to it more as if this was a whole system more as if this wasn 't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with
  it 's a one and i don 't know what else to call it  than the one we 'll have a better word for it but
 there 's a unity of some sort that 's starting to emerge  and again i don 't want to talk about consciousness i want to talk about it just as if it
  or a volvox which is what that organism is
