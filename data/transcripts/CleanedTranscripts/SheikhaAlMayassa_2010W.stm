  both myself and my brother belong to the under thirty demographic  which pat said makes seventy percent but according to our statistics it makes sixty percent of the region 's population 
 qatar is no exception to the region it 's a very young nation led by young people we have been
  reminiscing about the latest technologies and the ipods and for me the abaya my traditional dress that i 'm wearing today  
 now this is not a religious garment nor is it a religious statement  instead  it 's a diverse cultural statement that we choose to wear 
 now i remember a few years ago 
 a journalist asked dr sheikha who 's sitting here  president of qatar university who by the way is a woman
 he asked her whether she thought the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way 
 her answer was quite the contrary  
 instead she felt more free 
 more free because she could wear whatever she wanted under the abaya she could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care 
 not that you do
  just like the indian lady could wear her sari or the japanese woman could wear her kimono  
 we are changing our culture from within  but at the same time we are reconnecting with our traditions  
 we know that modernization is happening and yes qatar wants to be a modern nation but at the same time we are reconnecting and reasserting our arab heritage 
 it 's important for us to grow organically  and we continuously make the conscious
  decision to reach that balance in fact  research has shown that the more the world is flat if i use tom friedman 's analogy or global 
 the more and more people are wanting to be different and for us young people they 're looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves  
 which is why i prefer the richard wilk analogy of globalizing the local and localizing the
  global  we don 't want to be all the same but we want to respect each other and understand each other and therefore tradition becomes more important not less important  
 life necessitates a universal world however we believe in the security of having a local identity  
 and this is what the leaders of this region are trying to do  
 we 're trying to be part of this global village but at the same time we 're revising
  ourselves through our cultural institutions and cultural development  
 i 'm a representation of that phenomenon  
 and i think a lot of people in this room i can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself and i 'm sure although we can 't see the people in washington they are in the same position we 're continuously 
  trying to straddle different worlds different cultures and trying to meet the challenges of a different expectation from ourselves
  and from others  
 so i want to ask a question what should culture in the 21st century look like 
 in a time where the world is becoming personalized when the mobile phone the burger the telephone everything has its own personal identity how should we perceive ourselves 
 and how should we perceive others  how does that impact our desert culture 
  cultural developments happening in the region and the more recent museum of islamic art opened in qatar in two thousand and eight 
 i myself am personalizing these cultural developments  but i also understand that this has to be done organically  
 yes  we do have all the resources that we need in order to develop new cultural institutions
  what i think is more important is that we are very fortunate to have visionary leaders who understand that this can 't happen from outside it has to come from within  
 and guess what you might be surprised to know that most people in the gulf who are leading leading these cultural initiatives happen to be women 
 i want to ask you why do you think this is 
 is it because it 's a soft option we have nothing else to do no i don 't think so i think that
  women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally 
 it 's a natural component for bringing people together discussing ideas in the same way we 're doing here at ted we 're
 here we 're part of a community  sharing out ideas and discussing them 
 art becomes a very important part of our national identity 
 the existential
  and social and political impact
 an artist has on his nation 's development of cultural identity is very important 
 you know art and culture is big business  ask me ask the chairpersons and ceos of sotheby 's and christie 's ask charles saatchi about great art 
 they make a lot of money so i think women in our society are becoming leaders
  because they realize that
 for their future generations it 's very important to maintain our cultural identities  
 why else do greeks demand the return of the elgin marbles  and why is there an uproar when a private collector tries to sell his collection to a foreign museum 
 why does it take me months
  months on end to get an export license from london or new york in order to get pieces into my country 
 in few hours shirin neshat my friend from iran who 's a very important artist for us will be talking to you she lives in new york city but she doesn 't
 try to be a western artist  instead she tries to engage in a very important dialogue about her culture nation and heritage she does that through
  important visual forms of photography and film 
 in the same way qatar is trying to grow its national museums through an organic process from within  
 our mission is of cultural integration and independence  we don 't want to have what there is in the west we don 't want their collections we want to build our own identities our own fabric 
  create an open dialogue so that we share our ideas and share yours with us 
  modern art we have done extensive research to ensure that arab and muslim artists  and arabs who are not muslims not all arabs are muslims by the way but we make sure that they are represented in this new institution 
 this institution is is 
 and it has been the case for the past three decades 
  we will open the museum in a few days and i welcome all of you to get on qatar airways and come and join us 
 now this museum is just as important to us as the west  
 some of you might have heard of the algerian artist baya mahieddine 
 but i doubt a lot of people know that this artist worked in picasso 's studio in paris in the
  for me it was a new discovery and i think with time in the years to come we 'll be learning a lot about our picassos our legers and our cezannes  we do have artists but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet  
 now visual expression is just one form of of culture integration 
 we have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of youtube and social networking to express their stories share their
  photos and tell their own stories through their own voices in a similar way we have created the doha film institute  
 now the doha film institute is an organization to teach people about film and filmmaking  last year we didn 't have one qatari woman filmmaker 
 today i am proud to say we have trained and educated over sixty six qatari women filmmakers to edit tell their own stories in their own voices
 now if you 'll allow me i would love to share a one minute film that has proven to show that a 60 sec film can be as powerful 
  as a haiku in telling a big picture  and this is one of our filmmakers ' products
 the
  going back to straddling between east and west  last month we had our second doha tribeca film festival here in doha 
 the doha tribeca film festival was held at our new cultural hub katara it attracted forty two thousand
  now the doha tribeca film festival is not an imported festival  but rather an important festival between the cities of new york and doha  
 it 's important for two things  first it allows us to showcase our arab filmmakers and voices to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world new york city  
 at the same time we are inviting them to come and explore our part of the world  they 're learning our culture our language our heritage and realizing we
  're just as different and just the same as each other  
 now over and over again people have said let 's build bridges and frankly i want to do more than that i would like break the walls of ignorance between 
  east and west no not the soft option that we have discussed before  but rather the soft power that joseph nye has spoken about before 
  bring people together we should not underestimate it know thyself that is the journey of 
  that we are traveling  now i don 't pretend to have all the answers  but i know that me as an individual and we as a nation welcome this community of ideas worth spreading 
  very interesting journey i
 welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions  
 familiarity destroys and trumps fear try it ladies and gentlemen thank you very much shokran
