  this room may appear to be holding six hundred people but there 's actually so many more because in each one of us
 there is a multitude of personalities
  i have two primary personalities that have been in conflict and conversation within me since i was a little girl
  girl  i call them the mystic and the warrior 
 i was born into a family of politically active intellectual atheists there was this equation in my family that went something like this if you are intelligent you therefore are not spiritual 
 i was the freak of the family
  i was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks about the worlds that might exist beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses i wanted 
  to know if what we human beings see and hear
  then a wonderful thing happened when i was in high school  gurus from the east started washing up on the shores of america
  and i said to myself i wanna get me one of them 
 and ever since i 've been walking the mystic path  trying to peer beyond what
  so what did he mean by this i 'll show you take a breath right now of this clear air in this room 
 now see this strange  underwater  coral 
 it 's actually a person
  and those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now all around us
  if we 're blind to this simple biology  imagine what we 're missing
 at the smallest subatomic level right now
 and at the grandest cosmic levels my years as a mystic
 have made me question almost all my assumptions they 've made me a
  proud
 now when the mystic part of me jabbers on and on like this the warrior rolls her eyes  she 's
 concerned about what 's happening in this world right now  she 's
 worried  she
  'm pissed off and i know a few things and we better get busy about them right now i 've spent my life as a warrior  working for women 's issues  working on political campaigns 
 being an activist for the environment  
 and it can be sort 
 housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body  i 've always been attracted to those rare people
 who pull that off who
 devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic
 people like martin luther king jr who wrote i can never be what i ought to be
 until you are what you ought to be this he wrote is the interrelated structure of reality
  another mystic warrior who said the problem with the world is that we draw the circle of our family too small 
 and nelson mandela who lives by the african concept of ubuntu which means i need you
 in order to be me and you need me in order to be you now we all love to trot out
 these three mystic warriors as if
 they were born with the saint gene  but we all actually have the same capacity that they do  
 and we need to do their work now i 'm deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures are
  by the voice we 're giving to the most divisive among us listen to these titles of some of the bestselling books from both sides of the political divide here in the u s 
 liberalism is a mental disorder 
 rush limbaugh is a big fat idiot
 now here 's a title that may sound familiar but whose author may surprise you
  of struggle against lies stupidity and 
 who wrote that that was adolf hitler 's first title for mein kampf my struggle the book that launched the nazi party 
 the worst eras in human history whether
  in cambodia or germany or rwanda they start like this with negative
 and then they morph into violent extremism this is why i 'm launching a new initiative  and
 it 's it 's to help all of us myself included to counteract
  i realize we 're all busy people so don 't worry you can do this on a lunch break i 'm calling my initiative take the other to lunch 
 if you are a
 republican 
 you can take a democrat to lunch  or if you 're
 a democrat think of it as taking a republican to lunch  now if the idea of taking any
  of these people to lunch makes you lose your appetite  i suggest you start more local because there is no shortage of the other
 right in your own neighborhood  maybe that person who worships at the mosque 
 or the church or the synagogue down the street
  someone from the other side of the abortion
 conflict or maybe your brother in law who doesn 't believe in global warming  
 anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you or
 whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears a couple of weeks ago  i took a conservative
  tea party woman to lunch  now on paper she passed my smoking ears test
  she 's an activist from the right  and i 'm an activist from the left
  and we used some guidelines to keep our conversation elevated and you can use them too  because i know you 're all going to take an other to lunch  
 so first of all decide on a goal to get to know one person from a group you may
  have negatively stereotyped  
 and then before you get together  agree on some ground rules my tea party lunchmate and i came up with these 
 don 't persuade defend or interrupt  be curious be conversational be
  and listen 
 from there we dove in and we used these questions  share some of your life experiences with me 
 what issues deeply concern you  
 and what have you always wanted to ask someone from the other side 
 my lunch partner and i came away with some really important insights and i 'm going to share just one with you i think it has relevance to any problem between people
 anywhere  i asked her why her side makes such outrageous allegations and lies about my side
  we called them brainless gun toting racists  
 and we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people we actually know 
 and since we had established some trust we believed in each other 's sincerity 
 we agreed we 'd speak up in our own communities
 when we witnessed the kind of
 that can wound and fester into paranoia
 and then be used by those on the fringes to incite 
 by the end of our lunch we acknowledged each other 's openness neither of us had tried to change the other 
 but we also hadn 't pretended that our differences were just going to melt away after a lunch
 instead we had taken first steps together  
 past our knee jerk reactions to the ubuntu place which is the only place where solutions to our most 
 problems will be found
  who should you invite to lunch  next time you catch yourself in the act of otherizing that will be your clue
  and what might happen at your lunch will the heavens open and we are the world play over the restaurant sound system  
 probably not  
 because ubuntu work is slow  and it 's difficult it 's two people
 dropping the pretense of being
  people two warriors dropping their weapons and reaching toward each other 
 here 's how the great persian poet rumi put it
