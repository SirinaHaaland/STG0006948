  this machine which we all have residing in our skulls reminds me of an aphorism of
 a comment of woody allen to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull  and it 's this machine  and it 's constructed for
  it 's all about change  it confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can 't do today things today that we couldn 't do yesterday  and of course it 's born stupid  
 the last time you were in the presence of a baby this happens to be my granddaughter mitra  isn 't she fabulous 
 but nonetheless when she popped out despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing in its development for several months before on the basis of her experiences in the womb
 nonetheless she had very limited abilities as does every infant
 at the time
  normal natural full term birth  if we were to assay her
 perceptual abilities they would be crude there is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on in fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability
 in a very young infant infants don 't respond to much  there is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on
  and they can only in a very primitive way and in a very limited way control their movements it would be several months before this infant could do something as simple as reach out and grasp under voluntary control an object and retrieve it usually to the mouth
  and it will be some months beforeward
  and we see a long steady progression of the evolution from the first wiggles 
 to rolling over and sitting up and crawling  standing walking before we get to that magical point in which we can motate in the world
  and yet when we look forward in the brain we see really remarkable advance 
 by this age the brain can actually store it has stored recorded can fastly retrieve
 the meanings of thousands  tens of thousands of objects actions and their relationships in the world and those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of
  potentially millions of ways by this age
 the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities  and it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills this brain is very much a thinking machine  
 and by this age there is absolutely no question
 that this brain  
 it has a person on board  and in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self development 
 and by this age we see a remarkable evolution in its capacity to control movement
  has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously 
 in a complex sequence in complex ways as would be required for example for playing a complicated game like soccer  
 now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head  and where this boy comes from sao paulo brazil about forty percent of boys of his age have this ability 
 you could go out into the community
 in monterey
 and you 'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability and if you did he 'd probably be from sao paulo that 's all another way of saying
 that our individual skills and abilities are very much shaped by our environments
 that environment extends into our contemporary culture  the thing our brain is challenged with 
 because what we 've done in our personal evolutions is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities that are specific to
  our own individual histories  and in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind in the way that in fact no two of us are quite alike 
 every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities that all derive out of the plasticity 
 the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine 
 in an adult brain of course we 've built up
 a large repertoire of mastered skills and
  abilities that we can perform more or less automatically from memory and that define us as acting moving thinking
 creatures  
 now we study this as the nerdy  laboratory university based scientists that we are 
 by engaging the brains of animals like rats  or monkeys or of this particularly curious creature
 one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth
 to engage
  them in learning new skills and abilities  and we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired  in fact we do this in individuals
 of any age  in these different species that is to say from infancies  infancy up to adulthood and old age 
 so we might engage a rat for example to acquire a new skill or ability that might involve the rat using its paw to master particular
  manual grasp
 behaviors just like we might examine a child
 and their ability to acquire the sub skills or the general overall skill of accomplishing something like mastering the ability to read 
 or you might look in an older individual who has mastered a complex set of abilities that might relate to reading musical notation or performing the mechanical acts of performance
 that apply to musical performance from these studies we defined two
  great epochs
 of the plastic history of the brain  the first great epoch is commonly called the critical period 
 and that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form its basic processing machinery this is actually a period of dramatic change
 in which it doesn 't take learning per se to drive the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain  all it takes for example in the sound domain is exposure to
  sound  and the brain actually is at the mercy of the sound environment in which it is reared so for example i can rear an animal
 in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound 
 a repertoire of sound that i make up that i make just by exposure artificially important to the animal
  and its young brain  and what i see is that the animal 's brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form that 's idealized within the limits of its processing achievements
 to represent it in an organized and orderly way
 the sound doesn 't have to be valuable to the animal 
 i could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable like the sounds that simulate the sounds of a native language of a child and i see the brain actually
 develop a processor that is specialized
 specialized for that complex array a repertoire of sounds it actually exaggerates their separateness of representation in multi dimensional neuronal representational terms  
 or i can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound i can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan 
 in the presence of continuous noise
  and when i do that i actually specialize the brain
 to be a master processor for that meaningless sound  and i frustrate its ability to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence 
 such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies
 and they account for for example the beautiful evolution of a language specific processor in every normally developing baby  
 and so they also account for
 development of defective processing
  in a substantial population of children who are more limited as a consequence  in their language abilities at an older age  now
 in this early period of plasticity the brain actually changes outside of a learning context 
 i don 't have to be paying attention to what i hear  the input doesn 't really have to be meaningful i don 't have to be in a behavioral context 
 this is required so the brain sets
  up it 's processing
 so that it can act differentially  so that it can act selectively so that the creature that that wears it that carries it 
 can begin to operate on it in a selective way 
 in the next great epoch of life which applies for most of life the brain is actually refining its machinery
 as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities and in this epoch which extends from late in the first
  year of life
 to death it 's actually doing this under behavioral control  
 and that 's another way of saying the brain has strategies that define the significance of the input to the brain  
 and it 's focusing on skill after skill or ability after ability under specific attentional control it 's a function
  whether a goal in a behavior is achieved or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior  
 this is actually very powerful 
 this lifelong capacity for plasticity for brain change is powerfully expressed it is the basis of our real differentiation one individual from another 
 you can look down in the brain of an animal that 's engaged in a specific skill  and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels 
  so here is a very simple experiment it was actually conducted about five years ago in collaboration with scientists from the university of provence
 in marseilles it 's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained in a task that involves it
 manipulating a tool
 that 's equivalent in its difficulty to to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon 
 the monkey actually mastered the task in about seven hundred practice tries  
 so in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all it had a success rate of about one in eight tries
  tries 
 those tries were elaborate each attempt was substantially different from the other  but the monkey gradually developed a strategy  
 and seven hundred or so tries later the monkey is performing it flawlessly never fails he 's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time
 at this point the task is being performed in a beautifully stereotyped
  very beautifully regulated and highly repeated trial to trial 
 we can look down in the brain of the monkey  and we see that it 's distorted we can track these changes and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time and here we see
 the distortion reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey  
 now this is a map down in the surface of the brain in which in a very elaborate experiment we 've reconstructed the responses location
  in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons 
 we see here a reconstruction of how the hand is represented in the brain 
 we 've actually distorted the map by the exercise and that is indicated in the pink we have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger these are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool if
 we look at the selectivity of responses in the cortex of the monkey  we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fingertips
  that are engaged in other words there is still a single  simple representation of the fingertips in this most organized of cortical areas of the surface of the skin of the body 
 monkey has like you have 
 and yet now it 's represented in substantially finer grain the monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces  
 and that is an unknown unsuspected maybe by you
 part of acquiring the skill or ability  now actually we 've looked in
  different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task and each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability so for example we can look to the cortical area
 that represents input that 's controlling the posture of the monkey  
 we look in cortical areas that control specific movements and the sequences of movements that are required in the behavior and so forth 
 they are all remodeled they all become specialized for the task at hand 
 there are fifteen or twenty cortical
 that are changed specifically
 when you learn a simple skill like this  and that represents in your brain  really massive change  
 it represents the change in a reliable way of the responses of tens of millions  possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain  
 it represents changes of hundreds of millions  possibly billions of synaptic connections in your brain this is constructed by physical change
  and the level of construction that occurs is massive  
 think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior behavior abilities in general or acquiring their native language abilities  
 the changes are massive 
 what it 's all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the
  because in most of the life of the brain this is under control of behavioral context  it 's what you pay attention to  it 's what 's rewarding to you  
 it 's what the brain regards itself as positive and important to you 
 it 's all about cortical processing and forebrain specialization  
 and that underlies your specialization that is why you in your many skills and abilities are a unique specialist 
 a specialist that 's vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual one hundred years ago
 enormously different
 in the details from the brain of the average individual one thousand years ago now one of the characteristics of this change process
 is that information is always related to other inputs or information that is occurring
 in immediate time in context  and that 's because the brain is constructing representations of things that are correlated in little moments of time
 and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time the brain is recording all information and driving all change
 in temporal context  now overwhelmingly the most powerful context that 's occurred in your brain is you 
 billions of events have occurred in your history
 that are related in time to yourself
  as the receiver  or yourself as the actor yourself as the thinker yourself as the mover  
 billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body
 that are always associated with you as the receiver and that result in
 the embodiment
 of you you are constructed your self is constructed
 from these billions of events it 's constructed it 's created in your brain  and it 's created in the brain via physical
  change  this is a marvelously constructed thing that results in individual form
 because each one of us has vastly different histories  
 and vastly different experiences  that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self of personhood  now we 've used this research to try to understand 
  not just how a normal person develops  and elaborates their skills and abilities  but also try to
  understand
 the origins of impairment  and the origins of
 differences or variations that might limit the capacities of a child or an adult i 'm going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain 
 approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user
  and thereafter as a reader  
 and i 'm going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age  
 and then by using it in a targeted approach we 're going to try to differentiate
 the machinery to recover function in old age 
 so the first example i 'm going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments
  we now have a large body of literature that demonstrates that the fundamental problem that occurs in the majority of children
 that have early language impairments and that are going to struggle to learn to read is that their language processor is created in a defective form 
 and the reason that it rises in a defective form
 is because early in the baby 's brain 's life
 the machine process is noisy  it 's that simple
 signal to noise problem 
 okay  and there are a lot of things that contribute to that there are numerous inherited faults that could make the machine process noisier now
 i might say the noise problem could also occur
 on the basis of information provided
 in the world from the ears  if any those of you who are older in the audience know that when i was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate
 was born with what we called mental retardation 
 we knew that they were going to be slow cognitively  we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities  
 and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read 
 most of them would be intellectual and academic failures that 's disappeared  that no
  that inherited weakness that inherited condition
 has evaporated  we don 't hear about that anymore where did it go well
 it was understood by a dutch surgeon
  about thirty five years ago that if you simply fix the problem early enough 
 when the brain is still in this initial plastic period so it can set up this machinery adequately in this initial set up time in the critical period 
 none of that happens  what are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it 
 you 're basically opening up the tubes that drain
  fluid from the middle ears  which have had them reliably full 
 every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled  it 's degraded the child 's native language is such a case is not english  
 it 's not japanese  it 's muffled english  it 's degraded japanese  it 's crap  
 and the brain specializes for it it creates a representation of language crap  and then the child is stuck with it
 now the crap doesn 't just happen in the ear it can also happen in the brain  the brain itself can be noisy it 's commonly noisy  
 there are many inherited faults that can make it noisier  and the native language for a child with such a brain
 is degraded  it 's not english  it 's noisy english and that results in defective representations of sounds of words
 not normal
  a different strategy by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants and you can look in the brain of such a child
 and record those time constants they are about an order of magnitude longer 
 about eleven times longer in duration on average than in a normal child space constants are about three times greater
 such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain of course they will because as a
  receiver of language they are receiving it and representing it and in information it 's representing
 crap and they are going to have poor reading skills  because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds
 into this orthographic or visual
 representational form  if you don 't have a brain representation of word sounds that translation makes no sense  and you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology
 then these children increasingly
 in evaluation after evaluation in their operations in language and their operations in reading we document that abnormal neurology  
 the point is is that you can train the brain out of this a way to think about this is you can actually re refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it 
 changing it in detail it takes about thirty hours on the average  and we 've accomplished that in about four hundred and thirty thousand kids today
 actually  probably about fifteen thousand children are being trained as we speak 
 and actually when you look at the impacts the impacts are substantial so here we 're looking at the normal distribution  what we 're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution this is from about three thousand children 
 you can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right
  this is in a broad assessment of their language abilities this is like an iq test for language the impact in the distribution if you trained every child in the united states would be to shift the whole distribution to the right and narrow the distribution  
 this is a substantially large impact think of a classroom of children of children in the language arts  think of the children on the slow side of the class  
 we have the potential to move most of those children to the middle or to the right side 
 in addition to accurate language training
 it also fixes memory and cognition speech
  fluency and speech production 
 and an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training that is to say reading and to a large extent it fixes the brain you can look down in the brain of a child
 in a variety of tasks that scientists have at stanford  and mit  and ucsf and ucla and a number of other
  and children operating in various language behaviors  
 or in various reading behaviors  you see for the most extent for most children their neuronal responses complexly abnormal before you start 
 are normalized by the training 
 now you can also take the same approach
 to address problems in aging where again the machinery is deteriorating
 now from competent machinery  it 's going south noise is increasing in the brain  and learning modulation and control is deteriorating
  and you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which for example the brain is representing language again
 just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning  it 's going back into chaos in the end
 this results in declines in memory
 in cognition  and in postural ability and agility 
  turns out you can train the brain of such an individual this is a small population of such individuals train equally intensively for about thirty hours these are 
 and what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory of their ability to remember things after a delay 
 of their ability to control their attention their language abilities and visual spatial abilities  
 the overall neuropsychological index of these trained individuals in this population
 is about two standard deviations  that means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution and i 'm looking at your
  abilities  the average person has moved
 to the middle or the right side of the distribution  it means that most people who are at risk for senility more or less immediately are now in a protected position  
 my issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers because i think this can be done in this arena
  on a vast scale
 and the same for kids my main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies  i 'm specifically interested in things like autism and cerebral palsy these great childhood catastrophes  
 and in older age conditions like parkinsonism and
