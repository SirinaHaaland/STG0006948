  if you 're at all like me this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in san francisco  you build experimental kite powered hydrofoils capable of more than thirty knots
  and you realize that there is incredible power in the wind  and it can do amazing things
  and one day a vessel not unlike this will probably break the world speed record  
 but kites aren 't just toys like this kites i 'm going to give you a brief history and tell you about the magnificent future of every child 's favorite plaything  
 so kites are more than a thousand years old and the chinese used them for military applications and even for
  so they knew at that stage they could carry large weights i 'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man 
 in one thousand eight hundred and twenty seven a fellow called george pocock actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies in races against horse carriages across the english countryside  
 then of course at the dawn of aviation  all of the great inventors of the time like hargreaves like langley even alexander graham bell inventor of the telephone who was flying this kite were doing so in the pursuit of aviation
 then these two fellows came along  
 and they were flying kites to develop the control systems that would ultimately enable powered human flight  so this is of course orville and wilbur wright  and the wright flyer  
 and their experiments with kites led to this momentous occasion where we powered up and took off for the 
  and that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation  but unfortunately it relegated kites once again to be considered children 's toys that was until the 1970s where we had the last energy crisis  
 and a fabulous man called miles loyd who lives on the outskirts of san francisco  wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored in the journal of energy about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string to generate enormous amounts of electricity 
 the real key observation
  he made is that a free flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a  fixed wing turbine  
 so turbines grew and they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height  but they can 't really go a lot higher  and more height is where the more wind is and more power as much as twice as much 
 so cut to now we still have an energy crisis and now we have a climate crisis as well
  well you
 know so humans generate about twelve trillion watts or twelve terawatts from fossil fuels  
 and al gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets  
 and in reality what that means is in the next thirty to forty years we have to make ten
 trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow wind is the second largest renewable resource after solar
  terawatts more than enough to supply humanity two hundred times over the majority of it is in the higher altitudes above three hundred feet where we don 't have a technology as yet to get there  
 so this is the dawn of the new age of kites this is our test site on maui flying across the sky i 'm now going to show you the first autonomous generation of power
 by every child 's favorite plaything
  as you can tell you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours it makes you a little nauseous  
 and here we 're actually generating about ten kilowatts so enough to power probably five united states households with a kite not much larger than this piano  
 and the real significant thing here is we 're developing the control systems as did the wright brothers that
  it doesn 't hurt to do it in a location like this either  
 so this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow that 's tracing your name in the sky 
 and this is where we 're actually going so we 're beyond the 12 second steps  and we 're working towards megawatt scale machines that fly at two thousand feet
 and generate tons of clean electricity  so you ask how big are those machines
  this paper plane would be maybe a
 oop that would be enough to power your cell phone your cessna would be two hundred and thirty killowatts 
 if you 'd loan me your gulfstream i 'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt if
 you give me a seven hundred and forty seven i 'll make six megawatts which is more than the largest wind turbines today  and the spruce goose would be a 15 megawatt wing  
 so that is audacious you say  i agree  but audacious is what has happened many times before in history  this is a refrigerator factory
  factory  churning out airplanes for world war ii prior to world war ii they were making one thousand planes a year by one thousand nine hundred and forty five they were making one hundred thousand 
 with this factory and one hundred thousand planes a year we could make all of america 's electricity in about ten years
