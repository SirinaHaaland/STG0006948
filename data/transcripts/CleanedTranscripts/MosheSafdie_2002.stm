  like to talk about is something 
 that was very dear to kahn 's heart which is how do we discover what is really particular about a project  how do you discover the uniqueness
  of a project as unique as as a person because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness has to do with
 dealing with
 the whole force of globalization that the particular is
 central to finding the uniqueness of place and the uniqueness of a program in a building
  and so i 'll take you to wichita kansas 
 where i was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site right downtown
 by the river  and i thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river  part of the river  
 unfortunately though  the site was separated from the river by mclean boulevard so i suggested let 's reroute mclean 
 and that gave birth instantly to friends of mclean boulevard
 and it took six months to reroute it the first
 image i showed the building committee was
 this 
 astronomic observatory of jantar mantar in in jaipur because i talked about what makes a building a building of science
 and it seemed to me that this structure complex  rich and yet totally rational  it 's an instrument had something to do with science and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that 
 and so my first sketch after i left was to say let 's cut the channel
 and
 make an island and make an island building and i got all excited and came back and
 they sort of looked at me in dismay and said an island this used to be an island ackerman island
 and we filled in the channel during the depression to create jobs 
 and so the process began and they said you can 't put it all on an island some of it has to be on the mainland because
 we don 't want to turn our back to the community
  there emerged a design the galleries sort of forming an island and you could walk through them or on the roof  and
 there were all kinds of exciting features you could come in through the landside buildings walk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape if you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof  
 peek in the
 exhibits and then get totally seduced come back
  and pay the five dollars admission 
 and the client was happy well sort of happy because we were four million dollars over the budget 
 but essentially happy but i was still troubled  and i was troubled because i felt this was capricious  it was complex but there was something capricious about
 its complexity it was what i would say  compositional complexity and i felt
 that if i had to fulfill what i talked about a building for science there had to be
  kind of a generating idea some kind of a generating geometry  and this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry
 one with its center deep in the earth for the landside building and a toroid with its center
 in the sky for the island building a toroid
  the surface of a doughnut
 or for some of us a bagel  and
 out of this idea started spinning off many many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities  and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits 
 and
 you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry  
 and finally the building this is the model  and when there were complaints about budget i said
  worth doing the island because you get twice for your money  reflections and here 's the building as it
 opened with a channel overlooking downtown  
 and as seen from downtown  and the bike route 's going right through the building so those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building
  toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building  every beam in this building is the same radius 
 all laminated wood every wall  every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building  every piece of the building works these are the galleries with the light coming in through the
  i was asked to design a children 's memorial museum in a holocaust museum in yad vashem in jerusalem which
  you see here the campus  i was asked to do a building and i was given all the artifacts of clothing and
 and drawings and i felt very troubled i worked on it for months and i couldn 't
 deal with it because i felt people were coming out of the historic museum they are totally saturated with information and to see yet another museum with
 information it would make
  there was a cave on the site  we tunnel into the hill 
 descend through the rock into an underground chamber 
 there 's an anteroom with photographs of children who perished
 and then you come into a large space  there is a single candle flickering in the center
  by an arrangement of
 reflective glasses  it reflects into infinity in all directions  you walk through the space 
 a voice reads the names ages and place of birth of the children this voice does not repeat for six months 
 and then you descend to light and to the north and to life
  discotheque you can 't do that and they shelved the project  and it sat there for ten years and then one day abe spiegel from
 los angeles who had lost his  three year old son at auschwitz came saw the model wrote the check and it got built ten years later  
 so many years after that in
  i was on one of my monthly trips to jerusalem
 and i got a call from the foreign ministry saying we 've got the chief minister
 of the punjab here he is on a state visit  we took him on a
 visit to yad vashem we took him to the children 's memorial  he was extremely moved  he 's demanding to meet the
  could you come down and meet him in tel aviv and i went down and
 chief minister badal said to me 
 we sikhs have suffered a great deal as you have jews  i was very moved by what i saw today  
 we are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people we
 're about to embark on that i 'd like you to come and design it 
 and so you know it 's one of those things that
 you don 't take too seriously  but two weeks
  later  i was in this little town anandpur sahib  outside chandigarh the capital of the punjab and
 the temple and also next to it the fortress
 that the last guru of the sikhs  guru gobind  died in as he wrote the khalsa which
  i got to work and they took me somewhere down there nine kilometers away from the town and the temple and said that 's where we have chosen the location and i said this just doesn 't make any sense
 the pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands they 're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there  let 's get back to the town and walk to the site and i recommended they do it right there on that hill and
  this hill and bridge all the way into the town and as things are a little easier in india  the site was purchased within a week and we were
 working and my proposal was to split the museum into two
 the permanent exhibits at one end the
  and changing exhibitions on the other
 to flood the valley into a series of water gardens and to link it all to the fort and to the downtown  and the structures rise from the sand cliffs they 're built in concrete and sandstones 
 the roofs are
 stainless steel they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself
  pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other  and as you come from the north it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs as you come from the himalayas
 and
 evoking the tradition of the fortress and then i went away for four months
 and there was going to be groundbreaking  and i came back and lo and behold the little model i 'd left behind had been built ten times bigger for public
  within the working drawings  and half a million people gathered for the celebrations  
 you can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning i was renamed
  at work and it will be finished in two years back to yad vashem three years ago after all this episode began 
 yad vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum
 because now washington was built the holocaust museum in washington
 and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information and yad vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point
 they said let 's rebuild the museum but of course the sikhs might give you a job on a platter
 the jews make it hard international competition  phase one phase two phase three 
 and again i felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion that a building the size of the washington building
 fifty thousand square feet will sit on that fragile
  hill and that we will go into galleries
 rooms with doors and sort of of familiar rooms to tell the story of the holocaust  and i proposed that we cut through the mountain 
 that was my first sketch just cut the whole museum through the mountain enter from one side of the mountain come out on the other side of the mountain and then bring light through the mountain into the
 chambers and
 here you see the model a reception building and some underground parking  you cross a bridge you enter this triangular
 room  sixty feet high  which cuts right into the hill and extends right through as you go
 towards the north and all of it then all the
  and you see the openings for the light and at night  just one line of light cuts through the mountain which is a skylight on top of that
 triangle  and all the galleries as you move through them and so on are below grade  and
 there are chambers carved in the rock concrete walls stone  the natural rock when possible with the light shafts this is actually a spanish
  quarry  
 which sort of inspired the kind of spaces that these galleries could be 
 and then coming towards the north  it opens up it bursts out of the mountain into again a view of light and of the city and of
 the jerusalem hills 
 i 'd like to conclude with a project i 've been working on for two months
 it 's the headquarters for the institute of peace
 in washington the u s institute of peace the site chosen is across from the lincoln memorial  you see it there 
 directly on the mall it 's the last building on the mall on access of the roosevelt bridge that comes in from virginia 
  it is something i 'm just beginning to work on 
 but one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site  
 if it were to be anywhere in washington it would be an office building a conference center a place for negotiating peace and so on all of which the building is
 but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the mall and by the lincoln memorial this becomes the structure that is
 the symbol of peace on the mall and that was a lot of heat to
 deal with the first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces
 spaces where research goes on conference centers a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking
 and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition  the plans
  showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry 
 you see the structure as in the sequence of structures on the mall very transparent and inviting and looking in 
 and then as you enter it again  looking in all directions towards the city 
 and what i felt about that building is that it really was a building that had to do with a lightness of being to
 quote kundera that it had to do with whiteness it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with
 optimism and
 this is where it is it 's sort of
 evolving  
 studies for the structure of the roof  which demands maybe new materials  how to make it white  how to make it
  translucent  how to make it glowing how to make it not capricious  
 and here studying in three dimensions  how to give some kind again of
 order a structure not something you feel you could just change because you stop the design of that
  and so it goes 
 i 'd like to conclude by saying something 
 i 'd like to conclude by relating all of what i 've
  and i know it is not a fashionable term these days and certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools but
 it seems to me that all this in one way or the other is a search for beauty 
 beauty in the most profound sense of fit  
 i have a quote that
 beauty connotes humanity  we call a natural object beautiful because we see that its form expresses fitness 
 the perfect fulfillment of function 
 well i would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose  nevertheless beauty as the kind of fit something that tells us that
  all the forces that have to do with our natural environment have been fulfilled and our human environment for that 
 twenty years ago in a conference richard and i were at together  i wrote a poem  
 which seems to me to still hold for me today 
 he who seeks truth shall find beauty  
 he who seeks beauty shall find vanity  he who seeks order shall find gratification 
 he who seeks
  gratification shall be disappointed  he who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings shall find the joy of 
 he who seeks self expression shall fall into the pit of arrogance 
 arrogance is incompatible with nature through nature the nature of the universe and the nature of man  we shall seek truth  if we seek truth we shall find beauty
