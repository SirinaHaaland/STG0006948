  i call myself a body architect  i trained in classical ballet and have a background in architecture and fashion  
 as a body architect  i fascinate with the human body and explore how i can transform it
  i worked at philips electronics in the far future design research lab  looking twenty years into the future  
 i explored the human skin and how technology can transform the body  
 i worked on concepts like an electronic tattoo  which is augmented by touch or dresses that blushed and shivered with light  
 i started my own experiments these were the
  approaches to the high tech conversations i was having these are q tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue 
 i started a collaboration with a friend of mine bart hess he doesn 't normally look like this
 and we used ourselves as models 
 we transformed our apartments into our laboratories and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way 
 we were creating visual imagery provoking human evolution
 whilst i was at philips we discussed this idea of a maybe technology something that wasn 't either switched on or off but in between a maybe that could take the form of a gas or a liquid
 and i became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body so you couldn 't see where the skin ended and the near environment started  
 i set up my studio in the red light district and obsessively wrapped myself in plumbing tubing
 and found a way to redefine the skin and create this dynamic textile 
 i was introduced to robyn the swedish pop star  
 and she was also exploring how technology coexists with raw human emotion  
 and she talked about how technology with these new feathers this new face paint this punk the way that we identify with the world 
 and we made this music video
  fascinated with the idea of what happens when you merge biology with technology  and i remember reading about this idea of being able to reprogram biology in the future  away from disease and aging  
 and i thought about this concept of imagine if we could reprogram our own body odor modify and biologically enhance it  and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other or the way that we attract sexual partners  and would we revert
  back to being more like animals more primal modes of communication  
 i worked with a synthetic biologist  and i created a swallowable perfume which is a cosmetic pill that you eat
 and the fragrance comes out through the skin 's surface when you perspire
  it completely blows apart the way that perfume is and provides a whole new format it 's perfume coming from the inside out
  redefines the role of skin and our bodies become an atomizer  
 i 've learned that there 's no boundaries and if i look at the evolution of my work i can see threads and connections that make sense but when i look towards the future 
 the next project is completely unknown and wide open 
 i feel like i have all these ideas existing embedded inside of me and it 's these conversations and these experiences
  that connect these ideas and they kind of instinctively come out  
 as a body architect  i 've created this limitless and boundless platform for me to discover whatever i want  
 and i feel like i 've just got started 
 so here 's to another day at the office
