  at the break i was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate and this will be my only comment on it and
 that is i understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists 
 what i 'm going to tell you about in my
  eighteen minutes is how we 're about to switch from reading the genetic code
 to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves
  it 's only ten years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free living organism that of haemophilus influenzae 
 that took a genome
 project from thirteen years down to four months 
 we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours  
 so in the last decade a large number of genomes have been added  most human pathogens 
 a couple of plants several insects
 and several mammals including the human genome  
 genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over ten years ago was by the end of this
  year we might have between three and five genomes sequenced it
 's on the order of several hundred 
 we just got a grant from the gordon and betty moore foundation to sequence one hundred and thirty genomes this year 
 as a side project from environmental organisms  
 so the rate of reading the genetic code has
  but as we look what 's out there  we 've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet  
 most people don 't realize it because they 're invisible  but microbes make up about a half of the earth 's biomass  
 whereas all animals only make up about one one thousandth of all the biomass  and maybe it 's something that people in oxford don 't do very often but if you ever
  make it to the sea and you swallow a mouthful of seawater  keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria
 and on the order of ten million viruses  less than five thousand microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago and so we decided to do something about it and we started the sorcerer ii expedition 
 where we were as with great oceanographic expeditions trying to sample the ocean every two hundred miles  
 we started in bermuda
 for our test project then moved up to halifax working down the u s east coast  
 the caribbean sea  the panama canal through to the galapagos  then across the pacific
 and we 're in the process now of working our way across the indian ocean it
 's very tough duty we 're doing this on a sailing vessel in part to help excite young people
 about going into science  the experiments are
  incredibly simple we just take seawater and we filter it and we collect different size organisms on different filters 
 and then take their dna back to our lab in rockville where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every twenty four hours  
 and with doing this we 've made some amazing discoveries 
 for example it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes there was only one or
  two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments 
 it turns out almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors and use sunlight
 as the source of their energy
 and communication from one site from one barrel of
  we discovered one point three million new genes and as many as fifty thousand new species  
 we 've extended this to the air now with a grant from the sloan foundation 
 we 're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day  
 particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums 
 laughter we filter through some simple apparatuses we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering
 on top of a building in new york city and we 're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time 
 just on the data collection side just where we are through the galapagos  we 're finding that almost every two hundred miles we see tremendous diversity
 in the samples in the ocean some of these make logical sense in terms of different temperature gradients so this is a satellite
 photograph based on temperatures red being warm blue being cold
 and we found there 's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples in terms of abundant species 
 the other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light
  and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence and these vary tremendously from region to region 
 maybe not surprisingly in the deep ocean where it 's mostly blue 
 the photoreceptors tend to see blue light  when there 's a lot of chlorophyll around they see a lot of green light
 but they vary even more possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the
  just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was we assembled all the data
 including all of ours thus far from the expedition which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet and it totaled around twenty nine million genes  
 and we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are are we just discovering new members of known families or are
  and it turns out we have about fifty thousand major gene families  but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families 
  so we 're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes 
  up on the upper right hand corner with the animals 
 of those roughly twenty nine million genes we only have around twenty four thousand in our genome
 and if you take all animals together we probably share less than thirty thousand and probably
 maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families  i view that
  these genes are now not only the design components of evolution and we think in a gene centric view maybe going back to richard dawkins ' ideas than in a genome centric view 
 which are different constructs of these gene components 
 synthetic dna the ability to synthesize dna has changed at sort of the same pace
 that dna sequencing has over the last decade or
  and is getting very rapid and very cheap our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five 
 and that from mycoplasma genitalium  
 and we have really nice t shirts that say you know i heart my genitalium this is actually just a microorganism
  but it
 it has roughly five hundred genes  haemophilus had
  hundred genes and we simply asked the question if one species needs eight hundred another five hundred is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system  
 so we started doing transposon mutagenesis transposons are just small pieces of dna that randomly insert in the genetic code and if they insert in the middle of the gene they disrupt its function  
 so we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those
  but it turns out the environment is very critical for this and you
 can only define an essential or non essential gene based on exactly what 's in the environment 
 we also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach
 with the genomes of thirteen related organisms and we tried to compare all
  to see what they had in common  and we got these overlapping circles and we found only one hundred and seventy three genes common
 to all thirteen organisms  
 the pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around three hundred and ten or so 
 so we think that we can expand or contract genomes depending on your point of view here to maybe three hundred to four hundred genes from the minimal of five hundred
 the only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them  
 and we had to do this in a cassette based fashion we found that synthesizing accurate dna in large pieces was extremely difficult
 ham smith and clyde hutchison my colleagues on this developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize
  that was one hundred percent accurate 
 in terms of its sequence and its biology it was a quite exciting experiment when we just took the synthetic piece of dna  injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden 
 that dna started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria this was not the first synthetic virus a polio virus had been made a year before
 but it was only one ten thousandth as active and it took three years to do this is a cartoon of the structure of phi x one hundred and seventy four this is a 
  case where the software now builds its own hardware  and that 's the notions that we have with biology 
  recent testimony before a senate committee and a special committee the u s government has set up to review this area  
 and i think it 's important to keep reality in mind versus what happens with people 's imaginations  basically any virus that 's been sequenced today that genome can be made 
 and people immediately freak out about things about ebola or
  but the dna from this organism is not infective so even if somebody made the smallpox genome that dna itself would not cause infections  
 the real concern that security departments have is designer viruses 
 and there 's only two countries the u s and the former soviet union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents 
 if that research is truly discontinued there should be very little activity
 on the know how to make designer viruses in the future i think single cell organisms are possible within two years
 and possibly eukaryotic cells those that we have are possible within a decade so we 're now making
 several dozen different constructs
  because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome the key is how do you put all of the others we start with these fragments  
 and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those
 into a chromosome 
 this is derived from an organism deinococcus radiodurans that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed 
 it reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about twelve to
 twenty four hours after its chromosomes are literally blown apart this organism is ubiquitous on the planet and exists
 perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there 
 this is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation the glass started to burn and crack 
 while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier here 's an actual picture of what happens the top of this shows
  the genome after one point seven
 million rads of radiation the chromosome is literally blown apart  and here 's that same dna automatically reassembled twenty four hours later  it 's truly stunning that these organisms can do that 
 and we probably have thousands if not tens of thousands of different species on this
 planet that are capable of doing that after these genomes are synthesized the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome  
 so we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues for example from the third organism we sequenced methanococcus jannaschii
 it lives in boiling water temperatures its energy source is hydrogen and all
  its carbon comes from co2 it captures back from the environment  so we know lots of different pathways thousands of different organisms now
 that live off of co2 and can capture that back so instead of using carbon from oil
 for synthetic processes  we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere
  biopolymers or other products  
 we have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce
 hydrogen and oxygen also there 's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane and dupont has a major program with statoil in norway
 to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields
 there into useful products  
 within a short while i think there 's going to be a new field called combinatorial genomics 
 because with these new synthesis capabilities these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day
  and therefore as with all biology  you get selection through screening 
 whether you 're screening for hydrogen production or chemical production or just viability to understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach  we 're trying to 
  modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight  photosynthesis is modulated
  this process we 're also combining cellulases the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars
 and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol  
 pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories
 using microbes the chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists
  can produce i think future engineered species
 could be the source of food  hopefully a source of energy environmental remediation
 and perhaps
 replacing the petrochemical industry  let me just close with ethical and policy studies  we delayed
  bioethical review
 as to whether we should try and make an artificial species 
 every major religion participated in this it was actually a very strange study because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books  and they couldn 't find anything in them prohibiting making life so it must be ok  the only
