  how can we use computers  cameras  microphones
 to represent the world in an alternative way  as much as possible 
  possible to use the internet to create a new form of cinema and actually why do we record well
 it is with such simple questions in mind that i started to make films
 ten years ago first
 with a friend christophe  abric he had a website la blogothque dedicated to independent music we were crazy about music we wanted to
  represent music in a different way 
 to film the music we love the musicians we admired as much as possible far from the music industry and far from the cliches attached to it 
 we started to publish
 every week sessions on the internet  we are going to see a few extracts now
  in the shower to sigur ros playing in a parisian cafe  
 from phoenix playing by the eiffel tower
 to tom jones in his hotel room in new york  
 from arcade fire in an elevator in the olympia to beirut going down
  brooklyn  
 from r e m in a car
 to the national around a table at night in the south of france 
 from bon iver playing with some friends in an apartment in montmartre to
  many more
 unknown or very famous bands we published all those films for free on the internet  and we wanted to share
 all those films and represent music in a different way we wanted to create another type of intimacy using all those new
  at the time 
 ten years ago actually there was no such project on the internet  
 and i guess that 's why the project we were making the take away shows got quite successful  reaching
 millions of viewers  after a while i got
 a bit
 i wanted to go somewhere else  i felt the need to travel and to discover some other music  to explore the world 
 going to other corners  and actually it was also
 this idea of
 nomadic cinema sort of that i had in mind  how
 could the use of new technologies and the road fit together how could i edit my films in a bus crossing the andes 
 so i went on five year travels around the globe i started at the time in the digital film and music
  was also an homage to french filmmaker chris marker we 're going to see now a few more extracts of those new films
  from experimental electronic music in singapore with one man nation to
 brazilian icon tom z singing on his rooftop in so paolo  
 from the bambir the great rock band from armenia
 to some traditional songs in a restaurant
  in tbilisi  georgia  
 from white shoes a great retro pop band from jakarta indonesia
 to
  many
 other places and musicians around the world  
 my desire was to make it as a trek  
 to do all those films it would have been impossible with a big company behind me with a structure or anything  i was traveling alone with a backpack
 computer  camera microphones in it alone actually but just with local people meeting my team  which was
 absolutely not professional people 
 on the spot there going from one place to another and to make cinema as a trek i really believed that cinema could be
 this very simple thing  i want to make a film and you 're going to give me a place to stay for the night  i give you a moment of cinema
  had no idea about what i would do there
  three months later  after traveling all around the country i had recorded  thirty three films only with the help
 of local people only with the help of people that i was asking all the time the same question what is important to record here
 today  by living in such a way by working without any structure
  react
 to the moment
 and to decide oh this is important to make now this is important to record that whole person  this is important to create this exchange  
 when i went to chechnya  the first person i met
 looked at me and was like 
  what kind of problems are you going to study well  i was there to research on sufi rituals in chechnya actually
 incredible culture of sufism in chechnya  which is absolutely unknown outside of the region 
 as soon as people understood that i would give them those films i would publish them online for free under a creative commons license
  would also really give them to the people and i would let them do what they want with it i just want to represent them in a beautiful light i just want to portray them in a way that
 their grandchildren are going to look at their grandfather
  that 's the way
 people are going to look differently at their own culture at their own land they 're going to think about it differently it may be a way to maintain a certain diversity
  is a tombstone of a live performance it 's a really good sentence to keep in mind
 nowadays in an era saturated by images  what 's the point of that where do we go with it  
 i was researching i was still
 keeping this idea in mind  what 's the point
  was researching on music trying to pull  trying to get closer to a certain origin of it where is this all coming from i am french  i had no idea
 about what i would discover which is a very simple thing  
 everything was sacred at first and music was spiritual healing  
 how could i use my camera  
 my little tool to get closer
 and maybe
 not only capture the trance but find an equivalent a 
 maybe  something
 in complete harmony
 with the people
 that is now my my new research i 'm doing on spirituality on new spirits around the world
 maybe a few more extracts now
 from the tana toraja funeral ritual in indonesia
  the sufi rituals of chechnya
 to a mass in the holiest church of armenia
  some sufi songs in harar the holy city of ethiopia 
 to an ayahuasca ceremony deep in the amazon of peru with the shipibo then
 to my new project the one i 'm doing now here in brazil
 on the new  spiritualities all around the country this is my quest my own little quest of what i call experimental ethnography 
 trying to to hybrid all those different genres  trying to regain a certain
  why do we record i was still there  i really believe cinema teaches us to see 
 the way we show the world is going to change the way we see this world 
 and we live in a moment where the mass media are doing a terrible terrible job at representing the world
 events only simplifications of everyday life i think we are recording to regain a certain complexity  
 to reinvent
  you show up in places like the ones you just have shown us and you are carrying a camera and i assume that
 you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome you walk into sacred rituals private moments in a
 village a town a group of people  how do you break the barrier when you show up with a lens
  that 's what it taught me to travel  to trust
 the memory of the body more than the memory of the brain the respect is stepping forward not stepping backward and i really think that
 by engaging your body in the moment in the ceremony in the places people welcome you and understand your energy bg you told me that most of the videos you have
 made are actually one single shot
  don 't do much editing i mean you edited the ones for us at the beginning of the sessions because of the length etc  otherwise you just go in and capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning and so is that the case it
 's correct 
 vm my idea is that i think that as long as we
 don 't cut in a way as long
  going to
 get closer to the moment  
 to that moment and to that place i really think of that as a matter of respecting the viewer  to not cut
 all the time
 from one place to another to just let the time go bg tell me in a few words about your new project hbridos here in brazil
  just before coming to tedglobal you have actually been traveling around the country for that 
 tell us a couple of things vm hbridos is i really believe brazil  far from the cliches is the greatest religious country in the world the greatest
 country in terms of spirituality and in experimentations in spiritualities and it 's a
 big project i 'm doing over this year  which is researching in very different
  regions of brazil  in very different forms of cults and trying to understand how people live together with spirituality nowadays bg the man who is going to appear onstage
 momentarily and vincent 's going to introduce him  is one of the subjects of one of his past
 videos  when did you do a video with him vm i guess four years ago
  four years  in my first travel bg so it was one of your first ones in brazil vm it was amongst the first ones in brazil
 from bg so let 's introduce him  who are we waiting for vm i 'll just make it very short it 's a very
 great honor for me to welcome onstage one of the greatest brazilian musicians of all time please welcome nan vasconcelos
