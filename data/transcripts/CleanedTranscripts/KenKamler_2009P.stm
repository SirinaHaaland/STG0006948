  heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power
 of the human mind and what i 'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed
 when someone is in a survival situation how the will to survive
  can bring that out in people  this is
 an incident which occurred on mount everest it was the worst disaster in the history of everest  and when it occurred i was the only doctor on the mountain  
 so i 'll take you through that and we 'll
 see what it 's like when someone really
  been there six times four times i did work with national geographic making tectonic plate measurements  twice i went with nasa
 doing remote sensing devices  
 it was on my fourth trip to everest that a comet passed over the mountain  hyakutake  and the sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen  
 and we should have listened to them 
 everest is an extreme environment
  's only one third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level near the summit temperatures can be forty degrees below zero  you can have winds twenty to forty miles an hour  it 's actually a wind chill factor which is lower than a summer day on mars
 i remember one time being up near the summit  i reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water
  my down jacket only to discover that the water was already frozen solid that gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit
  ok this is the route up everest   it starts at base camp
  at seventeen thousand five hundred feet camp one two thousand feet higher camp two another two thousand feet higher up what 's called the western cwm
  is at the base of lhotse which is the fourth highest mountain in the world but it 's dwarfed by everest  
 and then camp four is the highest camp that 's three thousand feet short of the summit  
 this is a view of base camp
  this is pitched on a glacier at seventeen thousand five hundred feet it 's the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload  
 and this is what they unloaded for me i had four yak loads of medical supplies which are dumped in a tent and here i am trying to arrange things
  this was our expedition it was a national geographic expedition but it was organized by the explorers club  there were three other expeditions on the mountain an american team a new zealand team and an imax team 
 and after actually two months of preparation we built our camps all the way up the mountain this is a view looking up the icefall the first two thousand feet of the climb up from base
  camp  
 and here 's a picture in the icefall  it 's a waterfall but it 's frozen but it moves very slowly  and it actually changes every day 
 when you 're in it you 're like a rat in a maze you can 't even see over the top
 this is near the top of the icefall you want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen 
 that way it 's less likely to tumble down on you these are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at
 this is me crossing a crevasse  we cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached that
 's another crevasse  
 some of these things are ten stories deep or more and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night
 is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we 're
  the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall and from there we climb up
 to camp two which is sort of the foreground these are climbers moving up the lhotse face that mountain
 toward camp three they 're on fixed ropes here  a fall here  if you weren 't roped in would be five thousand feet
  is a view taken from camp three you can see the lhotse face is in profile  it 's about a forty five degree angle it takes two days to climb it  so you put the camp halfway through if you notice the summit of everest is is black there 's no ice over it  
 and that 's because everest is so high it 's in the jet stream  and winds are constantly scouring the face so no snow gets to accumulate 
 what looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit
 this is on the way up from camp three to camp four moving in up through the clouds  
 and this is at camp four  once you get to camp four  you have maybe twenty four hours to decide if you 're going to go for the summit or not everybody 's on oxygen your supplies are limited and you either have to go up or go down make that decision very quickly
  this is a picture of rob hall he was the leader of the new zealand team this is a radio he used later to call his wife that i 'll tell you about 
 these are some climbers waiting to go to the summit  they 're up at camp four and you can see that there 's wind blowing off the summit this is not good weather to climb in  
 so the climbers are just waiting hoping that the wind 's going to die down 
 and in fact the wind does die down at night it becomes very calm there 's no wind at all
  this looks like a good chance to go for the summit  
 so here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what 's called the triangular face it 's the first part of climb it 's done in the dark because it 's actually less steep than what comes next and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark  
 so that 's what happened the climbers got on the southeast ridge this is the view looking at the southeast ridge the summit would be in the foreground
  hundred feet up at a 30 degree angle to the summit  
 but what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up a storm blew in that no one was anticipating  you can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow
 way high off the summit  and there were climbers on that summit ridge
  this is a picture of me in that area taken a year before  and you can see i 've got an oxygen mask on
 with a rebreather  i have an oxygen hose connected here you can see on this climber we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack
 little titanium tanks very lightweight and we 're not carrying much else this is all you 've got you 're very exposed on the summit ridge ok this is a view taken on the summit
  all the climbers here are climbing unroped  and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody you 'd wind up just pulling them off with you 
 so each person climbs individually  and 
 it 's not a straight path at all  it 's very difficult climbing  and there 's always the risk of falling on either side if you fall to your left  you 're going to
  fall eight thousand feet into nepal if you fall to your right you 're going to fall twelve thousand feet into tibet 
 so it 's probably better to fall into tibet because you 'll live longer 
 but either way you fall for the rest of your life
  those climbers were up near the summit  along that summit ridge
 that you see up there  and
 i was down here in camp three my expedition was down in camp three  while these guys were up there in the storm the storm was so fierce that we had to
 lay  fully dressed  fully equipped laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain  
 it was the worst winds i 've ever seen  and
 the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher two thousand feet higher
  completely exposed to the elements  
 we were in radio contact with some of them  this is a view taken along the summit ridge
  rob hall  we heard by radio was up here  at this point in the storm with doug hansen 
 and we heard that rob was ok but doug was too weak to come down
 he was
  and rob was staying with him  we also got some bad news in the storm that
 beck weathers another climber had collapsed in the snow and was dead  there were still eighteen other climbers that we weren
 't aware of their
 their condition they were lost there was
 total confusion on the mountain  all the stories were confusing most of them were conflicting we really had no idea what was going on
 during that storm we were just hunkered down in our tents
  at camp three  our two strongest climbers todd burleson and pete athans decided to go up to try to rescue who they could
 even though there was a ferocious storm going  they tried to radio a message to rob hall  who was a superb climber
 stuck sort of with a weak climber up near the summit  i expected them to say to rob
  fact what they said was leave doug and come down yourself there 's no chance of saving him  and
 just try to save yourself at this point 
 and rob got that message 
 but his his answer was we 're both listening 
  todd and pete got up to the summit ridge up in here  and
 it was a scene of complete chaos up there  but they did what they could to stabilize the people
 i gave them radio advice from camp three  and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power  the ones that couldn 't
 we just sort of decided to leave up at camp four  so the climbers were coming down along
  this route this is taken from camp three where i was and
 they all came by me so i could take a look at them and see what i could do for them which is really not much because camp three is a little
 notch cut in the ice in the middle of a 45 degree angle you can barely stand outside the tent it
 's really cold it 's twenty four thousand feet the only supplies i had at that altitude were
 two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids so as the climbers came by me
  i sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down the ones that weren 't that lucid or were not that well coordinated i would give an injection of
 of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and
 and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain
  it 's so awkward to work up there that sometimes i even gave the injections right through their clothes it was just too hard to maneuver
 any other way
  up there while i was taking care of them we got more news about rob hall  there was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him
  he called in to say that he was alone now apparently doug had died higher up on the mountain  
 but rob was now too weak to come down himself  and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude he was just
 beyond rescue and he knew it
  at that point he asked
 to be paged into his wife he was carrying a radio his wife was home in new zealand  seven months pregnant with their first child  
 and rob asked to be patched into her that was done  and rob and his wife had their last conversation they picked the name for their baby 
 rob then signed off  and that was the last we ever heard of him
  i was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at twenty four thousand feet which was an impossibility  
 so what we did was  we got the victims down to twenty one thousand feet where it was easier for me to treat them this was my medical kit it 's a tackle box
 filled with medical supplies
  this is what i carried up the mountain  i had more supplies lower down which i asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp  
 and this was scene at the lower camp the survivors came in one by one 
 some of them were hypothermic some of them were frostbitten some were both 
 what we did was try to warm them up as best we could put oxygen on them and
 try to revive them which is difficult to do at twenty one thousand feet when the tent is freezing
  this is some severe frostbite on the feet severe frostbite on the nose  
 this climber was snow blind  as i was taking care of these climbers  we got a startling
 startling experience out of nowhere beck weathers  who we had already been told was dead  stumbled into the tent
 just like like a mummy he walked into the tent  i expected him to be incoherent  
 but in fact he walked into the tent and said to me hi ken where should i sit 
 and then he said do you accept my health insurance 
 he really said that 
  so he was completely lucid but he was very severely frostbitten you can see his hand is completely white his face his nose is burned  
 first it turns white and then when it 's completed necrosis  it turns black  and then it falls off it 's
 the last stage just like a scar 
 so as i was taking care of beck he related what had been going on up there he said he had gotten lost in the storm 
 collapsed in the snow and just laid there unable to move  some climbers had come by and looked at him
  him  and he heard them say he 's dead 
 but beck wasn 't dead he heard that but he was completely unable to move he was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings but couldn 't even blink to indicate that he was alive  
 so the climbers passed him by 
 and beck lay there
 for a day a night and another day in the snow
  snow 
 and then he said to himself 
 i don 't want to die  i have a family to come back to and the thoughts of his family his kids and his wife 
 generated
 enough energy enough motivation in him  so that he actually got up after laying in the snow that long a time he got up
 and found his way back to the camp
  told me that story very quietly but i was absolutely stunned by it i couldn 't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time
 and then getting up he apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia  and
 i can only try to speculate on how he did it 
  what if we had beck hooked up to a spect scan  something that could actually measure brain function 
 just very simply the three parts of the brain the frontal lobe  where you
 focus your attention and concentration you have the temporal lobe where you form images and keep memories  and the posterior part of your brain which contains the cerebellum which controls motion  
 and the brain stem where you have your basic maintenance functions like heartbeat and respiration
  so let 's take a cut through the brain here  and imagine
 that beck was hooked up to a spect scan  this measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain  
 so you have the prefrontal cortex here  lighting up in red this is a pretty evenly distributed scan you have the the middle area where the temporal lobe might
  and the posterior portion where the maintenance functions are in the back  this is a roughly normal scan  showing equal distribution of energy 
 now you go to this one and you see how much more
 the frontal lobes are lighting up this might be what beck would be experiencing when he realizes he 's in danger  he 's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble
  these parts of the brain are quieting down he 's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point  
 and he 's working pretty
  hard he 's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this 
 ok but
 he 's he 's losing ground here he 's running out of energy  it 's too cold he can 't keep his metabolic fires going and you see there 's no more red here his brain is quieting down  
 he 's collapsed in the
  everything is quiet there 's very little red anywhere beck is powering down  he 's dying  
 you go on to the next scan  but in beck 's case  you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again
  he 's beginning to think about his family he 's beginning to have images that are motivating him to to get up he 's
  this is how he 's going to turn thought back into into action  this part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus it 's an area in which
 a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists  this is where people make decisions where they develop willpower  
 and you can see there 's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain where he 's got images of his family into this area  which is
  powering his will 
 okay this is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it 's actually going to be a motivating factor he 's going to develop enough energy in that area
 after a day a night and a day
 to actually motivate himself to get up 
 and you can see here
  he 's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe he 's beginning to focus he can concentrate now he 's thinking about what he 's got to do to save himself so this energy has been transmitted up toward the front
 front of his brain and it 's getting quieter down here but he 's using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going 
 and then that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas  he 's not thinking about his
  he 's getting himself motivated this is the posterior part where his muscles are going to be moving and
 he 's going to be pacing himself his heart and lungs are going to pick up speed  so this is what i can speculate might have been going on had we been able to
 do a spect scan on beck during this
 during this survival epic  so here i am taking care of beck at twenty one thousand feet and i felt what i was
 was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself it just shows you what the power of the mind can do 
 he was critically ill there were other critically ill patients luckily we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys a
 helicopter came in at twenty one thousand feet
 and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history it was able to land on the ice take away beck and the other survivors
  one by one and get them off to kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp  
 this is a scene at base camp  at one of the camps where
 some of the climbers were lost and we had a memorial service there a
 few days later these are serphas lighting juniper branches  they believe juniper smoke is holy  
 and the climbers
 stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who
 were lost up near the summit  turning to the mountain  actually to talk to them directly
  there were five climbers lost here this was scott fischer 
 rob hall  andy harris doug hansen
 and yasuko namba  and one more climber
 should have died that day  but didn 't and that 's beck weathers  
 he was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower he was able to use all the power of his mind to to save himself
  these are tibetan prayer flags these sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags  the message will be carried up to the gods
  and that year beck 's message was answered
