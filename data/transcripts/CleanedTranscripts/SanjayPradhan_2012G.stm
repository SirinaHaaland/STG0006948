  grew up in bihar india 's poorest state  
 and i remember when i was six years old  i remember coming home one day
 to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep
 my brothers and i dug in and that 's when my father came home 
 he was livid  and i still remember how we cried
 when that cart with our
  half eaten sweets was pulled away from us later
  i understood why my father got so upset those sweets were a bribe
 from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract 
 my father was responsible for building roads in bihar  and he had developed a firm stance against corruption  
 even though he was harassed
 and threatened his was a lonely struggle
 because bihar was also india 's most corrupt state  
 where public officials were enriching themselves [ rather ] than serving the poor
 who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling
  i experienced this most viscerally
 when i traveled
 to remote villages to study poverty  
 and as i went village to village i remember one day  when i was famished
 and exhausted  and i was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree  
 and just at that time one of the
  poorest men in that village
 invited me into his hut and graciously fed me only i later realized
 that what he fed me
 was food for his entire family
 for two days this profound gift of generosity
 challenged and
  changed
 the very purpose of my life i resolved
 to give back 
 later i joined the world bank  
 which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries 
 my initial work focused on
  where i focused on negotiating reforms with the finance ministry of uganda so they could access our loans  
 but after we disbursed the loans  i remember a trip in uganda where i found
 newly built schools without textbooks or teachers new health clinics without drugs  
 and the poor once again without any voice or recourse it was
  bihar all over again 
 bihar represents the challenge of development abject poverty surrounded by corruption  
 globally one point three billion people live on less than $ one point two five a day  
 and the work i did in uganda
 represents the traditional approach to these problems
  has been practiced since 
 when winners of world war ii 
 five hundred founding fathers 
 and one lonely founding mother  gathered in new hampshire usa to establish the bretton woods institutions including the world bank  
 and that traditional approach to development had three key elements
  first transfer of resources from rich countries in the north to poorer countries in the south  accompanied by reform prescriptions 
 second the development institutions that channeled these transfers
 were opaque 
 with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved  and third  the engagement in developing countries
 was with a narrow set of government elites
 with little interaction with the citizens who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance 
 today  each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment open knowledge 
  and together they represent three key shifts that are transforming development
 and that also hold greater hope for the problems i witnessed in uganda
 and in bihar  
 the first key shift is open knowledge  
 you know developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the u s europe or the world
  bank 
 they get their inspiration their hope 
 their practical know how from successful emerging economies in the south  
 they want to know how china lifted five hundred million people out of poverty in thirty years 
 how mexico 's oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of
  children this
 is the new ecosystem
 of open knowledge flows not just traveling north to south  but south to south  
 and even south to north with mexico 's oportunidades
 today inspiring new york city  and
  transfers are opening up so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers this is the second shift 
 open aid  
 recently the world bank opened its vault of data for public use  releasing eight thousand economic and social indicators for two hundred countries over fifty years  
 and it launched a global competition to crowdsource
  innovative apps using this data development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny
 the projects they finance take geomapping 
 in this map from kenya  the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located  
 and the darker the shade of green the more the number of
 out of school children  so this simple mashup reveals
 that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out of school children  provoking new questions 
 is development assistance targeting those who most need our help 
  the world bank has now geomapped thirty thousand project activities in one hundred and forty three countries and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects 
 this is a tremendous leap forward
 in transparency and accountability of aid  and this leads me to the third and in my view the most
 significant shift in development 
 open governance 
 governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability from the arab spring to the anna hazare movement 
  in india using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability
  several governments in africa and eastern europe are opening their budgets to the public 
 but you know there is a big difference between a budget that 's public
 and a budget that 's accessible this
 is a public budget and as you can see it 's not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary
  citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources to tackle this problem governments are using new tools
 to visualize the budget
 so it 's more understandable
 to the public 
 in this map from moldova  the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools
  good educational outcomes  and the red color shows the opposite tools like this help turn
 a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual  and what 's exciting
 is that with this openness  there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and
  engage with government 
 so in the philippines today  parents and students can give real time feedback on a website
 or using sms  whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school  
 the same problems i witnessed in uganda and in bihar  
 and the government is responsive
  so for instance when it was reported on this website that eight hundred students were at risk
 because school repairs had stalled due to corruption  the department of education in the philippines took swift action  
 and you know what 's exciting is that this innovation
 is now spreading south to south from the philippines to indonesia
  moldova and beyond 
 in dar es salaam tanzania  
 even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations 
 this is what the map of tandale looked like in august two thousand and eleven  
 but within a few
  university students were able to use mobile phones and an open source platform
 to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure  and what is very exciting
 is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working  
 aggregated in the red bubbles that you see
  provides a graphic visual
 of the collective voices of the poor 
 today  even bihar is turning around and opening up
 under a committed leadership that is making government transparent accessible
 and responsive to the poor  but you know in many parts of the world governments are not
 interested in opening up or
 in serving the poor  and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system 
 these
 are the lonely warriors
 like my father and many many others and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors
 join hands
 so they can together
 overcome the odds  
 so for instance today in ghana  courageous reformers from civil society parliament and government have forged
 a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector 
 and  galvanized by this reformers in parliament are now investigating
 dubious contracts these examples give new hope new possibility
 to the problems i witnessed in uganda or that my father confronted in bihar  
 two years ago on april 8th two thousand and ten
  i called my father it was very late at night  and at age eighty he was typing a 
 public interest litigation against corruption in a road project 
 though he was no lawyer 
 he argued the case in court himself the next day  
 he won the ruling  but later that very evening he fell  and he died
 he fought till the end  increasingly passionate that to combat corruption
 and poverty not only did government officials need to be honest
 but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard
  became the two bookends of his life  and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape
  the collective voices of the poor
