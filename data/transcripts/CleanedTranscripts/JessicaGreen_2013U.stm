  is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms bacteria viruses and fungi 
 our desks our computers our pencils  our buildings all harbor resident microbial landscapes 
  design these things we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds  and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems 
 our bodies are home to trillions of microbes and these creatures define who we are 
 the microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods  the microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system  the microbes in your mouth can
  freshen your breath  or not  
 and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch  so for example when you touch a pencil microbial exchange happens  
 if we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways  
 i get asked all
  of the time from people is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems and i believe the answer is yes 
 i think we 're doing it right now  but we 're doing it unconsciously  
 i 'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture
 that demonstrates
  through both conscious and unconscious design we 're impacting these invisible worlds  
 this is the lillis business complex at the university of oregon  and i worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over three hundred rooms in this building 
 we wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building and to do this we sampled dust
  from the dust we pulled out bacterial cells  broke them open and compared their gene sequences 
 this means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project 
 this is a picture of tim  who right when i snapped this picture reminded me he said jessica  the last lab group i worked in i was doing fieldwork in the costa rican rainforest  and things have changed
  so i 'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices and we 're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that i 've been working on in partnership with autodesk  
 the way that you look at this data is first look around the outside of the circle you 'll see broad bacterial groups  and if you look at the shape 
  of this pink lobe it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group so at twelve o 'clock you 'll see that offices have a lot
  of alphaproteobacteria  and at one o 'clock you 'll see that bacilli are relatively rare  
 let 's take a look at what 's going on in different space types in this building if you look inside the restrooms they all have really similar ecosystems  
 and if you were to look inside the classrooms those also have similar
  but if you look across these space types you can see that they 're fundamentally different from one another  
 i like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest i told tim if you could just see the microbes it 's kind of like being in costa rica  kind of 
 and i also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland this perspective is a really powerful
 powerful one for designers because you can bring on principles of ecology and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal
  the way organisms move around we know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air  so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system  
 mechanical engineers design air handling units to make sure that people are comfortable that the air flow and temperature is just right they do this using
  principles of physics and chemistry  but they could also be using biology 
 if you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building you 'll see that they 're all very similar to one another  
 and if you compare this to the microbes in a different
  air handling unit you 'll see that they 're fundamentally different  
 the rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago  and what that means is that mechanical engineers are like eco engineers and they have the ability to structure 
  biomes in this building the way that they want to 
 another facet of how microbes get around is by people and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people or the sharing of ideas like in labs
  labs and in offices  
 given that microbes travel around with people you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes  
 and that is exactly what we found if you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another they have very similar ecosystems but if you go to
 an office that is a farther walking distance away the ecosystem is fundamentally
  different  
 and when i see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns 
 it makes me think that it 's possible to
 tackle really challenging problems like hospital acquired infections i believe this has got to be in part a building
  i 'm going to tell you one more story about this building  i am collaborating with charlie brown  he 's an architect  
 and charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change he 's dedicated his life to sustainable design when he met me and realized that it 
  was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology
  of this building he got really excited because it added a new dimension to what he did he went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health 
 he helped design some of the air handling systems in this building and the way it was ventilated  so what i 'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building 
 what you 're looking at is a
  signature of bacterial communities in the outdoor air and how they vary over time  
 next i 'm going to show you what happened when we experimentally manipulated classrooms we blocked them off at night so that they got no ventilation a lot of buildings are operated this way probably where you work
  and companies do this to save money on their energy bill what we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until saturday  when we opened the vents up again 
 when you walked into those rooms they smelled really bad  and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before  
 contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air
  came in from the outside through louvers 
 in these rooms the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well and when charlie saw this he got really excited he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process
 because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building 's resident microbial landscape
  the examples that i just gave you are about architecture but they 're relevant to the design of anything  
 imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane
 or  on a phone  
 there 's a new microbe i just discovered it it 's called blis and it 's been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath  wouldn 't it be awesome if we all had blis on our phones
 a conscious approach to design i 'm calling it bioinformed design  and i think it 's possible thank you
