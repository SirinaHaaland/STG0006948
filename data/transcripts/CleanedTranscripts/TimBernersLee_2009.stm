  's actually almost twenty years ago
 when i wanted to reframe the way we use information the way we work together i invented the world wide web now twenty
  to ask your help in a new reframing  so going back to one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine i wrote a memo
 suggesting the global hypertext system nobody really did anything with it pretty much 
 but eighteen months later this is this is how innovation happens eighteen months later my boss
 said i could do it on the side as a sort of a play
  kick the tires of a new computer we 'd got and so he gave me the time
 to code it up  
 so i basically roughed out what html should look like 
 hypertext protocol http  the idea of urls these names for things which started with http  i wrote the code and put it out there  
 why did i do it  well it was basically frustration
  i was working as a software engineer in this huge very exciting lab lots of people coming from all over the world they
 brought all sorts of different computers with them they had all sorts of different
 data formats all sorts all kinds of documentation systems so that in all that diversity if i wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this 
 everything i looked into i had to connect to some new machine i had to learn to run some new program
 i would find the information i wanted in some new data format and these were all incompatible 
 it was just very frustrating the frustration was all this unlocked potential  
 in fact on all these discs there were documents
  so if you just imagined them all being part of some big  virtual documentation
  system in the sky say on the internet then life would be so much easier 
 well once you 've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don 't read your memo actually he did  it was found after he died his copy  he had written vague but exciting in pencil in the corner 
 but in general it was difficult it was really difficult to explain what the web was like it 's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then but then ok  when ted started
  web so
 things like click didn 't have the same meaning i can show somebody a piece of hypertext a page which has got links and we click on the link and bing there 'll be another hypertext page 
 not impressive you know we 've seen that we 've got things on hypertext on cd roms what was difficult was to get them to imagine 
  imagine that that link could have gone to virtually any document you could imagine
 alright that is the leap
 that was very difficult for people to make well  some people did  so yeah it was difficult to explain but there was a grassroots movement
 and that is what has made it most fun that has been the most exciting thing not the technology not the things people have done with it but actually the community the spirit of all these people getting together  sending the emails that 's what it was like then
  funny but right now it 's kind of like that again i asked everybody more or less to put their documents i said could you put your documents on this web thing 
 and
 you did  thanks  it 's been a blast hasn 't it i mean it has been quite interesting because we 've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away they 're much
  more than we 'd originally imagined when we
 put together the little  initial website that we started off with now  i want you to put your data on the web  
 turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential there is still a huge frustration that people have because we haven 't got data on the web 
  as data what do you mean data what 's the difference documents data well documents you read ok  
  who was here or has otherwise seen hans rosling 's talk
 one of the great yes a lot of people have seen it one of the great ted talks hans put up this presentation
 in which he showed for various different countries in various different colors he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality and he shot this thing animated through time
  so he 'd taken
 this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about
 the economics in the developing world he put up a slide a little bit like this it had underground all the data
 ok data is brown and boxy and boring and that 's how we think of it isn 't it because
 data you can 't naturally use by itself but in fact data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it in this case 
 hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of united nations
 websites and things 
 he had put it together  combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he 'd put it into this
  this wonderful presentation and hans made a point of saying look it 's really important to have a lot of data and i was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying very forcibly it 's really important to have a lot of data 
 so i want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected or six like
  i want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data  the technology is linked data and it 's extremely simple if
 you want to put something on the web there are three rules first thing is
 that those http names those things that start with 
 we 're using them not just for documents now we 're using them for things that the documents
  them for people we 're using them for places we 're using them for your products  we 're using them for events all kinds of conceptual things they have names now that start with http second rule
 if i take one of these http names and i look it up and i do the web thing with it and i fetch the data using the http protocol from the web  i will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to
  who 's at the event whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that so the second rule is i get important information back  third rule is
 that when i get back that information
 it 's not just got somebody 's height and weight and when they were born  it 's got relationships  data is relationships  interestingly data is relationships  this
 person was born in berlin berlin is in germany and when it has relationships
  expresses a relationship then the other thing that it 's related to is given
 one of those names that starts http  so i can go ahead and look that thing up so i look up a person i can look up then the city where they were born then i can look up the region it 's in and the town it 's in and the population of it 
 and so on so i can browse this stuff so that 's it really 
 that is linked data
  wrote an article entitled linked data a couple of years ago and soon after that things started to happen 
 the idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that hans had and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting  it 's not just a whole lot 
 of other plants it 's not just a root supplying a plant but for each of those plants whatever it is a presentation an analysis somebody
  's looking for patterns in the data
 they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together the more powerful it is 
 so linked data  
 the meme went out there and 
 pretty soon chris bizer at the freie universitat in berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up he noticed that wikipedia you know wikipedia the online encyclopedia with
  lots and lots of interesting documents in it  well  in those documents 
 there are little squares  little boxes and in most information boxes  there 's data so he wrote a program to take the data extract it from wikipedia  and put it into a blob of linked data on the web which he called dbpedia 
 dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide and if you actually go and look up berlin
  other blobs of data which also have stuff about berlin and they 're linked together  so if you pull the data from dbpedia about berlin you 'll end up pulling up these other things as well  and 
 the exciting thing is it 's starting to grow this is just the grassroots stuff again ok  let 's think about data for a
  think of the diversity of the web it 's a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there so it is with data i could talk about all kinds of data  we could talk about government data enterprise data is really
 important  
 there 's scientific data  there 's personal data  there 's weather data there 's data about events there 's data about talks and there 's news and there 's
 all kinds of stuff i 'm just going to mention a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it  so that you also see how much
  unlocked potential let 's start with government data  barack obama said in a speech that he
 american government data would be available on the internet in accessible formats  and i hope that they will put it up as linked data  
 that 's important  why is it important not just for transparency yeah transparency in government is important  but that data this is the data from all the government departments think about
 how much of that data
  about how life is lived in america it 's actual useful it 's got value i can use it in my company  i could use it as a kid to do my homework so we 're talking about making the place making the world 
 run better by making this data available in fact if you 're responsible if you know about some data in a government department often you find that these
  very tempted to keep it
 hans calls it database hugging you hug your database you don 't want to let it go until you 've made a beautiful website for it well i 'd like to suggest that rather yes make 
  a beautiful website who am i to say don 't make a beautiful website make a beautiful website  but first give us the unadulterated data we want the data  we want unadulterated data ok  we
  's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you even though you 've paid for it as a taxpayer  and it 's not just america it 's all over the world  and it 's not just governments of course it 's enterprises as well
  so i 'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data  here we are at ted and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now curing cancer  
 understanding the brain for alzheimer 's understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable  understanding how the world
  the people who are going to solve those the scientists they have have half formed ideas in their head  they try to communicate those over the web but a lot of the state of knowledge of the human 
 race at the moment is on databases  often sitting in their computers and actually currently not shared  
 because they had their genomics data in one database in one building and they had their protein data in another now they are sticking it
 onto linked data and now they can ask the sort of question that you probably wouldn 't ask i wouldn 't ask they would 
 what proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons well  you
  take that mouthful and you put it into google of
 course there 's no page on the web which has answered that question because nobody has asked that question before you get two hundred and twenty three thousand hits no results you can use you ask the linked data which they 've now put together 
 thirty two hits each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at the power of being able to ask those questions as a scientist
 questions which actually bridge across different disciplines is really a complete sea change it 's very very important
  totally stymied at the moment the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can
 tackle those huge problems now if i go on like this you 'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions
 and has nothing to do with you but that 's not true in fact  data is about our lives you just you log on to your social networking site your favorite one
  you say this is my friend bing relationship data 
 you say this photograph it 's about it depicts this person bing that 's data 
 data data data every time you do things on the social networking site  the social networking site is taking data and using it re purposing it and using it to make other people 's lives 
 more interesting on the site but when you go to another linked data site and let 's say this is one about travel  and you say
  to send this photo to all the people in that group you can 't get over the walls the economist wrote an article about it and lots of people have blogged about it tremendous frustration the way to break down the silos 
 is to get inter operability between social networking sites we need to do that with linked data  one last type of data i 'll talk about maybe it 's the most exciting before i came down here i looked it up on openstreetmap the openstreetmap 's a map but it 's also a wiki zoom in and that square thing is a theater which we 're in right now
 the terrace theater it didn 't have a name on it  so i could go into edit mode i could select the theater  i could add down at the bottom the name  and i could save it back and now if you go back to the
  org and you find this place you will find that the terrace theater has got a name  i did that me i did that to the map  i just did that i put that up on there hey you know
  that street map is all about everybody doing their bit and it creates an incredible resource because everybody else does theirs  and that is what linked data is all about it 's about people
 doing their bit to produce a little bit and it all connecting that 's how linked data works you do your bit everybody
  you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it and we 've practiced that 
 so linked data it 's huge i 've only told you a very small number of things
 there are data in every aspect of our lives every aspect of work and pleasure   and it 's not just about the number of places where data
  it 's about connecting it together and when you connect data together  you get power in a way that doesn 't happen just with the web with documents you get this really huge
 power out of it so 
 we 're at the stage now where we have to do this the people who think it 's a great idea and all the people and i think there
 's a lot of people at ted who do things because even though there 's not an immediate return
  because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it they 'll do it because they 're the sort of person who just does things
 which would be good if everybody else did them ok  so it 's called linked data  i want you to make it 
 i want you to demand it and i think it 's an idea worth spreading
