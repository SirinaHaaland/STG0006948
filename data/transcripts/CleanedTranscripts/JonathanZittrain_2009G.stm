  my name is jonathan zittrain  and in my recent work i 've been a bit of a pessimist so i thought this morning i would try to be the optimist and give reason to hope for the future of the internet by drawing upon its present 
 now it may seem like there
  is less hope today than there was before people are less kind there is less trust around i don 't know as a
 simple example we could run a test here how many people have ever hitchhiked  
 i know  how many people have hitchhiked within the past ten years
  right  so what has changed it 's not better public transportation  
 so that 's one reason to think that we might be declensionists going in the wrong direction 
 but i want to give you three examples to try to say that the trend line is in fact in the other direction  and it 's the internet helping it along  
 so example number one the internet
  itself these are three of the founders of the internet  they were actually high school classmates together at the same high school in suburban los angles in the 
 you might have had a french club or a debate club they had a let 's build a global network club and it worked out very well  they are pictured
  anniversary newsweek retrospective on the internet and as you can tell they are basically goof balls  
 they had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network 
 the limitation was that they didn 't have any money no particular amount of capital to invest 
  of the sort that for a physical network you might need for trucks and people and a hub to move packages around overnight they had none of that 
 but they had an amazing freedom which was they didn 't have to make any money from it 
 the internet has no business plan never did no ceo 
 no firm responsible singly for building it  
  it 's folks getting together to do something for fun rather than because they were told to or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it 
 that ethos led to a network architecture a structure that was unlike other digital networks then or since so unusual in fact that it was said that it 's not clear the internet could
  was known to say you couldn 't possibly build a corporate network using internet protocol 
 and even some internet engineers today say the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out 
 that 's why the mascot of internet engineering if it had one is said to be the bumblebee because the
  ratio of the bumblebee is far too large for it to be able to fly  and yet  mysteriously  somehow the bee flies  
 i 'm pleased to say that thanks to massive government funding about three years ago we finally figured out how bees fly it
 's very complicated but it turns out they flap their wings very quickly 
 so what is this bizarre
  architecture configuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual  well to move data around from one place to another again it 's not like a package courier  it 's more like a mosh pit 
 imagine you being part of a network where you 're maybe at a sporting event and you 're sitting in rows like this and somebody asks for a beer  
 and it gets handed at the aisle and
  your neighborly duty is to pass the beer along at risk to your own trousers 
 to get it to the destination  
 no one pays you to do this it 's just part of your neighborly duty 
 and in a way that 's exactly how packets move around the internet sometimes in as many as twenty five or thirty
  with the intervening entities that are passing the data around having no particular contractual or legal obligation to the original sender or to the receiver
  now of course in a mosh pit it 's hard to specify a destination
  you need a lot of trust  but it 's not like i 'm trying to get to pensacola please so
 the internet needs addressing and directions  it turns out there is no one overall map of the internet
  instead again it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater  but we can only see amidst the fog the people immediately around us  
 so what do we do to figure out who is where 
 we turn to the person on the right  and we tell that person what we see on our left  and vice versa  and they can lather rinse repeat and before you
  you have a general sense of where everything is this is how internet addressing and routing actually work 
 this is a system that relies on kindness and trust 
 which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable 
 in rare but striking instances a single lie told by just one entity in this honeycomb
 can lead to real trouble so for
  last year the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent
 citizens of pakistan from seeing youtube there was a video there that the government did not like and they wanted to make sure it was blocked this is a common occurrence governments everywhere are often trying to block and filter and censor content on the internet  
 well this one isp in pakistan chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers in a rather unusual way
  it advertised the way that you might be asked if you were part of the internet to declare what you see near you it advertised that near it  in fact it had suddenly awakened to find that it was youtube 
 that 's right it said i am youtube which meant that packets of data from
 from subscribers going to youtube stopped at the isp since they thought they were already there and the isp threw them away unopened because the point was to block it  
 but it didn 't stop there you see that
 announcement went one click out which got reverberated one click out and it turns out that as you look at the postmortem of this event  you have at one moment perfectly working youtube  
  at moment number two  you have the fake announcement go out and within two minutes 
 it reverberates around and youtube is blocked everywhere in the world if you were sitting in oxford england trying to get to youtube your packets were going to pakistan and they weren 't coming back 
 now just think about that one of the most popular websites in the world  run by the most powerful company in the world  and there was nothing
 that youtube or google
  were particularly privileged to do about it  and yet somehow within about two hours the problem was fixed 
 how did this happen  
 well for a big clue we turn to nanog  the north american network operators group 
 a group of people who on a beautiful day outside enter into a windowless room at their terminals
  reading
 email and messages in
 fixed proportion font like this 
 and they talk about networks and some of them are mid level employees at internet service providers around the world  and here is the message where one of them says looks like we 've got a live one we 
  have a hijacking of youtube this is not a drill it 's not just the cluelessness of youtube engineers i promise 
 and they came together to help find the problem and fix it so it
 's kind of like if your house catches on fire 
 the bad news is there is no fire brigade 
 the good news is random people apparate from nowhere put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise 
 i was trying to think of the right model to describe
 this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers 
 you know it 's just like the hail goes out and people are ready to help  
 and it turns out this model is everywhere once you start looking for it  
 example number two 
  man named jimbo came up to you in two thousand and one and said i 've got a great idea we start with seven articles that anybody can edit anything at any time and we 'll get a great encyclopedia eh 
 right  dumbest idea ever 
 in fact wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid
 that even jimbo never had it  jimbo 's idea was for nupedia it was going to be totally traditional he would pay people money because he was
  feeling like a good guy 
 and the money would go to the people and they would write the articles  
 the wiki was introduced so others could make suggestions on edits as almost an afterthought a back room  
 and then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project and today wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can now
  i am not making this up 
 i have a theory i can explain later  suffice it to say for now that i prefer my wikipedia stir fried with pimentos 
 laughter but now wikipedia doesn 't just spontaneously work how does it really work  it turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless
  metaphorically speaking  and there are a bunch of people who on a sunny day would rather be inside
 and monitoring this the administrator 's notice board itself a wiki page that anyone can edit  
 and you just bring your problems to the page it 's reminiscent of the description of history as one damn thing after another 
 right number one tendentious editing by user andyvphil
  andyvphil if you 're here today  i 'm not taking sides anon attacking me for reverting here is my favorite a long story 
 it turns out there are more people checking this page for problems and wanting to solve them than there are problems arising on the page  
  at all times wikipedia is approximately forty five minutes away from utter destruction 
 right there are spambots crawling it  trying to turn every article into an ad for a rolex watch 
 it 's this thin geeky line that keeps it going 
 not because it 's a job not because it 's a career but because it 's a
  it 's something they feel impelled to do because they care about it  they even gather together in such groups as 
  unit civility maturity responsibility to just clean up the pages  
 it does make you wonder if there were for instance  a massive extremely popular star trek convention one weekend who would be minding the store
  see 
 what we see in this phenomenon
 is something that the crazed  late traffic engineer hans monderman discovered in the netherlands and here in south kensington that sometimes if you remove some 
  of the external rules and signs and everything else you can actually end up with a safer environment in
  which people can function 
 and one in which they are more human with each other they 're realizing that they have to take responsibility for what they do and wikipedia has embraced this some of you may remember star wars kid  
 the poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever  acting as if it were a light saber
  without his permission or even knowledge at first found its way onto the internet  hugely viral video extremely popular totally mortifying to him 
 now it being encyclopedic and all wikipedia had to do an article about star wars kid  
 every article on wikipedia has a corresponding discussion page and on the discussion page they had extensive argument among the wikipedians as to whether to have his real name featured in the article 
  on both sides here is just a snapshot of some of them 
 they eventually decided not unanimously by any means not to include his real name despite the fact that nearly all media reports did  they just didn 't think 
 it was the right thing to do it was an act of kindness and to this day the page for star wars kid has a warning right at the top that says you are not to put his real name on the page if you do it will
  removed immediately removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion 
 as a lawyer i 've got to say these guys are inventing the law and stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along  
 now this isn 't just limited to wikipedia we see it on blogs
 all over the place i mean this is a two thousand and five business week cover wow blogs are going to change your business i know they look silly and sure they look silly  
 they start off on all sorts of goofy projects this is my favorite goofy blog
 you send in a picture of your cat
  i know number four it 's like can you imagine coming home to that cat everyday 
 but then 
 you can see the same kind of whimsy applied to people so this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture this one
  you know i think that 's an animal carcass behind her 
 and it 's one after the other but then you hit this one 
 image removed at request of owner  
 that 's it  image removed at request of owner  it turns out that somebody lampooned here wrote to the snarky guy that does the site not with a legal threat not with an offer of
  i believe we can build architectures online to make such human requests that much easier to do to make it possible for 
 all of us to see that the data we encounter online is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward that actually represents human emotion and endeavor
  and to be able to have an ethical moment where we decide how we want to treat it  i even think it can go into the real world  we can end up as we get in a world with more 
  censors everywhere there is something filming you maybe putting it online to be able to have a little clip you could wear that says you know  i 'd rather not and then have technology
  person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it 
 in the real world we see filtering of this sort taking place in pakistan and we now have means that we can build like this system  
 so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it and it 's no longer just a i don 't know i couldn 't get
 i guess i 'll move on but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online 
 in fact talk about technology imitating life imitating tech or maybe it 's the other way around an nyu researcher here took little cardboard 
  robots with smiley faces on them and a motor that just drove them forward and a flag sticking out the back with
  can you help me get there released it on the streets of manhattan they
 'll fund anything these days 
 here is the chart of over forty three people helping to steer the robot that could not steer and get it on its way from one corner from one corner of washington square park to another 
 that leads to example number three hitchhiking i 'm not so sure
  hitchhiking is dead why 
 there is the craigslist rideshare board if
 it were called the craigslist hitchhiking board  tumbleweeds would be blowing through it  but it 's the rideshare board and it 's basically the same thing now why are people using it  
 i don 't know maybe they think that uh 
 killers don 't plan ahead
  i think the actual answer is that once you reframe it once you get out of one set of stale expectations from a failed project that had its day but now 
 for whatever reason is tarnished you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing that something like this on craigslist represents  and then you can highlight it
  one guy 's idea to at last put together people who are going somewhere far away and would like to sleep on a stranger 's couch for free 
 with people who live far away and would like someone they don 't know to sleep on their couch for free
  it 's a
 brilliant idea it 's a bee that yes
  successful couch surfings there have been and if you 're wondering no there have been no known fatalities associated with couchsurfing although to be sure the reputation system at the moment works that you leave your report after the couch surfing experience so there may be some
 selection bias there
