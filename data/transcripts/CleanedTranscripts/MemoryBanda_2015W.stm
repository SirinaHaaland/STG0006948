  i 'll begin today by sharing a poem
 written by my friend from malawi  eileen piri  eileen is only thirteen years old  
 but when we were going through the collection of poetry that we
 wrote i found her poem
 so interesting so motivating  so i 'll read it to you 
 she entitled her poem i 'll marry when i want 
 i 'll marry when i want  my mother can 't force me to marry 
 my father cannot force me
  me to marry  
 my uncle my aunt  my brother or sister cannot force me to marry  
 no one
 in the world can force me to marry i
 'll marry when i want  even if you beat me even if you chase me away  even if
  you do anything bad to me i 'll marry when i want  
 i 'll marry when i want  but not before i am well educated  
 and not before i am all grown up i 'll marry when i want 
  but where i and eileen come from 
 this poem  which i have just read to you is a warrior 's cry  
 i am from malawi malawi is one of the poorest countries very poor
  gender equality is questionable 
 growing up in that country  i couldn 't make my own choices in life  i couldn 't even explore
 personal opportunities in life i will tell you a story
 of two different girls two beautiful girls these girls
 grew up under the same roof 
 they were eating the same food sometimes they would share clothes  and even shoes  
 but their lives ended up differently in two different paths 
 the other girl is my little sister 
 my little
  sister was only eleven years old when she got pregnant it
 's a hurtful thing 
 not only did it hurt her even me  i was going through a hard time as well 
 as it is in my culture  
 once you reach puberty
  stage  you are supposed to go to initiation camps 
 in these initiation camps  you are taught how to sexually please a man 
 there is this special day  which they call very special day 
 where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp
 and sleeps with the little girls
  imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day  
 most girls end up pregnant  
 they even contract hiv and aids and other sexually transmitted diseases for my little sister  she ended up being
  she 's only sixteen years old and she has three children 
 her first marriage did not survive  nor did her second marriage 
 on the other side there is this girl 
 she 's amazing
  i was thirteen years old  
 i was told  you are grown up  you have now reached of age  you 're supposed to go to the initiation camp
  go to the initiation camps 
 you know what the women said to me you are a stupid girl  stubborn 
 you do not respect the traditions
 of our society of our community i said no because i knew where i was going i knew what i wanted in life
 i had a lot of dreams as a young girl 
 i wanted to get well educated 
 to find a decent job in the future  i was imagining myself as a lawyer seated on that big chair  
 those were the imaginations that were going through my
  and i knew that one day i would contribute something a little something to my community  
 but every day after refusing women would tell me 
 look at you  you 're all grown up your little sister has a baby what about you that was the music that i was hearing every day  
 and that is the music that girls hear every day
 when they don 't do something that the community needs them to do
 when i compared the two stories between me and my sister  i said 
 why can 't i do something 
 why can 't i change something that has happened for a long time in our community 
 that was when i called other girls
 just like my sister  who have children who have been
  in class but they have forgotten how to read and write  
 i said come on we can remind each other how to read and write again how to hold the pen how to read to hold the book 
 it was a great time i had with them  
 nor did i just learn a little about them  but they were able to tell me their personal stories 
 what they were facing every day as young mothers
  mothers that was when i was like ' why can 't we take all these things that are happening to us
 and present them and tell our mothers our traditional leaders that these are the wrong things 
 it was a scary thing to do 
 because these traditional leaders they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages a hard thing to change but a good
  thing to try  
 so we tried  it was very hard but we pushed  
 and i 'm here to say that in my community it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader  and our leader stood up for us and said no girl has to be
  in my community 
 that was the first time a community  they had to call the bylaws the first bylaw that protected girls in our community  
 we did not stop there  
 we forged ahead  we were determined to fight for girls
  not just in my community  but even in other communities 
 when the child marriage bill was being presented in february  we were there at the parliament house 
 every day when the members of parliament were entering we were telling them would you please support the bill 
 and we don 't have much technology like here  but we have our
  phones so we said why can 't we get
 their numbers and text them so we did that  it was a good thing so
 when the bill passed we texted them back thank you for supporting the bill and when the bill was signed by the
  's a good thing to know that the bill passed  but let me tell you this there are countries where eighteen is
  the legal marriage age  but don 't we hear cries of women and girls every day  
 every day  girls ' lives are being wasted away  
 this is high time for leaders to honor their commitment  
 in honoring this commitment  it means
 keeping girls ' issues at heart every time we don 't have to be subjected as second
 but they have to know that women as we are in this room 
 we are not just women we are not just girls  we are extraordinary we can do more  
 and another thing for malawi  and not just malawi but other countries the laws which are
  you know how a law is not a law until it is enforced the law
 which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries have been there  
 they need to be publicized at the local level at the community level 
 where girls ' issues are very striking 
 girls face issues  difficult issues at the community level every day
  so if these young girls know that there are laws that protect them  
 they will be able to stand up and defend themselves because they will know that there is a law that protects them 
 and another thing i would say is that
 girls ' voices and women 's voices are beautiful they are there
 but we cannot do this alone  
 male advocates they have to jump in to step in and work together it 's a collective work 
 what we need is what girls elsewhere need good education and above all not to marry whilst eleven
  we can transform the legal the cultural and political framework
 that denies girls of their rights i am standing here today
 and declaring that we can end child marriage
  in a generation this is the moment
 where a girl and a girl and millions of girls worldwide will be able to say i will marry when i want
