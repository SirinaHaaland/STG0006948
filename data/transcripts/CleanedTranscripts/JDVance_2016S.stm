  i remember the very first time i went to a nice restaurant a really nice restaurant it
 was for a law firm recruitment dinner  and i remember beforehand the waitress walked around and asked whether we wanted some wine  so i said sure i 'll take
  would you like sauvignon blanc or chardonnay 
 and i remember thinking come on lady  stop with the fancy french words and just give me some white wine 
 but i used my powers of deduction and recognized that chardonnay and sauvignon blanc were two separate types of white wine  and so i told her that i would take the chardonnay because frankly that was the easiest one to pronounce
  so i had a lot of experiences like that during my first couple of years as a law student at yale  
 because despite all outward appearances i 'm a cultural outsider  i didn 't come from the elites i didn 't come from
 the northeast or from san francisco 
 i came from a southern ohio steel town  and it 's a town that 's really struggling in a lot of ways ways that are indicative of the broader struggles of america
  heroin has moved in killing a lot of people people i know family violence domestic violence and divorce have torn apart families  
 and there 's a very unique sense of pessimism that 's moved in 
 think about rising mortality rates in these communities and recognize that for a lot of these folks the problems that they 're seeing are actually causing rising death rates in their own communities so there 's a very real sense of struggle
  i had a very
  seat to that struggle my family has been part of that struggle for a very long time 
 i come from a family that doesn 't have a whole lot of money  the addiction that plagued my community
 also plagued my family and even sadly my own mom there were a lot of problems that i saw in my own family
  caused sometimes by a lack of money  problems caused sometimes by a lack of access to resources and social capital
 that really affected my life 
 if you had looked at my life when i was fourteen years old and said 
 well what 's going to happen to this kid you would have concluded that i would have struggled with what academics call upward mobility 
 so upward mobility
  an abstract term but it strikes at something that 's very core at the heart of the american dream it 's the sense  
 and it measures whether kids like me who grow up in poor communities are going to live a better life whether they 're going to have a chance to live
 a materially better existence or whether they 're going to stay in the circumstances where they came from 
 and one of the things we 've learned unfortunately is that upward mobility isn 't as high as we 'd like it to be in this country 
 and interestingly  it 's very
  geographically distributed so take utah for instance 
 in utah a poor kid is actually doing ok very likely to live their share and their part in the american dream  
 but if you think of where i 'm from in the south in appalachia 
 in southern ohio it 's very unlikely that kids like that will rise the american dream in those parts of the country is
  in a very real sense just a dream  so why is that happening 
 so one reason is obviously economic or structural so you think of these areas they 're beset by these terrible economic trends built around industries like coal and steel that make it harder for folks to get ahead that 's
 certainly one problem  there 's also the problem of
  where the really talented people because they can 't find high skilled work at home end up moving elsewhere so they don 't build a business or non profit where they 're from 
 they end up going elsewhere and taking their talents with them  
 there are failing schools in a lot of these communities failing to give kids the educational leg up that really makes it possible for kids to have opportunities later in life these things are all important 
  i don 't mean to discount these structural barriers but when i look back at my life and my community something else was going on something else mattered
 's difficult to quantify  but it was no less real  
 so for starters  there was a very real sense of hopelessness in the community that i grew up in there was a sense that kids had that their choices didn 't matter 
 no matter what happened no matter how hard they worked no matter how hard they tried to get ahead  nothing good would happen
  that 's a tough feeling to grow up around that 's a tough mindset to penetrate  and it leads sometimes to very conspiratorial places  
 so let 's just take one political issue that 's pretty hot affirmative action 
 so depending on your politics you might think that affirmative action is either a wise or an unwise way to promote diversity in the workplace or the classroom
  but if you grow up in an area like this you see affirmative action as a tool to hold people like you back that 's especially true if you 're a member of the white working class  you see it as something
  that isn 't just about good or bad policy you see it as something that 's actively conspiring where people with political and financial power are working against you 
  but it 's there  and it warps expectations  
 so if you think about what do you do when you grow up in that world you can respond in a couple of ways one  you can say i 'm not going to work hard because no matter how hard i work it 's not going to matter 
 another thing you might do is say well i
 'm not going to go after the traditional markers of success like a university education or a prestigious job because the people who care about those things
  they 're never going to let me in 
 when i got admitted to yale a family member asked me if i had pretended to be a liberal to get by the admissions committee
  seriously  and it 's obviously not the case that there was a liberal box to check on the application  
 but it speaks to a very real insecurity in these places that you have to pretend to be somebody you 're not to get past these various social barriers it 's
  very significant problem  
 even if you don 't give in to that hopelessness  even if you think let 's say that your choices matter and you want to make the good choices you want to do better for yourself and for your family  
 it 's sometimes hard to even know what those choices are when you grow up in a community like i did  
 i didn 't know for example that you had to go to law school to be a lawyer  
 i didn 't know that elite universities
  as research consistently tells us are cheaper for low income kids because these universities have bigger endowments can offer more generous financial aid 
 i remember i learned this when i got the financial aid letter from yale for myself 
 tens of thousands of dollars in need based aid which is a term i had never heard before  
 but i turned to my aunt when i got that letter and said you know i think this just means that for the first time in my life being poor has paid really
  i didn 't have access to that information because the social networks around me didn 't have access to that information 
 i learned from my community how to shoot a gun how to shoot it well  
 i learned how to make a damn good biscuit recipe  the trick by the way is frozen butter not warm butter  
 but i didn 't learn how to get ahead i didn 't learn how to make
 the good decisions about education and opportunity that you need to
  century knowledge economy 
 economists call the value that we gain from our informal networks from our friends and colleagues and family social capital 
 the social capital that i had wasn 't built for 21st century america  
 and it showed there
 's something else that 's really important that 's going on that our community doesn 't like to talk about
  but it 's very real
 working class kids are much more likely to face what 's called adverse childhood experiences  which is just a fancy word for childhood trauma  
 getting hit or yelled at put down by a parent repeatedly  watching someone hit or beat your parent  watching someone do drugs or abuse alcohol these are all instances of childhood trauma  
 and they 're pretty commonplace in my family
  they 're not just commonplace in my family right now  they 're also multigenerational  so my grandparents 
 the very first time that they had kids they expected that they were going to raise them in a way that was uniquely good they were middle class  they were able to earn a good wage in a steel mill 
 but what ended up happening is that they exposed their kids to a lot of the childhood trauma that had gone back
 many generations my mom was twelve when she saw my grandma set my
  grandfather on fire  his crime
 was that he came home drunk after she told him if you come home drunk  i 'm gonna kill you and she tried to do it 
 think about the way that that affects a child 's mind and we think of these things as especially rare  but a
 study by the wisconsin children 's trust fund found that forty percent of
  kids face multiple instances of childhood trauma  
 compared to only  twenty nine percent for upper income kids 
 and think about what that really means if you 're a low income kid almost half of you face multiple instances of childhood trauma this is not an isolated problem this is a very significant issue 
 we know what happens to the kids who experience that life
  they 're more likely to do drugs more likely to go to jail more likely to drop out of high school 
 and most importantly  they 're more likely to do to their children what their parents did to them 
 this trauma  this chaos in the home is our culture 's very worst gift to our children  and it 's a gift that keeps on
  you combine all that the hopelessness  the despair  the cynicism about the future the childhood trauma  
 the low social capital 
 and you begin to understand why me  at the age of fourteen was ready to become just another statistic another kid who failed to beat the odds  
 but something unexpected happened 
 i did beat the odds things turned up for me i graduated from
  high school from college i went to law school  and i have a pretty good job now  so what happened well 
 one thing that happened is that my grandparents the same grandparents of setting someone on fire fame  they really shaped up by the time i came around  
 they provided me a stable home a stable family  they made sure that when my parents weren 't able to do the things that kids need they stepped in and
  that role 
 my grandma especially did two things that really matter one she provided that peaceful home that allowed me to focus on homework and the things that kids should be focused on 
 but she was also this incredibly perceptive woman despite not even having a middle school education she recognized the message that my community had for me that my choices didn 't matter
  that the deck was stacked against me she once told me jd never be like those losers who think the deck is stacked against them  you can do anything you want to 
 and yet she recognized that life wasn 't fair  
 it 's hard to strike that balance to tell a kid that life isn 't fair  but also recognize and enforce in them the reality that their choices matter but mamaw was able to strike that balance  
 the other thing that really helped was the united states marine corps so we think of the marine corps as a
  outfit and of course it is 
 but for me  the us marine corps was a four year crash course in character education it taught me how to make a bed how to do laundry how to wake up early how to manage my finances 
 these are things my community didn 't teach me i remember when i went to go buy a car for the very first time i was offered a dealer 's low low interest rate of twenty one
 point nine percent and i was ready
 to sign on the dotted line  
 but i didn 't take that deal  because i went and took it to my officer who told me stop being an idiot go to the local credit union and get a better deal and so that 's what i did 
 but without the marine corps i would have never had access to that knowledge i would have
 had a financial calamity frankly the
 last thing i want to say is that i had a lot of good fortune in the mentors and people who have played an important role in my life from the marines from ohio
  state from yale from other places people have really stepped in and ensured that they filled that social capital gap that it was pretty obvious apparently that i had 
 that comes from good fortune  
 but a lot of children aren 't going to have that good fortune and i think that raises really important questions for all of us
  about how we 're going to change that 
 we need to ask questions about how we 're going to give low income kids who come from a broken home access to a loving home we
 need to ask questions about how we 're going to teach low income parents how to better interact with their children with their partners we
 need to ask questions about how we give social capital  mentorship to low income kids who don 't have it 
 we need to think about how we teach working class children about
  hard skills like reading  mathematics  but also soft skills like conflict resolution and financial management 
 now  i don 't have all of the answers  i don 't know all of the solutions to this problem  but i do know this 
 in southern ohio right now  there 's a kid
  wondering whether when he comes through the door he 'll walk calmly or stumble drunkly there 's a kid
 whose mom sticks a needle in her arm and passes out 
 and he doesn 't know why she doesn 't cook him dinner  and he goes to bed hungry that night  
 there 's a kid who has no hope for the future
  to live a better life they just want somebody to show it to them  i don 't have all the answers  but i know
 that unless our society starts asking better questions
 about why i was so lucky and about how to get that luck to more of our communities and our country 's children we 're going to continue to have a very significant problem
