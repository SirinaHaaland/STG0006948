  bug lover myself not from childhood  by the way  but rather late  when i
 bachelored  
 majoring in zoology at tel aviv university i kind of fell in love with bugs  and then within zoology i took the course or the discipline of entomology
  the science
 of insects 
 and then i thought to myself how can i be practical or or help in the science of entomology  and then i moved to the world of plant protection
 plant protection from
 insects  from bad bugs  
 and then within plant protection i came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define
 as the use of living organisms to reduce
 populations of noxious plant pests  so it 's a whole discipline in plant protection
 aimed at the reduction of chemicals  
 and biological pest control by the way or these good bugs that we are talking about they 've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years
 but only in the last one hundred and twenty years  
 people started or people knew more and more how to exploit or how to use this biological control phenomenon or in fact natural control phenomenon for their own
 needs because biological control phenomenon you can
  and you see a whole new world of minute insects  or little spiders of one millimeter one and a half two
 millimeters long  and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones  so this phenomenon of of natural
  the plants 
 so it 's everywhere  and we need to know how to exploit it 
 go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples what is a pest what damage does it actually inflict on the plant  and what is the natural enemy  the biological control
  a look at that here is a devastating pest a spider mite  because it does a lot of webbing  like a spider 
 you see the mother in between  and two daughters probably on the left and right  and a single egg on the
  side  and then you see what kind of
 damage it can inflict on your right hand side you can see a cucumber leaf in the middle a cotton leaf and on the left a tomato leaf with these little
 stipplings they can literally turn from green to white  because of the sucking piercing
 mouth parts of those spiders  but
  that provides us with a good spider this is a predatory mite just as small as a spider mite   one two millimeters long not more than that
 running quickly  hunting  chasing the spider mites  and here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side just pierces 
 sucks the body fluids on the left hand side of the pest mite  and after five minutes 
  corpse of the spider mite  and next to it two satiated individuals predatory mites  a mother on the left hand side a young nymph on the  right hand
 side by the way  a meal for them for twenty four hours is about five of the spider mites of the bad mites and or fifteen to twenty
  springtime now in israel  when temperatures rise
 sharply you can see those bad ones those aphids all over the plants in your hibiscus in your lantana in the young fresh foliage of the so called spring flush  by the way with
  giving rise to females giving rise to other females  no males at all  parthenogenesis as it 's so called and they 're very happy with that apparently laughter
 here we can see the damage  those aphids secrete
 sugary liquid called honeydew and this just clogs the upper parts of the plant here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned
 from green to black
  of a black fungus sooty mold which is covering it  and here comes the salvation 
 through this parasitic wasp  here we are not talking about a predator here we are talking a parasite not a
  and sharp flier  and here you can see this parasite in action like in an acrobatic maneuver she stands  vis vis in front of the victim at the
 right hand side bending its abdomen and inserting 
 a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid  by the way the aphid tries to escape she kicks and bites and
 different liquids  but nothing will happen in fact only the egg of the parasitoid will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid  and after a few days depending upon 
  temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside
  after a few minutes
  you see halfway out 
 the birth is almost complete you can see by the way in different movies etc  it takes just a few minutes and if this is a female she 'll immediately mate with 
  a male and off she goes because time is very short this female can live only three to four days  and she needs to give rise to around four hundred eggs that means she has four hundred bad
  there is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example  again we 'll start first with the pest  the thrips  
 by the way  all these weird names
 i didn 't bother you with the latin names of these creatures 
 just the popular names  but this is a nice  slender  very bad pest if you can see this sweet peppers this is not just an exotic ornamental sweet
  pepper this is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults  
 and here comes the natural enemy minute pirate bug minute because it is rather small 
 here you can see the adult black and two young ones and again in action this adult pierces the thrips
  it within just several minutes  going to the other prey continuing all over the place  and if we spread those
 minute pirate bugs the good ones  for example in a sweet pepper plot 
 they go to the flowers  and look this flower is flooded with predatory bugs with the good ones  after wiping out the bad ones  the thrips  so this is a very positive situation
  harm to the developing fruit no harm to the fruit set everything is just fine under these circumstances  
 but again the question is here you saw them on a one to one basis
 the pest the natural enemy  what we do is actually this in northeast israel  in kibbutz sde eliyahu  there
  those natural enemies in other words what we do there
  amplify the natural control or the biological control phenomenon 
 and in thirty thousand square meters of state of the art greenhouses there we are 
  those predatory mites  those minute pirate bugs  those parasitic wasps 
  by the way they have a very nice landscape you see the jordanian mountains on the one hand and the jordan valley on the other hand and a good mild winter and a nice  hot 
  summer which is an excellent condition to mass produce those creatures and by the way 
 it is not genetic manipulation there are no gmos genetically modified organisms whatsoever
  take them from nature and the only thing that we do is give them the optimal conditions under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms in order to proliferate  multiply and reproduce 
 and that 's what we get   you see under a microscope  
 you see in the upper left corner you see a single predatory mite  and this is the whole bunch of predatory mites you see this ampul you see this
  this one i have one gram of those predatory mites  one gram is
 eighty thousand individuals eighty thousand individuals are good enough
 to control one acre four thousand square meters of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season
 of almost one year  and we can produce from this believe you me several dozens of kilograms
 on an annual
  basis  so this is what i call amplification of the phenomenon  and no we do
 not disrupt the balance on the contrary  because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance was already disrupted by the chemicals 
  here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the
  agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals 
 that 's the whole idea  
 and what is the impact in this table you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs  
 for example in israel  where we employ
 more than one thousand hectares ten thousand dunams in israeli terms of biological pests controlling sweet pepper
 under protection seventy five percent of the pesticides were actually reduced  
 and israeli strawberries even more eighty percent of the pesticides  especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries  
 so the impact is very strong 
 and there goes the question
 especially if you ask growers agriculturists why biological control
  good bugs  by the way  the number of answers you get equals the number of people you ask  
 but if we go for example to this place  southeast israel  the arava area above the great rift valley
  drive all the way to eilat  you see this just in the middle of the desert  
 and if you zoom in you can definitely watch this grandparents with their grandchildren  distributing
 the natural enemies the good bugs  instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applying chemicals  so safety with respect
  the idea of resistance 
 that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals  
 just like in our case that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics it 's the same  and it can happen
  either biological control or even natural control resistance is extremely rare 
 it hardly happens because this is evolution  this is the natural ratio 
 unlike resistance  which happens in the case of chemicals  and thirdly 
 public demand  the more the public demands the
  aware of the fact that they should wherever they can and wherever possible replace the chemical control with biological control 
 even here there is another grower you see very interested in the bugs  the bad ones and the good ones  wearing this magnifier already on her head just walking safely in her crop  
 finally i want to get to my vision or in fact to my dream
  this is the reality 
 have a look at the gap if we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide it 's two hundred and fifty million dollars  
 and look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world i think it 's times one hundred or something like that 
  so there is a huge gap to bridge  so actually how can we do it how can we bridge or let 's say 
 this gap over the years  first of all we need to find more robust good and reliable biological solutions more good bugs
 that we can either 
 or actually conserve in the field  secondly to create even more intensive and strict public demand
  of chemicals in agricultural fresh produce  
 and thirdly  also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry  
 and this gap really narrows step by step it does narrow  
 so i think my last slide is all we are saying we can
  i 'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol practitioners and implementers  in israel and abroad really give nature
