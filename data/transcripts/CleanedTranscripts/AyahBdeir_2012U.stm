  this may sound strange  but i 'm a big fan of the concrete block 
 the first concrete blocks were manufactured in one thousand eight hundred and sixty eight with a very simple idea modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit
  very quickly concrete blocks became the most used construction unit in the world 
 they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us buildings bridges  one brick at a time 
 essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time  
 almost a hundred years later in 
 lego came up with this 
 it was called the automatic binding brick and in a few short years lego bricks took place in every household it 's estimated that
  over four hundred billion bricks have been produced or seventy five bricks for every person on the planet 
 you don 't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses beautiful bridges beautiful buildings  lego made it accessible  
 lego has essentially taken the concrete block the building block of the world and made it into the building block of our imagination  
 meanwhile
  the exact same year at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced the next building block 
 the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive  
 like the concrete block the transistor allows you to build much larger more complex circuits  one brick at a time  but there 's a main difference the transistor was only for
  i personally don 't accept this that the building block of our time is
 reserved for experts so i decided to change that 
 eight years ago when i was at the media lab i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers
  a few years ago i started developing littlebits let me show you how they work 
 littlebits are electronic modules with each one specific function
 they 're pre engineered to be light  sound motors and sensors and the best part about it is
 they snap together
 with magnets  so you can 't put them the wrong way the bricks are color coded green is output blue is power
  pink is input and orange is wire  so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making making larger circuits 
 you put a blue to a green you can make light  you can put a knob in between
 and now you 've made a little dimmer
  switch out the knob for a pulse module  which is here 
 and now you 've made a little blinker
 add this buzzer for some extra punch
 and you 've created a noise machine  i 'm going to stop that  so beyond
 beyond simple play littlebits are actually pretty powerful  instead of having to program to wire to solder littlebits allow you to program using very
 simple intuitive gestures  so to make this blink faster or slower  you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower  
 the idea behind littlebits is that it 's a growing library  
 we want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready to use brick lights sounds solar panels motors everything should be accessible  
 we 've been giving littlebits to kids and seeing them play with them and it 's been an incredible
  the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don 't learn at schools for example how a nightlight works or why an elevator door stays open or how an ipod responds to touch  
 we 've also been taking littlebits to design schools so for example  we 've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littlebits as a material  
 here you see with felt and paper
  a few weeks ago we took littlebits to risd and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever just cardboard wood and paper and told them make something 
 here 's an example of a project they made a  motion activated confetti canon ball 
  this is actually my favorite project it 's a lobster made of playdough
 that 's afraid of the dark 
 to these non engineers littlebits became another material  electronics became just another material  and we want to make this material accessible to everyone  
  so littlebits is open source you can go on the website download all the design files make them yourself we want to encourage a world of creators
  inventors of contributors  because this world that we live in this interactive world is ours  so go ahead and start inventing  thank you
