  trees are wonderful arenas for discovery because of their tall stature their complex structure  
 the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty  i used to climb trees for fun all the time and now as a grown up i have made my profession
  understanding trees and forests through the medium of science  the most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy and dr terry erwin in 
 called the canopy the last biotic frontier i 'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy and share with you what canopy researchers are asking
  and also how they 're communicating with other people outside of science  let 's start
  our journey on the forest floor of one of my study sites in costa rica  because of the overhanging leaves and branches you 'll notice that the understory is very dark it 's very still 
  and what i 'd like to do is take you up to the canopy  not by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses  but rather showing you a very short clip from a national geographic film
  heroes of the high frontier this was filmed in monteverde costa rica and i think it gives us the best impression of what it 's like to climb a giant strangler fig
  up there is that it 's really like the atmosphere of an open field  and there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted to make their way and their life in the canopy  
 common groups like the sloth here have clear adaptations for forest canopies hanging on with their very strong claws  
 but i 'd like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity and tell you about the
  there are ten thousand species of ants that taxonomists people who describe and name animals have named four thousand of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy 
 one of the reasons i tell you about ants is because of my husband who is in fact an ant taxonomist and when we got married  he promised to name an ant after me which he did procryptocerus nalini a canopy ant we 've had two children august andrew
  and erika and actually he named ants after them so we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us 
 but my passion in addition to jack and my children
 are the plants the so called epiphytes those plants that grow up on trees  they don 't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor  but rather it is their leaves 
 that are adapted to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog 
  species around the world  they grow in tropical forests like this one and they also grow in temperate rainforests that we find in washington state these epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses  
 one thing i want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes as they die and decompose they actually construct an arboreal soil  both in the temperate zone and in the tropics and these mosses generated by decomposing
  like peat moss in your garden they have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water 
 one of the surprising things i discovered is that if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes what you 'll find underneath them are connections networks of what we call canopy 
  roots these are not epiphyte roots these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves and so those epiphytes are actually paying
  landlord a bit of rent in exchange for being supported high above the forest floor 
 i was interested and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interested in the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest  we 've done stripping experiments where we 've removed mats of epiphytes and and looked 
  at the rates of recolonization  we had predicted that they would grow back very quickly and that they would come in encroaching from the side what we found however was that they took
  an extremely long time over twenty years to regenerate starting from the bottom and growing up and even now after twenty five years they 're not up there they have not recolonized 
  completely  and i use this little image to say this is what happens to mosses  if it 's gone it 's gone and if you 're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom
  is really very slow these canopy communities are fragile well 
 when we look out you and i over that canopy of the intact primary forest 
 what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon 
 one of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered we know it 's a lot but we do not yet know
  the answers to how much  and by what processes carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere held in its
 in its biomass and moving on through the ecosystem 
 so i hope i 've showed you that canopy dwellers are not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy that tarzan and jane were interested in but rather that they foster biodiversity contribute 
  to ecosystem nutrient cycles and they also help to keep our global climate stable 
  you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems you would also see scenes like this scenes of forest destruction forest harvesting and forest fragmentation thereby making 
  that intact tapestry of the canopy unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has when it is not disturbed by humans  i 've also looked out on urban places like
  this and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives people who grew up in a place like this did not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees and forests as i did when i was a young girl 
 this troubles me 
 here in two thousand and nine  you know it 's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist  gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions and trying to figure out how we can answer
  as a small brown woman in a little college in the upper northwest part of our country far away from the areas of power and money  i really have to ask myself what can i do about this how can i reconnect people with trees 
 well  i think that i can do something  i know that as a scientist i have information and as a human being i can communicate with anybody
  inside or outside of academia  and so that 's what i 've begin doing and so i 'd like to unveil the international canopy network here  
 we consult to the media about canopy questions we have a canopy newsletter  we have an email listserv  and so we 're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy 
 the beauty of the canopy  the necessity of intact canopies to people outside of academia  we also recognize
  forth
 you know they don 't reach everybody and so we 've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to treetop barbie 
 is a great example of that what we do my students in my lab and i is we buy barbies from goodwill and value village  we dress her in clothes that have been made
  to become an ambassador who can carry the message that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing  
 we 've also made partnerships with artists with people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty of trees and forest canopies  and i 'd like to just tell you one of our projects which
 is the generation of canopy confluences what i do is i bring together scientists and artists of all kinds and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms  and we look at nature we 
  look at trees we look at the canopy  and we communicate and exchange and express what we see together 
  at rhode island school of design he saw nests in the canopy at one of our canopy confluences in the pacific northwest  and created this beautiful sculpture  
 we 've had dance people up in the canopy  jodi lomask and her wonderful troupe capacitor  joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in costa rica they made a fabulous
  they danced in the forest and we are taking this dance my scientific outreach
 communications and also linking up with environmental groups to go to different cities and to perform the science  the dance and the environmental outreach that we hope will make a difference  
 we brought musicians to the canopy and they made their music and it 's fantastic music  we had wooden flutists we had oboists
 we had opera singers we had guitar players and we had rap singers and i brought a little segment to give you of duke brady 's canopy rap
  experience of working with duke also led me to
 initiate a program called sound science  i saw the power of duke 's song with urban youth an audience you know i as a middle aged professor i don 't have a hope of getting to in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands 
 so i engaged caution this rap singer with a group of young people from inner city tacoma  we went out to
  i would pick up a branch caution would rap on it and suddenly that branch was really cool and then the students would come into our sound studios they would make their own rap songs with their own beats  they 
 ended up making a cd which they took home to their family and friends  thereby expressing their own experiences with nature in their own medium 
  pacific northwest  there 's a whole industry of 
  from old growth forests these mosses are taken from the forest  they 're used by the floriculture industry by florists to make arrangements and make hanging baskets it 's a two hundred and sixty five million dollar industry and it 's increasing rapidly  
 if you remember that bald guy you 'll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks in the pacific northwest
 old growth forest is going to take decades and decades to come back so this whole industry
 is unsustainable 
 what can i as an ecologist do about that well  my thought was that i could learn how to grow mosses  
 and that way we wouldn 't have to take them out of the wild  and i thought if i had some partners that could help me with
  that would be great and so i thought perhaps incarcerated men and women who don 't have access to nature who often have a lot of time they often have space and you don 't need any sharp tools to work with mosses would be great partners  
 and they have become excellent partners  the best i can imagine  they were very enthusiastic 
  were incredibly enthusiastic about the work they learned how to distinguish different species of mosses  which to tell you the truth is a lot more than my undergraduate students at the evergreen college can do  
 and they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design in order to grow these mosses  we 've been successful as partners in figuring out which species grow the fastest  and i 've just been overwhelmed with how successful
  this has been because the prison
 wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well  i started a science and sustainability seminar in the prisons  i brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners 
  into the prison we gave talks once a month and that actually ended up implementing some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons organic gardens  worm culture  recycling  water catchment
  with a grant from the department of corrections at washington state 
 they 've asked us to expand this program to three more prisons and our new project is having the inmates and ourselves learn how to raise the oregon spotted frog which is a highly endangered amphibian in washington state and oregon so they will raise them in captivity of course
 from
  they will have the pleasure many of them 
 of seeing those frogs that they 've raised from eggs and helped develop helped nurture move out into protected wildlands to augment the number of endangered species out there 
 in the wild and so i think for many reasons ecological social economic and perhaps even spiritual this has been a tremendous project and i 'm really looking forward to
  my students doing it but also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this 
 as many of you are aware the world of academia is a rather inward looking one i 'm trying to help researchers move more outward to have their own partnerships
 with people outside of the academic community  and so i 'm hoping that my husband jack the ant taxonomist can perhaps work with mattel to make taxonomist ken
  perhaps
 ben zander and
 bill gates could get together and make an opera about aids or perhaps al gore and naturally seven could make a song about climate change that would really make make you clap your hands  
 so  although it 's a little bit of a fantasy i think it 's also a reality  given the duress that we 're feeling environmentally in these times it is time for scientists to reach outward and
  time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well  
 i started my career
 with trying to understand the mysteries of forests with the tools of science 
 by making these partnerships that i described to you 
 i have really opened my mind and i have to say my heart to have a greater understanding to make other discoveries about nature
  myself when i look into my heart  i see trees this is actually an image of a real heart
 there are trees in our hearts there are trees in your hearts  
 when we come to understand nature we are touching the most deep the most important parts of our self 
 in these partnerships  i have also learned that people tend to compartmentalize themselves into
  and movie star people and scientists but when we share nature when we share our perspectives about nature  we find a common denominator  
 finally as a scientist
 and as a person
 and now  as part of the ted community  
 i feel that i have better tools to go out to trees to go out to forests to go out to nature
 to make new discoveries about nature and about humans ' place in nature wherever we are and whomever you are thank you very much
