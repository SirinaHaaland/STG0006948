  thank you very much chris everybody who came up here said they were scared i don 't know if i 'm scared  but this is my first
  time of
 addressing an audience like this and i don 't have any smart technology
 for you to look at there are no slides so you 'll just have to be content with me 
 what i want to do this morning is
 share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different africa  already this morning there were
 some allusions to the africa that you hear about all the time the africa of hiv
  aids  the africa of malaria the africa of poverty the africa of conflict and the africa of disasters  
 while
 it is true that those things are going on there 's an africa that you don 't hear about very much  and sometimes i 'm puzzled  and
  this is the africa that is changing that chris alluded to 
 this is the africa of opportunity  this is the africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies  
 and this is the africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this 
 that 's what i want to talk about today  
 and i want to start by telling you a story about that change in africa 
 on 15th of september two thousand and five
  a governor of one of the oil rich states of nigeria was arrested by the london metropolitan police
 on a visit to london  he was arrested
 because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him
  this arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the london metropolitan police
 and the economic and financial crimes commission of nigeria led by one of our most
 able and courageous people mr nuhu ribadu  
 alamieyeseigha was arraigned in london due to some slip ups he managed to escape dressed as a woman
 and ran from london back to nigeria where according to our constitution
  those in office
 as governors president as in many countries have immunity and cannot be prosecuted  
 but what happened people were so outraged by this behavior
 that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him
 and get him out of office today alams as we call him for short is in jail this is a story
  about the fact that people in africa are no longer willing
 to tolerate corruption from their leaders this is a story about the fact
 that people want their resources managed properly for their good and not taken out
 to places where they 'll benefit just a few
  and therefore when you hear about the corrupt africa corruption all the time i want you to know
 that the people and the governments
 are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries  and that some successes are emerging  does it mean the problem is over the answer is no 
 there 's still a long way to go but that there 's a will there  
 and that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight  so when you hear about corruption
  feel
 that nothing is being done about this that you can 't operate in any african country because of the overwhelming corruption  that is not the case there 's a will to fight 
 and
 in many countries that fight is ongoing and is being won 
 in others like mine where there has been a long history of dictatorship in nigeria  the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to
  go  but the the truth of the matter is that this is going on the results are showing independent
 monitoring by the world bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption and governance is improving 
  a study by the economic commission for africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in
 twenty eight african countries  and let me say just one more thing before i leave this area of governance 
 that is that people talk about corruption corruption all the time when they talk about it you immediately think about africa that 's the image african countries  
 but let me say this if alams was able to export eight million
 dollars into an account in london
  if the other people who had taken money estimated at twenty to forty billion now
 of developing countries ' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries if they 're able to do this what is that 
 is that not corruption in this country if you receive stolen goods are you not prosecuted  
 so when we talk about this kind of corruption let us also think about what is happening on the
  side of the globe where the money 's going
 and what can be done to stop it i
 'm working on an initiative now along with the world bank on asset recovery trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad
 developing countries ' moneys to get that sent back because if we can get the twenty billion dollars sitting out there back it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together
 the second thing i want to talk about is the will for reform 
 africans  after they 're tired we 're tired of being the subject of everybody 's
 charity and
 can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform 
 and what is happening in many african countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us  
 we have to do it we can invite partners who can support us but we have to start 
 we have to reform our economies change our leadership become more
  be more open
 to change and to information and this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries
 on the continent nigeria in fact if you 're not in nigeria you 're not in africa i want to tell you that one in four sub saharan africans is nigerian  
 and it has one hundred and forty million dynamic people
 chaotic people
  what we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves  
 and with the support of a leader who was willing at the time to do the reforms 
 we put forward a comprehensive reform program which we developed ourselves not the international monetary fund not the world bank where i worked for twenty one years and rose to be a vice
  no one can do it for you you have to do it for yourself we put together a program that would one get the state out of businesses it had nothing
 it had no business being in the state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it 's inefficient and incompetent  so we decided to privatize 
 many of our enterprises 
  as a result we decided to liberalize many of our markets can you believe that prior to this reform which started at the end of two thousand and three when i left washington to go and take up the post of finance minister
 we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop four thousand five hundred landlines in its entire 30 year
  a telephone in my country was a huge luxury you couldn 't get it you had to bribe you had to do everything to get your phone 
 when president obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector 
 we went from four thousand five hundred landlines
 to thirty two million gsm lines  and
  growing in the world after china  
 we are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms and nobody knows  
 except a few smart people 
 the smartest one first to come in was the mtn company of south
  the three years that i was finance minister they made an average of three hundred and sixty million dollars profit per year three hundred and sixty million
 in a market in a country that is a poor country with an average per capita income just under five hundred dollars per capita  
 so the market is there 
 when they kept this under wraps but
 soon others got to know 
 nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies and three or four others have come in  but there 's a huge market out there 
 and people don 't know about it or they don 't want to know  
 so privatization is one of the things we 've done the other thing we 've also done
 is to manage our finances
  because nobody 's going to help you and support you
 if you 're not managing your own finances well  and nigeria with the oil sector had the reputation
 of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well  so what did we try to do we introduced a fiscal rule
 that de linked our budget from the oil price before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in because oil is the biggest
 most revenue earning sector in the economy seventy percent of our revenues come from oil we de linked that and once we did it we
 began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save
 whatever was above that price we didn 't know we could pull it off it was very
  but what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development
 where even if oil prices were high we would grow very fast when they crashed we crashed and we could hardly even pay anything any salaries in the economy
  that smoothened out we were able to save just before i left twenty seven billion dollars  
  and this went to our reserves
 when i arrived in two thousand and three we had seven billion dollars in reserves 
 by the time i left  we had gone up to almost thirty billion dollars and as we speak now  we have about forty billion dollars in reserves
 due to
 proper management of our finances  
 and that shores up our economy  makes it stable our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have
  predictability of prices in the economy  
 we brought inflation down from twenty eight percent to about eleven percent 
 and we had gdp grow
 from an average of two point three percent the previous decade
 to about six
  all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy  and what is more important because we want to get away from oil and diversify 
  and there are so many opportunities in this one big country as in many countries in africa
  agriculture grew at better than eight percent as telecoms sector grew housing and construction  and i could go on and on 
 and this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro economy straightened out the opportunities in various other sectors
 are enormous  we have opportunities in agriculture like i said we have opportunities in solid
  we have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored and we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible that wouldn 't happen  
 so we 've now got a mining code
 that is comparable with some of the best in the world  we have opportunities in housing and real estate there was nothing in a country of one hundred and forty million people
 no shopping
 malls as you know
  this was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people 
 and now we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected 
 so huge things in construction real estate mortgage markets financial services  we had eighty nine banks too many
 not doing their real business we
  by requiring that they increase
 their capital share capital 
 and it went from about twenty five million dollars to one hundred and fifty million dollars the banks these banks are now consolidated  and that strengthening of the banking system
 has attracted a lot of investment from outside barclays bank of the u k is bringing in five hundred
  has brought in one hundred and forty million  and i can go on dollars on and on into the system we are doing the same with the insurance sector so in financial services a great deal of opportunity in tourism 
 in many african countries 
 a great opportunity and that 's what many people know east africa for the wildlife the elephants and so on  
 but managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people
  very important  so what am i trying to say i 'm trying to tell you
 that there 's a new wave on the continent a new wave of openness and democratization in which since two thousand more than two thirds of african countries have 
  democratic elections not all of them have been perfect or will
  is very clear 
 i 'm trying to tell you that since the past three years 
 the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about two point five percent to about five percent per annum this is better than the performance of many oecd countries  
 so it 's clear
 that things are changing conflicts are down on the continent from about twelve conflicts a decade ago we are down to three or four conflicts one
  of the most terrible of course of which is darfur 
 and you know you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent it looks like the entire continent is affected  
 but you should know that this continent is not
 is a continent of many countries 
 not one country  and if we are down to three or four conflicts it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in
  stable  growing exciting economies
 where there 's plenty of opportunity  and i want to just make one point about
 this investment the best way to help africans today
 is to help them to stand on their own feet  and the best way to do that is by helping
  create jobs there 's no issue with fighting malaria
 and putting money in that and saving children 's lives that 's not what i 'm saying that is fine  
 but imagine the impact on a family 
 if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves 
 if we can invest in places where you yourselves make money
 whilst creating
  jobs and helping people stand on their own feet 
 isn 't that a wonderful opportunity isn 't that the way to go 
 and i want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women 
  'm sorry that i didn 't say anything on time otherwise i would have liked you to have seen this it says africa open for business and this is a
 video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year understand that the woman who made it is going to be in tanzania where they 're having
 the
 the session in june  but it shows you africans and particularly african women
 who against all odds have developed businesses some of them world class 
 one of the women in this video adenike ogunlesi making children 's clothes which she started as a hobby
 and grew into a business  mixing african materials such as we have with
  make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys with african material mixed in very creative designs 
 has reached a stage where she even had an order from wal mart 
 for ten thousand pieces  
 so that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing and the women are diligent they are focused they work hard
  i could go on giving examples beatrice gakuba of rwanda who opened up a flower business and is now exporting
 to the dutch auction in amsterdam each morning and is employing two hundred other women and men to work with her  
 however many of these are starved for capital to expand 
 because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do
 what is necessary  nobody thinks in terms of a market nobody thinks there 's opportunity  
 but i 'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now will miss it forever  
 so if you want to
 be in africa  think about investing  think about the
  of this world who are doing incredible things 
 that are bringing them into the global economy  
 whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income  
 so i invite you
 to explore the opportunities when
  you go to tanzania  listen carefully because i 'm sure you will hear
 of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved
 in something that will do good
 for the continent for the people
 and for yourselves
