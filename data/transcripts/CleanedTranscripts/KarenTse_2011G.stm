  i walked into a prison in cambodia and i met a 12 year old boy
 who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel  and as i looked into his eyes i realized that for the hundreds of letters i had written
 for political prisoners
  that i would never have written a letter for him  
 because he was not a  12 year old boy who had done something important for anybody he was not a political prisoner he was a  12 year old boy
 who had stolen a bicycle what i also realized at that point was that it was not only cambodia  but of the one hundred and thirteen developing
  these countries have all passed laws
 that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured and what i recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity
 for us as a world community to come together
 and end torture as an investigative tool we often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst 
  percent of torture today is not for political prisoners it is for people
 who are in broken down legal systems  and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation it 's cheaper than having a legal system cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel
 it is what happens most of the time 
 i believe today that it is possible for us as a world community if we make a decision to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in
  our lifetime  
 but it will require three things  first is the training  empowerment and connection of defenders worldwide  the second
 is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel  and the third is commitment  so in the year two thousand
  i began to
 wonder what if we came together could we do something for these ninety three countries  
 and i founded international bridges to justice
 which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool
 and implementing due process rights in the ninety three countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in
  did come from cambodia and at the time i remember first coming to cambodia and there were in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four still less than ten attorneys in the country
 because the khmer rouge had killed them all and even twenty years later there was only ten lawyers in the country so consequently you 'd walk into a prison and
 not only would you meet 12 year old boys you 'd meet women and you 'd say why are you here women would say well i 've been here for ten years because my husband committed a crime but they can 't find him
  place where there was no rule of law the first group of defenders came together and i still remember 
 as i was training i said okay what do you do for an investigation 
 and there was silence in the class and finally one woman stood up [ inaudible name ] and she said khrew which means teacher 
 she said i have defended
 more than
 a hundred
  i 've never had to do any investigation because they all come with confessions 
 and we talked about as a class the fact that number one  the confessions might not be reliable  
 but number two we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this  especially as it was now against the law  
 and it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other
 in implementing these laws  and i still remember the first cases where they
  came all twenty five together she would stand up and they were in the back  and they would support her  and the judges kept saying no no no no we 're going to do things
 the exact same way we 've been doing them but one day the perfect case came and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller she was sitting outside of a house 
 she said she actually saw the person
 run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was but the police came they got her there was nothing on her
 she was pregnant at the time she had cigarette burns on her she 'd miscarried  
 and when they brought her case to the judge for the first time he stood up and he said yes there 's no evidence except for your torture confession
 and you will be released and the defenders
 began to take cases over and over again and you will see they have step by step began to change the course of history in cambodia
  cambodia is not alone i used to think well is it cambodia  or is it other countries  
 but it is in so many countries in burundi i walked into a prison and it wasn 't a
  diapers
 and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison and when i walked up to the prison director i said you 've got to let her out 
 a judge would let her out and he said okay  we can talk about it but look at my prison  
 eighty percent
 of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer what can we do so lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can
  take cases  but we realized that it 's not only the training of the lawyers  but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference for example in cambodia  
 it was that [ inaudible name ] did not go alone but she had twenty four lawyers with her who stood up together and in the same way in china they always tell me it 's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together
  in zimbabwe where i remember innocent  
 after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said i 've been here for one year eight years twelve years without a lawyer he came and we had a training together
 and he said i have heard it said because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling i have heard it said that we cannot
 help to create justice because we do not
  and then he said but i want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice 
 and with that he successfully organized  sixty eight lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases  the key that we see though is training
 and then early access i was recently in egypt and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers  and what they told me is that they said hey
  we don 't have police on the streets now the police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution they were torturing everybody all the time and
 i said but there 's been tens of millions of dollars
  that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here what 's going on i met with one of the development agencies  
 and they were training prosecutors and judges which is the normal
  as opposed to defenders  
 and they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual i said i 'm gonna copy this it had everything in it 
 lawyers can come at the police station it was perfect prosecutors were perfectly trained 
 but i said to them i just have one question  which is by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor 's office what had happened to them 
 and after a pause they said they had been tortured 
 so the pieces are not only the training of the lawyers but us finding a way to
  systematically implement early access to counsel because they are the safeguard in the system
 for people who are being tortured and as i tell you this i 'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like oh okay it sounds like
 we could do it but can we really do it because it sounds big  
 and there are many reasons why i believe it 's possible the first reason is the people on the ground
 who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment it 's not only innocent who i told you about in in zimbabwe  
 but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces we have a program called justicemakers  
 and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things  but how can we support them  
 so it 's an online contest where it 's only five thousand dollars if you come
  up with and innovative way of implementing justice and there are thirty justicemakers throughout the world from sri lanka to
 swaziland to the drc 
 who with five thousand dollars do amazing things through sms programs through paralegal programs  through whatever they can do  and it 's not
  but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward  
 so in china for instance great laws came out where it says police
 cannot torture people or they will be punished  and i was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers 
 and said how can we get this out  how can we make sure that this is implemented this is fantastic and he said to me
 you have money and i said 
 and he said that 's okay  we can still figure it out 
 and on december four  he organized three thousand members of the youth communist league from fourteen of the top law schools 
 who organized themselves  developed posters with the new laws  and went to the police stations and began what
  legal revolution to protect citizen rights 
 so i talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders we need to systematically implement early access to counsel  but the third and most important thing
 is that we make a commitment to this  
 and people often say to me you know this is great  but it 's wildly idealistic never going to happen 
 and the reason that i think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were
  used for people who decided they would end slavery 
 or end apartheid  it began with a small group of people who decided they would commit 
 now there 's one of our favorite poems from the defenders  which they share from each other is take courage friends  the road is often long the path is never clear  
 and the stakes are very high  
 but deep down you are not alone 
 and i believe that if we can come together
  as a world community to support not only defenders but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it we can end torture as an investigative tool 
 i end always because i 'm sure the questions are and i 'd be happy to talk to you at any point but what can i really do well i would say this first of all you know what you can do  
 but second of all i would
 leave you with the story of vishna who actually was my inspiration
  for starting international bridges to justice 
 vishna was a 4 year old boy when i met him who was born in a cambodian prison in kandal province  
 but because he was born in the prison 
 everybody loved him  including the guards  so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars so you know there 's bars  and by the
  vishna was getting bigger  which means what gets bigger your head gets bigger  
 so he would come to the first bar  the second bar and then the third bar and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through  and come back third second first and he would grab my pinkie  
 because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit you know he never quite made it to all of them every day  but he wanted to visit all one hundred and fifty six prisoners  
 and i would lift him and he would put his fingers through  or if they were dark cells it was like iron corrugated and he would put his fingers through
  and most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine and they looked forward to him  and i was like here 's vishna he 's a 4 year old boy he was born in a prison with almost nothing no material goods  but he had a sense of his own heroic journey which i believe we are all born into 
 he said probably
 i can 't do everything  but i 'm one i can do something and i will do the one thing that i can do so i thank you for having the prophetic
  imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together and invite you into this journey with us
