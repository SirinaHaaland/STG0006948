  when i was fourteen years old i was interested in science fascinated by it excited to learn about it  
 and i had a high school science teacher who would say to the class the
  i chose not to listen but to that statement alone  
 so let me take you to the andes mountains in chile  five hundred kilometers three hundred miles northeast of santiago  
 it 's very remote it 's very dry and it 's very beautiful 
  not much there there are condors there are tarantulas  
 and at night when the light dims it reveals one of the darkest skies on earth  
 it 's kind of a magic place the mountain  
 it 's a wonderful combination of very remote mountaintop with exquisitely sophisticated technology 
 and our ancestors for as long as there 's been recorded history have looked at the night sky and pondered the nature of our existence
 and we 're no exception our generation 
 the only difficulty is that the night sky now is blocked by the glare of city lights  
 and so astronomers go to these very remote mountaintops to view and to study the cosmos  so telescopes are our window to the cosmos  
 it 's no exaggeration to say that the southern hemisphere is going to be the future
 of astronomy for the 21st century  
 we have an array of existing telescopes already in the andes mountains in chile 
 and that 's soon to be joined by a really sensational array of new capability  
 there will be two international groups that are going to be building giant telescopes sensitive to optical
  as our eyes are there will be a survey telescope that will be scanning the sky every few nights  
 there will be radio telescopes sensitive to long wavelength radio radiation  and then there will be telescopes in space there 'll be a successor to the 
  hubble space telescope it 's called the james webb telescope and it will be launched in two thousand and eighteen there
 for the last decade  i 've been leading a group a consortium international group to build what will be when it 's finished 
 the largest optical telescope in existence  it 's called the giant magellan telescope  or gmt 
 this telescope is going to have mirrors that are eight point four meters in diameter each of the mirrors that 's almost twenty seven feet  so it dwarfs
  this stage maybe out to the fourth row in this audience each of the seven mirrors in this telescope will be almost 
 in diameter together the seven mirrors in this telescope
 will comprise eighty feet in diameter so essentially the size of this entire auditorium  
 the whole telescope will stand about forty three meters high and again
  being in rio  some of you have been to see the statue of the giant christ  the scale is comparable in height in fact it 's smaller than this telescope will be  
 it 's comparable to the size of the statue of liberty  
 and it 's going to be housed in
 an enclosure that 's twenty two stories sixty meters
  but it 's an unusual building to protect this telescope it will have open windows to the sky be able to point and look at the sky and it will actually rotate on a base
 two thousand tons of rotating building 
 the giant magellan telescope will have ten times the resolution of the hubble space telescope  
 it will be twenty million times more sensitive than the human eye  and it may for the first time ever be capable
 of finding life on planets outside of our solar system it 's going to allow us to look back at the first light in the universe
 literally the dawn of the cosmos the cosmic dawn  
 it 's a telescope that 's going to allow us to peer back witness galaxies as they were when they were actually assembling the first black holes in the universe the first
  galaxies 
 now for thousands of years  we have been studying the cosmos  we 've been wondering about our place in the universe  
 the ancient greeks told us that the earth was the center of the universe  five hundred years ago copernicus displaced the earth  
 and put the sun at the heart of the cosmos  
 and as we 've learned over the centuries since galileo galilei the italian
  scientist first turned 
 in that time a two inch very small telescope to the sky every time we have built larger telescopes we have learned something about the universe we 've made discoveries  without exception  
 we 've learned in the 20th century that the universe is expanding and
  our own solar system is not at the center of that expansion 
 we know now that the universe is made of about one hundred billion galaxies that are visible to us  
 and each one of those galaxies has one hundred billion stars within it  
 so we 're looking now at the deepest image of the cosmos that 's ever been taken it was taken using the hubble space
  and by pointing the telescope at what was previously a blank region of sky  before the launch of hubble and if you can imagine this tiny area  it 's only 
 of the size of the full moon so if you can imagine the full moon  and there are now ten thousand galaxies visible within that image 
 and the faintness of those images and the tiny size is only a result of the fact that those galaxies are so far away the vast distances  
 and each of those
  galaxies may contain within it a few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars 
 telescopes are like time machines  so the farther back we look in space  the further back we see in time 
 and they 're like light buckets literally they collect light  so larger the bucket the larger the mirror we have 
 the more light we can see and the farther back we can view
  so we 've learned in the last century that there are exotic objects in the universe black holes  we 've even learned that there 's dark matter and dark energy that we can 't see so you 're looking now at an actual image of dark matter 
 you got it not all audiences get that 
 so the way we infer the presence of dark matter we can 't see it but there 's an unmistakable tug
  tug  due to gravity  
 we now can look out we see this sea of galaxies in a universe that 's expanding 
 what i do myself is to measure the expansion of the universe  and one of the projects that i carried out in the  1990s used the hubble space telescope to measure how fast the universe is expanding
  we can now trace
 back to fourteen billion years  
 we 've learned over time that stars have individual histories that is they have birth they have middle ages and some of them even have dramatic deaths 
 so the embers from those stars actually then form the new stars that we see most of which turn out to have planets going around them 
 and one of the really surprising results in the last twenty years
 has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars these are called exoplanets 
 and until one thousand nine hundred and ninety five we didn 't even know the existence of any other planets other than going around our own sun  
 but now there are almost two thousand
 other planets orbiting other stars that we can now detect measure masses for there are five hundred of those
  that are multiple planet systems and there are four thousand and still counting other candidates for planets orbiting other stars 
 they come in a bewildering variety of different kinds 
 there are jupiter like planets that are hot  there are other planets that are icy  there are water worlds and there are rocky planets like the earth
 speculated diamond worlds  
 so we know there 's at least one planet our own earth in which there is life  we 've even found planets that are orbiting two stars that 's no longer the province of science fiction  
 so around our own planet we know there 's life we 've
  now can question our own origins  
 and given all that we 've discovered the overwhelming numbers now suggest that there may be millions perhaps maybe even hundreds of millions of other [ planets ] that are close enough
 just the right distance from their stars that they 're orbiting to have the existence of liquid water
 and maybe could potentially support
  so we marvel now at those odds the overwhelming odds
  and the amazing thing is that within the next decade the gmt may be able to take spectra of the atmospheres of those planets and determine whether or not they have the potential for life 
 so what is the gmt project  it 's an international project  it includes australia  south
  and i 'm happy to say being here in rio  that the newest partner in our telescope is brazil 
 it also includes a number of of institutions across the united states  including
 harvard university  the smithsonian and the carnegie institutions and the universities of arizona
 chile  
 so the making of the mirrors in this telescope is also fascinating in its own right take chunks of glass melt them in a furnace that is itself rotating 
 this happens underneath the football stadium at the university of arizona  it 's tucked away under fifty two thousand seats  nobody know it 's happening 
 and there 's essentially a rotating cauldron
  the mirrors are cast and they 're cooled very slowly  and then they 're polished to an exquisite precision  
 and so  if you think about the precision of these mirrors the bumps on the mirror over the entire
 amount to less than 
 of an inch  so can you visualize that
  of the width of one of my hairs over this entire 
 spectacular achievement  it 's what allows us to have the precision that we will have 
 so what does that precision buy us  so the gmt if you can imagine if i were to hold
  just happen to have  and i look at the face of that coin  i can see from here
 the writing on the coin  i can see the face on that coin  my guess that even in the front row you can 't see that 
 but if we were to turn the giant magellan telescope  all 80 feet diameter that we see in this auditorium  and point it two hundred miles away  if i were standing in so paulo 
 we could resolve the face
  this coin  that 's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope
  and if if we were 
 if an astronaut went up to the moon a quarter of a million miles away  
 and lit a candle a single candle then we would be able to detect it using the gmt 
 quite extraordinary
 this is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy nearby is astronomical it 's all relative it 's tens of millions of light years away 
 this is what this cluster would look like so look at those four bright objects  and now lets compare it with a a camera on the hubble space telescope  you can see faint detail that starts to come through 
  finally and look how dramatic this is this is what the gmt will see 
 so keep your eyes on those bright images again this is what we see on one of the most powerful existing telescopes on the earth  and this again  what the gmt will see 
 extraordinary precision  so where are we we have now leveled the top of the mountaintop in chile  we blasted that off
  we 've tested and polished the first mirror we 've cast the second and the third mirrors and we 're about to cast the fourth mirror we had a series of reviews this year international panels that came in and reviewed us and said you 're ready to go to construction 
 and so we plan on building this telescope with the first four mirrors we want to get on the air quickly
  and the full telescope will be finished in the middle of the next decade with all seven mirrors  
 so we 're now poised to look back at the distant universe  the cosmic dawn we
 'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail 
 but for me one of the most exciting things about building the gmt is the opportunity to actually discover something
  that we don 't know about that we can 't even imagine at this point something completely new 
 and my hope is that with the construction of this and other facilities 
 that many young women and men will be inspired to reach for the stars  thank you very much
  have a question for you you mentioned
 different facilities  so the magellan telescope is going up but also alma and others
 in chile and elsewhere including in hawaii is it about
 cooperation and complementarity or about competition i know there 's competition in terms of funding  but what about the
  in terms of the science they 're very complementary the telescopes that are in space the telescopes on the ground telescopes with different wavelength capability telescopes even that are similar but different instruments
 they will all look at different parts of the questions that we 're asking so when we discover other planets we 'll be able to test those observations we 'll be able to measure the atmospheres be able to look in space with very high resolution so
 they 're very complementary  you 're right about the funding we compete  but scientifically it 's very complementary
