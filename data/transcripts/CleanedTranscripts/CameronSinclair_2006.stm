  take you on a journey very quickly to explain the wish  i 'm going to have to take you somewhere where many people haven 't been and that 's around the world  
 when i was about twenty four years old
  kate stohr and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work not only about responding to natural disasters
 but involved in systemic issues  
 we believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce innovative sustainable design design can really make a difference in people 's lives  
 so i started my life as an architect or training as an architect  and i was always interested
  in socially responsible design and how you can really make an impact  but when i went to architecture school  it seemed that i was a black sheep in the family
  many architects seemed to think that when you design you design a jewel and it 's a jewel that you try and crave for whereas i felt that when you design you either improve 
 or you create a detriment to the community in which you 're designing so you 're not just doing a building for the residents or or for the people who are going to use it  but for the community as a whole 
 we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in kosovo  
 and i didn 't know what i was doing like i said
 mid 20s and i 'm  the internet generation so we started a website  we put a call out there and to my surprise in a couple of months we had hundreds of entries from around the world
  that led to a number of prototypes being built and really
  experimenting with some ideas
  two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub saharan africa responding to the hiv aids pandemic
 that led to
 five hundred and fifty entries from fifty three countries  we also
 have designers from around the world that participate  and we had an exhibit
  of work that that followed that two thousand and four was the tipping point for us 
 we started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in iran in bam also following up on our work in africa  
 working within the united states most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner but i live in bozeman montana go up to the north plains on the reservations or go down to alabama or mississippi
  and i could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries that i 've been to so we got involved in
 in inner cities and elsewhere and also
  i will go into some more projects two thousand and five mother nature kicked our ass i think we can pretty much assume that two thousand and five was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters 
 and because of the internet and because of
  connections to blogs and so forth within
 literally hours of the tsunami we were already raising funds getting involved working with with people on the ground
  we run from a couple of laptops and in the first couple of days  i had four thousand emails from people needing help  so
 we began to get involved in projects there and i 'll talk about some others
  and then of course this year we 've been responding to katrina as well as following up on our reconstruction work so this is a brief overview 
 in two thousand and four i really couldn 't manage the number of people who wanted to help or the number of requests that i was getting it was all coming into my laptop and cell phone  
 so we decided to embrace 
  an open source model of business so that anyone anywhere in the world could start a local chapter and they can get involved in local problems because i believe there is no such thing as
  utopia all problems are local all solutions are local so that means you
 know somebody who 's based in in mississippi knows more about mississippi than i do so what happened is we used meetup and and all these other
 internet tools and we ended up having forty chapters starting up thousands of architects in one hundred and four countries
  so the bullet point sorry i never do a suit so i knew that i was going to take this off  ok  because i 'm going to do it very quick
 this isn 't just about nonprofit what it showed me is that there 's a grassroots movement going on of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller and that we have the opportunity
 not the responsibility but the opportunity to really get involved
  in making change 
 i 'm adding that to my time 
 so what you don 't know is we 've
  these thousands of designers working around the world connected basically by a website and we have a staff of three
 the fact that nobody told us we couldn 't do it  we did it and so there 's something to be said about navet so seven years later we 've developed so that we 've got advocacy 
  instigation and implementation we advocate for good design not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums op eds we have a book on humanitarian work  but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy
 we can talk about fema but that 's another talk  
 instigation developing ideas with communities and and ngos doing open source design competitions
  referring matchmaking with communities and then implementing actually going out there and doing the work because
 when you invent  it 's never a reality until it 's built  so it 's really important that if we 're designing and
 trying to create change we build that change  so here 's a select number of projects 
 kosovo  
 this is kosovo in ' ninety nine 
 we did an open design competition like i said  it led to a whole variety of of ideas and this wasn 't about emergency shelter but transitional shelter that would last five to ten years that would be placed next to the the land the resident lived in
 and that they would rebuild their own home  
 this wasn 't imposing an architecture on a community  this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow
 the way they want to we had from the sublime to the ridiculous but they worked this is an inflatable hemp house  it was built it
  this is a shipping container built and works and a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural
 building  but also the issues of governance and the idea of creating communities through complex networks  so we 've engaged not just designers but also
 a whole variety of
 professionals using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes
  straw bale construction creating heat walls  and then something remarkable happened in ' ninety nine we went to africa
 originally to look at the housing issue within three days we realized the problem was not housing  it was the the growing pandemic of hiv aids  
 and it wasn 't doctors telling us this it was actual villagers that we were staying
  and so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk ten fifteen kilometers to see doctors  you get the doctors to the people  
 and we started engaging the the medical community 
 and you know we thought we were real bright
 sparks we 've come up with this great idea mobile health clinics  widely distributed throughout sub saharan africa 
 and the medical community there said we
 said this for the last decade we know this we just don 't know how to show this so in a way we 
  needs and shown
 solutions  and so again we had a whole variety of ideas that came in 
 this one i personally love because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions but about raising awareness  
 this is a kenaf clinic  you get seed and you grow it in a plot of land and
 and it grows fourteen feet in a month and on the fourth week the doctors come and they mow out an area put a tensile structure on the top  and
 when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers  you cut down the clinic and you eat it
 so it 's dealing with the fact that if you have aids you also need to have nutrition rates and the idea
  as important as getting antiretrovirals out there so you know this is a serious serious solution 
 this one i love the idea is it 's not just a clinic it 's a community center this looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community so it can be a self sustaining project 
 every one of these projects is sustainable 
 that 's not because i 'm a tree hugging green person  it 's because when you live on four dollars a day
  living on survival and you have to be sustainable you have to know where your energy is coming from you have to know where your resource is coming from and you have to keep the maintenance down  
 so this is this is about getting an economic engine  and then at night it turns into a movie theater so it 's not an aids clinic  
 it 's a community center  so you
  and these ideas developed into prototypes and they were eventually built and currently as of this year there are clinics rolling out in nigeria and
 kenya 
 from that we also developed siyathemba  the community came to us and said the problem is that the girls don 't have education 
 and we 're working in an area where young women between the ages
  have a fifty percent hiv aids rate  
 and that 's not because they 're promiscuous  it 's because there 's no knowledge  and so we decided to look at the idea of sports and create a youth sports center that 
  doubled as an hiv aids outreach center  and the coaches of the girls ' team were also trained doctors  so that there would be a very slow way of developing
  and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region and then the community picked their design they said this is our design because it 's not only about engaging a community 
 it 's about empowering a community and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process 
  out there working with the first ever women 's soccer team in
  which has now changed to siyathemba
 this is our home ground cameron sinclair i 'm going to show that later because i 'm running out of time  i can see chris looking at me
 slyly  this was a connection just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop
 africa 's first telemedicine center in tanzania  and we met literally a couple of months ago we 've already developed a design the team is over there working in partnership this was a matchmaking thanks to
  to a couple of tedsters sun [ microsystems ] cheryl heller
 and
 andrew zolli who connected me with this amazing african woman  and we start construction in june and it will be opened by tedglobal so when you come to tedglobal you can check it out 
 but what we 're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development  and we 've been involved in a lot of
  such as
 the tsunami and also things like hurricane katrina  this is a
  shelter that can be easily assembled  
 this is a 
 community center  and what that means is we actually live and work with the community and they 're part of the design
  the kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be  and then eventually the community 
  through skills training end up building the building with us  here is another school
 this is what the un un gave these guys for six months twelve plastic tarps
 this was in august  this was the replacement that 's supposed to last for two years when the rain comes down you can 't hear a thing and in the summer it 's about one hundred and forty degrees
  inside  so we said if the rain 's coming down  let 's get fresh water so every one of our schools has a rainwater collection system  very low cost
  three classrooms and rainwater collection is five thousand dollars  this was raised by hot chocolate sales
 in atlanta  
 it 's built by the parents of the kids the kids are out there on site building the buildings and it opened a
  couple of weeks ago and there 's six hundred kids that are now using the schools 
 so disaster hits home
 we see the bad stories on cnn and fox and all that but we don 't see the good stories 
 here is a community that got together and they said no to waiting they formed a partnership
 diverse partnership of players to actually map out east biloxi to figure out who 's getting involved we 've had over one thousand five hundred volunteers rebuilding rehabbing homes  
 figuring out what fema regulations are not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild working with residents getting them out of their homes so they don 't get ill  this is what they 're cleaning up on their own
  designing housing this house is going in in a couple of weeks this is a rehabbed home done in four days  this is
 a utility room for a woman who is on a on a walker she 's seventy years old this is what fema gave her 
 six hundred bucks happened two days ago  we put together  very quickly a washroom  it
  it 's running and she just started a business today where she 's washing other people 's clothes 
 the calhouns they 're photographers who had documented the lower ninth for the last forty years  
 that was their home and these are the photographs they took  and we 're helping working with them to create a new building 
 projects we 've done projects we 've been a part of support why don 't aid agencies do this 
 this is the un tent
  this is the new un tent just introduced this year quick to assemble it 's got a flap that 's the invention 
 it took twenty years to design this and get it implemented in the field i was twelve years old 
 there 's a problem here luckily we 're not alone there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
 architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work 
 more hemp houses it 's a theme in japan apparently  i 'm not sure what they 're smoking 
 this is a grip clip designed by somebody who said all you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical
  support beams 
 this guy designed for
 for
 nasa is now doing housing  i 'm going to whip through this quickly because i know i 've got only a couple of minutes
  so this is all done in the last two years  i showed you something that took twenty years to do and this is just a
  that were built in the last couple of years from brazil to india  mexico alabama  
 china  
 israel palestine 
 vietnam the average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is thirty two that 's how old i am
  so it 's a young
 i just have to stop here because arup is in the room and this is the best designed toilet in the world  if you 're ever ever in india  go use this toilet 
 chris luebkeman will tell you why  
 i 'm sure that 's how he wanted to spend the party 
 but the future is not going to
  cities of new york but this and when you look at this  you see crisis what i see is many many inventors 
 one billion people live in abject poverty we hear about them all the time four billion live in in growing but fragile economies 
 one in seven live in unplanned settlements if we do nothing about the housing crisis that 's about to happen in twenty years one in three people will live
  in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp look left look right one of you will be there 
 how do we improve the the living standards of five billion people 
 with ten million solutions  so i wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions
 for everyone
  humanity with seven hundred dollars and a website  
 so chris somehow decided to give me one hundred thousand so why not this many people
  architecture is the way to go you have a diverse community of participants and we 're not just talking about inventors and designers but we 're talking about the funding model 
 my role is not as a designer it 's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world and what we need is
 something that replicates me globally  because i haven 't slept in seven years 
  what will this thing be designers want to respond to issues of of humanitarian crisis  but they don 't want some company
 in the west taking their idea and basically profiting from it so creative commons has developed the developing nations license and what that means is that a designer can
 the siyathemba project i showed was the first ever building to have a creative commons license on it
  as soon as that is built 
 anyone in africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free
 applause so why not allow designers the opportunity to do this but still protect their rights here  we want to have
 a community where you can upload ideas and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake in flood in all sorts of austere
  environments  the reason that 's important is i don 't want to wait for the next katrina to find out if my house works  
 that 's too late we need to do it now so doing that globally and i want this whole thing to work
 when you look at the face of an architect most people think a gray haired white guy i don 't see that i see the face of the world  so i want everyone
  from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development 
 the idea of needs based competitions xprize for the other ninety eight percent if you want to call it that 
 we also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together and the idea of integrating manufacturers fab labs in every country
  when i hear about the $ one hundred laptop and it 's going to educate every child educate every designer in the world  put one in every favela every
 slum settlement 
 because you know what innovation will happen  and i need to know that it 's called the leap back we talk about leapfrog technologies i write with worldchanging and the one thing we 've been talking about is i learn more on the ground than i 've ever learned here  so let 's take those ideas adapt
  and we can use them 
 these ideas are supposed to be adaptable
 they should have the potential for evolution they should be developed by every nation in the world and and useful for every nation in the world  
 what will it take there should be a sheet i don 't have time to read this because i 'm going to be yanked off ca let 's just leave it up for a sec cs well
  what will it take 
 you guys are smart  
 so it 's going to take a lot of computing power  because i want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in in developing these designs but utilize the designs 
 also 
 a process of reviewing the designs
  i want every arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we 're doing stuff that 's standing because those guys are the best in the world
  and so 
 you know i want these i just should note  i have two laptops and one of them is there and that has three thousand designs on it  if i drop that laptop 
 what happens  
 so it 's important to have these proven ideas put up there  easy to use easy to get ahold of 
 my mom once said
  all mouth and no trousers 
 i 'm fed up of talking about making change  you only make it by doing it  
 we 've changed fema guidelines we 've changed public policy  we 've changed international response
 based on building things so for me it 's important that we create a real conduit
  it 's free innovation think of free culture this is free innovation  
 somebody said this a couple of years back  
 i will give points for those who know it  but i think
 i think the man was
 maybe twenty five years too early  so let 's do it
