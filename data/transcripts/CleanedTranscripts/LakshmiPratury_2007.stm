  i will talk about death seemed to be the passion today  
 actually it 's not about death  it 's inevitable terrible but really what i want to talk about is i 'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die that 's what i want to talk about 
 so art buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video
 that appeared soon after he died saying hi i 'm art buchwald and i just died 
 and mike  who i met at galapagos a trip which i won at ted 
 is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling chronicling his journey through cancer  
 and my father left me a legacy of his handwriting
 through letters and a notebook
  in the last two years of his life when he was sick he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me 
 he wrote about my strengths  weaknesses  and gentle suggestions for improvement
 quoting specific incidents  and held a mirror to my life 
 after he died i realized that no one writes to me anymore
  handwriting is a disappearing art i 'm all for email and thinking while typing but why give up old habits for new 
 why can 't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives  
 there are times
 when i want to trade all those years that i was too busy
 to sit with my dad and chat with him  and trade all those years
 for one hug  
 but too late but that 's when
 i take out his letters
 and i read them and the paper that touched his hand is in mine and i feel connected to him  so
 maybe we all need to leave our children
 with a value legacy and not a financial one
  a value for things with a personal touch
 an autographed book a soul searching letter 
 if a fraction of this powerful ted audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper john it 'll be a recycled one
 and write a beautiful letter to someone they love we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes
  do i plan to leave for my son  i collect autographed books and those of you authors in the audience know i hound you for them
 and cds too tracy i plan to publish
 my own notebook as i witnessed my father 's body being swallowed by fire i sat by his funeral pyre and
  i have no idea how i 'm going to do it but i am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book  and leave that published book for my son
