  this is a map of new york state that was made in one thousand 
 nine hundred and thirty seven by the general drafting company it 's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds because down here at the bottom of the catskill mountains there is a little town called roscoe actually this will go easier if i just put it up here
 there 's roscoe
 and then right above roscoe is rockland new york  
 and then right above that is the tiny town of agloe new york agloe new york is very famous to cartographers because it 's a paper town it 's also 
  known as a copyright trap  mapmakers because my map of new york and your map of new york are going to look very similar on account of the shape of
  new york
 often mapmakers will insert fake places
 onto their maps in order to protect their copyright because then if my fake place shows up on your map i can be well and truly sure that you have robbed me
 is a scrabblization of the initials of the two guys who made this map ernest
  on it at the same exact intersection of two dirt roads in the middle of nowhere well
 you can imagine the delight over at general drafting 
 they immediately call rand mcnally  and they say we 've caught you we made agloe new york up it is a fake place it 's a paper town we 're going to sue your pants
  because people kept going
 to that intersection of two dirt roads 
 in the middle of nowhere  expecting there to be a place called agloe someone built a place called agloe new york it
 had a gas station a general store two houses at its peak
  and this is of course a completely irresistible metaphor to a novelist because we would all like to believe that the stuff that we write down on paper
 can change the actual world in which we 're actually living which is why my third book is called paper towns but what interests me ultimately more
 than the medium in which this happened is the phenomenon itself  
 it 's easy enough to say that the world shapes our maps of the world right like the overall shape of the
  world is obviously going to affect our maps but what i find a lot more interesting is the way
 that the manner in which we map the world changes the world because the world would truly be a different place if north were down and the world would be a truly 
  different place if alaska and russia weren 't on opposite sides of the map and the world would be a different place if we projected europe to show it in its actual
 size the world is changed by our maps of the world the way that we choose
 sort of our personal cartographic enterprise also shapes the map of our lives  and that in turn shapes our lives  i believe that what we map changes the life
  i do believe that while maps don 't show you where you will go in your life 
 they show you where you might go you very rarely go to a place that isn 't on your personal map  so i was a really terrible student when i was a kid 
  was consistently in the low 2s 
 and i think the reason that i was such a terrible student is that i felt like education was just a series of hurdles that had been erected before me and i had to jump over 
 in order to achieve adulthood  and i didn 't really want to jump over these hurdles because they seemed completely arbitrary so i often wouldn 't and then people would threaten me you know they 'd threaten me with this going on [ my ] permanent record
  never get a good job i didn 't want a good job  
 as far as i could tell at eleven or twelve years old like people with good jobs woke up very early in the morning 
 and the men who had good jobs one of the first things they did
 was tie a strangulation item of clothing around their necks they literally put nooses on themselves and then they went off to their jobs whatever they were 
 that 's not a recipe for a happy life
  these people in my 
 twelve year old imagination these people who are strangling themselves
 as one of the first things they do each morning  they can 't possibly be happy why would i want to jump over all of these hurdles and have that be the end that 's a terrible end  
 and then when i was in tenth grade i went to this school indian springs school a small boarding school outside of birmingham alabama
  and all at once i became a learner  and i became a learner because i found myself in a community of learners  i found myself surrounded by people who celebrated 
 intellectualism and engagement and who thought that my ironic  oh so cool disengagement wasn 't clever or funny but like it was a simple and unspectacular response to very complicated and compelling
  problems  and so i started to learn because learning was cool i learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets  and i learned that iambic pentameter is and why it sounds so good 
  to human ears i learned that the civil war was a nationalizing conflict i learned some physics i learned that correlation shouldn 't be confused with causation all of these things by the way
  enriched my life on a literally daily basis  and it 's true that i don 't use most of them for my job 
 but that 's not what it 's about for me  it 's about cartography what is the process of cartography it 's you know 
 sailing upon some land and thinking i think i 'll draw that bit of land and then wondering maybe there 's some more land to draw 
 and that 's when learning really began for me  it 's true that i had teachers that didn 't give up on me  and i was very fortunate to have those
  teachers because i often gave them cause to think there was no reason to invest in me  but a lot of the learning that i did in high school
 wasn 't about
 what happened inside the classroom  it was about what happened outside of the classroom for instance i can tell you that there 's a certain slant of light winter afternoons that oppresses like the heft of cathedral 
  tunes not because i memorized emily dickinson in school when i was in high school
  but because there was a girl when i was in high school  and her name was amanda  and i had a crush on her and she liked emily dickinson poetry  
 the reason i can tell you what opportunity cost is is because one day when i was playing super mario kart on my couch my friend emmet walked in and he said how long have you been playing super mario kart and i said
  have made thirty dollars so in some ways you just paid thirty dollars to play super mario kart and i was like i 'll take that deal 
 but i learned
 what opportunity cost is 
 and along the way the map of my life got better it got bigger 
 it contained more places there were more things that might happen more futures i might
  have 
 it wasn 't a formal organized learning process and i 'm happy to admit that it was spotty it was inconsistent there was a lot i didn 't know i might know  you know cantor 
  's idea that some infinite infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets but i didn 't really understand the calculus
  instead of imagining it as arbitrary hurdles that you have to jump over is that you see a bit of coastline  and that makes you want to see more and so now i do know at least some of the calculus that underlies all of that stuff  
 so i had one learning community in high school then i went to another for college  and then i went to another when i started working at a magazine called booklist where i was an assistant
  and then i wrote a book and like all authors dream of doing i promptly quit my job 
 and for the first time since high school  i found myself without a learning community and it was miserable  i hated it
  i read many many books during this two year period i read books about stalin and books about how the uzbek people came to identify as muslims and i read books about how to make atomic bombs
  it just felt like i was creating my own hurdles and then jumping over them myself  instead of feeling the excitement of being part of a community of learners a community of people 
  who are engaged together in the cartographic enterprise of trying to better understand and map the world around us  and then in two thousand and six i met that guy his
  ze frank i didn 't actually meet him just on the internet  ze frank
 was running at the time a show called the show with ze frank 
 and i discovered the show  and that was my way back into being a community learner again here 's ze talking about las vegas ze frank 
 las vegas was built in the middle of a huge hot desert almost everything here was brought from somewhere else the sort of rocks the trees the waterfalls these fish are almost as out of place as my pig that flew contrasted
  the scorching desert that surrounds this place so are these people things from all over the world have been rebuilt here away from their histories and away from the people that experience them differently  sometimes improvements were made even the sphinx got a nose job  here 
  there 's no reason to feel like you 're missing anything this new york means the same to me as it does to everyone else everything is out of context and that means context allows for everything self parking events center shark reef this fabrication
  of place could be one of the world 's greatest achievements because no one belongs here everyone does as i walked around this morning i noticed most of the buildings were huge mirrors reflecting the sun back into the desert  but 
  unlike most mirrors which present you with an outside view of yourself embedded in a place these mirrors come back empty john green makes me nostalgic for the days when you could see the pixels in online video 
  just a great public intellectual he 's also a brilliant community builder and the community of people that built up around these videos was in many ways a community of learners so we played ze frank at chess collaboratively and we beat him
 we organized ourselves to take a young man on a road trip across the united states 
 we turned the earth into a sandwich by having one person hold a piece of bread at one point on the earth and on the exact opposite point of the earth have another person holding a piece of bread
 i realize that these are silly ideas  
 but they are also learny ideas  and that was what was so exciting to me and if you go online you can find communities like this all over the place follow the calculus tag 
 on tumblr and yes you will see people complaining about calculus but you 'll also see people re blogging those complaints making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful and here 's a way in to thinking about the problem
  that you find unsolvable you can go to places like reddit and find sub reddits like  ask a historian or ask science where you can ask people who are in these fields
 a wide range of questions from very serious ones to very silly ones but to me the most interesting communities of learners that are growing up on the internet right now are on youtube and
  i am biased
 but i think in a lot of ways the youtube page resembles a classroom look for instance at minute physics a guy who 's teaching the world about physics let 's cut to the 
  chase as of july four two thousand and twelve  the higgs boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally
 first just like the electron is an excitation in the electron field  the higgs boson is simply a particle which is an excitation of the everywhere permeating higgs field the higgs field in turn
  plays an integral role in our model for the weak nuclear force in particular  the higgs field helps explain why it 's so weak we 'll talk more about this in a later video  but even though weak nuclear theory was confirmed in the 1980s
  in the equations the higgs field is so inextricably jumbled with the weak force that until now we 've been unable to confirm its actual and independent existence jg 
 or here 's a video that i made as part of my show crash course talking about world war i the immediate cause was of course the assassination in sarajevo of the austrian archduke franz 
  ferdinand on june twenty eight one thousand nine hundred and fourteen by a bosnian serb nationalist named gavrilo princip quick aside it 's worth noting that the first big war of the twentieth century began with an act of terrorism so franz ferdinand wasn 't
  particularly well liked by his uncle the emperor franz joseph now that is a mustache but even so the assassination led austria to issue an ultimatum to serbia whereupon serbia accepted 
  some but not all of austria 's demands leading austria to declare war against serbia and then russia due to its alliance with the serbs mobilized its army germany because it had an alliance with austria told russia to stop mobilizing which russia failed to do so then germany mobilized its own army
  declared war on russia cemented an alliance with the ottomans and then declared war on france because you know  france and
 it 's not just physics and world history that people are choosing to learn through youtube 
 here 's a video about abstract mathematics 
  in math class yet again because they make you go every single day and you 're learning about i don 't know the sums of infinite series that 's a high school topic right which is odd because it 's a cool topic  but they somehow manage 
  to ruin it anyway so i guess that 's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum so in a quite understandable need for distraction you 're doodling and thinking more about what the plural of series should be than about the topic at hand
  sixteen and so on approaches one is useful if say you want to draw a line of elephants each holding the tail of the next one  
 normal elephant young elephant baby elephant  dog sized elephant puppy sized elephant all the way down to mr tusks and beyond which is at least a tiny bit awesome because you can get an infinite number of elephants in a line and still have it fit across a single notebook page
  lastly here 's destin from smarter every day talking about the conservation of angular momentum and since it 's youtube cats hey 
 it 's me destin welcome back to smarter every day so you 've probably observed that cats almost always land on their feet  today 's question is why 
 like most simple questions there 's a very complex answer for instance let me reword this question how does a cat go from
  frame without violating the conservation of angular momentum jg 
 so here 's something all four of these videos have in common 
 they all have more than half a million views on youtube 
 and those are people watching not in classrooms  but because they are part of the communities of learning that are being set up by these
  and i said earlier that youtube is is like a classroom to me and in many ways it is because here is the instructor it 's like the old fashioned classroom here 's the instructor and then beneath the instructor are the students and they 're all having a conversation  and i know that youtube comments have a very
 very bad reputation in the world of the internet but in fact if you go on comments for these channels what you 'll find is people engaging the subject
  complicated questions that are about the subject matter and then other people answering those questions  and because the youtube page is set up so that the page in which i 'm talking to you
 is on the exact the place where i 'm talking to you is on the exact same page as your comments you are participating in a live and real and active way in the conversation 
  and because i 'm in comments usually  i get to participate with you and you find this whether it 's world history or mathematics or
  science or whatever it is you also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the internet in order to create places for intellectual engagement 
  instead of the ironic detachment that maybe most of us associate with memes and other internet conventions you know got bored invented calculus or
  in case you can 't see what she says  yeah  
 i really believe that these spaces these communities have become for a new generation of learners  
 the kind of communities the kind of cartographic communities that i had when i was in high school  and then again when i was in college
 and as an adult
  these communities has
  me to a community of learners and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood so that i no longer feel like learning is something reserved for the young vi hart and minute physics introduced me to all kinds of things that i
  and i know that we all hearken back to the days of the parisian salon in the enlightenment or to the algonquin round table and wish oh i wish i could have been a part of that i wish i could have laughed at dorothy parker 's jokes but i 'm here to tell you
 that these places exist they still exist they exist in corners of the internet where old men fear to tread 
 and i truly truly believe
 that when we invented agloe new york
