  thousands of years from now we 'll look back at the first century of computing as a fascinating but very peculiar time
 the only time in history where humans were reduced to live in 2d space interacting with technology
 as if we were machines a singular 100 year period in the vastness of time
 where humans
 communicated were entertained and managed their lives from behind a screen today  we spend most of our time
 tapping and looking at screens what happened to interacting with each other
  know about you but i feel limited inside this 2d world of monitors and pixels and it is this very limitation
 and my desire to connect with people
 that inspires me as a creator  put simply  i want to create a new reality  a reality where technology
 brings us infinitely closer to each other  a reality where people not devices
 are the center of everything  
 i dream of a reality where technology senses what we see touch and feel  
 a reality where technology no longer gets in our way  but instead embraces who we are i dream of technology
 on a human
  we have all experienced technology that enables people to act more like people products that enable natural interactions  voice controls or biometrics  
 this
 is the next step in the evolution  this is microsoft hololens the first fully untethered holographic computer 
 devices like this
  into our world  enhancing the way we experience life
 beyond our ordinary range of perceptions  now  i 'm not thinking about a distant future  
 i 'm talking about today  
 we are already seeing car companies like volvo designing cars differently with hololens 
 universities like case western redefining the way medical students learn
  personal favorite nasa is using hololens to let scientists explore planets holographically 
 now this is important 
 by bringing holograms into our world i 'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer  i 'm talking about freeing
  of traditional computing 
 put it this way  
 temporally adjusted  we 're like cave people in computer terms we 've barely discovered charcoal and started drawing
 the first stick figures
 in our cave  now this is the perspective i apply to my work every single day  
 and now for the next few minutes  i invite all of you
 to apply the same
  perspective to the journey ahead of us 
 now as i put this hololens on 
 let me explain the setup a little bit it 's probably the most
 risky demo we have ever done on any stage with hololens and i can 't think of a better place to
  am going to be seeing holograms right on this stage just as clearly as i can see all of you 
 now at the same time  we have also this special camera that just walked in onstage so that all of you can share in this experience with me up on all the monitors 
 so let 's start our journey and what better place to begin our journey than
  let 's explore the world all around us with this new lens and understand the computer world from a brand new perspective  
 the computer universe is both marvelous
 and primitive  
 it 's a universe based on causality 
 as developers  we dream the different causes and then we program the different effects  double click on an icon
  that 's a cause  open an application  that 's an effect  
 now when we compare this to our physical universe it
 is overly constraining  because our universe is not digital 
 our universe is analog 
 our universe doesn 't think in terms of zero or one  true or false or black or white 
  exist in a world governed by quantum physics 
 a universe of zero and one both at the same time  
 a reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray 
 you can see how these two worlds collide  
 so why are screens
 so pervasive in our analog life
  we see screens from the moment we wake up to the moment we fall asleep why  
 i think it 's because computers give us superpowers  
 within the digital universe we have the power to displace space and the power to displace time 
 it doesn 't matter if you 're using technology for entertainment  productivity or communication 
 think of it this way  let 's all go home tonight
 and watch our favorite show on television  
 this is theater time and space displaced 
 as soon as i 'm done with this ted talk i 'm going to immediately call my lovely family in seattle
  that 's displacement of space  now these are such great superpowers that we put up with the
  digital world  but what if we didn 't have to what if we could have these same digital powers
 in our
 world  
 you can already see glimmers of this  
 but i believe our children 's children will grow up in a world devoid of 2d technology 
  's remarkable to dream of this world a world where technology truly understands us
 where we live  work and communicate with tools that enhance the human experience not machines that limit
 our humanity 
 so how do we get there 
 for me the answer required looking at the problem from a different perspective  
 it required sensing
  the world from the perspective of a machine 
 if you 're a machine trying to sense our world  how would you actually break the problem down 
 you 'd probably try to classify things as a human 
 an environment
 or an object  
 but how would that machine then interact
  with reality  
 and i can think of three ways first as a machine i would observe or i would input reality  
 speech recognition and biometric authentication are great examples of a machine interacting with humans from an input perspective  
 secondly
  i could place digital information  or output information into reality 
 holograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment
 from an output perspective 
 finally as a machine  i could exchange energy with the world via haptics now imagine being able to feel the
  of a virtual object or better yet imagine pushing a hologram
 and having it push you back with equal force with this perspective  we are able to collapse reality
 into a simple matrix  now here 's a secret as an engineer i get really excited anytime i can reduce something to the matrix 
 from self driving cars
 to smartphones to this holographic computer on my head machines are
  capable of understanding our world and they are starting to interact with us in significantly
 more personal ways  now imagine
 having granular control over everything in the world  move the dial one way
  you get reality  move the dial the other way
  and you get virtual reality  
 now imagine dialing your entire environment
 between virtual and real worlds 
 down here now imagine if i could look at all of you
 and dial from real humans
 into elves  
 when technology truly understands our world it will again transform the ways we interact the ways we work
 and the ways we play
  less than half a century ago two courageous men landed on the moon using
  computers that were less powerful than the phones in your pockets  
 six hundred million humans watched them on grainy black and white televisions 
 and the world  the world was mesmerized now imagine how our children
 and their children
 will experience the continued exploration of space with technology
  that understands
 this world  
 we already live in a world where real time universal translators exist  
 and i can squint  and i can already see holographic telepresence in our near future 
 in fact since we 've been lucky with our demo so far let 's try doing something else even more
  i invite you
 to experience for the first time anywhere in the world  here on the ted stage 
 a real life holographic teleportation  
 between me and my friend dr jeffrey norris from nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory
  can you tell us a little bit jeff about where you are jn 
 well i 'm
 actually in three places  i 'm standing in a room across the street  while i 'm standing on this stage with you while i 'm standing on mars a
  a hundred million miles away  this is crazy can you tell us a little bit more about where all this data from mars is coming from jn 
 absolutely  
 this is a precise holographic replica of mars 
 built from data captured by the curiosity mars rover that i can explore as easily as a place on earth 
  we can instantly understand an environment just by being present in it 
 we 've built tools like our mars rover to extend our vision and lengthen our reach  but for decades  we 've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards 
 now we 're leaping over all of that over the giant antennas and the relay satellites and the vastness between worlds
 to take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there 
 today  a group of scientists on our mission are seeing mars as never before
 an alien world made a little more familiar  because they 're finally exploring it as humans should 
 but our dreams don 't have to end with making it just like being there
  when we dial this real world to the virtual we can do magical things  
 we can see in invisible wavelengths or teleport to the top of a mountain 
 perhaps someday we 'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it 
 we 're taking the first steps but we want the whole world to join us in taking the next because this is not a journey for a
  few but for all of us ak thank you jeff  this was amazing thank you so much for joining us on the ted stage today
  i dream about this future
 every single day  i take inspiration from our ancestors  we used to live in tribes where we interacted communicated
  we are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return to the humanity that brought us where we are today
 technology
 that will let us stop living inside this 2d world of monitors and pixels  and let us start remembering
 what it feels like to live in
  so there 's been some talk in the press and i 'll just ask you straight then we have a straight answer there 's been talk about the difference between the demos and the reality of the commercial product 
 talk about this field of view issue is this
 is this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get ak it
 's a great question or said better this is a question we 've been receiving in the media for possibly the last year if
 you do your research i haven 't answered that question i 've purposely ignored it because
 ultimately it 's the wrong question to ask
 that 's the equivalent of me showing holograms to someone for the
  then saying what 's the size of your television 
 the field of view for the product is almost irrelevant what we should be talking about is the density of lights or radiance that shows up 
 better said what the angular resolution is of the things that you see so from that perspective what you saw you know the camera is wearing a hololens 
 so even if i wanted to cheat i can 't hw but the camera has a different lens on it than our eye right
  the camera has a fish eye lens on it it 's seeing a much wider view than the human eye is  so if you think about the points of light
 that show up radially from the vision of the camera which is the thing that matters how many points of light can i get in a given volume  
 that 's the same as i get on this hololens as i will on that one  
  so in short to be super crisp  the camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view than the human eye  but the angular resolution of the holograms that you see
 the points of light per unit of area are actually the same hw so you spent jeff i 'll get to you in a minute
 so you spent a lot of time mapping the stage ak that 's right hw so
 help me out here  if i buy a hololens and have it at home i don 't need to map my apartment right ak the hololens maps in real time
 at about five frames per second with this technology that we call spatial
  mapping
 so in your home as soon as you put it on
 holograms will start showing up and you 'll start placing them and they 'll start learning your home 
 in a stage environment where we 're trying to get something on my head to communicate with something over there with all of the wireless connectivity that usually brings all conferences down  
 we don 't take the risk of
 trying to do this live  so what we do is pre map the stage at five frames per second
  with the same spatial mapping technology that you 'll use with the product at home  and then we store it so that when there 's shenanigans of wireless in an environment like this between the camera
 's hololens and the one on my head  we don 't have things disappear  because ultimately  the holograms are coming from this  hololens and that one is just viewing the hololens so if i lose connectivity
  on mars you were here you were in a room across the street tell me more about the the fact that with holograms
  my question for a hologram jn thanks for the
 absolutely i believe that these technologies are scientifically useful right now  and that 's why we 're using them in multiple parts of our work at nasa 
 so we 're using it to improve the ways that we explore mars  
 we 're also using it for our astronauts on the space station we 're even using it now to design the next generation of our spacecraft
 amazing ok jeff  please go away thank you very much
