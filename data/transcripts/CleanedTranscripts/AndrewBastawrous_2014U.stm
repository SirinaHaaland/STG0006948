  million people in the world who are blind eighty percent of them
 are living in  low income countries such as kenya  and the absolute majority
 do not need to be blind they are blind from diseases that are either completely
  curable or preventable  
 knowing this with my young family we moved to kenya  we secured equipment  funds  vehicles  we trained a team  
 we set up a hundred clinics throughout the great rift valley
 to try and understand a single question why are people going
  and what can we do 
 the challenges were great  
 when we got to where we were going we set up our high tech equipment 
 power was rarely available we 'd have to run our equipment from petrol power generators  
 and then something occurred to me there has to be an easier way  
 because it 's the patients who are the most in need of access to eye care who are the least likely to get it 
 more people in kenya  and in
 have access to a mobile phone than they do clean running water  so we said could we harness the power of mobile technology to deliver eye care in a new way
 and so we developed peek a smartphone [ system ] that enables community healthcare workers and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere  
 we set about replacing traditional hospital equipment  which is bulky expensive and fragile
  smartphone apps and hardware
 that make it possible to test anyone in any language and of any age 
 here we have a demonstration of a three month old having their vision accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker
 we 've got many trials going on in the community and in schools  and through the lessons that we 've learned in the field we
  realized it 's extremely important to share the data in non medical jargon so that people understand
 what we 're examining and what that means to them  so here for example we use our sight sim application once your vision has been measured to show carers
 and teachers
 what the visual world is like for that person so they can empathize with them and help them once we 've discovered somebody has low vision the next
  big challenge is to work out why and to
 be able to do that we need to have access to the inside of the eye  
 traditionally this requires expensive equipment to examine an area called the retina the retina is the single part of the eye that has
 huge amounts of information about the body and its health  we 've developed
  hardware that comes in at less than five dollars to produce  which can then be clipped onto a
  smartphone and makes it possible to get views of the back of the eye of a very high quality  and the beauty is anybody can do it 
 in our trials on over two and half thousand people 
 the smartphone with the add on clip is comparable to a camera that is hugely more expensive and hugely more difficult to transport  
 when we first moved to kenya we went with one hundred and fifty thousand dollars of equipment
  a team of fifteen people and that was what was needed to deliver health care now all that 's needed
 is a single person on a bike
 with a smartphone and it costs just five hundred dollars 
 the issue of power supply is overcome by harnessing the power of solar our healthcare workers travel with a solar powered rucksack which keeps the phone charged and
  backed up now we go to the patient
 rather than waiting for the patient never to come
  we go to them in their homes
 and we give them the most comprehensive high tech accurate examination which can be delivered by anyone with minimal training  
 we can link global experts with people in the most rural
  places that are beyond the end of the road  effectively putting those experts in their homes  allowing us to make diagnoses and make plans for treatment  
 project managers hospital directors are able to search on our interface by any parameter they may be interested in here in nakuru where i 've been living we can search 
  for people by whatever condition here are people who are blind from a curable condition cataract  
  each red pin depicts somebody
 who is blind from a disease that is curable and treatable  and they 're locatable we can use bulk text messaging services to explain that we 're coming to arrange a treatment what
 's more we 've learned that this is something that we haven 't built just for the community but with the community 
 those blue pins that drop represent elders or local leaders that are connected to those people who can ensure
  that we can find them and arrange treatment  
 so for patients like mama wangari who have been blind for over ten years and never seen her grandchildren  for less than forty dollars we can restore her eyesight  
 this is something that has to happen it
 's only in statistics that people go blind by the millions 
 the reality is everyone goes blind on their own  
 but now they might just be a text message away from help
 now because live demos are always a bad idea to try a live demo 
 so here we have the peek vision app okay 
 and what we 're looking at here
  this is sam 's optic nerve which is a direct extension of her brain so i 'm actually looking at her brain as we look there we can see all parts of the retina 
 it makes it possible to pick up diseases of the eye and of the body
 that would not be possible without access to the eye and that clip on device can be manufactured for just a few dollars  and people can be cured of blindness and i think it says a lot about us
 as a human race if we 've developed cures and we don 't deliver them but now we can thank you
