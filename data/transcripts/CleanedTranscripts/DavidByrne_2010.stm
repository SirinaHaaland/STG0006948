  this is the venue where as a young man some of the music that i wrote was first performed 
 it was remarkably a pretty good sounding room with all the uneven
  the nature of the room meant that words could be understood the lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood the sound system was kind of decent
 and there wasn 't a lot of reverberation in the room so the
 rhythms could be pretty intact too pretty concise 
 other places around the country had similar rooms  this is tootsie 's orchid lounge in nashville the music was in some ways different but in
 structure and form very much the
  the clientele behavior was very much the same too  and
 so the bands at tootsie 's or at cbgb 's
 had to play loud enough
 the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing  
 since then i 've played other places that are much nicer  i 've played
 the disney hall here and carnegie hall and places like that
  exciting but i also noticed that sometimes the music that i
 had written or was writing at the time  didn 't sound all that great in some of those halls we managed but
 sometimes those halls didn 't seem exactly suited
 to the music i was making or had made so i asked myself  do i write stuff for specific rooms
  do i have a place a venue in mind when i write is that a kind of model for creativity do we all make things with a venue a context 
  part of its roots in west africa  
 and the music there  i would say the instruments the intricate rhythms  the way it 's played the setting the context  
 it 's all perfect  it all works perfect the music works perfectly in that setting  there 's no
 big room to
 create reverberation and confuse the rhythms  the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification
  etc it 's no accident  it 's perfect for that particular context  and it would be a mess
 in a context like this this is a gothic cathedral
  no rhythm whatsoever  and
 the room flatters the music  it actually improves it this is the room that bach
 wrote some of his music for this is the organ  
 it 's not as big as a gothic cathedral so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate he can very innovatively
  this is a little bit later  this is the kind of rooms that mozart wrote in i think we 're in like one thousand seven hundred and seventy somewhere around there 
 they 're smaller even less reverberant so he can write really frilly music
  the audience in these opera houses when they were built they used to yell out
 to one another  they used to eat drink and yell out to people on the stage just like they do at cbgb 's and places like that if they liked an aria
  they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore not at the end of the show but immediately and
 well  that was an opera
 experience this is the opera house that wagner built for himself  and the size of the room is not that big  it 's smaller than this but
  wagner made an innovation he wanted a bigger band he wanted a little more bombast so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more
  obviously this kind of thing became popular the halls got bigger carnegie hall 's fair sized it 's larger than some of the other symphony halls and
 they 're a lot more reverberant than
 la scala around the same according to alex ross who writes for the new yorker  this kind of rule came into effect that
  audiences had to be quiet no more eating drinking and yelling at the stage or
 gossiping with one another during the show  they had to be very quiet  so those two things combined meant that
 a different kind of music
 worked best in these kind of halls it meant that there could be extreme dynamics which there weren 't in
 some of these other kinds of music  quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting  but because of the
  reverberation in those rooms like carnegie hall the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural
  coming along at the same time this is a jazz band  according to scott joplin 
 the bands were playing on riverboats and and clubs again it 's noisy they 're playing for dancers there 's certain sections of the song the songs had different sections  that the dancers really liked and they 'd say play that part again 
 well  there 's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers  so the bands started to improvise
  new melodies  and a new form of music was born these are
 played mainly in small rooms 
 people are dancing  shouting and drinking so the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that same thing goes true for
 that 's the beginning of the century for the
 whole of 20th century popular music whether it 's rock or latin music or whatever [ live music ] doesn 't really change that much  
 it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century when this became
 one of the primary venues for music  and this was
 one way that the music got there  microphones enabled singers in particular
  and musicians and composers to completely change the kind of music that they were writing so far a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music but
 singers like frank sinatra could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone 
 other singers
  this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone it would have been impossible without recorded music as well  and
 he 's singing right into your ear he 's whispering into your ears the effect is just electric it 's like the guy is
 sitting next to you whispering
 who knows what into your ear
  so
 at this point music diverged there 's live music  and there 's recorded music  
 and they no longer have to be exactly the same 
 now there 's venues like this a discotheque  and there 's jukeboxes in bars where you don 't even need to have a band
 there doesn 't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever
  systems are good people began to make music specifically
 for discos and for those sound systems 
 and as with jazz 
 the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others  so the early hip hop guys would loop certain sections
  mc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies and another new form of music was born 
 live performance when it was incredibly successful ended up in what is probably  acoustically the worst sounding venues on the planet  
  basketball arenas and hockey arenas musicians who ended up there did the best they could they wrote what is now called arena rock which is
  situation and in some ways the music that they 're writing for this place works perfectly so
 there 's more new venues one of the new ones is the automobile i grew up with a radio in a car but now that 's evolved into something else the car is a whole venue
  i would say is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it 
 it might not be what you want to listen to at home  but it works great in the car
 has a huge frequency spectrum you know big bass and high end and the voice
 kind of stuck in the middle automobile music you can share with your friends  there 's one other kind of new venue
  the private mp3 player  presumably this is just for christian music laughter
 in some ways it 's like carnegie hall or when the audience had to hush up because
 you can now hear every single detail in other ways it 's more like the west african music because
 if the music in an mp3 player gets too quiet
  turn it up and the next minute your ears are blasted out by a louder passage  so that doesn 't really work  i think
 pop music mainly it 's written today to some extent is written for these kind of players for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail  
 but the dynamic doesn 't change that much  
 so i asked myself
  a model for creation  this adaptation that we do and
 does it happen anywhere else well  according to david attenborough and some other people birds do it too
 that the birds in the canopy where the foliage is dense  their calls tend to be high pitched
  and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls  so that they don 't get distorted when they bounce off the
 forest floor and birds like
 this savannah sparrow  they tend to have a buzzing sound clip savannah
 sparrow song type call  and it turns out that a
 sound like this is the most energy efficient
 and practical way
  to transmit
 their call across the fields and
 savannahs  
 other birds like this tanager 
 have adapted within the same species  the tananger on the east coast of the united states where the forests are a little denser has one kind of call  and the tananger
  this is a model for creation if we make music  primarily the form at least to fit
  and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls and if we write software to fit existing operating systems
 is that how it works
  yeah i think it 's evolutionary  it 's adaptive  but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there
  this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view the romantic view is that first comes the passion
  and then the outpouring of emotion and then somehow it gets shaped into something and i 'm saying well
  the passion 's still there but the vessel
 that it 's going to be injected into and poured into 
 that is instinctively and intuitively created first we already know where that passion is going
  conflict of views is kind of interesting the writer  thomas frank says that
 this might be a kind of explanation why some
 voters vote against their best interests 
 that voters like a lot of us 
 assume that if they hear something that sounds like it 's sincere that it 's coming from the gut that it 's passionate that it 's more authentic
 and they 'll vote for that  so that if somebody can fake sincerity if they can fake passion they stand a better chance
 of
 being selected in that way  which seems a little dangerous  i 'm saying the two  the passion the joy are
  mutually exclusive maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that
 we are like the birds we adapt 
 we sing  and like the birds  
 the joy is still there even though we have changed what we do to fit the context thank you very much
