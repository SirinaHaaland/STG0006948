  fifty years ago  when i began exploring the ocean  no one
 not jacques perrin not jacques cousteau or rachel carson imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it 
 it seemed at that time to be
  a sea of eden  
 but now we know  and now we are facing paradise lost  
 i want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us and to consider why it matters
 that in fifty years we 've lost
 actually we 've taken we 've eaten more than ninety percent of the big fish in the sea  why you should care that nearly
  half of the coral reefs have disappeared  
 why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying  
 but it really should concern you it does concern you as well  i 'm haunted by
 the thought of what ray anderson calls tomorrow
  we didn 't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and
 the living ocean while there still was time well now is that time i hope for your help
 to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health
 and in so doing secure hope for humankind health to the ocean means
 health for us and i hope jill tarter 's wish to engage earthlings includes dolphins and whales
 and other sea creatures
 in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe and i hope jill that someday we will find evidence
 that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet
 i guess i did 
 for me as a scientist it all began in 
 when i first tried scuba  it 's when i first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter  
  i actually
 love diving at night you see a lot of fish then that you don 't see in the daytime 
 diving day and night was really easy for me in one thousand nine hundred and seventy when i led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time
 at the same time
 that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine i had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor
 while using this personal submersible called jim
  six miles offshore and one thousand two hundred and fifty feet down it 's one of my favorite bathing suits
 since then i 've used about thirty kinds of submarines and i 've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called deep search
 to design and build systems to access the deep sea  i led a five year national geographic expedition the sustainable seas expeditions
  using these little subs  they 're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it and i 'm living proof  
 astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air  food water temperature
 all the things you need to stay alive in space
 or under the sea  i heard astronaut joe allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support
  system
 and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system 
 and then he pointed to this and he said 
 life support system we need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it  
 the poet auden said thousands
  percent of earth 's water is ocean no blue  no green  if you think the ocean isn 't important  imagine earth without it 
 mars comes to mind no ocean no life support system  
 i gave a talk not so long ago at the world bank
 and i showed this amazing image of earth and i said there it is the world bank
  that 's where all the assets are and
 we 've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them  
 tim worth says the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment with every drop of water you drink every breath you take 
 you 're connected to the sea  no matter where on earth you
  most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea  over time most of the planet 's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there mostly by microbes 
 the ocean drives climate and weather stabilizes temperature shapes earth 's chemistry 
 water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain sleet and snow  
 and provides home for
  of life in the world maybe in the universe  no water  no life  no blue  no green  
 yet we have this idea we humans 
 that the earth all of it the oceans the skies are so vast and so resilient it doesn 't matter what we do to it 
 that may have been true ten thousand years ago and maybe even one thousand years ago
  in the last one hundred especially in the last fifty we 've drawn down the assets the air the water  the wildlife
 that make our lives possible new technologies are helping us to understand the nature
 of nature the nature of what 's happening  showing us our impact on the earth  i mean first you have to know that you 've got a
  in our time we 've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history  
 and with knowing comes caring and with caring there 's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us  
 but first
 we have to know 
 three years ago i met john hanke  who 's the head of google earth and i told him how much i loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously
  but i asked him when are you going to finish it you did a great job with the land the dirt what about the water 
 since then  i 've had the great pleasure of working with the googlers with doer marine with national geographic with dozens of the best institutions 
  and scientists around the world  ones that we could enlist to put the ocean in google earth
  and as of just this week last monday google earth
 is now whole 
 consider this starting right here at the convention center  we can find the nearby aquarium  we can look at where we 're sitting and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium the ocean
 and california 's four national marine sanctuaries
  and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect
 and restore some of the assets
 we can flit over to hawaii and see the real hawaiian islands not just the little bit that pokes through the surface  
 but also what 's below to see
 wait a minute we can go kshhplash right there ha under the
  what the whales see we can go explore
 the other side of the hawaiian islands  we can go actually and swim around on google earth
 and visit with humpback whales 
 these are the gentle giants that i 've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater there
 's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale  
 we can pick up and
  fly to the deepest place seven miles down the mariana trench where only two people have ever been imagine that it 's only seven miles but
 only two people have been there forty nine years ago
 one way trips are easy  we need new deep diving submarines how about some x prizes for ocean exploration
  we need to see deep trenches  the undersea mountains  and understand life in the deep sea 
 we can now go to the arctic 
 just ten years ago i stood on the ice at the north pole an ice free arctic ocean
 may happen in this century  
 that 's bad news for the polar bears  that 's bad news for us too  excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global
  warming  it 's also changing ocean chemistry making the sea more acidic that 's bad news for coral reefs and
  plankton also it 's bad news for us we
 're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea  millions of tons of discarded fishing nets  
 gear that continues to kill  we 're clogging the ocean
  poisoning the planet 's circulatory system and we 're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife all
 units  
 barbarically  we 're killing sharks for shark fin soup  
 undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle
  the nitrogen cycle  the oxygen cycle  the water cycle
 our life support system
 we 're still killing bluefin tuna truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead 
 all of these parts are part of our life support system  
 we kill using long lines with baited hooks every
 few feet that may stretch for fifty miles or more 
 industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers taking everything in their path  
 using google earth you can witness trawlers in china the north sea the gulf of mexico
 shaking the foundation of our life support system leaving plumes of death in their path  
 the next time you dine on sushi or sashimi or swordfish steak or shrimp cocktail whatever wildlife you
  to enjoy from the ocean think
 of the real cost for every pound that goes to market more than ten pounds  even one hundred pounds may be thrown away
 as bycatch this is the consequence of not knowing
 that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea  this chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from
  hundred to two thousand the highest concentrations are in red 
 in my lifetime  imagine ninety percent of the big fish have been killed  most of the turtles sharks tunas and whales
 are
 way down in numbers but there is good news 
 ten percent of the big fish still remain there are still some blue whales there are still some krill in
  antarctica there are a few oysters in chesapeake bay  half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape a jeweled belt
 around the middle of the planet 
 there 's still time  but not a lot to turn things around 
 but business as usual means that in fifty years there may be no coral reefs and no commercial fishing because
 the fish will simply be gone
 imagine the ocean
 without fish imagine what that means to our life support system  
 natural systems on the land are in big trouble too  but the problems are more obvious  
 and some actions are being taken to protect trees watersheds and wildlife 
  with yellowstone national
  the united states began establishing a system of parks
 that some say
 was the best idea america ever had 
 about twelve percent of the land around the world is now protected  
 safeguarding biodiversity  providing a carbon sink generating oxygen protecting watersheds 
 and in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea  national marine
  's another great idea  the good news is
 that there are now more than four thousand places in the sea around the world that have some kind of protection and you can find them on google earth  
 the bad news is that you have to look hard to find them 
 in the last three years for example the u s protected three hundred and forty thousand square miles of ocean
 as national monuments  but it only increased from zero point six of one percent
 to zero point eight
 of one percent of the ocean protected  globally 
 protected areas do rebound but it takes a long time to restore
  50 year old rockfish or monkfish sharks or sea bass or 200 year old orange roughy  
 we don 't consume  200 year old cows or chickens 
 protected areas provide hope
 that the creatures of ed wilson 's dream of
  an encyclopedia of life  or the census of marine life will live not just as a list a photograph 
 or a paragraph 
 with scientists around the world i 've been looking at the ninety nine percent of the ocean that is open to fishing and mining and drilling and dumping and whatever
 to search out hope spots and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future  such as the arctic we have
  one chance right now to get it right 
 or the antarctic where the continent is protected  
 but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill whales and fish 
 sargasso sea 's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed
  percent of the land in the galapagos islands is protected  but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing it
 's true too in argentina on the patagonian shelf which is now in serious trouble 
 the high seas where whales tuna and dolphins travel
 the largest least protected ecosystem on earth  
 filled with luminous creatures living in dark waters that average two miles deep 
 they flash and sparkle
  and glow with their own living light there are still places in the sea as pristine as i knew as a child  
 the next ten years may be the most important and the next ten thousand years the best chance our species will have to protect
 what remains of the natural systems that give us life to cope with climate change  we need new ways to generate power
  we need new ways better ways to cope with poverty  wars and disease  we need many things to keep
 and maintain the world as a better place but nothing else will matter
 if we fail to protect the ocean our fate
 and the ocean 's are one  we need to do for the ocean what al gore did for the skies above a global plan of action
 with a world conservation union the iucn is underway to protect biodiversity to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change 
 on the high seas and in coastal areas 
 wherever
 we can identify critical places new technologies are needed to map photograph and explore the ninety five percent of the ocean
 that we have yet to see
 the goal is to protect biodiversity to provide stability and resilience  
 we need deep diving subs  new technologies to explore the ocean  we need maybe an expedition a ted at sea
 that could help figure out the next steps and so i suppose you want to know
  i wish you would use all means at your disposal
 films expeditions the web new submarines and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas
 hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean  the blue heart of the planet  how much some
 some say ten percent some say thirty percent you decide how much of your heart do you want to protect 
 whatever it is a fraction of one percent
 is not enough 
 my wish is a big wish but if we can make it happen it can truly change the world  and help ensure the survival
 of what actually
  as it turns out is my favorite species that would be us 
 for the children of today for tomorrow 's child as never again now
 is the time
