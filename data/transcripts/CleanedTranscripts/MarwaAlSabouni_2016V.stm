  six years of war homs is now a half destroyed city 
 my family and i were lucky our place is still
 standing  
 although for two years  we were like prisoners at home  outside there were demonstrations and battles and bombings and snipers  
 my husband and i used to run an architecture studio in the old town main
  large parts of homs have been more or less quiet  
 the economy is completely broken and people are still fighting  the merchants who had stalls in the old city market now trade out of sheds on the streets 
 under our apartment
  all sorts of jobs to get by when i look at my destroyed city of course i ask myself what has led to this senseless war
 syria was largely a place of tolerance historically accustomed
  how did my country a country with communities living harmoniously together and comfortable in discussing their differences
 how did it degenerate into civil war violence  displacement
 and unprecedented sectarian hatred  there were many reasons that had led to the war social political and economic 
  there is one key reason that has been overlooked
 and which is  important to analyze because from it will largely depend whether we can make sure that this doesn 't happen again 
 and that reason is architecture architecture in
 my country has played an important role in creating directing and and amplifying conflict between  warring factions and this is probably true for other
  key role in whether a community crumbles or comes together syrian
 society has long lived the coexistence of different traditions and backgrounds syrians have experienced the prosperity of open trade
 they have enjoyed the true meaning
  in the mosques and churches built  back to back in the interwoven souks and public venues and the proportions and sizes based on principles of humanity and harmony this
 architecture of mixity
 can still be read in the remains the old islamic city in syria was built over a multilayered past  integrating with it and embracing its spirit 
 so did its communities people lived and worked with each other in a place that gave them a sense of belonging and made them
 feel at home they shared a remarkably unified existence but over the
 last century  gradually this delicate balance of these places has been interfered with 
 first by the urban planners of the colonial period when the french went enthusiastically about transforming what they saw as the un modern syrian cities they blew up city
  urbanism and architecture of our cities assured identity and belonging not by 
  by intertwining but over time the ancient became worthless  and the new coveted the harmony of the built environment and social environment got trampled over by
  urbanism that zoned communities by class  creed or affluence  and the same was happening to the community as
 the shape of the built environment changed so the lifestyles and sense of belonging of the communities also started changing 
 from a register of togetherness of belonging architecture became a way of differentiation  and communities started drifting apart from the
  very fabric that used to unite them and from the soul of the place that used to represent their common existence  while many reasons had led to the syrian war we
  losing the sense of belonging to a place and a sense of sharing it with someone else has made it a lot easier to destroy  
  areas without proper infrastructure made of endless rows of bare block boxes containing people 
 people who mostly belonged to the same group whether based on religion  
  that used to bind the city together whether they were social through
  me an aside 
 when i read about heterogeneous urbanism in other parts of the world 
 involving ethnic neighborhoods in british cities or around paris or brussels  i recognize the beginning of the kind of instability we have witnessed so disastrously here in syria 
 we have severely destroyed cities
  the war will end  and the question that as an architect  i have to ask is 
 how do we rebuild  
 what are the principles that we should adopt in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes 
 from my point of view  the main focus should be on creating places that make
  need to recapture some of the traditional values that did just that creating the conditions for coexistence and peace
 values of beauty that don 't exhibit ostentation but rather 
 approachability and ease  
 moral values that promote generosity and acceptance architecture that is for everyone to enjoy  not just for the elite just as used to be in the shadowed alleys of the old islamic city  
 mixed designs that encourage a sense of community
 there is a neighborhood here in homs that 's called baba amr
 that has been fully destroyed 
 almost two years ago i introduced this design into a un habitat competition for rebuilding it 
 the idea was to create an urban fabric inspired by a tree capable of growing and spreading organically  echoing
  parking and playing and leisure trees and shaded areas it
 's far from perfect  obviously i drew it during the few hours of electricity we
 get and there are many possible ways to express belonging and community through architecture
 but compare it with the freestanding  disconnected
  the coherent urbanism of the old islamic city
  while rows of soulless housing or tower blocks even when they are luxurious tend to promote isolation and otherness 
 even simple things like shaded places or fruit plants or drinking water inside the city can make a difference in how people feel towards the place 
 and whether they consider it a generous place that gives a place
  in order for a place to give its architecture should be giving too 
 our built environment matters the fabric of our cities is reflected in the fabric of our souls  
 and whether in the shape of informal concrete slums or broken social housing or trampled old towns
  the contemporary urban archetypes that have emerged all across the middle east have been one cause of the alienation and fragmentation of our communities 
 we can learn from this we can learn how to rebuild in another way how to create an architecture that doesn 't contribute only to the practical and economic
 aspects of people 's lives but also to their social spiritual
  we need to create again cities that are shared by the communities that inhabit them 
 if we do so people will not feel the need to seek identities opposed to the other identities all around  because they will all feel at home
