  you know i am so bad at tech that my daughter who is now forty one when she was five was overheard by me
 to say to a friend of hers  if it doesn 't bleed when you cut it my daddy doesn 't understand it
  assignment i 've been given may be an insuperable obstacle for me but i 'm certainly going to try what have i heard during these last
 four days this is my third visit to ted one was to tedmed and one as you 've heard was a regular ted two years ago  
 i 've heard what i consider an extraordinary thing that i 've only heard a little bit in the two previous teds and
  that is is an interweaving and an interlarding an intermixing 
 of a sense of social responsibility in so many of the talks
 global responsibility in fact  appealing to enlightened
 but it goes far beyond enlightened
 ten 
 of the speakers have been talking about is the realization as you listen to them carefully that they 're not saying well this is what we should do this is what i would like you to do it 's this 
  is what i have done because i 'm excited by it because it 's a wonderful thing and it 's done something for me and of course it 's accomplished
  it 's the old concept  the real greek concept of philanthropy in its original sense 
  the love
 of humankind and the only explanation i can have for some of what you 've been hearing in the last four days is that it arises in fact 
 out of a form of love and this gives me enormous hope and hope of course is the topic that i 'm supposed to be speaking about which i 'd completely forgotten about until i arrived
 and when i did i thought well i 'd better look this word up in the dictionary  so  sarah and i my wife walked over to the public library which is four blocks away on pacific street  
 and we got the oed and we looked in there and there are fourteen definitions of hope 
 none of which really hits you
 between the eyes as being the appropriate one and of course that makes sense because hope
  is an abstract phenomenon it 's an abstract idea it 's not a concrete
 word 
 well  it reminds me a little bit of surgery  if there 's one operation for a disease you know it works  if there are fifteen operations you know that none of them work  and that 's the way it is with definitions of words if you have appendicitis they take your appendix
  you 're cured if you 've got reflux oesophagitis there are fifteen procedures and
 joe schmo does it one way and will blow does it another way and none of them work and that 's the way it is with this word hope 
 they all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen  and you know what i found out the 
  root of the word hope is a stem
 it is the same root from which the word curve comes from but what it means in the original 
  a change in direction going in a different way 
 and i i find that very very interesting and very provocative because what you 've been hearing in the last couple of days is
 the sense of going in different directions directions that are specific and unique to problems there are
 paradigms you 've heard that word several times in the last four days and everyone 's familiar with kuhnian paradigms so when we think of hope now  we have to think of looking in other directions than we have
 been looking there 's another not definition but description of hope that has always appealed to me 
 and it was one by vclav havel in his perfectly
 spectacular book
 breaking the peace in which he says that hope does not consist of the expectation that things will come out exactly right  
 but the expectation that they will make sense regardless of how they come out i can 't tell you how reassured i was
 by the very last sentence
 in that glorious presentation by dean kamen a few days ago
 i wasn 't sure i heard it right so i
 found him in one of the inter sessions he was talking to a very large man but i didn 't care i interrupted and i said did you say this he said i think so so here 's what it is i 'll repeat it 
 the world will not be saved by the internet it
 's wonderful do you know what the world will be saved by i 'll tell you it 'll be saved by the human spirit
 and by the human spirit i don 't mean anything divine i don 't
 mean anything supernatural certainly not coming from this skeptic what i mean
 is this ability that each of us has
 to be something greater than herself or himself to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not
  capable of on an elemental level we have all felt that spirituality
 at the time of childbirth some of you have felt it in laboratories some of you have felt it at the workbench 
 we feel it at concerts i 've felt it in the operating room at the bedside 
 it is an elevation of us beyond ourselves and i think that it 's going to be in time 
 the elements of
  the human spirit
 that we 've been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days and if there 's anything that has permeated this room it is precisely
 that i 'm intrigued
 by a concept that was
  whose name was percy shelley now we all think that shelley obviously is the great romantic poet that he was many of us tend to forget
 that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays too and the most
  a defence of poetry now it 's about five six seven eight pages long and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page but somewhere
 on the second page he begins
 talking about the notion that he calls moral imagination and here 's what he says
 a man
 generic man a man to be greatly good must imagine clearly 
 he must see himself
 and the world through the eyes of another and of
  see himself and the world not just the world but see himself what is it that is expected of us
 by the billions of people who live
 in what laurie garrett the other day so appropriately called despair and disparity what is it that they have
  every right
 to ask of us what is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves out of our shared humanity
 and out of the human spirit  well you know precisely
 what it is there 's a great deal of argument about whether we as the great nation that we are should be the policeman of the
  the world 's constabulary  but there should be virtually no argument
 about whether we should be the world 's healer there has certainly been no argument about that in this room in the past four days 
 so if we are to be the world 's healer every disadvantaged person in this world including in the united states
 becomes our patient
  every disadvantaged nation  and perhaps our own nation becomes
 our patient so it 's fun to think about the etymology of the word patient 
 it comes initially from the latin patior  to endure or to
  you go back to the old indo european root again and what do you find the  indo european stem is pronounced payen we would spell it 
 and lo and behold mirabile dictu it is the same root
 as the word compassion comes from p a e n so  the lesson is very clear  
 the lesson is that our patient the world  and the disadvantaged of the world
 that patient
  deserves
 our compassion  but beyond our compassion and far greater than compassion is our moral imagination and our identification
 with each individual who lives
 in that world 
 not to think of them as a huge forest but as individual trees of course in this day and age  the trick is
  not to let each tree be obscured by that bush in washington that can get can get in the way 
 so here we are we are should be 
 morally committed to being the healer of the world  
 and we have had examples over and over and over
  again you 've just heard one in the last fifteen minutes
 of people who have
 not only had that commitment  but had the charisma the brilliance and i think in this room it 's easy to use the word brilliant my god
 the brilliance
 to succeed at least at the beginning of their quest and who no doubt will continue to succeed as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves
 in their cause
  the love of humankind
