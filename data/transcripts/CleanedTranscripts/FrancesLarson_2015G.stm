  for the last year  everyone 's been watching the same show  
 and i 'm not talking about game of thrones but a horrifying real life drama that 's proved too fascinating to turn off 
 it 's a show produced by murderers and shared around the world via
  the internet 
 their names have become familiar james foley steven sotloff david haines  alan henning peter 
 kenji goto jogo their beheadings by the islamic state
 were barbaric  but if we think they were archaic from a remote
  age then we 're wrong they were uniquely modern  
 because the murderers acted knowing well that millions of people would tune in to watch 
 the headlines called them savages and barbarians  
 because the image of one man overpowering another  killing him with a knife to the throat  conforms to our idea of ancient primitive
  practices  the polar opposite of our urban civilized ways 
 we don 't do things like that 
 but that 's the irony  we think a beheading has nothing to do with us even as we click on the screen to watch
  but it is to do with us 
 the islamic state beheadings
 are not
  ancient or remote they
 're a global 21st century event 
 a  21st century event that takes place in our living rooms at our desks on our computer screens 
 they 're entirely dependent on the power of technology to connect us  
 and whether we like it or not everyone who watches
 is a part of the show and
  of people watch  
 we don 't know exactly how many obviously it 's difficult to calculate  but a poll taken in the uk for example in august 
  estimated that one point two million people had watched the beheading of james foley in the few days after it was released
  and that 's just the first few days  and just britain 
 a similar poll taken in the united states in november two thousand and fourteen
 found that nine percent of those surveyed had watched beheading videos  
 and a further twenty three percent had watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown
  nine percent may be a small minority of all the people who could watch  but it 's still a very large crowd  
 and of course that crowd is growing all the time  because every week every month more people will keep downloading and keep watching 
 if we go back eleven years
  before sites like youtube and facebook were born  
 it was a similar story when innocent civilians like daniel pearl nick berg paul johnson were beheaded 
 those videos were shown during the iraq war  
 nick berg 's beheading
 quickly became one of the most searched for items on the internet 
 within a day  it was the top search term across search engines like google
  lycos yahoo in the week after nick berg 's beheading these were the top ten search terms
 in the united states 
 the berg beheading video remained the most popular search term for a week  and it was the second most popular search term for the whole month of may
  website that first showed nick berg 's beheading
 had to close down within a couple of days due to overwhelming traffic to the site 
 one dutch website owner said that his daily viewing figures rose from three hundred thousand to seven hundred and fifty thousand
 every time a beheading in iraq was shown he told reporters
  eighteen months later
 that it had been downloaded many millions of times  and that 's just one website a similar pattern was seen again and again when
 videos of beheadings were released during the iraq war  
 social media sites have made these images more accessible than ever before  but if we take another step back in history
 we 'll see that it was the camera that first created a new kind of crowd in our history of beheadings as public spectacle 
 as soon as the camera appeared on the scene a full lifetime ago on june seventeen 
 it had an immediate and unequivocal effect that day the first film of a public beheading was created in france
  france it was the execution the guillotining of a german serial killer
 outside the prison saint pierre in versailles 
 weidmann was due to be executed at the crack of dawn as was customary at the time  
 but his executioner was new to the job  and he 'd underestimated how long it would take him to prepare
  was executed at four thirty in the morning  by which time on a june morning there was enough light to take photographs 
 and a spectator in the crowd filmed the event unbeknownst to the authorities 
 several still photographs were taken as well  and you can still watch the film online today
 and
  look at the photographs the crowd on the day of weidmann 's execution
 was called unruly and disgusting by the press but that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people
 who could now study the action over and over again
  the camera may have made
 these scenes more accessible than ever before  but it 's not just about the camera 
 if we take a bigger leap back in history we 'll see that for as long as there have been public judicial executions and beheadings 
 there have been the crowds to see them 
 in london as late as the early  19th century  there might be four or five thousand people to see a standard hanging
  could be forty thousand or fifty thousand to see a famous criminal killed  
 and a beheading which was a rare event in england at the time  attracted even more 
 in may one thousand eight hundred and twenty five men known as the cato street conspirators
 were executed in
  london for plotting to assassinate members of the british government they were hung
 and then decapitated it was a gruesome scene  each man 's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd 
 and one hundred thousand people that 's ten thousand more than can fit into wembley stadium 
 had turned out to watch the streets were packed 
  had rented out windows and rooftops 
 people had climbed onto carts and wagons in the street people climbed lamp posts 
 people had been known to have died in the crush on popular execution days  
 evidence suggests that throughout our history of public beheadings and public executions 
 the vast majority of the people who come to see are either enthusiastic
 or at best
  disgust has been comparatively rare 
 and even when people are disgusted and are horrified  it doesn 't always stop them from coming out all the same to watch  
 perhaps the most striking example of the human ability to watch a beheading and remain unmoved
 and even be disappointed
 was the
  introduction in france in 
 of the guillotine that famous decapitation machine 
 to us in the  21st century the guillotine may seem like a monstrous contraption 
 but to the first crowds who saw it it was actually a disappointment
  executions on the scaffold where people were mutilated and burned and pulled apart slowly 
 to them watching the guillotine in action it was so quick there was nothing to see 
 the blade fell the head fell into a basket out of sight immediately 
 and they
  give me back my gallows  give me back my wooden gallows 
 the end of torturous public judicial executions in europe and america was partly to do with being more humane towards the criminal  
 but it was also partly because the crowd obstinately refused to behave in the way that they should 
 all too often execution day was more like a carnival than a solemn ceremony 
 a public judicial execution in europe or america is unthinkable 
 but there are other scenarios that should make us cautious about thinking that things are different now and we don 't behave like that anymore 
 take for example  the incidents of suicide baiting 
 this is when a crowd gathers to watch a person who has climbed to the top of a public building in order to kill themselves
 and people in the crowd shout and jeer get on with it go on and jump this is a 
 phenomenon 
 one paper in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one found that in ten out of twenty one threatened suicide attempts 
 there was incidents of suicide baiting and jeering from a
  there have been
 incidents reported in the press this year  
 this was a very widely reported incident in telford and shropshire in march this year  
 and when it happens today  people take photographs and they take videos on their phones and they post those videos online 
 when it comes to brutal murderers who post their beheading videos the internet has created a new kind of crowd
  the action takes place in a distant time and place  
 which gives the viewer a sense of detachment from what 's happening a sense of separation it 's nothing to do with me it 's already happened  
 we are also offered an unprecedented sense of intimacy today we are all offered front row seats we can all watch in private in our own time and space  and no one need ever
  know that we 've clicked on the screen to watch  
 this sense of separation from other people from the event itself seems to be key to understanding our ability to watch  and there are several ways in which the internet creates a sense of detachment
 that seems to erode individual moral responsibility
  our activities online are often contrasted with real life as though the things we do online are somehow less real 
 we feel less accountable for our actions
 when we
 interact online there 's a sense of anonymity a sense of invisibility  so we feel less accountable for our behavior 
 the internet also makes it far easier to stumble upon things inadvertently things that we would usually
  avoid in everyday life 
 today a video can start playing before you even know what you 're watching 
 or you may be tempted to look at material that you wouldn 't look at in everyday life or you wouldn 't look at if you were with other people at the time 
 and when the action is pre recorded and takes place in a distant
  time and space watching seems like a passive activity 
 there 's nothing i can do about it now it 's already happened  
 all these things make it easier as an internet user for us to give in to our sense of curiosity about death 
 to push our personal boundaries 
 to
 test our sense of shock to explore our sense of shock  but we 're not passive when we watch on the contrary
  the murderer 's desire to be seen when the victim of a decapitation is bound and defenseless he or she essentially becomes
 a pawn in their killer 's show  unlike a trophy head that 's taken in battle that represents the luck and skill it takes to win a
  a beheading is staged when it 's essentially a piece of theater 
 the power comes from the reception the killer receives as he performs 
 in other words  watching is very much part of the event 
 the event no longer takes place in a single location at a certain point in time as it used to and as it may still appear to 
 now the event is stretched
  out in time and place  and everyone who watches plays their part 
 we should stop watching  but we know we won 't 
 history tells us we won 't and the killers know it too thank you
  's move here while they install for the next performance i want to ask you the question that probably many here have which is how did you get interested in this topic frances larson 
 i used to work at a museum called the pitt rivers museum in oxford which was famous for its display of shrunken heads from south america 
 people used to say oh the shrunken head museum the shrunken head museum
  the history of scientific collections of skulls i was working on the cranial collections 
 and it just struck me as ironic that here were people coming to see this gory primitive savage culture that they were almost fantasizing about and creating
 without really understanding what they were seeing and all the while these vast i mean hundreds of thousands of skulls in our museums
 across europe and the states were kind of upholding this enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality so i wanted to kind of
 twist it round and say let 's look at us we 're looking through the glass case at these shrunken heads let 's look at our own history and our own cultural
 fascination with these things
