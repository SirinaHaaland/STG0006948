  i 'm an artist and i cut books this is one of my first book works it 's called alternate route to knowledge  i wanted to create a stack of books so that somebody could come into the gallery and think they 're just looking at a regular stack of books but then as they
  see this rough hole carved into it and wonder what was happening wonder why and think about the material of the book 
 so i 'm interested in the texture but i 'm more interested in the text and the images that we find within books 
 in most of my work what i do is i seal the edges of a book with a thick varnish so it 's creating sort of a skin on the outside of the book so it becomes a solid material but then the pages inside 
  are still loose  and then i carve into the surface of the book and i 'm not moving or adding anything i 'm just
  carving around whatever i find interesting so everything you see within the finished piece is exactly where it was in the book before i began  
 i think of my work as sort of a remix in a way because i 'm working with somebody else 's material in the same way that a d j might be working with somebody else 's music 
 this was a book of raphael paintings
  taking his work and remixing it carving into it i 'm sort of making it into something that 's more new and more contemporary  
 i 'm thinking also about breaking out of the box of the traditional book and pushing that linear format and try to push the structure of the book itself
 so that the book can become fully sculptural 
 i 'm using clamps and ropes and all sorts of materials
 in order to hold things in place before i varnish so that i can push the form before i begin so that something like this
 can become a piece like this  which is just made from a single dictionary or something like this
 can become a piece like this 
 or something like this  which who knows what that 's going to be or
  why that 's in my studio  will become a piece like this  
 so i think one of the reasons people are disturbed by destroying books people don 't want to rip books and nobody really wants to throw away a book is that we think about books as living things we think about them as a body  
 and they 're created to relate to our
  as far as scale but they also have the potential to continue to grow and to continue to become new things so books really are alive  
 so i think of the book as a body  
 and i think of the book as a technology  i think of the book as a tool  
 and i also think of the book as a machine 
 i also think of the book as a landscape this is a full set of encyclopedias that 's been connected and sanded together  and as i
  carve through it i 'm deciding what i want to choose so with encyclopedias i could have chosen anything  but i specifically chose images of landscapes  
 and with the material itself  i 'm using sandpaper and sanding the edges so not only the images suggest landscape but the material itself suggests a landscape as well  
 so one of the things i do is when i 'm carving through the book
  i 'm thinking about images but i 'm also thinking about text and i think about them in a very similar way  because what 's interesting is that when we 're reading text when we 're reading a book 
 it puts images in our head  so we 're sort of filling that piece we 're sort of creating images when we 're reading text and when we 're looking at an image we actually use language in order to understand what we 're looking at so there 's sort of a yin yang that happens
  of a flip flop so i 'm creating a piece that the the viewer is
 completing themselves  
 and i think of my work as almost an archaeology i 'm excavating and i 'm trying to maximize the potential and discover as much as i possibly can and exposing it within my own work 
 but at the same time  i 'm thinking about this idea of erasure  and what 's happening
  now that most of our information is intangible  and this idea of loss  
 and this idea that not only is the format constantly shifting within computers but
 the information itself  now that we don 't have a physical backup
 has to be constantly updated in order to not lose it 
  i have several dictionaries in my own studio  and i do use a computer every day and if i need to look up a word i 'll go on the computer because i can go directly and instantly to what 
  i 'm looking up i think that the book was never really the right format for nonlinear information which is why we 're seeing reference books becoming the first to be endangered or extinct  
 so i don 't think that the book will ever really die people think
  that now
 now that we have digital technology the book is going to die and we are seeing
 things shifting and things evolving i think that the book will evolve and just like
 people said painting would die when photography and printmaking became everyday materials but what it really allowed painting to do was it allowed painting to quit its day job it allowed painting to not have to have that
  everyday
 chore of telling the story  and painting became free and was allowed to tell its own story and that 's when we saw
 modernism emerge and we saw painting go into different branches  and i think that 's what 's happening with books now now that most of our technology most of our information most of our personal and cultural records
 are in digital form i think it 's really allowing the book to become something new  so i think it 's a very exciting
 time for an artist like me  and it 's very exciting to see what will happen with the book in the future  thank you
