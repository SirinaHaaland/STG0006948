  my life
 when everything seemed perfect  everywhere i went i felt at home  everyone i met  i felt i knew them for as long as i could remember and
 i want to share with you
 how i came to that place and what i 've learned since i left
  it  this is where it began  
 and it raises an existential question which is if i 'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness why am i not visible in the photograph  
 and where is this time and place  
 this is los angeles california where i live  
 this is a police photo that 's actually my car we 're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in los angeles called
 and the situation is that a car full of paramedics on their way home from the hospital after work
 have run across the wreckage  and they 've advised the police that there were no survivors inside the car that the driver 's dead that i 'm dead  
 and the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive to cut apart the vehicle to extract the body of the driver  and when they do they find that behind the glass
  find me and my skull 's crushed and my collar bone is crushed  
 all but two of my ribs my pelvis and both arms they 're all crushed  but there is still a pulse and they get me to that nearby hospital cedars sinai 
 where that night i receive because of my internal bleeding forty five units of blood which means
 full
 full replacements of all the blood in me before they 're able to staunch the flow i 'm put on full life support
 and i have a massive stroke  and my brain drops into a coma  
 now comas are measured on a scale from fifteen down to three fifteen is a mild coma 
 three is the deepest and if you look you 'll see that there 's only one way you can score three it 's essentially there 's no sign of life from outside at all 
 i spent more than a month in a glasgow coma scale three and it is inside that deepest level of coma on the
  rim between my life and my death that i 'm experiencing the full connection and full consciousness
 of inner space  from my family looking in from outside what they 're trying to figure out is
 a different kind of existential question  which is how far is it going to be possible to bridge from the comatose potential mind that they 're looking at
 to an actual mind which i define simply
  as the functioning of the brain that is remaining inside my head 
 now to put this into a broader context i want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien watching the earth from outer space  and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television
 is the earth channel and your favorite show is the human show 
 and the reason i think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting it 's so unpredictable
 and so fragile  and this is how we began we all began in the awash valley in ethiopia  
 the show began with tremendous special effects because there were catastrophic climate shifts
 which sort of sounds interesting
 as a parallel to today because of the earth tilting on its axis and those catastrophic climate shifts 
 we had to figure out how to find better food and we had to learn there 's lucy that 's how we all began
 we had to learn how to crack open animal bones use tools to do that to feed on the marrow to grow our brains more so we actually grew our consciousness in response to this global threat 
 now
 you also continue to watch as consciousness evolved to the point that here in india 
 in madhya pradesh there 's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found 
 it 's a cupule that took forty to fifty thousand blows with
  a stone tool to create and it 's the first known expression of art on the planet  
 and the reason it connects us with consciousness today is that all of us still today  the very first shape we draw as a child is a circle 
 and then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle we create an eye
 and the eye that evolves through all of our history there 's the egyptian god horus which symbolizes prosperity
  wisdom and health 
 and that comes down right way to the present with the dollar bill in the united states which has on it an eye of providence  
 so watching all of this show from outer space you think we get it we understand that the most precious resource on the blue planet is our consciousness because it 's the first thing we draw we surround ourselves
  it 's probably the most common image on the planet  
 but we don 't we take our consciousness for granted while i was producing in los angeles  i never thought about it for a second  until it was stripped from me i never thought about it 
 and what i 've learned since that event and during my recovery
 is that consciousness is under threat on this planet in ways it 's never been under threat before 
 these are just some examples and the reason i 'm so honored to be here to talk today in india is because india has the sad distinction of being the head injury capital
  of the world that statistic is so sad there is no more drastic and sudden gap created between potential and actual mind than a severe head injury each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation  
 which means that india unless something changes is accumulating a need for 
  millennia of rehabilitation what you find in the united states is an injury every twenty
  that 's one and a half million every year stroke every forty seconds alzheimer 's disease every seventy seconds somebody succumbs to that 
 all of these represent gaps between potential mind and actual mind 
 and here are some of the other categories if you look at the whole planet 
 the world health organization tells us that depression is the number one disease on earth in terms of years lived with disability 
 we find that the number two
 source of disability is depression in the age group of fifteen to forty four 
 our children are becoming depressed at an alarming rate 
 i discovered during my recovery the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers is suicide  
 if you look at some of these other items concussions half of e r admissions from adolescents are
  if i talk about migraine  forty percent of the population suffer episodic headaches  
 fifteen percent suffer migraines that wipe them out for days on end all of this is leading computer addiction just to cover that 
 the most frequent thing we do is use digital devices 
 the average teenager sends three thousand three hundred texts every [ month ] 
 we 're talking about a society that is retreating into depression and disassociation
 when we are potentially confronting the next
  great catastrophic climate shift 
 so what you 'd be wondering watching the human show is are we going to confront and address the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way by growing our consciousness or are we going to continue to retreat  
 and that then might lead you to watch an episode one day of cedars sinai medical center
 and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind  this is a dense array eeg mri
 tracking one hundred and fifty six channels of information it 's not my eeg at cedars  
 it 's your eeg tonight and last night  it 's the what our minds do every night to digest the day and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we 're asleep to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning  
 this is how i was when i returned from the hospital
  nearly four months the horseshoe shape you can see on my skull is where they operated and went inside my brain to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life 
 but if you look into the eye of consciousness that single eye you can see i 'm looking down but let me tell you how i felt at that point 
 i didn 't feel empty i felt everything simultaneously i felt empty and full hot and cold  euphoric and depressed
 because the brain is the world 's first fully functional quantum computer it can occupy multiple
  states at the same time and with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged  i felt everything simultaneously  
 but let 's swivel around and look at me frontally  this is now flash forward to the point in time where i 've been discharged by the health system 
 look into those eyes i 'm not able to focus those eyes i 'm not able to follow a line of text in a book
  but the system has moved me on because as my family started to discover there is no long term concept in the health care system  
 neurological damage ten years of rehab requires a long term perspective but let 's take a look behind my eyes  
 this is a gamma radiation spec scan that uses gamma radiation to map three dimensional function within the brain  
 it requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension but in two dimensions i think you can see the beautiful symmetry and illumination of
  normal mind at work here 's my brain 
 that is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain being destroyed by the stroke  
 so my family as we moved forward and discovered that the health care system had moved us by 
 had to try to find solutions and answers and during that process it took many years
 one of the doctors said that my recovery
  my degree of advance since the amount of head injury i 'd suffered was miraculous  
 and that was when i started to write a book because i didn 't think it was miraculous i thought there were miraculous elements 
 but i also didn 't think it was right that one should have to struggle and search for answers when this is a pandemic within our society  
 so from this experience of my recovery  i want to share four particular aspects i call them the
 four c 's of consciousness that helped me grow my potential mind back towards the actual mind that i work with every day the first c is cognitive training  
 unlike the smashed glass of my car  plasticity of the brain means that there was always a possibility with treatment to train the brain so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness  
 plasticity means that there was always hope for our reason hope for our ability to rebuild that function 
  can redefine itself and this is demonstrated by two specialists called hagen and silva back in the one thousand nine hundred and seventy 's 
 the global perspective is that up to thirty percent of children in school have learning weaknesses that are not 
 but with appropriate treatment they can be screened for and detected and corrected and avoid their academic
  but what i discovered is it 's almost impossible to find anyone who provides that treatment or care 
 here 's what my neuropsychologist provided for me when i actually found somebody who could apply it i 'm not a doctor so i 'm not going to talk about the various subtests let 's just talk about 
  is the mental processing how fast you can acquire information retain it and retrieve it that is essential for success in life today 
 and you can see here there are three columns  untestable that
  and then i creep up to the point that i get a score of seventy nine which is just below average 
 in the health care system if you touch average you 're done  that 's when i was discharged from the system 
 what does average i q really mean  it meant that when i was given two and a half hours to take a test that anyone here would take in fifty
  this is a very very low level in order to be kicked out of the health care system 
 then i underwent cognitive training and let me show you what happened to the right hand column when i did my cognitive training
 over a period of time  this is not supposed to occur i q is supposed to stabilize and solidify at the age of eight 
 now the journal of the national medical association
  gave my memoir a full clinical review  which is very unusual i 'm not a doctor i have no medical background whatsoever  
 but they felt the evidences that there was important valuable information in the book  
 and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it but they asked one question they said is this repeatable 
 that was a fair question because my memoir was simply how i found solutions that worked for me the answer is yes and for the first time it 's
  to share two examples here 's somebody what they did as they went through cognitive training
 at ages seven and eleven and here 's another person in call it high school and college 
 and this person is particularly interesting i won 't go into the intrascatter that 's in the subtests  but they still had a neurologic issue but that person could be identified as having a learning disability  
 and with accommodation they went on to college and had a full life in terms of their opportunities 
  i still had crushing migraine headaches two elements that worked for me here
 are the first is ninety percent i learned of head and neck pain is through muscular skeletal imbalance  the craniomandibular system is critical to that 
 and
 when i underwent it and found solutions  this is the interrelationship between the tmj and the teeth 
 up to thirty percent of the population have a disorder disease or dysfunction in the jaw that affects the entire body 
 i was fortunate to find
  dentist who applied this entire universe of technology you 're about to see to establish that if he repositioned my jaw the headaches pretty much resolved  
 but that then my teeth weren 't in the right place he then held my jaw in the right position while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment  so my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position 
 this affected my entire body  if that sounds like a very very strange thing to say and
  rather a bold statement how can the jaw affect the entire body 
 let me simply point out to you if i ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long walk 
 how far would you last before you had to remove that grain of sand  
 that tiny misalignment bear in mind there are no nerves in the teeth that 's why the same between the before and after that this shows it 's hard to see the difference now just trying putting
  grains of sand between your teeth and see the difference it makes  i still had migraine headaches  the next issue that resolved was that if ninety percent of
 head and neck pain is caused by imbalance  the other ten percent largely if you set aside 
 brain cancer and hormonal issues is the circulation imagine the blood flowing through your body i was told at ucla medical center as one sealed system
  there 's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it and around that pipe are the nerves drawing their nutrient supply from the blood that 's basically it if you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system it bulges someplace else  
 if that some place else where it bulges is inside the biggest nerve in your body your brain 
 you get a vascular migraine  this is a level of pain that 's only known to other people who suffer vascular migraines
  this technology  this is mapping in three dimensions this is an mri mra mrv a volumetric mri  
 using this technology  the specialists at ucla medical center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring a vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body  
 and in the following months and
  i felt the neurological flow of life itself returning 
 communication the next c 
 this is critical all consciousness is about communication  
 and here by great fortune one of my father 's clients had a husband who worked at the alfred mann foundation for scientific research  
 alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator who 's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness  whether to restore
  vision to the blind or movement to the paralyzed  and i 'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed 
 i 've brought with me from southern california  the fm device this is it being held in the hand 
 it weighs less than a gram  so two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime  five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin 
 where does it go inside the body  it has been simulated and tested to endure in the body  corrosion free for over eighty years
  so it goes in and it stays there here are the implantation sites the concept that they 're working towards and they have working prototypes
 is that we placed
 it throughout the motor points of the body where they 're needed the main unit will then go inside the brain 
 an fm device in the cortex of the brain the motor cortex will send signals in real time to the motor points in the relevant muscles so that the person will be able to move their arm let 's say in real time if they 've lost control of their arm
  and other fm devices implanted in fingertips on contacting a surface will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain so that the person feels a sense of touch 
 is this science fiction no because i 'm wearing the first application of this technology i don 't have the ability to control my left foot 
 a radio device is controlling every step i take and a sensor picks up my foot for me every time i walk and
 in closing
  want to share the personal reason why this meant so much to me and changed the direction of my life 
 in my coma one of the presences i sensed was someone i felt was a protector  
 and when i came out of my coma  i recognized my family but i didn 't remember my own past 
 gradually i remembered the protector was my wife  and i whispered the good news through my broken jaw which was wired shut to my night nurse  and the following morning
  my mother came to explain that i 'd not always been in this bed in this room  that i 'd been working in film and television and that i had been in a crash
 and that yes i was married  but marcy had been killed instantly in the crash and during my time in coma  
 she had been laid to rest in her hometown of phoenix  
 now in the dark years
  work out what remained for me if everything that made today special was gone 
 and as i discovered these threats to consciousness and how they are surrounding the world and enveloping the lives of more and more people every day  i discovered what truly remained i 
  believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness that the human show can stay on the air for millennia to come 
  want to talk to him for a second
 when i read his book  i went to la to meet him and so i was sitting in this
 restaurant  waiting for a man to come by who
 obviously would have some difficulty i don 't know what i had in my mind and he was walking around i didn 't expect that person that i was going to meet to be him  
 and then we met and we talked and i 'm like 
 he doesn 't look like somebody
 who was built out of nothing  and then i was amazed at what role technology
  played in your recovery and we have his book
 outside
 in the bookshop the thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail
 with which he has written every hospital he has been to every treatment he got every near miss he
  i knew when i was timing this that there wouldn 't be time for me to do anything about well this is it this is the control unit  and this records every single step i 've taken
  five or six years now  and if i do this probably the mic won 't hear it 
 that little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on when i press it again it 'll chirp three times  and that 'll mean that it 's armed and ready to go 
 and that 's my friend i mean i charge it every night  and it works it works and what i would love to add because i didn 't have time
 that
 is a small antenna  underneath my heel there is a sensor
 that detects when my foot leaves the ground what 's called the heel lift  
 this thing blinks all the time i 'll leave it out so you might be able to see it but this is blinking all the time it 's sending signals in real time 
 and if you walk faster if i walk faster  it detects what 's called the time interval which is the interval between each heel lift  and it accelerates the
  amount and level of the stimulation the other things they 've worked on i didn 't have time to say this in my talk
 is they 've restored functional hearing to thousands of deaf people 
 i could tell you the story  this was going to be an abandoned technology but alfred mann met the doctor who was going to retire [ dr schindler ]
 and he was going to retire all the technology was going to be lost because not a single
 medical manufacturer would take it on because it was a small issue but
  of deaf people in the world and the cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now
 it works  and the other thing is they 're working on artificial retinas for the blind
 and this this this is the implantable generation  because what i didn 't say in my talk is this is actually exoskeletal  i should clarify that because the first
  's wrapped around the leg around the affected limb  i must tell you they 're an amazing there 's a hundred people who work in that building
 engineers scientists and other team members
 all the time  alfred mann has set up this foundation to advance this research because he saw there 's no way venture capital would come in for something like this 
 the audience is too small you 'd
  there 's plenty of paralyzed people in the world  but the audience is too small and the amount of research the time it takes the fda clearances
  the payback time is too long for v c to be interested so he saw a need and he stepped in he 's a very very
 remarkable man he 's done a lot of
