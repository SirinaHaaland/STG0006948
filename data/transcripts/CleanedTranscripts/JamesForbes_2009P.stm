  what does it look like come with me to nine hundred and fifteen south bloodworth street in raleigh north
  where i grew up if you come in you will see us evening time at table
 set for ten but not always all seats filled
 at the point when dinner is ready to be served  
 since mom had eight kids  sometimes she said she couldn 't tell who was who and where they were before we could
  and if someone happened to be missing  
 we would have to we say fix a plate for that person  put it in the oven 
 then we could say grace  and we could eat  
 also while we were at the table  there was a ritual in our family  
 when something significant had happened for any one of us
  had just been elected as the president of the pta 
 or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination 
 or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent
 the ritual at the family was once the announcement is made we must take five ten minutes to do what we call
  that person
 that is to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way  for when one is honored 
 all are honored  
 also  we had to make a report on our extended 
 visited members that
  extended members of the family  sick and elderly shut in my task was at least once a week to visit mother lassiter who lived 
  on east street mother williamson who lived on bledsoe avenue and mother lathers who lived on oberlin road  why because they were old and infirm  
  to be family is to care and share and to look out for one another they are our family and of course sometimes there was a bonus for going they would offer sweets or money 
 mom says if they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them you must always say ' nothing ' and if they insist say ' whatever
  this was the nature of being at that table in fact she indicated that
 if we would do that not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family  
 but she said even god will smile  and when god smiles there is peace 
  table at nine hundred and fifteen i learned something about compassion  
 of course  it was a minister 's family  so we had to add god into it and so i came to think that mama eternal 
 mama eternal is always wondering 
 are all the children in and if we had been faithful
  in caring and sharing  we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world  now it was not always wonderful at that table  let me explain 
 a point at which we did not rise to the occasion  it was christmas and at our family oh what a morning christmas morning  where
  open up our gifts where we have special prayers and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols  it was a very intimate moment in fact you could come 
  down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing  and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed  
  who did not have any place on that particular christmas to celebrate  and daddy brought
 elder revels to the christmas family celebration  
 we thought he must be out of his mind this is our time  this is intimate time  this is when we can just be who we are and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on
  while we are still in our pjs  why would daddy bring
 elder revels  any other time but not to the christmas celebration  
 and mom overheard us and said well you know what if you really understand the nature of this celebration it
 is that this is a time
 where you extend the circle of love that 's what the celebration is all about it 's time to
  make space to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community 
 so we sucked up 
 but growing up at nine hundred and fifteen compassion was not a word to be debated  it was a
  and brothers united together and like chief seattle said we did not spin the web of life  we 're all strands in it and whatever 
  we do to the web we do to ourselves now that 's compassion  so let me tell you i kind of look at the world this way  
  's compassion a harvested field of grain with some grain
 in the corners  reminding me of the hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest  but you must always leave some on the edges just in case there 's someone
 who has not had the share necessary
 for good nurture  talk about a picture of compassion  i see
 always it stirs my heart a picture of dr martin luther king
 jr walking arm in arm with andy young and rabbi heschel and maybe thich nhat hanh and some of the other saints assembled  walking across the
  bridge and going into selma just a photograph arm in arm for struggle suffering together
 in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of
  in my community was upset you heard about riots
 all across the land bobby kennedy was scheduled
 to bring an inner city message
 in indianapolis  
 this is the picture they said it 's going to be too volatile for you to go 
 he insisted i must go so sitting on a flatbed truck 
 the elders of the community are there and bobby stands up and says to the people i have bad news for you some of you may
  not have heard that dr king has been assassinated 
 i know that you are angry and i know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge but he said what i really want you to know
 is that i know how you feel  because i had someone dear to me
 snatched away
 i know how you feel 
 and he said i hope that you will have the strength to do what i did  
 i allowed my anger my bitterness my grief
 to simmer a while  
 and then i made up my mind that i was going to make a different world  and we can do that together that 's a picture compassion  i think
  i see it 
 i saw it when the dalai lama came to the riverside church while i was a pastor and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world 
 he asked them to give a message  and they each read
 in their own language a central affirmation
 and that was
 some version of the golden rule 
 as you would that others would do unto you do also unto them 
 twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire
  are so connected
 that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself
 one more picture while i 'm stinking and thinking about the riverside church nine eleven  
 last night
 at chagrin fall a
 when a service was held at the riverside church  we carried it on our station in this city  
 it was he said one of the most powerful moments
 of life together we were all suffering  
 but you invited representatives of all of the traditions
 to come and
  you invited them ' find out what it is in your tradition
 that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated 
 when we have been despised and rejected ' and they all spoke out of their own traditions 
 a word about the healing power of
  a sense of compassion
 sort of as second nature  but i became a preacher now as a preacher i got a job i got to preach the stuff  but i got to do 
 as father divine in harlem used to say to folks some people preach the gospel  i have to tangibilitate the gospel so the real issue is how do you
  tangibilitate
 compassion  how do you make it real my faith
 has constantly lifted up the ideal and challenged me when i fell beneath it 
 in my tradition 
 there is a gift that we have made to other traditions to everybody around the world who knows the story
  the good samaritan many people think of it primarily in terms
 of charity
  random acts of kindness  
 but for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable 
  was 
 what is the greatest commandment 
 and according to jesus the word comes forth you must love yourself  you must love the lord your god with all your heart mind and soul  and your neighbor as yourself 
 and then the person asked well  what do you mean
  telling the story of the man who fell among thieves  and how religious authorities
 went the other way  
 and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way  but an unsuspecting despised person
 came along saw the man in need provided oil and wine for his wounds
 put him on his own transportation  and took him
 to the inn and asked the innkeeper take care of him 
 and he said here this is the initial investment  but if needs continue 
 make sure that you provide them
  and whatever else is needed i will provide it
 and pay for it when i return this always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a good samaritan 
 a good samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and
  one who provides a system of sustained care i like that ' a system of sustained care ' in the inn take care i think maybe it 's one time when the bible 
  talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary that all god 's children would have their needs cared for so that 
  we could answer when mommy eternal asks in regards to health are all the children in and we could say yes
 oh what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate
 compassion  i recall that my work as a pastor has always involved
 caring for their spiritual needs being concerned for housing for
  for the prisoners for the infirm  
 for children even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off where they are going 
 to be a pastor is to care for these individual needs  but now to be a good samaritan and i always say and to be a good american for me 
 is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care
 compassion takes on a corporate dynamic 
 i believe that whatever we did around that table
 at bloodworth street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that
  that family together that understands the nature of our unity we are one people together 
 so  let me explain to you what i mean when i think about
 compassion  and why i think it is so important that right at this point in history  
 we would decide to establish this charter of compassion 
 the reason it 's important
  because
 this is
 a very special time in history it is the time that biblically we would speak of as
 the day  or the year of god 's favor  this is a season of grace  unusual things are beginning
  pardon me as a black man for celebrating that the election of obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor  
 and yet 
 there is so much more that needs to be done we need to bring health
 and food and education and respect for all god 's citizens all god 's children
 remembering mama eternal now let me close my comments
 by telling you
 that whenever i feel something very deeply  
 it usually takes the form of verse  
 and so i want to close with a little song i close with this song it 's a children 's song
 because we are all
  children at the table of mama eternal  and if mama eternal has taught us correctly 
 this song will make sense not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering  but to all who sign the charter for compassion  and this is why we do it the song says i
  made heaven so happy today
