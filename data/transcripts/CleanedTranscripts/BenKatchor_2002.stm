  i 'm going to read a few strips these are most of these are from a
 monthly page i do in and architecture and design magazine called metropolis and the first story is called the faulty switch
  another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch 
 it 's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight 
 but at dusk
 everything changes  the architect spent hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass
 switchplates for his new office tower and then left it to a contractor to install these 
  79 cent switches behind them  we know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room we automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward
  but the sound we are greeted with as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late afternoon light 
 recalls to mind a dirty men 's room in the rear of a greek coffee shop 
 this sound colors our first impression of any room it can 't be helped  but where
  commonly described as a click come from is it simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action  
 or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment  the often dental consonant of no 
  language or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach
  they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls  
 but today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic  
 the click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life
 announcing our entry into every lightless room 
 the sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature 
 it has a deep melancholy ring 
 children don 't like it it 's why they leave lights on
  adults find it comforting  
 but wouldn 't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship  
 or the recorded crowing of a rooster 
 or the distant peel of thunder  
 thomas edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one
  for the filament of his electric light bulb  
 why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch 
 that 's the end of that the
 next
 story is called in praise of the taxpayer that so many of the city 's most venerable taxpayers have
  survived yet another commercial building boom is cause for celebration these one or two story structures designed 
 to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand were not meant to be permanent buildings
  yet for one reason or another they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high rise construction  
 although they make no claim to architectural beauty  they are in their perfect temporariness a delightful alternative 
 to the large scale structures that might someday take their place
 the most perfect examples occupy corner lots they offer a pleasant respite from the 
  development around them a break of light and air 
 an architectural biding of time so buried in signage are these
  that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor  
 the small commercial building from an earlier century whose upper floors have been sealed  and whose groundfloor space now functions as a taxpayer  the few surfaces
  and necktie stores now these provisional structures have in some cases  remained standing
  for the better part of a human lifetime 
 the temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization a healthy sublimation of the urge to build 
 and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone
 that 's the end
  for the ancient egyptians the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead
 thirty cubits from foot to knee 
 it was not until the 14th century that an italian painter recognized the lap
 as a grecian temple  upholstered in flesh and cloth
 over the next two hundred years we see the infant christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the virgin 's lap and then back again 
 every child recapitulates this ascension  straddling one or both legs sitting sideways or leaning against the body
  from there to the modern ventriloquist 's dummy is but a brief moment in history 
 you were late for school again this morning  
 the ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap 
 the illusion of speech follows incidentally  
 what have you got to say for yourself jimmy
 as adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance 
 we have fading memories of that provisional temple  erected each time an adult sat down 
 on a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on 
 it is children and teenage girls who are most keenly
  aware of its architectural beauty  
 they understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels  
 the relationship between
  a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission  the bathrooms and kitchens will of course have no windows 
 the lap of luxury is an architectural
  construct of childhood which we seek in vain as adults to employ  
 that 's the end the
 next story is called the haverpiece collection a nondescript warehouse visible for a moment
 from the northbound lanes of the prykushko expressway
  serves as the temporary resting place
 for the haverpiece collection of european dried fruit
  the profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry  the foreboding sheen of an extra large date
  do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries where everything was displayed in poorly labeled roach proof bins  
 pears dried in the form of genital organs apricot halves like the ears of
  by maurice haverpiece a wealthy prune juice bottler and consolidated to form the core collection
  as an art form it lies somewhere between
  the rest of the collection remains here  stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and
  center a shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar
