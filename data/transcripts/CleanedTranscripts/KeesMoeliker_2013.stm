  is the natural history museum in rotterdam where i work as a curator
 it 's my job to make sure the collection stays okay and that it grows and basically it means i collect
  ninety five we got a new wing next to the museum it was made of glass
 and this building really helped me to do my job good
 the building was a true bird killer
 you may know that birds don 't understand the concept of glass they don 't see it so they fly into the windows
 and get killed the only thing i had to do was go out pick them up and have them stuffed for the collection laughter
 and in those days
 i developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass
 and it was on june five
  five that i heard a loud bang against the glass that changed my life and ended that of a duck
 and this is what i saw when i looked out of the window
 this is the dead duck it flew against the window it 's laying dead on its belly
 but next to the dead duck is a live duck
 and please pay attention
 both are of the male sex
 and then this happened the live duck mounted the dead duck and started to copulate
 well i 'm a biologist i 'm an ornithologist i said something 's wrong here one is dead one
  is alive that must be necrophilia
 i look both are of the male sex homosexual necrophilia
 so i laughter
 i took my camera i took my notebook
 took a chair and started to observe this behavior
 after seventy five minutes
  i had seen enough and i got hungry
 and i wanted to go home
 so i went out
 collected the duck and before i put it in the freezer i checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex
 and here 's a rare
  so it was indeed
 of the male sex it 's a rare picture because there are ten thousand species of birds
 and only three hundred possess a penis the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard anas platyrhynchos aves anatidae
 i knew i 'd seen something special but
 it took me six years to decide to publish
  it 's a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine
 but to share this among your peers is something different i didn 't have the framework so after six years my friends and colleagues urged me to publish so i published the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard
 and here 's the situation again
 a is my office b is the place where the duck hit the glass and c is
  where i watched it
 and here are the ducks again
 as you probably know in science
 when you write a kind of special paper only six or seven people read it laughter
 but then something good happened i got a phone call from a person called marc
  abrahams and he told me you 've won a prize with your duck paper the ig nobel prize
 and the ig nobel prize laughter applause the
 ig nobel prize
 honors research that first makes people laugh and then makes them think
 with the ultimate goal to make more people interested in
  science that 's a good thing so i accepted the prize laughter
 i went
 let me remind you that marc abrahams didn 't call me from stockholm he called me from cambridge massachusetts so i traveled to
 boston to cambridge
 and i went to this wonderful ig nobel prize ceremony held at harvard university and this ceremony
 is a very nice experience
 real nobel laureates hand you the prize that 's the first thing
 and there are nine other winners who get prizes here 's one of my fellow winners that 's charles paxton
 who won the two thousand biology prize for his paper courtship behavior
 of ostriches towards
  humans under farming conditions in britain laughter and
 i think there are one or two more ig nobel prize winners in this room
 dan where are you dan ariely
 applause for dan applause
 dan won his prize
  in medicine for demonstrating that high priced fake medicine works better than low priced fake medicine laughter so here
 's my one minute of fame my acceptance speech
 and here
  is its first time on the u s west coast i 'm going to pass it around laughter
 yeah
 you can pass it around please note it 's a museum specimen but there 's no chance you 'll get the avian flu
 after winning this prize my life changed in the first place
  people started to send me all kinds of duck related things and i got a real nice collection
 more importantly
 people started to send me their observations of remarkable animal behavior and believe me if there 's an
  animal misbehaving on this planet i know about it laughter
 this is
 a moose
 it 's a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison this is in montana two thousand and eight
 this is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish
  this is the netherlands two thousand and eleven
 these are
 cane toads in australia
 this is roadkill please note that this is necrophilia it 's remarkable the position the missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom
 these are pigeons in rotterdam
  barn swallows in hong kong two thousand and four
 this is a turkey in
 wisconsin on the premises of the ethan allen juvenile correctional institution
 it took all day and the prisoners had a great time
 so what does this mean i mean the question i ask myself
  myself
 why does this happen in nature well what i concluded from
 reviewing all these cases is that it is important that this happens only when death is instant
 and in a dramatic way and in the right position for copulation at least i thought it was till i got these slides
 and here you see a dead duck it 's been there for three days and it 's laying on its back
 so there goes my theory of necrophilia
 another example of the impact of glass buildings on the life of birds this is mad max a blackbird who lives in rotterdam
 the only thing this bird did was fly against
  this window from two thousand and four to two thousand and eight day in and day out here he goes and here 's a short video
  he sees an intruder in his territory and it 's coming all the time and he 's there so there is no end to it
 and i thought in the beginning i studied this bird for a couple of years that well shouldn 't the brain of this bird be damaged
 it 's not i i show you here some slides some frames from the video
 and at the last moment before he hits the glass he puts his feet in front and then he bangs
  against the glass
 so i 'll conclude to invite you all to dead duck day that 's on june five every year at five minutes to six in the afternoon
 we come together at the natural history museum in rotterdam
 the duck comes out of the museum and we try to discuss new ways to prevent birds from
 colliding with windows
 and as you know or as you may may not know this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world in the u s alone a billion birds die
 in collision with glass buildings
 and when it 's over we go to a chinese restaurant
 and we have a six course duck dinner
 so i hope to see you
 next year
 in rotterdam the netherlands for dead duck day thank you applause oh sorry
 may i have my duck back please
