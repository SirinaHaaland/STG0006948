  how many people here would like to live to be at least eighty years old  
 yeah 
 i think we all have this hopeful expectation of living into old age  let 's project out into the future to your future
 now everyone look at two people one of you probably has alzheimer 's disease
  in some way this terrifying disease is likely to affect us all 
 part of the fear around alzheimer 's stems from the sense that there 's nothing we can do about it 
 despite decades of research we still have no disease modifying treatment and no cure  
 so if we 're lucky enough to live long enough alzheimer 's appears to be our
  destiny  
 but maybe it doesn 't have to be 
 what if i told you we could change these statistics  literally change our brain 's destiny  without relying on a cure or advancements in medicine  
 let 's begin by looking at what we currently understand about the neuroscience of alzheimer 's  
 here 's a picture of two neurons connecting the point of connection this space
  circled in red is called the synapse 
 the synapse is where neurotransmitters are released this is where signals are transmitted where communication happens 
 this is where we think feel see hear desire  and remember  
 and the synapse is where alzheimer 's happens  let 's zoom in on the synapse and look at a cartoon representation of what 's going on
 during the business of communicating information in addition to releasing neurotransmitters like glutamate into the synapse neurons also release a small peptide called amyloid beta 
 normally amyloid beta is cleared away metabolized by 
 the janitor cells of our brains  while the molecular causes of alzheimer 's are still debated most
  neuroscientists believe that the disease begins when amyloid beta begins to accumulate  
 too much is released or not enough is cleared away and the synapse begins to pile up with amyloid beta  
 and when this happens it binds to itself forming sticky aggregates called amyloid plaques 
 how many people here are forty years old or older you 're afraid to admit it now
  initial step into the disease this presence of amyloid plaques accumulating can already be found in your brains 
 the only way we could be sure of this would be through a pet scan because at this point  you are blissfully unaware you
 're not showing any impairments in memory language or cognition 
  we think it takes at least fifteen to twenty years of amyloid plaque accumulation before it reaches a tipping point  
 then triggering a molecular cascade that causes the clinical symptoms of the disease  
 prior to the tipping point  your lapses in memory might include things like 
 why did i come in this room or oh what 's his name or 
 where did i put my keys 
 now  before you all start freaking out again because i know half of you did at least one of those in the last twenty four hours
 these are all normal kinds of forgetting 
 in fact i would argue that these examples might not even involve your memory because you didn 't pay attention to where you put your keys in the first place  
 after the tipping point  the glitches in
  language and cognition are different  instead of eventually finding your keys in your coat pocket or on the table by the door you find them in the refrigerator 
 or you find them and you think what are these for 
 so what happens when amyloid plaques accumulate to this tipping point  our microglia janitor cells become 
 releasing chemicals that cause inflammation and cellular damage  we think they might actually start clearing away
  the synapses themselves a crucial neural transport protein called 
  and twists itself into something called tangles which choke off the neurons from the inside 
 by mid stage alzheimer 's we have massive inflammation and tangles and all out war at the synapse and cell death  
 so if you were a scientist trying to cure this disease at what point would you ideally want
  to intervene 
 many scientists are betting big on the simplest solution keep amyloid plaques from reaching that tipping point  
 which means that drug discovery is largely focused on developing a compound that will prevent eliminate or reduce amyloid plaque accumulation
 so the cure for alzheimer 's will likely be a preventative medicine
 're going to have to take this pill before we reach that tipping point  before the cascade is triggered before we start leaving our keys in the refrigerator  
 we think this is why to date these kinds of drugs have failed in clinical trials
 not because the science wasn 't sound but because the people in these trials were already symptomatic
  it was too late 
 think of amyloid plaques as a lit match at the tipping point the match sets fire to the forest  
 once the forest is ablaze it doesn 't do any good to blow out the match you have to blow out the match before the forest catches fire 
 even before scientists sort this out this information is actually really good news for us because it turns out that the way we live can influence the accumulation of amyloid plaques and so there are things we can do to
  keep us from reaching that tipping point  
 let 's picture your risk of alzheimer 's as a see saw scale  
 we 're going to pile risk factors on one arm and when that arm hits the floor  you are symptomatic and diagnosed with alzheimer 's  
 let 's imagine you 're fifty years old you
 're not a spring chicken anymore so you 've accumulated some amyloid plaques with age your scale is tipped a little bit  
 now let 's look at
  your dna  we 've all inherited our genes from our moms and our dads some of these genes will increase our risk and some will decrease it 
 if you 're like alice in still alice you 've inherited a rare genetic mutation that cranks out amyloid beta  and this alone will tip your scale arm to the ground  
 but for most of us the genes we inherit will only tip the arm a bit 
 for example
 apoe4 is a gene variant that increases amyloid but you can inherit a copy of apoe4 from mom and dad and still never get alzheimer 's  
 which means that for most of us our dna alone does not determine whether we get alzheimer 's  
 so what does we can 't do anything about getting older or the genes we 've inherited so far we haven 't changed our brain 's destiny
  what about sleep 
 in  slow wave deep sleep our glial cells rinse cerebral spinal fluid throughout our brains clearing away metabolic waste that accumulated in our synapses while we were awake  
 deep sleep is like a power cleanse for the brain 
 but what happens if you shortchange yourself on sleep many scientists believe that poor sleep hygiene might actually be a predictor of
  alzheimer 's  a single night of sleep deprivation leads to an increase in amyloid beta
  and amyloid accumulation has been shown to disrupt sleep  which in turn causes more amyloid to accumulate and so now we have this positive feedback loop that 's going to accelerate the tipping of that scale 
 what else
  high blood pressure diabetes obesity smoking high cholesterol have all been shown to increase our risk of developing alzheimer 's  
 some autopsy studies have shown that as many as eighty percent of people with alzheimer 's also had cardiovascular disease
 aerobic exercise has been shown in many studies to decrease amyloid beta in animal models of the disease 
  mediterranean lifestyle and diet can help to counter the tipping of this scale
 so there are many things we can do to prevent or delay the onset of alzheimer 's  but let 's say you haven 't done any of them let 's say
 there 's alzheimer 's in your family so you 've likely inherited a gene or two that tips your scale arm a bit  
 you 've been burning the candle at both ends for years you love bacon  and you don 't run unless someone 's chasing you
 let 's imagine that your amyloid plaques have reached that tipping point your scale arm has crashed to the floor  you 've tripped the cascade setting fire to the forest causing inflammation tangles and cell death  
 you should be symptomatic for alzheimer 's  
 you should be having trouble finding words and keys and remembering what i said at the beginning of this talk  
 but you might not be
  be 
 there 's one more thing you can do to protect yourself from experiencing the symptoms of alzheimer 's  even if you have the full blown disease pathology ablaze in your brain it
 has to do with neural plasticity and cognitive reserve 
 remember the experience of having alzheimer 's is ultimately a result of losing
  the average brain has over a hundred trillion synapses which is fantastic we 've got a lot to work with  
 and this isn 't a static number  we gain and lose synapses all the time through a process called neural plasticity 
 every time we learn something new we are creating and strengthening new neural connections new synapses 
 in the nun study  six hundred
  all over the age of seventy five when the study began were followed for more than two decades 
 they were regularly given physical checkups and cognitive tests  and when they died their brains were all donated for autopsy 
 in some of these brains scientists discovered something surprising  
 despite the presence of plaques and tangles and brain shrinkage what appeared to be unquestionable
  alzheimer 's the nuns who had belonged to these brains showed no signs of having the disease while they were alive  
 how can this be  
 we think it 's because these nuns had a high level of cognitive reserve  which is a way of saying that they had more functional synapses 
 people who have more years of formal education who have a high degree of literacy who engage regularly in mentally stimulating activities all have more cognitive reserve 
 they have an abundance
  and a redundancy in neural connections  
 so even if they have a disease like alzheimer 's compromising some of their synapses they 've got many extra backup connections  and this buffers them from noticing that anything is amiss  
 let 's imagine a simplified example  let 's say you only know one thing about a subject  let 's say it 's about me  
 you know that lisa genova wrote still alice and that 's the only thing
  you know about me  you have that single neural connection that one synapse  
 now imagine you have alzheimer 's  you have plaques and tangles and inflammation and microglia devouring that synapse  
 now when someone asks you hey who wrote ' still alice ' 
 you can 't remember because that synapse is either failing or gone you 've forgotten me forever
  if you had learned more about me  let 's say you learned four things about me  now imagine you have alzheimer 's and three of those synapses are damaged or destroyed 
 you still have a way to detour the wreckage you can still remember my name  
 so we can be resilient to the presence of alzheimer 's pathology through the recruitment
  and we create these pathways  this cognitive reserve  by learning new things
 ideally we want these new things to be as rich in meaning as possible recruiting sight and sound and associations and emotion  
 so this really doesn 't mean doing crossword puzzles you don 't want to simply retrieve information you 've already
  because this is like traveling down old familiar streets cruising neighborhoods you already know 
 you want to pave new neural roads  
 building an alzheimer 's resistant brain means learning to speak italian meeting new friends  reading a book or listening to a great ted talk  
 and if despite all of this you are someday diagnosed with alzheimer
  there are three lessons i 've learned from my grandmother and the dozens of people i 've come to know living with this disease  
 diagnosis doesn 't mean you 're dying tomorrow  keep living 
 you won 't lose your emotional memory you 'll still be able to understand love and joy 
 you might not remember what i said five minutes ago  but you 'll remember how i made you feel  
 and you are more than what you can remember
