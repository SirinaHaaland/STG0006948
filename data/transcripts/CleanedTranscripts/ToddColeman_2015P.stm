  she 's on bed rest at the hospital being monitored for her preterm contractions  
  she doesn 't look the happiest 
 that 's in part because it requires technicians and experts to apply these clunky belts on her to monitor her uterine contractions 
 another reason jane is not so happy
 is because she 's worried in particular she 's worried about what happens after her 10 day stay on bed rest at the hospital 
 what happens when she 's home if she were to give birth this early it would be devastating  as an
  woman she 's twice as likely to have a premature birth
 or to have a stillbirth  
 so jane basically has one of two options  stay at the hospital on bed rest 
 a prisoner to the technology until she gives birth 
 and then spend the rest of her life paying for the bill or
 head home after her 10 day stay and hope for the best
  neither of these two options seems appealing  
 as i began to think about stories like this and hear about stories like this i began to ask myself and imagine is there an alternative 
 is there a way we could have the benefits of 
 monitoring that we get with our trusted partners in the hospital while someone is at home living their daily life with that in mind  i encouraged
  people in my research group to partner with some
 clever material scientists  and all of us came together and brainstormed  
 and after a long process we came up with a vision an idea of a wearable system that perhaps you could wear like a piece of jewelry
 or you could apply to yourself like a band aid and after many trials and
  we were able to come up with this flexible electronic patch that was manufactured using the same processes that they use to build computer chips  
 except the electronics are transferred from a semiconductor wafer onto a flexible material that can interface with the human body 
 these systems are about the thickness of a human hair  
 they can measure
 the types of information that we want things such as
  bodily movement  
 bodily temperature  electrical rhythms of the body and so forth 
 we can also engineer these systems so they can integrate energy sources  
 and can have wireless transmission capabilities 
 so as we began to to build these types of systems we began to test them on ourselves in our research group  but in addition we began to
  reach out to some of our clinical partners in san diego and test these on different patients in different clinical conditions  including
 like jane here is a picture of a pregnant woman in labor at our university hospital
 being monitored for her uterine contractions with the conventional
  in addition our flexible electronic patches are there 
 this picture demonstrates  waveforms pertaining to the fetal heart rate  where the red corresponds to what was acquired with the conventional belts and 
  the blue corresponds to our estimates using our flexible electronic systems and our algorithms 
  some of the things we had imagined were beginning to come to fruition and we were actually seeing this in a clinical context 
 but there was still a problem the problem was the way we manufactured these systems
 was very inefficient had low yield and was very  error prone in addition  as we talked to some of the nurses in the hospital they encouraged us
 to make sure that our electronics
 worked with typical medical adhesives that are used in a hospital  we had an epiphany
 and said wait a minute  
 rather than just making them work with adhesives  let 's integrate them into adhesives  and that could solve our manufacturing problem 
 this picture that you see here is our ability to embed these censors inside of a piece of scotch tape
 by simply peeling it off of a wafer  ongoing work in our research group allows us to in addition
  integrated circuits into the flexible adhesives to do things like amplifying signals and digitizing them processing them and encoding for wireless transmission 
 all of this integrated into the same medical adhesives that are used in the hospital 
 so when we reached this point  we had some other challenges from both an engineering as well as a usability perspective
  to make sure that we could make it used practically 
 in many digital health discussions people believe in and embrace the idea that we can simply digitize the data 
 wirelessly transmit it send it to the cloud  and in the cloud we can extract meaningful information for interpretation 
 and indeed you
 can do all of that if you 're not worried about some of the energy challenges 
 think about jane for a moment  she doesn 't live in palo alto  nor does she live in beverly hills
 what that means is we have to be mindful about her data plan and how much it would cost for her to be sending out a continuous stream of data 
 there 's another challenge that not everyone in the medical profession is comfortable talking about 
 and that is that jane does not have the most trust in the medical establishment 
 she
 people like her her ancestors have not had the best experiences at the hands of doctors
 and the hospital
 or insurance companies 
 that means that we have to be mindful of questions of privacy jane might not feel that happy about all that data being processed into the cloud  
 and jane
 cannot be fooled she reads the news she knows that if the
  government can be hacked  if the fortune five hundred can be hacked  so can her doctor  
 and so with that in mind  we had an epiphany 
 we cannot outsmart all the hackers in the world  but perhaps we can present them a smaller target  
 what if we could actually  rather than have those algorithms that do data interpretation run in the cloud
  if we have those algorithms run on those small integrated circuits embedded into those adhesives  
 and so when we integrate these things together what this means is that now we can think about the future
 where someone like jane can still go about living her normal daily life  
 she can be monitored it can be done in a way where she doesn 't have to get another job to pay her data plan and we can also address some of her
  concerns about privacy 
 so at this point  we 're feeling very good about ourselves  we 've accomplished this we 've begun to address some of these questions about privacy and we feel like
  pretty much the chapter is closed now  everyone lived happily ever after right  
 well not so fast
  one of the things we have to remember as i mentioned earlier is that jane does not have the most trust in the medical establishment we have to remember
 that there are increasing and widening health disparities  and there 's inequity in terms of proper care management  
 and so what that means is that this simple picture of jane and her data even with her being comfortable being wirelessly transmitted to the cloud  letting a doctor intervene if necessary is not the whole story
  do is to think about ways to have
 trusted parties serve as intermediaries between people like jane and her health care providers for example we 've begun to partner with churches
 and to think about nurses that are church members that come from that trusted community as patient advocates and health coaches to people like jane 
 another thing we have going for us is that insurance companies
  increasingly are attracted to some of these ideas 
 they 're increasingly realizing that perhaps it 's better to pay one dollar now for a wearable device and a health coach  
 rather than paying ten dollars later 
 when that baby is born prematurely and ends up in the neonatal intensive care unit
 one of the most expensive parts of a hospital this has been a long learning process for us
 this iterative process of breaking through and attacking one problem and not feeling totally comfortable and identifying the next problem has helped us go along this path
  of actually trying to not only innovate with this technology but make sure it can be used for people who perhaps need it the most 
  accelerating rate  we have to remember that human beings are using this technology and we have to be mindful
 that these human beings they have a face they have a name
 and a life and in the case of jane
