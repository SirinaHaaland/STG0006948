  image got do
 with it  and i must say i think emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages because i 'm going to keep harping on some of the issues
 that have come up but i 'm going to try and do something different and
  close the loop
 with some of my personal stories and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we 've been talking about 
 so africa is a complex continent full of contradictions as you can see 
 we 're not the only ones 
 applause and you know it 's
  we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent just think about that 
 you know  and this is typically what we 've been talking about the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff now why is that
 a problem a typical disaster story  disease corruption  poverty  and some of you might be standing here thinking
  all you privileged people come here saying ' forget the poor people let 's focus on business and the markets and whatever ' 
 and they 're all there 's the eighty percent of africans who
 really need help and i want to tell you that this is my story  ok  and it 's the story of many of the africans who are here we
 start with poverty i didn 't grow up in the slums or anything that dire
  i know what it is to grow up without having money or being able to support family
 euvin was talking about bellwether signs
  the bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast you know
 when things were good  we had eggs and sausages when things were bad we had porridge
  and like many african families my parents could never save because they supported siblings  cousins
  you know  their parents 
 and things were always dicey  now when i was born they realized they had a pretty smart kid  and they didn 't want me to go to the neighborhood school which was free  
 and they adopted a very interesting approach to education which was they were going to take me to a school
  that they can barely afford 
 so they took me to a private  catholic  elementary school
  which set the foundation for what ended up being my career  and
 what happened was because they could afford it sometimes sometimes not i got kicked out pretty much every term
  you know  someone would come in with a list of the people who haven 't paid school fees and when they started getting pretty strict you had to leave until your school fees could be paid
  i remember thinking  i mean why don 't these guys just take me to a cheap school  because you know  
 as a kid you 're embarrassed and you 're sensitive and everyone knows you guys don 't have money  but they kept at it 
 and
 i now understand why they did what they did
  we have an entrance exam to go into high school  
 and there 's national schools which are like the best schools and provincial schools 
 my dream school at that time was kenya high school a national school  i missed the cutoff by one point  
 and i was so disappointed  and i was like oh my god  you know what am i going to do and
 my father said ok listen let 's go and try and talk to the headmistress you know it 's just one point i mean  maybe she 'll let you in if
  that slot 's still there so we went to the school  
 and because we were nobodies  and because we didn 't have privilege and because
 my father didn 't have the right last name  
 he was treated like dirt  and i sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him saying you know who do you think you are and
  joking if you think you can get a slot  
 and i had gone to school with other girls who were kids of politicians and who had done much much worse than i did  and they had slots there  
 and there 's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated
 in front of you  you know  and
 we left and i swore to myself and i was like i 'm never ever going to have to beg for anything in my life they called me two weeks later
  can come now and i told them to stuff it 
 final story and i sort of have to speak quickly  
 disease  my father who i 've been talking about died of aids in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine 
 he never told anyone that he had aids his fear of the stigma was so strong  and i 'm pretty much the one who figured it
  out because i was a nerd and i was in the states at the time and they called me he was very sick  the first time he got sick  
 and he had cryptococcal meningitis  
 and so i went on to google cryptococcal meningitis  you know because of doctor patient privilege they couldn 't really tell us what was going on  but they were like you know this
  when i went online and looked at the infectious
 read about the disease i pretty much realized what was going on 
 the first time he got sick he recovered  
 but what happened was that he had to be on medication that at that time diflucan which in the states is used for yeast infections
 cost thirty dollars a pill he had to be on that pill for the rest of his life
  so money ran out he got sick again  and
 up until that time he had a friend who used to travel to india and he used to import
 bring him could get him a generic version of it and that kept him going but the money ran out
 he got sick again
 he got sick on a friday
  only one bank that had atms in kenya  and we could not
 get cash the family couldn 't get cash for him to start the treatment
 until monday the hospital put him on a water drip for three days 
 and finally we figured well ok we 'd better just try and take him to a public hospital at least he 'll get treated while we try to figure out the
  and he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him  and you know  now imagine if and i could go on and on
 imagine if this is all you know about me how would you look at me 
 with pity  you know  sadness  
 and this is how you look at africa  this is the damage it causes you don 't see the other side of me  you don 't see the
  blogger you don 't see the harvard educated lawyer the vibrant person  you know  and i just wanted to personalize that because we talk about it in big
 terms and you wonder you know so what but it 's
 damaging  and i 'm not unique right imagine if all you knew about william was the fact that he grew up in a
 poor village and you didn 't know about the windmill  you know
 and i was just moved i was actually crying during his presentation he was like i try and i make i was like nike should hire him you know just do it 
 and this is again the point i 'm trying to make when you focus just on the disasters
  what is to be done  first of all africans  we need to get better at telling our stories  we heard about that yesterday  we had some of them
 this morning  and this is an example you know blogging is
  doing that afrigator is an aggregator of african blogs that
 was developed in south africa  so we need to start getting better if no one else will tell our stories  let 's do it and going back to the point i was trying to make this is the swahili
 wikipedia swahili is spoken by about fifty million
 people in east africa it only has five contributors  four of them are white males
  the other person is ndesanjo if you 're here  stand up
 is a tanzanian [ the ] first swahili
 blogger  he 's the only african who 's contributing to this people  please we can 't whine
 and complain the west is doing this  what are we doing where are the rest of the swahili speakers  why are we not generating our own
  's not enough to complain we need to act
  reuters now integrates african blogs into their coverage of africa so that 's a start and we 've heard of all their other initiatives the
 cheetah generation the aid approach  you know  is flawed  and after all the hoopla of live eight  we 're still not anywhere in the picture no
  the point i 'm trying to make though is that it 's not enough for us to criticize  and
 for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should i be should i move back should i stay  you know 
  and i can 't emphasize that enough  you know  i walked away from a job with
 one of the top firms in d c covington and burling six figures with two paychecks or three paychecks i could solve a lot of my family 's problems
  but i walked away from that because my passion was here and because i wanted to do things that were fulfilling  and because i 'm needed here  you know
  probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a harvard law school degree because of all the things i 'm doing
 one is because i 'm pretty aggressive and i try and find you know opportunities but there is such a need you know 
 i 'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called enablis
 that supports entrepreneurs in south africa we 're now moving into east africa  and we give them business development
  services as well as financing loan and equity i
 've also set up a project in kenya  and what we do is we track the performance of kenyan mps my partner m who 's a tech guru hacked wordpress it costs us like  twenty dollars a month just for hosting everything else on there is
 a labor of love we 've manually entered all the data there and you can get profiles of each mp questions
  asked in parliament  we have a comment function where people can ask their mps questions there are some mps who participate and come back and ask 
 and basically we started this because we were tired of complaining
 about our politicians you know  i believe that accountability stems from demand you 're not
 just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart  and we as africans need to start challenging our leaders what are they doing  you know they 're not going to change
 just
 out of nowhere so we need new policies we need where 's that coming from you know  another thing is that these leaders
 are a reflection of our society we talk about african governments like they 've been dropped from mars  
 you know  
 they come from us  and what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don 't like and how can we change that so mzalendo was
 one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable 
 where do we go from here  i believe in the power of ideas i believe in the power of sharing knowledge  and i 'd ask all of you when you leave here  
 please just share and keep the ideas that you 've gotten out of here going because it can make a difference the
 other thing
  i want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual i 've had lots of conversations about things i think
 need to be happening in africa people are like ok if you don 't do aid i 'm a bleeding heart liberal what can i do 
 and when i talk about my ideas they 're like bbut it 's not scalable  you know give me something i can do with paypal it 's
  and sometimes just taking an interest in the individual in the fellows you 've met  and the businesspeople you 've met 
 it can make a huge difference especially in africa because usually the individual in africa carries a lot of people behind them 
 practically i mean when i was a first year student in law school  my mom 's business had collapsed so i was supporting her my sister was struggling to get through undergrad
  i was helping her pay her tuition 
 my cousin ran out of school fees and she 's really smart  i was paying her school fees a cousin of mine died of aids left an orphan  so we said well what are we going to do with her  
 you know she 's now my baby sister  and because of the opportunities that were afforded to me i am able to lift all those people so don 't underestimate that 
 an example this man changed my life he 's a professor he 's now at vanderbilt
  undergrad professor mitchell seligson  
 and because of him i got into harvard law school  because he took an interest i was taking a class of his 
 and he was just like  this is an overeager student which we don 't normally get in the united states because everyone else is cynical and jaded
 he called me to his office and
  and to me at that time university i was at university of pitts for undergrad  and that was like heaven  ok because compared to what could have been in kenya
  and you know  i kind of like pittsburgh like that 's the dumbest reason i 've ever heard for applying to law school  and
 he took me under his wing and he encouraged me and he said look you can get into harvard you 're that good ok  and if they don 't admit you they
 're the ones who are messed up and he built me up you know  and this is just an illustration you can meet other individuals here
  just need a push that 's all i needed was a push to go to the next level
  basically i want to end with my vision for africa  you know
 a gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave
 the continent so that we can fulfill our potential you know my vision is that
  my daughter and any other african child being born today 
 can be whoever they want to be here  without having to leave  and
 they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born that 's one thing you americans take for
  that you can grow up  you know  not so good circumstances and you can move
  just because you are born in rural arkansas whatever that doesn 't define who you are for most africans
 today  where you live or where you were born and the circumstances under which you were born  determine
 the rest of your life  i would like to see that change and the change starts with us and as africans we need to take responsibility for our continent
