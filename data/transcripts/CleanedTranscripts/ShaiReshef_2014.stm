  would like to share with you
 a new model of higher education a
 model that once expanded can enhance the collective intelligence of millions of creative and motivated individuals that otherwise would be left behind
  look at the world  pick a place and focus on it you will find humans chasing higher education 
 let 's meet some of them 
 patrick  patrick was born in liberia to a family of twenty children 
 during the civil war  he and his family were forced
 to flee to nigeria there
 in spite of his situation  he graduated high school with nearly perfect grades  he wanted to continue to higher education  
 but due to his family living on the poverty line he was soon sent to south africa
 to work and send back money to feed his family patrick
 never gave up his dream of higher education  late at night
  after work  he surfed the net looking
 for ways to study meet debbie debbie is from florida 
 her parents didn 't go to college and neither did any of her siblings  debbie has worked all her life  
 pays taxes  supports
  herself month to month  proud of the american dream a dream that just won 't be complete without higher education  
 but debbie doesn 't have the savings
 for higher education  she can 't pay the tuition neither could she leave work 
 meet wael  wael is from syria  he 's experiencing firsthand
  fear and failure imposed on his country 
 he 's a big believer in education 
 he knew that if he could find an opportunity for higher education  an opportunity to get ahead of the rest  he has a better chance to survive in a world turned upside down 
 the higher education system
 failed
  exactly as it is failing
 millions of potential students millions that graduate high school millions that are qualified for higher education  
 millions that want to study yet cannot access it
 for various reasons  first  financial 
 universities are expensive  we all know it  in large parts of the world higher education is unattainable for
  an average citizen 
 this is probably the biggest problem facing our society 
 higher education stopped being a right for all and became a privilege for the few  
 second  cultural 
 students who are qualified for higher education can afford want to study cannot
  because it is not decent 
 it is not a place for a woman 
 this is the story of countless women in africa for example  prevented from higher education because of cultural barriers  
 and here comes the third reason  
 unesco stated that in two thousand and
  million students will be deprived of higher education  simply because there will not be enough seats
 to accommodate them to meet the demand 
 they will take a placement test they will pass it  but they still won 't have access because there are no places available 
 these are the reasons
 i founded
  to give an alternative to create an alternative to those who have no other an alternative that will be affordable
 and scalable an alternative that will disrupt
 the current education system and open the gates to higher education for every qualified student
 regardless
  of what they earn where they live or what society says about them  patrick debbie and wael
 are only three examples out of the one thousand seven hundred accepted students from one hundred and forty three countries 
 applause thank you 
 we didn 't need to reinvent the wheel  we just looked at what wasn 't working and
  used the amazing power of the internet to get around it  we set out to build a model
 that will cut down almost entirely the cost of higher education  
 and that 's how we did it  first  bricks and mortar cost money 
 universities have expenses that virtual universities
 don 't  we don 't need to pass these
  expenses on to our students  they don 't exist 
 we also don 't need to worry about capacity there are no limits of seats in virtual university 
 actually nobody needs to stand
 at the back of the lecture hall  textbooks are also something our students don 't need to buy by using open educational resources
 and the generosity of professors
 are putting their material up
 free and accessible  we don 't need to send our students to buy textbooks all of our materials come free 
 even professors the most expensive line in any university balance sheet come free to our students over three thousand of them 
  vice chancellors professors and academic advisers from top universities such as 
  yale berkeley and oxford  came on board to help our students  finally is our belief
 in peer to peer learning  
 we use this sound pedagogical model to encourage our students from all over the world to interact and study together 
 and also
 to reduce the
  time our professors need to labor over class assignments 
 if the internet has made us
 a global village this model can develop its future leadership  look how we do it  we only offer
 two programs business administration and computer science the
  programs most in demand worldwide the two programs that are likeliest to help our students find a job  
 when our students are accepted
 in a small classroom of twenty to thirty students to ensure that those who need
  they meet
 a new peer a whole new set of students from all over the world every week  when they go into the classroom they find
 the lecture notes of the week  the reading assignment the homework assignment and the discussion question which is the core of our studies  every week
  every student must contribute to the class discussion 
 and also must comment on the contribution of others this way  
 we open our students ' minds  we develop a positive shift in attitude
 toward different cultures 
 by the end of each week  
 the students take a quiz  hand in their homework  which are assessed by their peers under the supervision of the instructors 
 get a grade  move to the next week
  of the course  they take the final exam  get a grade and follow to the next course  
 we open the gates for higher education
 for every qualified student 
 every student with a high school diploma  
 sufficient english and internet connection can study with us  we don 't use audio  we don 't use video
 is not necessary any student from any part of the world with any internet connection can study with us we
 are tuition free 
 all we ask our students to cover is the cost of their exams one hundred dollars per exam  a full time bachelor 's degree student
 taking forty courses will pay one thousand dollars a
  thousand dollars for the entire degree and for those who cannot afford even this 
 we offer them a variety of scholarships it is our mission that nobody will be left behind for financial reasons 
 with five thousand students in two thousand and sixteen  this model is financially sustainable 
 five years ago
  it was a vision 
 today it is a reality  
 last month  we got the ultimate academic endorsement to our model university of the people is now fully accredited
  up we have demonstrated that our model works 
 i invite universities and even more important developing countries ' governments to replicate this model
 to ensure that the gates of higher education will open widely a new era is coming
 an era
  that will witness
 the disruption of the higher education model as we know it today from being a privilege for the few
 to becoming a basic right affordable and accessible for all thank you
