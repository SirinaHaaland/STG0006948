  a very old magazine i found this observation test
 about the story of the ark 
 and the artist that drew this observation test did some errors had some mistakes there are more or less twelve
 mistakes some of them are very easy there is a funnel 
 an aerial part a lamp and clockwork key on the ark  some of them are about the animals the number  but there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that 's not reported here  
 and this problem is 
  now we have god that is going to submerge earth
 permanently or at least for a very long period  and no one is taking care of plants
 noah needed to take two of every kind of bird of every kind of animal of every kind of creature that moves  but no mention about plants
  why 
 in another part of the same story all the living creatures
 are just the living creatures that came out
  from the ark  so birds livestock and wild animals 
 plants are not living creatures this is the point that is a point that is not coming out from
 the bible but it 's something that really accompanied humanity  let 's have a look at this nice
 code that is coming from a renaissance book here we have the description
  of the order of nature  it 's a nice description because it 's starting from left you have the stones
 immediately after the stones the plants that are just able to live we have the animals that are able to live and to sense  
 and on the top of the pyramid  there is the man this is not the common man
  is quite comforting for people like me i 'm a professor
 this to be over there on the top of creation but it 's something completely wrong  
 you know very well about professors but it 's also wrong about plants  
 because plants are not just able to live they are able to
  they are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals just to give you an example every single root apex
 is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least fifteen different chemical and physical parameters 
 and they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and
 complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence well
  this is something this underestimation of plants is something that is
 always with us 
 let 's have a look at this short movie now we have david attenborough  now david attenborough is really a plant lover 
 he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior now  when he speaks about plants
  to remove the fact that plants exist  
 the blue whale  the biggest creature that exists on the planet that is wrong  completely wrong  the blue whale  it 's a dwarf
 if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet that is this wonderful
  this is a living organism that has a mass of at least two thousand tons  now  the story that plants are some  low level organisms has been formalized
 many times ago by aristotle that in de anima that is a very influential book for the western civilization wrote that
 the plants are on the edge
 between living and not living  they have just a kind of very low level soul  it 's called the vegetative soul
 because they lack movement  and so they don 't need to sense  
 let 's see okay some of the movements of the plants are very well known this is
  very fast movement this is a dionaea a venus fly trap hunting snails sorry for the snail 
 this has been something that has been refused for centuries despite the evidence 
 no one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal  because it was against the order of nature  
 but plants are also able to to show a lot of movement some of them are very well known like the flowering it 's just a question to
  to use some techniques like the time lapse some of them are much more sophisticated look at this young
 bean that is moving to catch the light every time and it 's really so graceful it 's like a dancing angel  
 they are also able to play
 they are really
  and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing  they are training themselves 
 as many young animals do to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day  
 they are able to respond to gravity of course so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the
  vector of gravity  but they are also able to sleep  this is one mimosa pudica  so during the night they curl the leaves
 and reduce the movement and during the day you have the opening of the leaves there is much more movement  this is interesting because
 this sleeping machinery
  it 's perfectly conserved it 's the same in plants in insects and in animals 
 and so if you need to study this sleeping problem it 's easy to study on plants for example
  than in animals  and it 's much more easy even ethically it 's a kind of vegetarian
 experimentation plants are
 even able to communicate they are extraordinary communicators they communicate with other plants  they are able to
  distinguish kin and non kin they communicate with plants of other species
 and they communicate with animals
 by producing chemical volatiles 
 for example during the pollination now with the pollination it 's a very serious issue for plants because they move the pollen from one flower to the other yet they cannot move from one flower to the other so they need a vector
 and this vector
  normally an animal many insects have been used by plants
 as vectors for the transport of the pollination but not just insects even birds reptiles  and mammals like bats rats
 are normally used for the transportation of the pollen  this is a serious business we have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of
 sweet substance very energizing having in change this transportation of the pollen but some plants are manipulating animals like in the case of orchids 
  that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen
 to do this without a brain we need to wait until one thousand eight hundred and eighty when
 this big man charles darwin  publishes a
 wonderful astonishing book that starts a revolution  the title is the power of movement in plants no one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before charles darwin 
 in his book  
 assisted by his son
  francis who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world in cambridge
 they took into consideration every single movement for five hundred pages and in the last paragraph of the book
 it 's a kind of stylistic mark because normally charles darwin stored in the last paragraph of of a book  the most important
  it 's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical
 acts like the brain of one of the lower animals this is not a metaphor 
 he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was j d hooker or at that
 time president of the royal society so the maximum scientific authority in britain speaking
  about the brain in the plants now  this is a root apex
 growing against a slope  
 so you can recognize this kind of movement the same movement that worms snakes and every animal that are moving
 on the ground without legs is able to display 
 and it 's not an easy movement because to have this kind of movement you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having
  a brain  so we studied
 the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here  depicted in blue that is called the transition zone and this region it 's a very small region it 's less than one millimeter  
 and in this small region you have
 the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important you have
 kinds of signals here  
 the signals that you are seeing here are action potential are the same signals that the neurons of my brain of our brain use to to exchange information 
 now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of
  but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant like a plant of rye  we have almost fourteen million roots 
 we have eleven and a half million root apex and a total length of six hundred or more kilometers and
 a very high surface area now let 's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with
  have on the left the internet
 and on the right the root apparatus they work in the same way they are a network
 of small computing machines working in networks and why are they so similar 
 because they evolved for the same reason 
 to survive predation 
  they work in the same way  so you can remove ninety percent of the root apparatus and the plants [ continue ] to work you can remove ninety percent of the internet and
  to work so a suggestion for the people working with networks plants
  possibility let 's imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants  until now 
 the man
 was inspired just by man or the animals in producing 
 we have the animaloid
  but why have we not
 any plantoid well if you want to fly  it 's good that you look at birds to be inspired by birds but if you want
 to explore soils or if you want to colonize
  best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this 
 we have another possibility we are working [ on ] in our lab [ which ] is to build hybrids  it 's much more easy to build hybrids hybrid means it 's
 something that 's half living and half machine it 's much more easy to work with plants than with animals  
  they have electrical signals the connection with the machine is much more easy much more even ethically
 possible
 and these are three possibilities that we are working on
 to build
 hybrids  driven by algae or by the leaves at the end by the most most powerful parts of the plants by the
 roots  well  thank you for your attention
  attention and before i finish i would like to reassure that no snails were harmed in making this presentation  thank you
