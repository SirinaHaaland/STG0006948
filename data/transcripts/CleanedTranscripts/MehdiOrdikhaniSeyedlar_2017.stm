  paying close attention to something  not that easy is it it
 's because our attention is pulled in so many different directions at a time  and it 's in fact pretty impressive if
  stay focused many people think that attention is all about what we are focusing on  but it 's also about what information
 our brain is trying to filter out 
 there are two ways you direct your attention  
 first there 's overt attention  in overt attention  you move your eyes towards something in order to pay attention to it 
  then there 's covert attention in covert attention  
 you pay attention to something  but without moving your eyes  think of driving for a second 
 your overt attention  your direction of the eyes are in front
 but that 's your covert attention which is constantly scanning the surrounding area  
 where you don 't actually look at
  i 'm a computational neuroscientist and i work on cognitive brain machine interfaces or bringing together the brain and the computer 
 i love brain patterns brain patterns are important for us because based on them we can build models for the computers and based on these models computers can recognize how well our brain functions 
 and if it doesn 't function well  
 then these computers themselves can be used as assistive
 devices
 for therapies  but that also means something 
 because choosing the wrong patterns will give us the wrong models and therefore the wrong therapies right 
 in case of attention  the fact that we can
 shift our attention not only by our eyes but also by thinking that
  makes covert attention an interesting model for computers  so i wanted to know what are the brainwave patterns when you look
 overtly or when you look covertly 
 i set up an experiment for that 
 in this experiment there are two flickering squares one of them flickering at a slower rate than the other one 
 depending on which of these flickers you are
  paying attention to certain parts of your brain will start resonating in the same rate
 as that flickering rate so by analyzing your brain signals  we can track where exactly you are watching
 or you are paying attention to 
 so to see what happens in your brain when you pay overt attention  i asked people
  to look directly in one of the squares and pay attention to it in this case not surprisingly we saw that
 these flickering squares appeared in their brain signals which was coming from the back of their head 
 which is responsible for the processing of your visual information 
  was really interested to see what happens in your brain when you pay covert attention  
 so this time i asked people to look in the middle of the screen and without moving their eyes 
 to pay attention to either of these squares 
 when we did that we saw that both of these flickering rates appeared in their brain signals  but interestingly 
 only one of them which was paid attention to had stronger signals
  so there was something in the brain which was handling this information so that thing in the brain was basically the activation of the frontal area 
 the front part of your brain is responsible for higher cognitive functions as a human the frontal
  it seems that it works as a filter
 trying to let information come in only from the right flicker that you are paying attention to
 and trying to inhibit the information coming from the ignored one 
 the filtering ability of the brain is indeed a key for attention which is missing in some people
  a person with adhd cannot
 inhibit these distractors and that 's why they can 't focus for a long time on a single task  
 but what if this person could
 play a specific computer game with his brain connected to the computer and then train his own
  is just one example  we can use these cognitive brain machine interfaces for many other cognitive fields 
 it was just a few years ago that
 my grandfather had a stroke and he lost complete ability to speak he could
  understand everybody but there was no way to respond even not writing because he was illiterate  
 so he passed away in silence 
 i remember thinking at that time what if we could
 have a computer which could speak for him  now after years that i am in this field i can see that this might be
  imagine if we can find brainwave patterns when people think about images or even letters  
 like the letter a generates a different brainwave pattern than the letter b and so on 
 could a computer one day communicate for people who can 't speak 
 what if a computer
 can help us understand the thoughts of a person in a coma we are not there yet
 pay close attention  we will be there soon
