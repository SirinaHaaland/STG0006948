  have you ever been asked by your chinese friend what is your zodiac sign 
 don 't think they are making small talk if you say i 'm a monkey they immediately know you are either
  polite way of asking your age 
 by revealing your zodiac sign you are also being evaluated 
 judgments are being made about your fortune or misfortune your personality career prospects and how you will do in a given year 
 if you share you and your partner 's animal signs they will paint a picture in their mind about your private life 
 maybe you don 't believe in the chinese zodiac
 as a quarter of the world population is influenced by it you 'd be wise to do something about that 
 so what is the chinese zodiac exactly 
 most westerners think of greco roman zodiac  the signs divided into twelve months the
 chinese zodiac is different it 's a 12 year cycle labeled with animals  starting with a rat and ending with a pig and
 no association with constellations for example if you were born in one thousand nine 
 you are a rabbit  can you see your zodiac sign there 
 our chinese ancestors constructed a very complicated theoretical framework based on yin and yang  
 the five elements and the twelve zodiac animals 
 over thousands of years
  culture has affected people 's major decisions such as naming  marriage  giving birth
 and attitude towards each other and some of the implications are quite amazing the
 chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others  
 so parents choose specific years to give birth to babies because they believe the team
  effort by the right combination of animals can give prosperity to families 
 we even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations  i 'm a pig  i should have perfect romance with tigers
 goats and rabbits 
 chinese people believe some animals are natural
  i need to be careful with a snake  raise your hand if you are a snake let 's have a chat later 
 we believe some animals are luckier than the others  such as the dragon 
 unlike the western tradition the chinese dragon is a symbol for power  strength and wealth it 's everyone 's dream to have a dragon baby  
 jack ma 's parents must have been very proud and they are not the only ones
 in two thousand and twelve the year of the dragon the birthrate in china hong kong and taiwan increased by five percent 
 that means another one million more babies 
 with a traditional preference to baby boys the boy girl ratio that year was one hundred and twenty to one hundred 
 when those dragon boys grow up they will face much more severe competition in
  love and job markets  
 according to the bbc and the chinese government 's press release
 january two thousand and fifteen saw a peak of cesarean sections  
 why  
 that was the last month for the year of the horse it 's not because they like horses so much it
 's because they try to avoid having unlucky goat babies
  goat  please don 't feel bad those are goat babies they don 't look like losers to me 
 tiger is another undesirable animal due to its volatile temperament 
 many chinese regions saw a sharp decline of birthrate during those years  
 perhaps
 one should consider zodiac in reverse as those tiger and goat babies will face much less
  competition  maybe they are the lucky ones  
 i went through the forbes top three hundred richest people in the world 
 and it 's interesting to see the most undesirable two animals  the goat and tiger are at the top of the chart even higher than the dragon
  so maybe we should consider maybe it 's much better to have less competition
  one last but interesting point many chinese people make their investment decisions based on the zodiac sign index  
 although the belief and tradition of the zodiac sign has been over thousands of years  
 the trend of using it in making major decisions did not really happen until the past few decades  our ancestors were very busy
  poverty  drought famine riot disease and civil war and finally chinese people have the time  
 wealth and technology to create an ideal life they 've always wanted  
 the collective decision made by one point three billion people has caused the fluctuation in
  from health care and education to property and consumer goods  
 as china plays such an important role in the global economy and geopolitics 
 the decisions made based on the zodiac and other chinese traditions end up
 impacting everyone around the world 
 are there any monkeys here two thousand and sixteen is the year of the monkey monkeys are clever curious
