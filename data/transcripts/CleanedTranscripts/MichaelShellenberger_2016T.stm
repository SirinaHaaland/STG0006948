  have you heard the news  we 're in a clean energy revolution and where i live in berkeley california it seems like every day i see a new roof
 with new solar panels going up electric car in the
  germany sometimes gets half its power from solar and india is now committed to building ten times more solar than we have in california  by the year 
 even nuclear seems to be making a comeback  bill gates is
 in china working with engineers there 's forty different companies that are working together to try to race to build the first reactor that runs on waste that can 't melt down and is cheaper than coal  
 and so
 you might start to ask
 is this whole global warming problem going to be a lot easier to solve than anybody imagined 
 that was the question we wanted to know so my colleagues and i decided to take a deep dive into the data  
 we were a little skeptical of some parts of the clean energy revolution story  but what we found really surprised us the first thing is that clean energy has been increasing this is electricity from clean energy sources over the last twenty
 but when you look at the percentage of global electricity from clean energy sources  it 's actually been in decline from thirty six percent to thirty one percent and 
 if you care about climate change you 've got to go in the opposite direction to one hundred percent of our electricity from clean energy sources as quickly as possible
  how much could five percentage points of global electricity be 
 well it turns out to be quite a bit it 's the equivalent of sixty nuclear plants the size of diablo canyon california 's last nuclear plant or nine hundred 
  solar farms the size of topaz  which is one of the biggest solar farms in the world and certainly our biggest in california  a big part of this is simply that fossil fuels are increasing faster than clean energy and that 's understandable there 's just a lot
  of poor countries that are still using wood and dung and charcoal as their main source of energy and they need modern fuels  but there 's something else going on which is that one of those 
  clean energy sources in particular has actually been on the decline in absolute terms not just relatively  and that 's nuclear you can see its generation has declined seven percent over the last ten years now
  solar and wind have been making huge strides so you hear a lot of talk about how it doesn 't really matter because solar and wind is going to make up the difference  
 but the data says something different when you combine all the electricity from solar and wind you see it actually barely makes up half of the decline from nuclear
  let 's take a closer look in the united states over the last couple of years really two thousand and thirteen two thousand and fourteen
  we prematurely retired four nuclear power plants they were almost entirely replaced with fossil fuels  and so the consequence was that we wiped out almost as much clean energy electricity that we get from solar 
 and it 's not unique to us people think of california as a clean
  energy and climate leader but when we looked at the data what we found is that in fact california reduced emissions more slowly than the national average between two thousand and two thousand and fifteen 
 what about germany they 're doing a lot of clean energy  
 but when you look at the data  german emissions have actually been going up since two thousand and nine and there 's really not anybody who 's going to tell you that they 're going to meet their climate commitments in two thousand and twenty 
 the reason isn 't hard to understand solar and wind provide power about ten to twenty percent of the time
  which means that when the sun 's not shining the wind 's not blowing you still need power for your hospitals your homes your cities your factories  
 and while batteries have made some really cool improvements lately  the truth is they 're just never going to be as efficient as the electrical grid  every time you put electricity into a battery and take it out you lose about
  to forty percent of the power 
 that 's why when in california  we try to deal with all the solar we 've brought online we now get about ten percent of electricity from solar
 when the sun goes down and people come home from work and turn on their air conditioners and their tv sets and every other appliance in the house  we need a lot of natural gas backup so what we 've been doing is stuffing a lot of natural gas into the side of a mountain
  and that worked pretty well for a while but then late last year it sprung a leak 
 this is aliso canyon  so much methane gas was released it was the equivalent of putting half a million cars on the road it basically blew through all of our climate commitments for the year well
 what about india sometimes you have to go places to really get the right data  so we traveled to india a few months ago we met with all the top officials solar nuclear the rest and what they told us is
  actually having more serious problems than both germany and california  we don 't have backup  we don 't have all the natural gas  and
 that 's just the start of it say we want to get to one hundred gigawatts by two thousand and twenty two but last year we did just five and the year before that we did five so let 's just take a 
  closer look at nuclear the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change has looked at the carbon content of all these
  different fuels and nuclear comes out really low it 's actually lower even than solar 
 and nuclear obviously provides a lot of power twenty four hours a day seven days a week  during a year a single plant can provide power ninety two percent of the time 
 what 's interesting is that when you look at countries that have deployed different kinds of clean energies
  there 's only a few that have done so at a pace consistent with dealing with the climate crisis  so nuclear seems like a pretty good option but there 's this big problem with it which all of you i 'm sure are aware of which is that people really don 't like it 
 there was a study a survey done of people around the world not just in the united states or europe 
 about a year and a half ago and what they found is that nuclear is actually one of the least popular forms of energy even oil is more popular than nuclear and
  nuclear kind of edges out coal the thing is people don 't really fear coal in the same way they fear nuclear which really operates on our unconscious  so what is it that we fear 
 there 's really three things there 's the safety of the plants themselves the fears that they 're going to melt down and cause damage there 's the waste from them and there 's the association with
  and i think  understandably engineers look at those concerns and look for technological fixes  that 's why bill gates is in china developing advanced reactors that 's why forty different entrepreneurs are working on 
  this problem and i myself have been very excited about it we did a report how to make nuclear cheap in particular the thorium reactor shows a lot of promise  so when the climate scientist james hansen asked if i wanted to go to china with him
  and look at the chinese advanced nuclear program  i jumped at the chance  we were there with mit and uc berkeley engineers  
 and i had in my mind that the chinese would be able to do with nuclear what they did with so many other things start to crank out small nuclear reactors on assembly lines 
  ship them up like iphones or macbooks and send them around the world i would get one at home in berkeley
  the presentations were all very exciting and very promising they have multiple reactors that they 're working on 
 the time came for the thorium reactor and a bunch of us were excited  they went through the whole presentation they got to the timeline  
 and they said we 're going to have a thorium molten salt reactor
 ready for sale to the world by
  that up a little bit  because we 're in a little bit of a climate crisis right now  and your cities are really polluted by the way 
 and they responded back they were like i 'm not sure what you 've heard about our thorium program but we don 't have a third of our budget  and your department of energy hasn 't been particularly forthcoming with all that data you guys have on testing
  i 've got an idea you know how you 've got ten years where you 're demonstrating that reactor 
 let 's just skip that part and let 's just go right to commercializing it that will save money and time 
 and the engineer just looked at me and said let me ask you a question would you buy a car that had never been demonstrated before 
 so what about the other reactors there 's a reactor that 's coming online
  they 're starting to sell it it 's a high temperature gas reactor it can 't melt down
  but it 's really big and bulky that 's part of the safety  and nobody thinks it 's going to ever get cheaper than the reactors that we have 
 the ones that use waste as fuel are really cool ideas but the truth is we don 't actually know how to do that yet  there 's some risk that you 'll actually make more waste  and most people think 
  that if you 're including that waste part of the process it 's just going to make the whole machine a lot more expensive it 's just adding another
  complicated step 
 the truth is 
 there 's real questions about how much of that we 're going to do i mean  we went to india and asked about the nuclear program the government said before the paris climate talks that they were going to do something like 
  thirty new nuclear plants  but when we got there and interviewed people and even looked at the internal documents they 're now saying they 're going to do about five  and in most of the world especially the
  rich world they 're not talking about building new reactors we 're actually talking about taking reactors down before their lifetimes are over germany 's actually pressuring its neighbors to do that i 
  mentioned the united states we could lose half of our reactors over the next fifteen years  which would wipe out forty percent of the emissions reductions we 're supposed to get under the clean power plan of course in japan they took all their nuclear plants offline replaced them with coal
  gas oil burning  and they 're only expected to bring online about a third to to two thirds so when we went through the numbers and just added that up how much nuclear do 
  we see china and india bringing online over the next fifteen years how much do we see at risk of being taken offline this was the most startling finding what we found is that the world is actually at risk of losing four
  times more clean energy than we lost over the last ten years in other words we 're not in a clean energy revolution we 're in a clean energy crisis  
 so it 's understandable that engineers would look for a technical fix to the fears that people have of nuclear but when you consider that these are big challenges to
  that they 're going to take a long time to solve there 's this other issue which is are those technical fixes really going to solve people 's fears let
 's take safety 
 you know  despite what people think it 's hard to figure out how to make nuclear power much safer i mean every medical journal that looks at it this is the most recent study from the british 
  journal lancet one of the most respected journals in the world nuclear is the safest way to make reliable power
  everybody 's scared of the accidents so you go look at the accident data
 fukushima chernobyl the world health organization finds the same thing  the vast majority of harm is caused by people panicking  and they 're panicking because 
  they 're afraid in other words  the harm that 's caused isn 't actually caused by the machines or the radiation 
  everyone worries about the waste well the interesting thing about the waste is how little of it there is this is just from one plant 
 if you take all the nuclear waste we 've ever made in the united states put it on a football field stacked it up it would only reach twenty feet high  and people say it 's
  poisoning people or doing something it 's not it 's just sitting there it 's just being monitored there 's not very much of it by contrast the waste that we don 't control from energy
  and it kills seven million people a year and it 's threatening very serious levels of global warming  and the truth is that even if we get good at using that waste as fuel there 's always going to be 
  some fuel left over that means there 's always going to be people that think it 's a big problem for reasons that maybe don 't have as much to do with the actual waste as we think 
 decide to go get a weapon in fact
 it works the opposite 
 what we find is the only way we know how to get rid large numbers of nuclear weapons is by using the plutonium in the warheads as fuel in our nuclear power plants  
  and so if you are wanting to get the world rid of nuclear weapons  then we 're going to need a lot more nuclear power
  as i was leaving china  the engineer that brought bill gates there kind of pulled me aside and he said you know 
 michael i appreciate your interest in all the different nuclear supply technologies  but there 's this more basic issue which is that there 's just not enough global demand  i 
  mean  we can crank out these machines on assembly lines we do know how to make things cheap but there 's just not enough people that want them
 let 's do solar and wind and efficiency and conservation let 's accelerate the advanced nuclear programs i think we should triple the amount of money we 're spending on it but
 i just think the most important thing 
 if we 're going to overcome the climate crisis is to keep in mind that the cause of the clean energy crisis
 isn 't from within our machines  it 's from within ourselves  thank you very much
