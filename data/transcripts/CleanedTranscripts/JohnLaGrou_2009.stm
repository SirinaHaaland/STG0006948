  the smoke alarm
 has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide but smoke alarms don 't prevent fires every year in the usa
  over twenty thousand are killed or injured with three hundred and fifty thousand home fires and one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity 
 what if we could prevent electrical fires before they start well a couple of friends and i figured out how to do this 
 so how does electricity ignite residential fires  well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical
  our invention had to address all of these issues  so what about circuit breakers  well thomas edison invented the circuit breaker in 
  technology and this is a problem because over eighty percent of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers 
 hmmm so we considered all of this and we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power
  receptacle itself any electrical device an appliance an extension cord whatever must be able to tell the power outlet hey power outlet i 'm drawing too much 
  current shut me off now before i start a fire and the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it so here is what we did 
  we put an inexpensive wireless data reader inside the receptacle so they could communicate  
 now every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network 
 the appliance 's safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug if too much current is flowing the intelligent receptacle turns
 itself off and prevents another fire from starting we call this technology efci electrical fault circuit interrupter  
 okay two more points  every year in the usa roughly two thousand five hundred children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles and this is crazy 
 an intelligent receptacle prevents injuries because the power is always off  until an intelligent plug is detected
  saving lives perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power is in its energy savings 
 this invention will reduce global energy consumption by allowing remote control and automation of every outlet in every home and business now you can choose to reduce your home energy bill by automatically cycling heavy loads like air
  hotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms from a central location or even a cell phone  there are ten billion electrical outlets in north america alone 
 the potential energy savings is very very significant
  thousands of lives
