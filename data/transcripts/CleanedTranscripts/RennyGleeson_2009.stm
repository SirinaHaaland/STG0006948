  what i wanted to talk to you
 about today is two things one 
 the rise of a culture of availability and two a request so we 're seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device
  across all social strata 
 we 're seeing along with that proliferation of mobile devices an expectation of availability and with that comes the third point which is obligation and an obligation to that availability and the problem is we 're still working through from a societal standpoint 
 how we allow people to be available 
 there 's a significant delta in fact between what we 're willing to accept apologies to hans rosling
 he said anything that 's not using real stats is a lie but the big delta
 how we deal with this from a public standpoint  so we 've developed certain tactics and strategies to to cover up 
 this first one 's called the lean and if you 've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting chicken you 're sitting there looking at the person waiting for them to look away and then quickly checking the device  
 although you can see the gentleman up on the right
  going to check my device but the guy  here on the right he 's doing the stretch it 's that
 reeeee e e each out the physical contortion to get that device just below the the tabletop  or my favorite the love you mean it 
 nothing says i love you like let me find somebody else i give a damn about 
  this one coming to us from india you can find this on youtube the gentleman who 's recumbent on a motorcycle while text messaging or what we call the 
 sweet gravy stop me before i kill again 
 that is actually the device  what this is doing is we find a a
 direct collision
 we find a direct collision between availability and what 's possible through availability and a fundamental
  human need which we 've been hearing about a lot actually the the need to create shared narratives 
 we 're very good at creating personal narratives but it 's the shared narratives that make us a culture 
 and when you 're standing with someone  and you 're on your mobile device  effectively what you 're saying to them is you are not as important as literally almost anything that could come to me through this device
  look around you there might be somebody on one right now participating in multi dimensional engagement 
 our reality right now is less interesting than the story we 're going to tell about it later
  this one i love this poor kid clearly a prop don 't get me wrong a willing prop but the kiss that 's being documented kind of looks like it sucks
  is the sound of one hand clapping  
 so as we lose the context
 of our identity  it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative becomes the context in which we live the stories that we tell 
 what we push out becomes who we are people aren 't simply projecting identity they 're creating it
