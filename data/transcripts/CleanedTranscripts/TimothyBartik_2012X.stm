  in this talk today i want to present a different idea
 for why investing in early childhood education
 makes sense as a public investment it 's a different idea because usually when people talk about early childhood programs they talk about all the wonderful
  benefits for participants in terms of
 former participants in preschool they have better k 12 test scores  better adult earnings now that 's all very important  
 but what i want to talk about is what preschool does
 for state economies and for promoting state economic development
  that 's actually crucial
 because if we 're going to get increased investment in early childhood programs  
 we need to interest state governments in this the federal government has a lot on its plate  
 and state governments are going to have to step up so we have to appeal to them the legislators in the state government and turn to something they understand that they have to
 promote the economic development
 of their state economy now by promoting economic development  i don 't mean anything magical all i mean is is that early childhood education
 can bring more and better jobs to a state
 and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings for the state 's residents now i think it 's fair to say that when people think about
 state and local economic
  they don 't generally think first about
 what they 're doing about childcare and early childhood programs  
 i know this i 've spent most of my career researching these programs i 've talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues a lot of legislators about these issues 
 when legislators and others think about economic development what they first of all think about are business tax incentives  property tax abatements
  a million of these programs all over the place  so for example states compete very vigorously to attract
 new auto plants or expanded auto plants they hand out all kinds of business tax breaks now those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions and the way they can make sense is by creating more and better jobs 
 they raise employment rates raise per capita earnings of state residents
  so there is a benefit to state residents that corresponds to the costs that they 're paying by paying for these business tax breaks 
 my argument is essentially that early childhood programs can do
 exactly the same thing  
 create more and better jobs  but in a different way  
 it 's a somewhat more indirect way  these programs can promote more and better jobs by  you build it
  you invest in high quality preschool it develops the skills of your local workforce if enough of them stick around 
 and in turn that higher quality local workforce will be a key driver
 of creating jobs and creating higher earnings per capita in the local community  now let me turn to some numbers on this  
 okay  if you look at the research evidence
 that 's extensive on how much early
  childhood programs affect the educational attainment wages and skills
 of former participants in preschool as adults  you take those known effects 
 you take how many of those folks will be expected to stick around the state or local economy and not move out 
 and you take research on how much skills
 drive job creation  you will conclude
  from these three separate lines of research that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs  
 the per capita earnings of state residents go up by two dollars and 
  a three to one return now you can get much higher returns of up to
  former preschool participants who move to some other state 
 but there 's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars because this is salient and important to state legislators and state policy makers and it 's the states that are going to have to act  
 so there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development  
  one objection you often hear or
 maybe you don 't hear it because people are too polite to say it is why should i pay more taxes
 to invest in other people 's children  what 's in it for me  
 and the trouble with that objection it reflects a total misunderstanding
 of how much local economies involve everyone being
  interdependent specifically the interdependency here is is that there are huge
 spillovers of skills that when other people 's children
 get more skills that actually increases the prosperity of everyone including people whose skills
  so for example  numerous research studies have shown if you look at what really drives
 the growth rate of metropolitan areas it 's not so much
 low taxes low cost low wages 
 it 's the skills of the area particularly the proxy for skills that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area  
 so when you look for example at metropolitan areas such as the boston area
  these areas are not doing well economically because they 're 
 if you ever tried to buy a house in silicon valley it 's not exactly a low cost proposition they are growing because
 they have high levels of skills  so when we invest in other people 's children and build up those skills we increase the overall
 job growth of a metro
  area as another example 
 if we look at what determines an individual 's wages 
 and we do statistical exploration of that what determines wages we know that the individual 's wages will depend in part 
 on that individual 's education 
 for example whether
  not they have a college degree  
 one of the very interesting facts is that in addition we find that even once we hold constant statistically  the effect of your own education  
 the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages  so specifically if 
 you hold constant your education you stick in percentage of college graduates in your
  you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages without changing your education at all in fact this effect is so strong
 that when someone gets a college degree  
 the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects  so if someone gets a college degree
  their lifetime earnings go up by a huge amount over seven hundred thousand dollars there 's an effect on everyone else in the metro area of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area  
 and if you add that up it 's a small effect for each person  but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area  you actually get
 that the increase in wages for everyone else in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars that 's actually greater than the direct benefits of the person choosing to get education
 what 's going on here what can explain these huge spillover effects of education well let 's think about it this way  i can be the most skilled person in the world  
 but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills 
 my employer is going to find it more difficult to introduce new technology new production techniques  
 so as a result  my employer is going to be less productive they will not be able to
  afford to pay me as good wages 
 even if everyone at my firm has good skills 
 if the workers at the suppliers to my firm do not have good skills 
 my firm is going to be less competitive competing in national and international markets  and again  
 the firm that 's less competitive will not be able to pay as good wages and then particularly in
  in high tech businesses  they 're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses so clearly the productivity of firms in silicon valley has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm 
 but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area  so as a result  if we can invest in other people 's children through
 preschool and other early childhood programs that are high quality we not only help those children we help everyone in the metropolitan area
 gain in wages and we 'll have the metropolitan area gain in job growth 
 another objection used sometimes here to invest in early childhood programs is concern about people moving out  
 so you know maybe ohio 's thinking about investing in more preschool education
  for
 children in columbus ohio but they 're worried that these little buckeyes will for some strange reason decide to move to ann arbor michigan and become wolverines  
 and maybe michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in ann arbor michigan and be worried these little wolverines will end up moving to ohio and becoming buckeyes and so they 'll both underinvest because everyone 's going to move out
  is if you look at the data americans aren 
  people sometimes assume the data is that over sixty percent of americans
 spend most of their working careers in the state they were born in over sixty percent that percentage does not vary much from state to
  it doesn 't vary much with the state 's economy whether it 's depressed or booming  it doesn 't vary much over time so
 the reality is if you invest in kids  
 they will stay or at least enough of them will stay
 that it will pay off for your state economy  okay so to sum up there is a lot of research evidence that early childhood programs  if run in a
 pay off in higher adult skills 
 there 's a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy 
 and there 's a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy 
 and if you calculate the numbers
 for each dollar
  we get about three dollars back in benefits for the state economy  so
 in my opinion the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling so what are the barriers to getting it done  
 well  one obvious barrier is cost so if you
 look at what it would cost if every state government invested
 in universal preschool at age four full day preschool at age four
  the total annual national cost would be roughly thirty billion dollars so thirty billion dollars is a lot of money 
 on the other hand if you reflect on
 that the u s ' s population is over three hundred million we 're talking about an amount of money that amounts to one hundred dollars
  hundred dollars per capita per person is something that any state government can afford to do 
 it 's just a simple matter of political will to do it 
 and of course as i mentioned this cost has corresponding benefits i mentioned there 's a multiplier of about three two point seven eight for the state economy in terms of over eighty billion in extra earnings  
 and if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something what we 're talking
  about is that for the average low income kid that would increase earnings by about ten percent over their whole career 
 just doing the preschool not improving  k 12 or anything else after that not doing anything with college tuition or access just directly improving preschool 
 and we would get five percent higher earnings for middle class
  so this is an investment that pays off in very concrete terms for a broad range of income groups in the state 's population
 and produces large and tangible
 benefits now that 's one barrier  i actually think the more profound barrier
 is the long term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs so the argument i 'm making is is that we 're increasing the quality of our local workforce and
  thereby increasing economic development  
 obviously if we have a preschool with four year olds 
 we 're not sending these kids out at age five to work in the sweatshops right at least i hope not 
 so we 're talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off
 for fifteen or twenty years  and of course america is notorious for being a
  short term oriented society now one response you can make to this and i sometimes have done this in talks is people can talk about there are benefits for these programs in reducing
 special ed and remedial education costs there are benefits parents care about preschool maybe we 'll get some migration effects
 from parents seeking good preschool and i think those are
  but in some sense they 're missing the point  ultimately this is something we 're investing in now for the future 
 and so what i want to leave you with
 is what i think is the ultimate question  i mean i 'm an economist but this is ultimately not an economic question  
 it 's a moral question  
 are we
  as americans are we as a society still capable
 of making the political choice to sacrifice now by paying more taxes
 in order to improve the long term future
 of not only our kids  but our community are we still capable of that
 as a country and that 's something that each and every citizen and voter
 needs to ask themselves is that something that you are still invested in 
 that you still believe in the notion of investment that is the notion of investment you sacrifice now for a return later
  so i think the research evidence
 on the benefits of early childhood programs for the local economy is
  the moral and political choice is still up to us as citizens and as voters
