  years ago i was turning sixty and i don 't like being sixty 
 and i started grappling with this existential angst of what little i had done with my life
 breaking this record here it was more like who had i become  how had i spent my valuable time how could this have gone by like lightning 
 and
 i couldn 't forgive myself for the countless countless hours i had lost in negative thought
 all the time i had spent beating myself up
  for losing my marriage and and not stopping the sexual abuse when i was a kid
 and career moves and this and this and this just why why didn 't i do it better why why why  and then my mother died
 at eighty two and so i starting thinking not only am i not happy with the past now i 'm getting choked with i 've only got twenty two years left
  to do with this short amount of time that 's just fleeting and i 'm not in the present whatsoever and i decided the remedy to all this malaise
 was going to be for me to chase
 an elevated dream an extreme dream  something that would require
  something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life every minute of every day  
 because the dream was so big that i couldn 't get there
 without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction and i decided  it was an old dream that was lingering
  that was from so many years ago three decades ago
 the only sort of world class swim i had tried and failed at back in my 20s was going from cuba to florida  
 it was deep in my imagination 
 no one 's ever done it without a shark cage it 's daunting it 's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean it
 's probably at my speed at my age
 for anybody 's speed at anybody 's age going to take sixty maybe seventy hours of continuous swimming never getting out on the boat 
 and i started to train i hadn 't swum for thirty one years not a stroke  
 and i had kept in good shape but swimming 's a whole different animal as a matter of fact this picture is supposed to be me
 during training  it 's a smiling face  and when you 're training for
  it 's an arduous difficult sport and i don 't remember smiling
 at any time
 during this sport 
 as i said i respect other sports  and i compare this sport sometimes to cycling and to mountain climbing and and other of the expedition type events but this is a sensory deprivation
  a physical duress  and when i started in with the eight hours and the ten hours and the twelve hours and the fourteen hours and the fifteen hours and the 24 hour swims i knew i had it  
 because i was making it through these and when i said i 'm going to go out and do a 15 hour swim and we 're coming into the dock after a long day and it 's now night and we come in and it 's fourteen hours and fifty eight minutes and i can touch the dock and we 're
  who cares the last two minutes i say no  it 's got to be fifteen hours and i swim another minute out and another minute back to make the fifteen hours and i put together an expedition 
 it 's not that i didn 't have help  but honestly  i sort of led i was the team leader and to get the government permissions you read in the paper you think it 's easy to get into cuba everyday try going
  in with an armada like we had of fifty people and five boats and cnn 's crew etc  
 the navigation is difficult there 's a big river
 called the gulf stream
 that runs across and it 's not going in the direction you are it 's going to the east and you 'd like to go north  
 it 's tricky  and there 's dehydration  and there 's hypothermia and
  and there are all kinds of problems and i gathered together honestly the world 's leading experts in every possible way  and a month ago the 
 of september i stood on that shore and i looked across to that long long faraway horizon
 and i asked myself 
 do you have it  are your shoulders ready  and they were they were prepared no stone left unturned was the mind ready
 you know you 're swimming with the fogged goggles you 're swimming at sixty strokes a minute so you 're never really focused on anything you don 't see 
  well you 've got tight bathing caps over your ears trying to keep the heat of the head
  you 're really left alone with your own thoughts  
 and i had all kinds of counting systems ready there in english followed by german followed by spanish followed by french  
 you save the french for last  
 and i had songs i had a playlist in my head not through headphones in my own head of sixty five songs  and i couldn 't wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night because that 's when neil young comes
  think you 'd be singing leonard cohen 's hallelujah out in the majesty of the ocean not songs about heroin addiction in new york city  
 but no for some reason
 i couldn 't wait to get into the dark of the night and be singing
  night before i started i finished stephen hawking 's 
 the grand design and i couldn 't wait to trip the mind fantastic about the 50th hour i was going to start thinking about
 the edge of the universe is there an edge
  this an envelope we 're living inside of or no does it go onto infinity in both time and space and there 's nothing like swimming for fifty hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this 
 i couldn 't wait to prove the athlete i am 
 that nobody else in the world can do this swim and i knew i could do it and when i jumped into that water i yelled in my mother 's french
 and i started swimming and oh my god it was glassy 
 and we knew it all fifty people on the boat we all knew this was it this was our time and i reminded myself a couple hours in you know 
 the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself first of all you 're going to hit obstacles  
 and
 even though you 're feeling great at any one moment
  don 't take it for granted be ready  because there 's going to be pain there 's going to be suffering  it 's not going to feel this good all the way across 
 and i was thinking of the hypothermia and maybe some shoulder pain and all the other things the vomiting that comes from being in the saltwater you 're immersed in the liquid
 your body doesn 't like the saltwater after a couple of days three days  you tend to
 rebel in a lot of physical ways but no two hours in
 never in my life i knew there were portuguese men o ' war all kinds of moon jellies all kinds of things but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters  and i was on
  know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm evidently a piece this big of tentacle has a 
 little barbs on it and each barb is not just stinging your skin it 's sending a venom the most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box 
 jellyfish and every one of those barbs is sending that venom into this central nervous system
 so first i feel like boiling hot oil  i 've been dipped in and i 'm yelling out fire fire fire  fire help me somebody help me and the next thing
 is paralysis i feel it in the back and then i feel it in the chest up here and i can 't breathe and now i 'm not swimming with a nice long stroke i 'm sort
  of crabbing it this way  then come convulsions a young man on our boat is an emt he dives in to try to help me he 's stung they drag him out on the boat and he 's evidently 
 i didn 't see any of this but lying on the boat and giving himself epinephrine shots and crying out he 's
  and he is down and he is crying and he 's yelling to my trainer who 's trying to help me  and he 's saying bonnie
 i think i 'm going to die my breath is down to three breaths a minute 
 i need help and i can 't help diana so that was at eight o 'clock at night the doctor medical team from university of miami arrived at five in the morning 
 so i swam through the night and at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots i didn 't get out  but was in the water taking prednisone
  shots taking xanax oxygen to the face it was like an icu unit in the water 
 and i guess the story is that even navy seals who are stung by the box jelly they 're done they either die or they quickly get to 
  a hospital  and i swam through the night and i swam through the next day and the next night at dusk
  again
 wham the box jelly again all across the neck all across here and this time 
 i don 't like it i didn 't want to give into it but there 's a difference between a non stop swim and a staged swim 
 and i gave in
 to the staged swim and they got me out and they started again with the epinephrine and the prednisone and with the oxygen
  and with everything they had on board  and i got back in 
 and i swam through that night and into the next day and at forty one hours this body
 couldn 't make it  
 the devastation of those stings had taken the respiratory system down so that i couldn 't make the progress i wanted 
 and the dream was crushed
  how odd is this
 intelligent person who put this together and got all these world experts together and i knew about the jellyfish but i was sort of cavalier a lot of athletes have this you know sort of
 invincibility  they should worry about me  i don 't worry about
  just swim right through them we 've got benadryl on board if i get stung i 'll just grin and bear it  
 well there was no grin and bearing this as a matter of fact  the best advice i got was from an elementary school class
 in
 the caribbean  and i was telling these kids one hundred and twenty of them they were all in the school on the gymnasium floor and i was telling them about the the jellyfish and how they 're gelatinous and
 you can 't see them at night especially and they have these long thirty to forty to
 50 ft tentacles and they do this wrapping and they can send the poison into the system and a little kid from the back was like this  and i said what 's your name henry henry what 's your question he said well i didn 't have a question so much as i had a suggestion 
 he said 
 you know those guys who really believe in what they believe in and so they
  well it 's odd that you 've learned of this as a noble noble kind of pursuit but yeah i know those guys he said that 's what you need you need like a school of fish
 that would swim in front of you like this 
 and when the jellyfish come and they wrap their tentacles around the fish they 're going to be busy with them and you 'll just scoot around
  and so i started that swim in a bathing suit like normal and no joke this is it it came from the shark divers  i finished the swim
 like this 
 i was swimming with this thing on that 's how scared of the jellyfish
  i was so now what do i do 
 i wouldn 't mind if every one of you came up on this stage tonight
 and told us how you 've gotten over the big disappointments of your lives  because we 've all had them haven 't we we 've all had a heartache  
 and so my journey now is to find some sort of
 grace
  i can look at the journey not just the destination  i can feel proud i can stand here in front of you tonight and say i was courageous 
 yeah thank you and
 with all sincerity i can say i am glad i lived those two years of my life that way because my goal
 to not suffer regrets
  anymore i got there with that goal when you live that way when you live with that kind of passion there 's no time there 's no time for regrets you 're just moving forward  and i want to live every day of the rest 
  of my life that way  swim or no swim  but the difference in accepting this particular defeat
 if there 's death
  and we have no choice  then grace and acceptance
 are necessary  
 but that ocean 's still there this hope is still alive  
 and i don 't want to be the crazy woman who does it for years and years and years and tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails but i can swim from cuba to
  the atlantic no that 's the last swim it 's the only swim i 'm interested in  but
 i 'm ready  and by the way a reporter called me the other day and he said he looked on wikipedia
 and he said he saw my birthday was august 
  nine hundred and forty nine and for some odd reason in wikipedia they had my death date too 
 he said did you know you 're going to die the same place you were born new york city and it 's going to be in january of ' thirty five 
 i said nope i didn 't know and now i 'm going to live to eighty five i have three more years than i thought 
 and so i ask
  myself i 'm starting to ask myself now even before this this extreme dream gets achieved for me i 'm asking myself and maybe i can ask you tonight too 
 to paraphrase the poet
 mary oliver  she says so what is it  what is it you 're doing
  with this one wild and precious life of yours 
 thank you very much
