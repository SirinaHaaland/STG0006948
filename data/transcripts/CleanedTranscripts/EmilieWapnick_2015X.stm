  raise your hand if you 've ever been asked the question what do you want to be when you grow up 
 now if you had to guess how old would you say you were when you were first asked this question you can just hold up fingers
  raise your hand if the question what do you want to be when you grow up has ever caused you any anxiety 
 any anxiety at all  
 i 'm someone who 's never been able to answer the question what do you want to be when you grow up 
  the problem wasn 't that i didn 't have any interests it 's that i had too many 
 in high school i liked english and math and art and i built websites and
 i played guitar in a punk band called frustrated telephone operator  maybe you 've heard of us 
 this continued after high school  and at a certain point  i began to notice this pattern in myself where i would become interested in an area and i would dive in become
 all consumed and i 'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was  and then i would hit this point
 where i 'd start to get bored  
 and usually i would try and persist anyway because i had already devoted so much time and energy and sometimes money into this field  but eventually this sense
  i got this this isn 't challenging anymore
 it would get to be too much and i would have to let it go  
 but then i would become interested in something else something totally unrelated and i would dive into that and become
  be like yes i found my thing and then i would hit this point again where i 'd start to get bored  
  and eventually i would let it go  but then i would discover something new and totally different and i would dive into that 
 this pattern
 caused me a lot of anxiety for two reasons  the first was that
 i wasn 't sure how i was going to turn any of this into a career  i thought that i would eventually have to pick one thing
 deny all of my other passions  and just
 resign myself to being bored
 the other reason it caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal  
 i worried that there was something wrong with this and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything  
 i worried that i was afraid of commitment or that i was scattered or that 
 afraid of my own success
  if you can relate to my story and to these feelings i 'd like you to ask yourself a question
 that i wish i had asked myself back then 
 ask yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things i 'll
 tell you where you learned it you learned it from the culture  
 we are first asked the question what do you want to be when you grow
  up when we 're about five years old and the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you 're that age 
 laughter it 's considered an innocuous question  posed to little kids to elicit cute replies like 
 i want to be an astronaut or i want to be a ballerina or i want to be a pirate 
 insert halloween costume here 
  but this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms for instance high school students might get asked what major they 're going to pick in college  
 and at some point what do you want to be when you grow up goes from being the cute exercise it once was
 to the thing that keeps us up at night  why  
 see  while this question inspires kids to dream about what they could be it
  not inspire them to dream about all that they could be in fact it does just the opposite  
 because when someone asks you what you want to be you can 't reply with twenty different things  
 though well meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like oh how cute but you can 't be a violin maker and a psychologist you have to choose 
  and he 's a luthier and psychotherapist  
 and this is amy ng 
 a magazine editor turned illustrator  entrepreneur  teacher and creative director  but most kids don 't hear about people like this 
 all they hear
 is that they 're going to have to choose  but it 's more
  the notion of the narrowly focused life
 is highly romanticized in our culture  
 it 's this idea of destiny or the one true calling  
 the idea that we each have one great thing we are meant to do during our time on this earth and you need to figure out what that thing is
 and devote your life to it 
 but what if you 're someone who isn 't wired
  what if there are a lot of different subjects that you 're curious about and many different things you want to do 
 well there is no room for someone like you in this framework  
 and so you might feel alone you might feel like you don 't have a purpose and you might feel like there 's something wrong with you 
 there 's nothing wrong with you what you are
  is someone with many interests and creative pursuits  it 's a mouthful to say it
 might help if you break it up into three parts  multi potential  and ite  
 you can also use one of the other terms that connote the same idea
  as polymath  the renaissance person  actually during the renaissance period it was considered the ideal to be well versed in multiple disciplines  
 barbara sher refers to us as scanners 
 use whichever term you like or invent your own i have to say i find it sort of fitting that as a community we cannot agree on a
 as a limitation or an affliction that you need to overcome  
 but what i 've learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website 
 is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way  
 here are three
 that is combining two or more fields and creating something new at the intersection  
 sha hwang and rachel binx drew from their shared interests in cartography data visualization  travel mathematics and design when they founded
  sha and rachel came up with this unique idea not despite  but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences  
 innovation happens at the intersections that 's where the new ideas come from 
 and multipotentialites with all of their backgrounds are able to access a lot of these points of intersection
  the second   multipotentialite superpower
 is rapid learning 
 when  multipotentialites become interested in something we go hard 
 we observe everything we can get our hands on we 're also used to being beginners because we 've been beginners so many times in the past
  and this means that we 're less afraid of trying new things and stepping out of our comfort zones
  skills are transferable across disciplines  and we bring everything we 've learned to every new area we pursue so we 're rarely starting from scratch  
 nora dunn is a full time traveler and freelance writer  
 as a child concert pianist she honed an incredible ability to develop muscle memory now she 's the fastest typist she knows
  a writer  nora was a financial planner  she had to learn the finer mechanics of sales when she was starting her practice  
 and this skill now helps her write compelling pitches to editors 
 it is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you 're drawn to even if you end up quitting you might apply that knowledge in a different field
  in a way that you couldn 't have anticipated  
 the third  multipotentialite superpower
 is adaptability that is the ability to morph into whatever you need to be in a given situation  
 abe cajudo is sometimes a video director  sometimes a web designer  sometimes a kickstarter consultant sometimes a teacher 
  he 's valuable because he does good work  he 's even more valuable because he can take on various roles depending on his clients ' needs 
 fast company magazine identified adaptability
 as the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive in the 21st century  
 the economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably that it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot in order to meet the needs of the
  market that are really going to thrive 
 idea synthesis  rapid learning and adaptability 
 three skills that  multipotentialites are very adept at 
 and three skills that they might lose
 if pressured to narrow their focus 
 as a society  we have a vested interest in encouraging
  themselves 
 we have a lot of complex multidimensional problems in the world right now  and we need creative out of the box thinkers to tackle them 
 now  let 's say that you are in your heart  
 a specialist you came out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon 
 don 't worry there 's nothing wrong with you either
 in fact some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist and  multipotentialite paired together  
 the specialist can dive in deep and implement ideas while the  multipotentialite brings a breadth of knowledge to the project it 's a beautiful partnership
  but we should all be designing lives and careers that are aligned with how we 're
  are largely being encouraged simply to be more like their specialist peers 
 so with that said if there is one thing you take away from this talk i hope that it is this  
 embrace your inner wiring  whatever that may be 
 if you 're a specialist at heart then by all means specialize that is where you 'll do your best work
  but to the multipotentialites in the room  including those of you who may have just realized in the last twelve minutes that you are one 
 to you i say  embrace your many passions  
 follow your curiosity down those rabbit holes  
 explore your intersections  
 embracing our inner wiring leads to a happier more
  authentic life and perhaps more importantly
