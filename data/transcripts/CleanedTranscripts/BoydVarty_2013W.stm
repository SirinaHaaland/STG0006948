  trying to live from his heart  and so just before i get going i wanted to tell you as a south african
 that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago  nelson mandela
  has come to the end of his long walk to freedom  and so this talk is going to be for him 
 i grew up in wonder  i grew up amongst those animals  
 i grew up in the wild eastern part of south africa
 at a place called
  's a place where my family has been in the safari business
 for four generations  
 now for as long as i can remember my job has been to take people out into nature  
 and so i think it 's a lovely twist of fate today
 to have the opportunity
 to bring some of my experiences out in nature
 in to this gathering
  is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories  and so what i have to share with you today
 is the simple medicine
 of a few campfire stories stories about heroes of heart  now my stories are not the stories that you 'll
  on the news and while it 's true that africa is a harsh place i also know it to be a place where people animals and ecosystems
 teach us about a more interconnected world 
 when i was nine years old president mandela came to stay with my family 
 he had just been released from his twenty seven years of incarceration and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status  members of
  the african national congress thought that in the bush he he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye  
 and it 's true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi 
 but it was a defining time for me as a young boy  i would take him breakfast in bed  and then in an old track suit and slippers  he would go for a walk
  around the garden at night i would sit with my family around the snowy bunny eared tv and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden
 surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people
 as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly  he was bringing peace to a divided and violent south africa one man
 with an unbelievable sense of his
  humanity mandela said often that the gift of prison
 was the ability to go within and to think 
 to create in himself the things he most wanted for south africa  peace  reconciliation  harmony 
 through this act of immense open heartedness he was to become the embodiment
 of what in south africa we call
  am because of you or people are not people without other people 
 it 's not a new idea or value but it 's one that i certainly think at these times is worth building on 
 in fact it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions
  ubuntu is at play right now you are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who i am 
 without you i 'm just a guy talking to an empty room and i spent a lot of time last week doing that and it 's
 not the same as this 
 if mandela was the national and international embodiment then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man
  born under a tree sixty kilometers from where i grew up in mozambique he would never have a lot of money but he was to be one of the richest men i would ever meet 
 solly grew up tending to his father 's cattle  now i can tell you i don 't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle  but it makes for
 the first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks
  he had learned to do that out in the bush i have no idea but he could do it 
 he then moved across into what we called the habitat team 
 these were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well being he fixed roads he mended wetlands  he did some anti poaching and then one day we were out together 
 and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked  
 and it was an old track  but for fun he turned and he began to follow
 it and i tell you i could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a 
  tracker  
 if you drove past  solly somewhere out on the reserve you look up in your rearview mirror you 'd see he 'd stopped the car twenty fifty meters down the road
 just in case you need help with something the only accusation i ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said
  pathologically helpful 
 when i started professionally guiding people out into this environment
 solly was my tracker we worked together as a team  and the first guests we ever got
 were a philanthropy group from your east coast  and they said to solly on the side they said before
 we even go out to see lions and leopards we want to see where you live so we took them up to his house and this visit of the philanthropist to his house
 coincided with a time when solly 's wife who was learning english was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying hello i love you  
 welcome i love you 
 laughter and there was something so beautifully african about it to me this small house with a
  on the day
 that solly saved my life  he was already my hero  
 it was a hot day 
 and we found ourselves down by the river because of the heat  i took my shoes off  and i rolled up my pants  and i walked into the water 
 solly remained on the bank the water was clear
  and we turned and we began to make our way upstream 
 and a few meters ahead of us there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank  and its branches were touching the water  and it was shadowy  
 and if had been a horror movie  people in the audience would have started saying don 't go in there don 't go in there 
 and of course the crocodile was in the shadows  now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite wham it hits me by my
  right leg  it pulls me it turns i throw my hand up i 'm able to grab a branch  it 's shaking me violently it 's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you  and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that laughter
 solly on the bank sees that i 'm in trouble he turns he begins to make his way to me the croc again continues to shake me it goes to bite me a second time  i notice a slick of blood in the water
  around me that gets washed downstream as it bites the second time i kick my foot goes down its throat it spits me out 
 i pull myself up into the branches and as i come out of the water i look over my shoulder 
 my leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description the bone is cracked the meat is torn up i make an instant decision that i 'll never look at that again 
 as i come
 out of the water 
 solly arrives at a deep section a channel between us  
 he knows  he sees the state of my leg he knows that between him and i there is a crocodile  and i can tell you this man doesn 't slow down for one second he comes straight into the channel he 
  wades in to above his waist  he gets to me he grabs me i 'm still in a vulnerable position he picks me and puts me on his shoulder this is the other thing about solly he 's freakishly strong  
 he walks me up the bank he lays me down he pulls his shirt off  he wraps it around my leg  picks me up a second time walks me to a vehicle  and he 's able to get me to medical attention  
 and i survive now 
  know how many people you know
 that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it
 to come and help you  but for solly it was as natural as breathing  
 and he is one amazing example of what i have experienced all over africa 
 in a more collective society we realize
 from the inside that our own well being is deeply tied to the well being of others  
 danger is shared
  shared  pain is shared  joy is shared  achievement is shared  houses are shared  food is shared
 ubuntu
 asks us to open our hearts and to share  
 and what solly taught me that day is the essence of this value his animated  empathetic action in every moment  
 now although the root word is
  people  i thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people  and then
 i met this young lady her name was elvis in fact solly gave her the name elvis because he said she walked like she was doing
 the elvis the pelvis dance  she was born with very badly deformed back
  she arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route 
 when i first saw her  i thought she would be dead in a matter of days  and yet for the next five years
 she returned in the winter months  
 and we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track it looked like an inverted bracket and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow  and then we would come around the corner and there she would be with her herd 
 and that outpouring
 of emotion from people on our safari trucks as they saw her it was this sense of kinship  
 and it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel
 a natural connection
 with the natural world and with animals and yet still i remained amazed that she was surviving  
 and then one day we came across them at this small water hole it was sort of a hollow in the ground  and i watched as the matriarch
  drank  and then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants  looks like the arm in motion  and she began to make her way up the steep bank 
 the rest of the herd turned
 and began to follow  and i watched young elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill she got
 visibly ears came forward she had a full go of it and halfway up her legs
  gave way and she fell backwards she attempted it a second time and again halfway up she fell backwards  
 and on the third attempt an amazing thing happened  
 halfway up the bank a young teenage elephant came in behind her  and he propped his trunk underneath her  and he began to shovel her up the bank
  and it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant the next day i watched again
 as the matriarch broke a branch
 and she would put it in her mouth  and then she would break a second one
 and drop it on the ground  and a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area
 that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant 
  elvis and the herd taught me
 caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu  
 and i believe that in the cathedral of the wild we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us  
 and it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity
 but through all the creatures that live on this planet  if africa has a gift to share
  it 's a gift of a more collective society  and while it 's true that ubuntu is an african idea what i see
 is the essence of that value being invented here  thank you
  that you knew president mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today and
 deeply distraught and
 and know the tragic loss that it is to the world but
 i just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts because we know that you heard that news just before
 coming in to do this session boyd
  so happy because it was time for him to pass on he was suffering  
 and so of course there 's the mixed emotions  but i just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the oprah show
 and asked her what the show would be about
  we 've got a road to walk in south africa  
 and everything they used to call it madiba magic you know he used to go to a rugby match and we would win anywhere he went things went well
  but i think that magic will be with us and
 the important thing is that we carry what he stood for  and so that 's what
 i 'm going to try and do  and that 's what people all over south africa are trying to do
