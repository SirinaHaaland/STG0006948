  talk about identity that 's sort of an interesting enough topic to me and the reason was because when i was asked to do this i 'd just read in
 one of the papers i can 't remember
 something from someone at facebook saying well we need to make everybody use their real names and then that 's basically all the problems solved  and that 's so wrong that 's such a 
 fundamentally reactionary view of identity  and it 's going to get us into all sorts of trouble  
  that 's a camera phone picture of me looking at a painting [ what 's the problem ] that 's a painting that was painted by a very famous forger  
 and because i 'm not very good at presentations i already can 't remember the name that i wrote on my card  and he was incarcerated in i think wakefield prison
 for forging masterpieces by i think
  so good at it that when he was in prison
  everybody in prison the governor and whatever wanted him to paint masterpieces to put on the walls because they were so good  and so that 's a masterpiece which is a fake of a masterpiece  and 
 bonded into the canvas is a chip
 which identifies that as a real fake if you see what i mean so when we 're talking about authenticity
  i 'm guessing everyone 's got a chip and pin card right 
 so why is that a good example  that 's the example of how legacy thinking about identity subverts the security of a
  chip and pin card that 's in your pocket
 has a little chip on it that cost millions of pounds to develop is extremely secure  
 you can put scanning electron microscopes on it you can try and grind it down blah blah blah  those chips have never been broken whatever you read in the paper  
 and for a joke we take that super secure chip and we bond it to a trivially counterfeitable magnetic stripe
 and for very lazy criminals we still emboss the card so if you 're a criminal in a hurry and you need to copy someone 's card
  you can just stick a piece of paper on it and rub a pencil over it just to sort of speed things up and
 even more amusingly and on my debit card too we print the name and the salt code and everything else on the front too  why
 there is no earthly reason why your name is printed on a chip and pin card  and if you think about it it
 's even more insidious and perverse than it seems at first because the only people that benefit from having the name on the card
 are criminals  you know what your name is  right 
 and when you go into a shop and buy something  it 's a pin he doesn 't
 care what the name is  
 the only place where you ever have to write your name on the back is in america at the moment and whenever i go to america and i have to pay with a mag stripe on the back of the card i always sign it carlos tethers anyway just as a security
 mechanism because
  if a transaction ever gets disputed and it comes back and it says dave birch  i know it must have been a criminal because i would never sign it dave birch 
 so if you drop your card in the street it means a criminal can pick it up and read it they know the name from the name they can find the address  and then they can go off and buy stuff online  
 why do we put the name on the card  because we think identity is something to do with names  and because we 're rooted in the idea of the identity card which obsesses us and i know it
  crashed and burned
 a couple of years ago but if you 're
 someone in politics or the home office or whatever and you think about identity  you can only think of identity in terms of cards with names on them and that that 's very subversive in a modern world  
 so the second example i thought i 'd use
 is
 chatrooms [ chatrooms and children ] i 'm very proud of that picture that 's my son
 playing in his band with his friends for the
 gig i believe you call it where he got paid 
 laughter and i love that picture i like the picture of him getting into medical school a lot better i like that picture
 for the moment why do i use that picture because that was very interesting  watching that experience as an old person 
  so him and his friends they get together  they booked a room like a church hall  and they got all their friends who had bands and they got them together  and they do it all on
  facebook and then they sell tickets  and the first band on 
  menu that 's probably the wrong word for it isn 't it the first band on the list of bands that appears at
 some public music performance of some kind gets the sales from the first twenty tickets then the next band gets the next twenty  and so on they were at the
 bottom of the menu they were like fifth i thought they had no chance he actually got twenty quid fantastic right  but my point is that all worked perfectly except
 on the web so they 're sitting on facebook and they 're sending these messages and arranging things and they don 't know who anybody is  right  
 that 's the big problem we 're trying to solve if only they were using the real names  then you wouldn 't be worried about them on the internet  and so when he says to me oh  i want to go
  you to go into a chatroom to talk about guitars because they might not all be your friends and some of the people that are in the chatroom might be
 perverts and teachers and vicars 
 i mean they generally are when you look in the paper right  so i want to know who all the people in the chatroom are so okay
  you can go in the chatroom but only if everybody in the chatroom is using their real names and they submit full copies of their
 police report 
 but of course if anybody in the chatroom asked for his real name i 'd say no you can 't give them your real name because what happens if they turn out to be perverts and teachers and whatever
 so you have this odd sort of paradox where i 'm happy for him to go into this space if i know who everybody else is  but i don 't want anybody else to know who he is  
 and so you get this sort of logjam around identity
  where you want full disclosure from everybody else but not from yourself and there 's no progress we get stuck  
 and so the chatroom thing doesn 't work properly  and it 's a very bad way of thinking about identity
 so on my rss feed  i saw this thing about i just said something bad about my rss feed didn 't i i should stop saying it like that for some random reason i can 't
  something about cheerleaders turned up in my inbox and i read this story about cheerleaders  and it 's a fascinating story this happened a couple of years ago in the u s there were some cheerleaders in a
 team at a high school in the u s and they said mean things about their cheerleading coach as i 'm sure kids do about all of their teachers all of the time  
 and somehow the cheerleading coach found out about this she was very upset  and so she went to one of the girls and said you have to give me your facebook
  even at some universities and places of education kids are forced to hand over their facebook passwords so you 've got to give them your facebook password  she was a kid 
 what she should have said is my lawyer will be calling you first thing in the morning it 's an outrageous imposition
 on my 4th amendment right to privacy and you 're going to be sued for all the money you 've got that 's what she should have said  but she 's a kid so she hands over the password the teacher can 't log
  because the school has blocked access to facebook
  so the teacher can 't log into facebook until she gets home so the girl tells her friends guess what happened the teacher logged in she knows so the girls just all logged into facebook on their phones and deleted their profiles  
 and so when the teacher logged in there was nothing there 
 my point is  those identities they don 't think about them the same way  identity is especially when you 're a teenager a fluid
  have an identity you don 't like it because it 's subverted in some way or it 's insecure or it 's inappropriate you just delete it and get another one  
 the idea that you have an identity that 's given to you by someone the government or whatever and you have to stick with that identity and use it in all places that 's absolutely wrong
 why would you want to really know who someone was on facebook unless you wanted to abuse them and harass them in some way and it just doesn 't work properly  
 and my fourth example is there are some cases where you really want to
  be wondering  that 's me at the 
 i wasn 't actually at the g20 protest but i had a meeting at a bank on the on the day of the g20 protest  and i got an email from the bank saying please don 't wear a suit because it 'll inflame the protesters
 i look pretty good in a suit frankly so you can see why it would drive them into
  if i don 't want to inflame the protesters the obvious thing to do is go dressed as a protester so i went dressed completely in black you know 
 with a black balaclava i had black gloves on but i 've taken them off to sign the visitor 's book i 'm wearing black trousers black
 boots i 'm dressed completely in black i go into the bank at ten o 'clock go hi i 'm dave birch i 've got a three o 'clock with so and so there sure they sign me in there 's my visitor 's badge
  on facebook and whatever that gets you that kind of security 
 that gets you security theater where there 's no actual security  but people are sort of playing parts in a play about security  and as long as everybody learns their lines everyone 's happy but it 's not real security 
 especially because i hate banks more than the g20 protesters do because
  suppose i was sitting next to a rogue trader  and i want to report it to the boss of the bank so i log on to do a little bit of whistleblowing i send a message this guy 's a rogue trader
 that message is meaningless if you don 't know that i 'm a trader at the bank if that message just comes from anybody  it has zero information value  
 there 's no point in sending that message
 but if i have to prove who i am i 'll never send that message it 's just like the nurse in the hospital reporting the
  that message will only happen if i 'm anonymous  so the system has to have ways of providing anonymity there otherwise we don 't get where we want to get to 
 so four issues so what are we going to do about it well
  what we tend to do about it
 is we think about orwell space  and we try to make electronic versions of the identity card that we got rid of
  facebook login which proves who you are and i make you carry it all the time  that solves the problem and of course for all those reasons i 've just outlined  it doesn 't and it might actually make some problems worse  the more times 
  you 're forced to use your real identity certainly in transactional transactional terms the more likely that identity is to get stolen and subverted the goal is to stop people from using identity
  transactions you do are
 not who are you they 're are you allowed to drive the car are you allowed in the building are you over eighteen  etcetera etcetera 
 so my  suggestion i like james think that there should be a resurgence of interest in r & d i think this is a solvable problem it 's something we can do about 
 naturally in these circumstances  i turn to doctor
  because in this as in so many other walks of life  doctor who has already shown us the answer  
 so i should say for some of our foreign visitors  doctor who is the greatest living scientist in england 
 and a beacon of truth and enlightenment to all of us and this is doctor who with his psychic paper 
  you guys must have seen doctor who 's psychic paper you
  nerds if you say yes who 's seen doctor who 's psychic paper  oh right you were in the library the whole time studying i guess is that what you 're going to tell us 
 doctor who 's psychic paper is when you hold up the psychic paper the person in their brain sees the thing that they need to see  so i want to show you a british passport i 
  hold up the psychic paper you see a british passport  i want to get into a party i hold up the psychic paper  i show you a party invitation you see what you want to see  so what i 'm saying is we need to make an electronic
  version of that but with one tiny tiny change which is that it 'll only show you the british passport if i 've actually got one it
 'll only show you the party invitation if i actually have one it will only show you that i 'm over eighteen if i actually am over eighteen  but nothing else 
 so you 're the bouncer at the pub you need to know that i 'm over eighteen instead
  you my driving license which shows you i know how to drive what my name is my address all these kind of things  i show you my psychic paper and all it tells you is am i over eighteen or not 
 right 
 is that just a pipe dream of course not otherwise i wouldn 't be here talking to you so in order to build that and make it work i 'm only going to name these things i 'll not go into them 
 we need a plan  
 which is we 're going to build this as an infrastructure for everybody to use to solve all of these problems we 're going to make a utility
  to be universal you can use it everywhere i 'm just giving you little flashes of the technology as we go along  that 's a japanese atm the fingerprint template is stored inside the mobile phone  so when you want to draw 
  money out you put the mobile phone on the atm and touch your finger your fingerprint goes through to the phone the phone says yes that 's whoever and the atm then gives you some money it has to be a utility
  you can use everywhere  it has to be absolutely convenient  that 's me going into the pub
 all the device on the door of the pub is allowed is is this person over eighteen and not barred from the pub  and so the idea is you touch your id card to the door and if i am allowed in it 
  shows my picture if i 'm not allowed in it shows a red cross it doesn 't disclose any other information it has to have no special gadgets that can only mean
 one thing following on from ross 's statement which i agree with completely 
 if it means no special gadgets it has to run on a mobile phone that 's the only choice we have we have to make it work on mobile phones  
 there are six point six billion mobile phone subscriptions my favorite statistic of all time only four billion toothbrushes in the world  that means something  i don 't know what 
 i rely on our futurologists to tell me it
 has to be a utility which is extensible so it has to be something that anybody
 could build on anybody should be able to use this infrastructure you don 't need permissions licenses whatever anyone should be able to write some code to do this
 you know what symmetry is so you don 't need a picture of it this is how we 're going to do it we 're going to do it using phones and we 're going to do it using mobile proximity i 'm going to suggest to you
 the technology to implement doctor who 's psychic paper is already here  and if any of you have got one of the new barclay 's debit cards with the contactless interface on it you 've already got that technology
  ever been up to the big city and used an oyster card at all does that ring any bells to anybody the technology already exists  the first phones that have the technology built in the google nexus the s2 the samsung wifi seven point nine 
 the first phones that have the technology built into them are already in the shops so the idea that the gas man can turn up at my mom 's door and he can show my mom his phone and she can tap
  and it will come up with green if he really is from british gas and allowed in and it 'll come up with red if he isn 't end of story  we have the technology to do that and what 's more although some of those things sounded a bit
 counter intuitive like proving i 'm over eighteen without proving who i am the cryptography to do that not only exists  it 's extremely well known and well understood digital signatures 
  a few examples of the technology being used in experimental places
 that 's london fashion week where we built a system with o2 
 that 's for the wireless festival in hyde park  you can see the persons walking in with their vip band it 's just being checked by the nokia phone that 's reading the band  i 'm only putting those up to show you these things are prosaic this stuff works in these environments
  's psychic paper
