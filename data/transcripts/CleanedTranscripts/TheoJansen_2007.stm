  i would like to
 tell you about a project
 which i started about sixteen years ago  it 's about making new forms of life and these are made
 of this kind of
 tube electricity tube
  holland  and
 we can start a film about that  and we can
 see a little bit backwards in time narrator eventually these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches theo
 jansen is working hard on this evolution theo jansen 
 i want to put these
 forms of life on the
  beaches  and they should survive over there on their own in the future  
 learning to live on their own
 and it 'll take couple of more years
 to let them walk on their own narrator
 the mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food
  but from the wind 
 the wind will move feathers on their back which will drive their feet  
 the beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach  with its nose pointed into the wind 
 as soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand 
 it stops  and walks in the opposite direction 
 evolution
  has generated many species 
  this is the animaris currens ventosa
  sort of race  and each and every animal is different  and the winning codes
  will multiply this is the wave going from left to right you can see this one
  now it goes from left to right  this is a new generation a new family which
 is able to store the wind  so  the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles  which are on top of
 and they can use that energy in case  the wind falls away  and the the tide is coming up and there is still a little bit of energy
 to reach the dunes and save their lives  
 because they are drowned very easily 
  proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking there are eleven numbers  which i call the eleven holy numbers
  of the tubes which make it walk that way in fact  it 's a new invention of the wheel  
 it works the same as a wheel  the axis of a wheel stays on the same level 
 and this hip is staying on the same level as well  
 in fact this is better than a wheel because
 when you try to
 drive your bicycle on the beach you will notice it
  do and
 the feet just step over the sand  and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground  in between 
 so five thousand years after the invention of the wheel  we have a new wheel
 i will show you in the next video can you start it please
  there 's a guy pushing there  behind  but it can also walk on the wind very well it 's three point two tons 
 this is
 working on on the stored wind in the bottles
  it 's going the other way 
  they have to survive all the dangers of the of the beach  and one of the big dangers is the sea  this is the sea  
 and it must feel the water of the sea
 and this is the water feeler  and what 's very important is this tube  it sucks
  it swallows water it feels the resistance of it so imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea
  as soon as it touches the water you should hear a sound of
  if it doesn 't feel it will be drowned ok  
 here we have the brain of the animal in fact it is a step counter  
  it 's a binary step counter  so as soon it has been to the sea  it changes
 the pattern of zeroes and ones here  and
 it always knows where it is on the on the beach  so it 's very simple brain 
 it says well there 's the sea  there are dunes and i 'm here  
  a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal  thank you 
 one of the biggest enemies
 are the storms  
 this is a part of the nose of the animaris percipiere 
 when the nose
  the nose is fixed the whole animal is fixed the wind may turn but the animal will always turn its nose into the wind
 now  another couple of years  and these animals will survive on their own 
 i still have to help them a lot
 thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
