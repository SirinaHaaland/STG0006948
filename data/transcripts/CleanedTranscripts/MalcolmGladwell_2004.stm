  i think i was supposed to talk about my new book which
 is called blink and it 's about snap judgments and first impressions and it comes out in january and i hope you all buy it in triplicate 
  i was thinking about this and i realized that although my new book makes me happy  and
 i think would make my mother happy  it 's not really about happiness  so i decided instead 
 i would talk about someone who i think has done as much to make americans happy
 as perhaps anyone over the last twenty years a man who is a great personal hero of mine
  someone by the name of howard moskowitz who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce
  howard 's about this high  and he 's
 round  and he 's
 in his 60s and he has
 big huge glasses and
 thinning gray hair and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality and he has a parrot and he
  by profession he 's a psychophysicist now i should tell you that i have no idea what
 psychophysics is although at some point in my life i dated a girl for two years who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics which should tell you something
 about that relationship  as far as i know psychophysics is about measuring things
 and howard is very interested in measuring things and he
 with his doctorate from harvard and he set up a little consulting shop in white plains new york  and one of his first clients was pepsi this is many years ago back in the early 
 and pepsi came to howard and they said you know there 's this new thing called aspartame and we would like to make diet pepsi we 'd like you to figure out
  how much aspartame we should put in each can of diet pepsi in order to have the perfect drink now that sounds like an incredibly
 straightforward question to answer 
 and that 's what howard thought  because pepsi told him we 're working with a band between eight and twelve percent anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough  
 anything above twelve percent sweetness is too sweet we want to know what 's the sweet spot between eight
  if i gave you this problem to do you would all say it 's very simple what we do is you make up a big experimental batch of pepsi at every degree of sweetness eight percent eight point one eight point two eight point three all the way up to twelve
 and we try this out with thousands of people and we plot the results on a curve  and we take the most popular concentration  right  really simple 
 howard does the experiment and he gets the data back and he plots it on a curve  and all of a sudden he realizes it 's not a nice bell curve
  in fact the data doesn 't make any sense it 's a mess  it 's all over the place now  most people in that business in the world of testing food
 and such are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess they think well you know figuring out what people think about cola 's not that easy 
 you know maybe we made an error somewhere along the way 
  let 's just make an educated guess and they simply point and they go for ten percent  right in the middle 
 howard is not so easily placated howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards and this was not good enough for him and this question bedeviled him for years 
 and he would think it through and say what was wrong why could we not make sense of this experiment with diet pepsi 
 and one day he was sitting in a diner in white plains about to go trying to dream up some work for
  lightning  the answer came to him  and that is that when they analyzed the diet pepsi data they were asking the wrong question 
 they were looking for the perfect pepsi  and they should have been looking for the perfect pepsis  
 trust me this was an enormous revelation 
 this was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science howard immediately went on the road  and he would go to conferences around the country and he would stand up and
  been looking for the perfect pepsi  you 're wrong  you should be looking for the perfect
 pepsis and
 people would look at him blankly and say 
 what are you talking about craziness and they would say move next tried to get business nobody would hire him he was obsessed though and he talked about it and talked about it howard loves the yiddish expression to a worm in horseradish the world is horseradish 
 this was his horseradish
 he was obsessed with it 
 and finally  
 he had a breakthrough vlasic pickles came to him  
 and they said doctor moskowitz  we want to make the perfect pickle and he said there is no perfect pickle there are only perfect pickles 
 and he came back to them and he said you don 't
  to improve your regular you need to create zesty and that 's where we got zesty pickles
  then the next person came to him campbell 's soup and this was even more important in fact  campbell 's soup is where
 howard made his reputation  campbell 's made prego  and prego in the early  80s was struggling
 next to rag  which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the 
 in the industry i don 't know whether you care about this or how much time i have to go into this but it was technically speaking
 prego is a better tomato sauce than rag 
 the quality of the tomato paste is much better the spice spice mix is far superior it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way in fact they would do the famous bowl test back in the  70s with rag and prego you 'd have a plate of spaghetti and you would
 pour it on right and the rag would all go to the bottom and the prego would sit on top that 's called
 anyway despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence  and the quality of their tomato paste 
 prego was struggling  so they came to howard and they said  fix us  and howard looked at their product line and he said what you have is a 
  dead tomato society  so he said this is what i want to do  and he got together with the campbell 's soup kitchen and he made
 of spaghetti sauce  and he varied them according to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce  by sweetness by level of garlic by tomatoey ness by tartness by sourness 
 by visible solids my favorite term
 in the
 spaghetti sauce business every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce  he varied spaghetti sauce  and then he took this whole raft of
 spaghetti sauces and he went on the road he
 went to new york to chicago he went to jacksonville to los angeles  
 and he brought in people by the truckload into big halls  and he sat them down for two hours and over the course of that two hours he gave them ten bowls 
 ten small bowls of pasta with a different
 spaghetti sauce on each one and after they ate
  to rate from zero to one hundred how good they thought
 the spaghetti sauce was at the end of that process after doing it for months and months he had a mountain of data about how the american people feel
 about spaghetti sauce  and then he analyzed the data did he look for the most popular
 variety of spaghetti sauce no howard doesn 't believe that there is such a thing instead he looked at the data and he said  let 's see if we can group all these different data points into
 clusters  let 's see if they congregate around certain ideas  
 and sure enough if you sit down  and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce you realize that all americans fall into one of three groups  
 there are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain  
 there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy  and there are people who like
  extra chunky 
 and of those three facts the third one was the most significant  
 because at the time in the early 1980s if you went to a supermarket you would not find extra chunky spaghetti sauce  
 and prego turned to howard and they said you 're telling me that one third of americans crave
 spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs and he said
  and prego then went back and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country 
  and over the next ten years  they made six hundred million dollars off their line of extra chunky sauces 
  and that 's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar and fourteen different kinds of
 of mustard and seventy one different kinds of olive oil and
 then eventually even rag hired howard and howard did the exact same thing for rag that he did for prego and today if you go to a really good supermarket do you know how many rags there are
  that 's howard 's doing that is howard 's gift to the american people now why is that important 
 it is in fact  enormously important i 'll explain to you why  what howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy
  assumption number one in the food industry used to be
 that the way to find out what people want to eat what will make people happy is to ask them 
 and for years and years and years rag and prego would have focus groups  and they would sit you down and they would say what do you want in a spaghetti sauce  tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce and for all those years
 twenty thirty years through all those focus group sessions
  no one ever said they wanted extra chunky even though at least a third of them  deep in their hearts actually did 
 people don 't know what they want  as howard loves to say the mind knows not what the tongue wants it 's a mystery
  that we cannot always explain what we want deep down  if i asked all of you for example in this room what you want in a coffee you know what you
 'd say  every one of you would say i want a dark
  you will never ever say to someone who asks you what you want that i want a milky weak coffee so that 's
 number one thing that howard did number two thing that howard did is he he made us realize it 's another very critical point
 he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call horizontal segmentation
  why is this critical because this is the way the food industry thought before howard
  what were they obsessed with in the early 80s they were obsessed with mustard in particular they were obsessed with the story of grey poupon
 used to be  there were two mustards french 's and gulden 's what were they yellow mustard what 's in it yellow mustard seeds turmeric and paprika that was mustard 
 grey poupon came along with a dijon
  more volatile brown mustard seed 
 some white wine a nose hit much more delicate aromatics and what do they do they put it in a little tiny glass jar with a
 wonderful enameled label on it made it look french even though it 's made in oxnard california 
 and instead of charging a dollar fifty for
  the way that french 's and gulden 's did they decided to charge four dollars  and they had those ads with the guy in the rolls royce 
  eating the grey poupon  another pulls up and says do you have any grey poupon and the whole thing after they did that grey poupon takes off takes over the mustard business  and everyone 's take home lesson from that was that
 the way to make people happy
 is to give them something that is more expensive something to aspire to
  them turn their back on what they think they like now  and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy 
 a better mustard a more expensive mustard a mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning 
 and howard looked to that and said that 's wrong mustard does not exist on a hierarchy mustard
  just like tomato sauce on a horizontal plane  there is no good
 mustard or bad mustard  there is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard there are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people 
 he fundamentally
 democratized the way we think about taste  and for that as well  we owe howard moskowitz a huge vote of thanks 
 third thing that howard did  and perhaps the most important is howard confronted the notion of the platonic dish
 what do i mean by that 
 for the longest time in the food industry there was a sense that there was one way a perfect way to make a dish  you go to 
 they give you the  red tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction
  you just get the reduction why because the chef at chez panisse has a platonic notion about 
 this is the way it ought to be
 and she serves it that way time and time again and if you quarrel with her she will say you know what you 're wrong this is the
 best way it ought to be in this restaurant now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well  
 they had a platonic notion of what tomato sauce was and where did that come from it came from italy 
 italian tomato sauce is what it 's blended it 's thin 
 the culture of tomato sauce was thin when we talked about authentic tomato sauce in the 1970s we talked about italian tomato sauce we talked about the earliest rags 
  which had no visible solids right 
 which were thin you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta that 's what it was and why were we attached to that because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most
 culturally authentic tomato sauce a and b we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce  
 then they would embrace it and that 's what would please the maximum number of people
  cooking world were looking for cooking universals  
 they were looking for one way to treat all of us and it 's good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals because all of science 
 through the 19th century and much of the 20th was obsessed with universals  
 psychologists medical scientists   economists were all interested in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave  
 but that changed
 right what is the great revolution in science of the last ten fifteen years  it is the movement from the search for universals
 to the understanding of variability  
 now in medical science  we don 't want to know necessarily just how cancer works  we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer i guess my cancer different
  genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability  what howard moskowitz was doing was saying this same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce 
 and for that we owe him a great vote of thanks i 'll
 give you one last illustration of variability  
 and that is oh i 'm sorry howard not only believed that but he took it a second step which was to say that
 when we pursue universal principles in food
 we aren 't just making an error we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice and the example he used was coffee  and coffee is
 something he did a lot of work with with nescaf if i were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee a type of coffee a brew
 that made all of you happy  and then i asked you
  rate that coffee  the average score in this room for coffee would be about sixty on a scale of zero to one hundred  
 if however you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters maybe three or four coffee clusters and i could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters 
 your scores would go from sixty to 
 the difference between coffee
 at sixty and coffee at seventy eight is a difference between coffee that makes you wince and coffee that makes you deliriously
 happy that is the final and i think most beautiful lesson of howard moskowitz that in embracing the diversity
 of human beings  we will find a surer way to true happiness
