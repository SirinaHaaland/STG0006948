  we belong to the family called the hominidae 
 we are the species called homo sapiens sapiens  and it 's important to remember that in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet earth  
 we are one
 species
 of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet earth today 
 and that 's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever
  lived on the planet in past times  we 're one species out of
 approximately or let 's say at least sixteen upright walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years but as far as we know we 're the only upright walking ape that exists on
 planet earth today  except for the bonobos and it 's important to remember that because the bonobos are so human and they share
 ninety nine percent of their genes with us  and we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes it
 's important to remember that we evolved now i know that 's a dirty word for some people  but we evolved
 from common ancestors with the gorillas the chimpanzee
 and also the bonobos
 we have a common past and we have a common future  
 and it is important to remember that all of these great apes
 have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today
  and it 's this journey that is of such interest to humanity  and it 's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family as we 've been in east africa looking for the fossil remains
 of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past 
 and this is how we look for them a group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas
 of africa looking
  for small fragments of bone fossil bone that may be on the surface  and that 's an example of what we may do as we walk across
 the landscape in northern kenya  looking for fossils 
 i doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that 's in this picture  but if you look very carefully there is a
  it is something that is going to involve a lot more people to begin to piece together our past we still really haven 't got a very complete picture of it 
 when we find a fossil  we mark it today we 've got great technology we
  gps  we mark it with a gps fix and we also take
 a digital photograph of the specimen so we could essentially put it back on the surface  
 exactly where we found it and we can bring all this information into big gis packages today  
 when we then find something very important like the bones of a human ancestor  we begin to excavate it extremely
  carefully and slowly using dental picks
 and fine paintbrushes and all the sediment is then put through these screens  and where we go again through it very carefully looking for small bone fragments
 and it 's then washed and these things are so exciting they are so often
 the only or the very first time that anybody has ever
  here 's a very special moment when my mother and myself were digging up
 some remains of of
 human human ancestors  and it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother laughter
 not many people can say that but now let me take you back to
  two million years ago  i 'd just like to point out if you look at the map of africa  it does actually look like a hominid skull
 in its shape  
 now we 're going to go to the east african and the the rift valley it essentially runs up from the gulf of of aden
 or runs down to lake malawi and the rift valley is a depression
  it 's a basin and
 rivers flow down from the highlands into the
 the basin  carrying sediment preserving
 the bones of animals that lived there if you want to become a fossil you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried you then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface
  and then you hope that one of us
  lot will walk around and find small pieces of you laughter
 ok so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors because it 's incredibly difficult a for these 
  things to become to be preserved  and secondly for them to have been brought back up to the surface  
 evolutionary story so let 's go to lake turkana which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country kenya  
 and if
 you look north here there 's a big river that flows into the lake that 's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there fossil sites run up and down 
 both lengths of that lake basin  which represents some twenty thousand square
  miles that 's a huge job that we 've got on our hands two million years ago
 at lake turkana homo erectus one of our human ancestors actually lived in this region you can see some of the major fossil sites that we 've been working
 in the north but essentially two million years ago  homo erectus up in the far right corner lived alongside
 three other species of human ancestor  
 and here is a skull of a homo erectus which i just pulled off the shelf there 
 but it is not to say that being a single species on planet earth is the norm in fact if you go back in time  it is the norm
  that there are multiple species of hominids or of of human ancestors that coexist at any one time  where did these things come from 
 that 's what we 're still trying to find answers to and
 it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species and
 our ancestors are no exception
  the fossils
 that have been found
 from lake turkana but i was very lucky to have been brought up in kenya  essentially accompanying my parents to lake turkana in search of human remains 
  and we were able to dig up when we got old enough fossils such as this
  and things like that but when i was twelve as i was in this picture a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side  when they found essentially
 the skeleton of this homo erectus 
 i could relate to this homo erectus skeleton very well because i was the same age that
 he was when he died  and i imagined him
 to be tall
 his brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey probably sweating heavily as they did so he was very able to use stones effectively as tools 
 and
 this individual himself this one that i 'm holding up
  actually had a bad back he 'd probably had an injury as a child 
 he had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female  and probably much smaller members of his family group to have got to where he did
 in life  age twelve  unfortunately for him he fell into a swamp and couldn 't get out 
  his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved  and he remained there
 until one point six million years later when this very famous fossil hunter kamoya kimeu walked along a small hillside
  and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles  
 was begun immediately and more and more little bits of skull started to be
 extracted from the sediment and what was so fun about it was this the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree 
 and fairly recently the tree had grown up  but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside and so it had decided to grow
  its roots in and around this holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope  
 we began to find limb bones we found finger bones the bones of the pelvis vertebrae ribs the collar bones 
 things that had never ever been seen before
 in homo erectus it
 was truly exciting he had a body very similar to our own  
 and he was on the threshold of becoming human 
 well  shortly afterwards members of his species started to move northwards out of africa and you start to see fossils
 of homo erectus in georgia  china
 and also in parts
  homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave africa and begin its spread across the globe 
 some exciting finds again as i mentioned from dmanisi in the republic of georgia but also surprising finds recently 
  announced from the island of flores in indonesia  where a group of these
  and have become dwarfed and they 're only about a meter in height  but they lived only eighteen thousand years ago  
 and that is truly extraordinary to think about 
 just to put this in terms of generations because people do find it hard to think of time  homo erectus left africa ninety thousand generations ago
  we evolved essentially from an african stock again at
 about two hundred thousand years as a
  and we only left africa about seventy thousand years ago  
 and until thirty thousand years ago at least three upright walking apes shared the planet earth 
 the question now is well who are we we 're certainly a polluting  wasteful aggressive species with a
  not particularly pleasant at all we have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors 
 is this a good evolutionary adaptation or is it going to lead us to being the 
 hominid species on planet earth  and what is it that really makes us us i think it 's our collective intelligence it 's our ability
  to write things down our language and our consciousness 
 from very primitive beginnings with a very crude tool kit of stones we now have a very advanced tool kit
  and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels  we 've got
  we 've mapped the human genome and recently even created synthetic life thanks to craig venter  and we 've also managed to communicate with people all over the world from extraordinary places  even from within an excavation
 in northern kenya we can talk to people about what we 're doing as al gore so clearly has reminded us  we
 have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet human
  really only survive on planet earth if you look at the
 the fossil record for about on average a million years at a time  we 've only been around for the past two hundred thousand years as a species yet we 've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people 
 and last year our population grew by eighty million i mean these are extraordinary numbers 
 you can see here
  again taken from al gore 's book  but what 's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth  
 we have to control our numbers and i think this is as important as anything else that 's being done in the world today  but we have to control our numbers because we can 't really hold it together as a species 
 my father so appropriately put
  it that we are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species 
 can we hold it together 
 it 's important to remember that we all evolved in africa  
 we all have an african origin  
 we have a common past and we share a common future
 evolutionarily speaking we 're just a blip we 're sitting on the edge of a precipice  and we have
 the tools
 and the technology
 at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today  
 we could tell every single human being out there if we really wanted to but will we do that
  or will we just let nature take its course
