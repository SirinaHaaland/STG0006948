  are celebrating an anniversary with me i 'm not married
  six years before that i was starting
 my career as an opera singer in europe 
 when i was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension also known as ph
 it happens when there
  a thickening in the pulmonary veins making the right side of the heart work overtime and causing what i call the 
 effect my heart was three and a half sizes too big  physical activity becomes very difficult for people with
  and usually after two to five years you die  
 i went to see this specialist and she was top of the field and told me i had to stop singing 
 she said those high notes are going to kill you 
 while she didn 't have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary
  she was absolutely emphatic i was singing my own obituary  
 i was very limited by my condition physically  
 but i was not limited when i sang  and as air came up from my lungs through my vocal cords
 and passed my lips as sound  it was the closest thing i
 had ever come
  and just because of someone 's hunch i wasn 't going to give it up  
 thankfully  i met reda girgis who is dry as toast but he and his team at johns hopkins
 didn 't just want me to survive they wanted me to live
 a meaningful life this meant making trade offs 
 i come from colorado it 's a mile high and i grew up there with
 ten brothers and sisters and two adoring parents well the altitude exacerbated my symptoms 
 so i moved to baltimore to be near my doctors and enrolled in a conservatory nearby
  i couldn 't walk as much as i used to so i opted for five inch heels and i gave up
  i started taking huge doses of
 sildenafil  also known as viagra 
 my father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing in alternative or traditional therapies for ph but after six
  i couldn 't walk up a small hill  i couldn 't climb a flight of stairs i could barely stand up without feeling like i was going to faint  
 i had a heart catheterization where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure  which is supposed to be between fifteen and twenty  mine
 was one hundred and forty six i like to do things big  
 and it meant one thing there is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called flolan
  and it 's not just a drug  it 's a way of life doctors insert a catheter into your chest 
 which is attached to a pump that weighs about  four and a half
 pounds 
 every day twenty four hours that pump is at your side administering medicine directly to your heart and
 it 's not
 a particularly
  preferable medicine in many senses  this is a list of the side effects if you eat
 too much salt 
 like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you 'll probably end up in the icu if you go through a metal detector you 'll probably die  if you
 get a bubble in your medicine because you have to mix it every morning and it stays in there you probably die
  die  if you run out of medicine you definitely die  no one wants to go on flolan  but when i needed
 it it was a godsend  
 within a few days i could walk again  within a few weeks i was performing  and in a few months  i debuted at the kennedy center 
 was a little bit problematic when performing so i 'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ace bandage
  literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone stuffing the pump into my spanx hoping the doors wouldn 't open unexpectedly
 and the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume
  designers  
 i graduated from graduate school in two thousand and six 
 and i got a fellowship to go back to europe 
 a few days after arriving i met this wonderful old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles and before long i was commuting between budapest milan and florence  
 though i was attached to this ugly
  my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera very complicated but in a good way  then in
 february
 of two thousand and eight my grandfather passed away  he was a big figure in all of our lives and we loved him
 very much it certainly didn 't prepare me for what came next
  weeks later i got a call from my family my father had been in a catastrophic
 car accident  and he died 
 at twenty four my death would have been entirely expected  but his
 well the only way i can articulate
 how it felt was that it precipitated my
  medical decline  
 against my doctors ' and family 's wishes i needed to go back for the funeral  i had to say goodbye in some way shape or form  
 but soon i was showing signs of right heart failure  and i had to return to sea level doing so knowing that i probably would never
  canceled most of my engagements that summer but i had one left in tel aviv so i went 
 after one performance  i could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxicab  i sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face  and
 in the heat of the desert  i was freezing cold my fingers started turning blue  and i was like
 is going on here i heard my heart 's valves snapping open and closed the cab stopped and i pulled my body from it feeling 
  each ounce of weight as i walked to the elevator  i fell through my apartment door and crawled to the bathroom
  dying  and if i didn 't mix that stuff up fast  i would never leave that apartment alive  
 i started mixing and i felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another  but i just kept on going finally with the last bottle in and the last bubble out i attached the pump to the tubing and lay there hoping it would kick in
  soon enough if it didn 't i 'd probably see my father sooner than i anticipated  
 thankfully 
 in a few minutes i saw the signature hive like rash appear on my legs  
 which is a side effect of the medication and i knew i 'd be okay we
 're not big on fear in my family  
 but i was scared 
 i went back to the states anticipating i 'd return to europe  but the heart catheterization showed that
 wasn 't going
 anywhere further that a flight for life from johns hopkins hospital i performed here and there but as my condition deteriorated so did my voice 
 my doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant  i didn 't  
 i had two friends who had recently died months after having very challenging surgeries i knew another young man though who had ph who died while waiting
  for one i wanted to live i thought stem cells were a good option  but
 they hadn 't developed to a point where i could take advantage of them yet 
 i officially took a break from singing  and i went to the cleveland clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years for transplant
  i was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon and i
 asked him if i needed a transplant  what i could do to prepare 
 he said be happy a happy patient is a healthy patient 
 it was like in one verbal swoop he had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and
  i still didn 't want a transplant
 but in a month  i was back in the hospital with some severely edemic kankles
 very attractive  and it was right heart failure  i
 finally decided it was time to take my doctor 's advice  it was time for me to go to cleveland
 and to start the agonizing wait
  for a match  
 but the next morning  
 while i was still in the hospital  i got a telephone call it was my doctor in cleveland marie budev 
 and they had lungs  it was a match they were from texas  and everybody was really happy for me
  problems i had spent my whole life training my lungs and i was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up i
 flew to cleveland 
 and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye  
 but organs
  and i went into surgery before
 i could say goodbye 
 the last thing i remember was lying on a white blanket  telling my surgeon that i needed to see my mother again  
 and to please try and save my voice  i fell into this apocalyptic dream world during the
  blood were infused into my body  
 and in my surgeon 's 20 year career he said it was among the most difficult transplants that he 's ever performed 
 they left my chest open for two weeks you could see my over sized heart
 beating
 inside of it i was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive
 infection ravaged my skin
  i
 had hoped my voice would be saved but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it
 if they stayed in there was no way i would ever sing again  so
  the top guy at the clinic to come down and give me
 surgery to move the tubes around my voice box 
 he said it would kill me so my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last ditch attempt
 to save my voice  though my mom couldn 't say goodbye to me before the surgery she didn 't leave my side in the months of recovery that followed  
 and if you want an example
  example of perseverance  grit
 and strength in a beautiful little package  it is her 
 one year ago to this very day  i woke up i was
  there were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body  i couldn 't walk  i couldn 't talk i couldn 't eat  i couldn 't move i certainly couldn 't sing  
 i couldn 't even breathe  
 but when i looked up and i saw my mother  
 i couldn 't help but smile  whether by a mack truck or by heart failure or
  faulty lungs death happens  but life isn 't
 really just about avoiding death is it it 's about living  
 medical conditions don 't negate the human condition  and
 when people are allowed to pursue their passions doctors will find they have better happier and healthier patients my parents were totally stressed out
  about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place but they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time
 and i 'm so grateful they did this past summer  when i was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the colorado rockies  
 i couldn 't help but think of that
  doctor who told me
 that i couldn 't sing  and i wanted to tell her  and i want to tell you we need to stop
 letting disease divorce us from our dreams when we do we will find that patients don
  and some of us might even sing
