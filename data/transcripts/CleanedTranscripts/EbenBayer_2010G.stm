  like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years  
 but before i do that i need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics which require huge amounts of energy to create
 and because of their disposal issues are slowly poisoning our planet
 i also want to tell you and share with you
 how my team and i have been using mushrooms over the last three years
  not like that 
 we 're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials  which perform a lot like plastics during their use but are made from crop waste and are totally compostable
 at the end of their lives
  but first i need to talk to you about what i consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category 
 this is a material you all know is styrofoam  but i like to think of it as toxic white stuff 
 in a single cubic foot of this material about what would come around your computer or large television
 you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol yet after just a few weeks of use
  throw this material in the trash  
 and this isn 't just found in packaging 
 twenty billion dollars of this material is produced every year in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops  and that 's not the only place it 's found 
 the epa estimates in the united states by volume this material occupies twenty five percent of our landfills  
 even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment on the side of the
  road or next to a river  if it 's not picked up by a human like me and you it 'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years  perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans 
 like in the great plastic gyre  where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits but they 're not really going away  they 're not biologically compatible 
 they 're basically fouling up earth 's respiratory and circulatory systems  and because these materials are so prolific 
 because they 're found in so many places there 's one other place you 'll find this material
  which is made from benzene a known carcinogen you 'll find it
 inside of you 
 so for all these reasons i think we need better materials and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials  
 the first is feedstocks  
 today we use a single feedstock petroleum to heat our homes  power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you we recognize this is a finite
  resource  and it 's simply crazy to do this to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash every time you get a package  
 second of all  we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials i say far less because ten percent isn 't going to cut it  we should be talking about half a quarter
 one tenth the energy content 
 and lastly and i think perhaps
  we should be creating materials that fit into what i call nature 's recycling system 
 this recycling system has been in place for the last billion years  i fit into it you fit into it and a hundred years tops my body can return to the earth with no preprocessing  
 yet that packaging i got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years  this is crazy  
 but nature provides us with a really good model here 
 when a tree 's done using its leaves its solar collectors these amazing molecular photon capturing devices at the end of a season
  doesn 't pack them up take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves it just drops them the shortest distance possible to the forest floor 
 where they 're actually upcycled into next year 's topsoil  and this
 gets us back to the mushrooms because in nature mushrooms are the recycling system  and what we
  by using a part of the mushroom you 've probably never seen
 analogous to its root structure it 's called mycelium
 we can actually grow materials with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics  
 now mycelium is an amazing material  because it 's a self assembling material it actually takes things we would consider waste things like seed husks or woody biomass
 and can transform them into a chitinous polymer which you can form into almost any
  in our process  we basically use it
 as a glue  
 and by using mycelium as a glue you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry 
 and you can create materials with many different properties materials that are insulating
 materials that can absorb impacts that can absorb acoustical impacts  but these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts not
  and because they 're made of natural materials they are one hundred percent compostable in you own backyard  
 so i 'd like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials  
 the first is selecting a feedstock  preferably something that 's regional that 's in your area right local manufacturing  
 the next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool physically filling an enclosure a mold in whatever shape you want to get 
 then
 you actually grow the mycelium through these particles
  and that 's where the magic happens because the organism is doing the work in this process not the equipment the final step is of course the product whether it 's a packaging material a table top or
 building block 
 our vision is local manufacturing like the local food movement for production so we 've created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts  if you 're in china 
 you might use a rice husk
 or a cottonseed hull if you 're in northern europe or north america
  you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls  
 we then process these husks with some basic equipment and i want to share with you a quick video from our facility that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale
  so what you 're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from texas in this case it 's a waste product  and what they 're doing in our equipment
 is going through a continuous system
  these materials  while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium this gives us a continuous stream of material that we can put into almost any shape though
 today we 're making corner blocks and it 's when this lid goes on the part that the magic really starts because the manufacturing process is our organism it
 'll actually begin to digest these wastes and over the next five days  assemble them into biocomposites
  entire facility
 is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools sitting indoors in the dark  quietly  self assembling materials and everything from building materials
 to in this case a packaging corner block  so i 've said a number of times that we grow materials and
 it 's kind of hard to picture how that happens  so my team has taken five days worth of growth a typical growth cycle for us and condensed it into
 15 second time lapse  and i want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen 
 because over the five day period what they do is extend out and through this material using the energy that 's contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix 
 this matrix  self assembles growing through and around the particles making millions and millions of tiny
  and what parts of the seed husk we don 't digest actually become part of the final physical composite  
 so in front of your eyes this part just  self assembled it actually takes a little longer it takes five days  but it 's much faster than conventional farming 
 the last step of course is application in this case we 've grown a corner block 
 a major fortune five hundred furniture maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment they used to use a plastic packaging buffer  
 but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance
 with our grown material  
 best of all 
 when it gets to the customer it 's not trash they can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing  and it 's going to improve the local soil 
 so why mycelium the first reason is local open feedstocks you want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls  because you have
  because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process you don 't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility so you can have lots of small facilities spread all across the world 
 biological yield is really important  and because one hundred percent of what we put in the tool become the final product  even the parts that aren 't digested become part of the structure we
 're getting incredible yield rates 
 natural polymers
  i think that 's what 's most important  
 because these polymers have been tried and tested in our ecosystem for the last billion years  in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans they 're not going to clog up earth 's ecosystems they work great  
 and while today we can practically guarantee that yesterday 's packaging is going to be here in ten thousand years 
 what i want to guarantee
 is that in ten thousand years  our descendants our children 's children will be living happily and in harmony
 with a healthy earth  and i think that can be some really good news  thank you
