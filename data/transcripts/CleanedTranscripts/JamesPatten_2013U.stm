  computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression 
 but for the most part that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones 
 and i 'd like to tell you a story about bringing this power of the computer to move things around and interact with us
  off of the screen and into the physical world in which we live 
 a few years ago i got a call from a luxury fashion store called barneys new york  and the next thing i knew  i was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays this one 's called 
 the chase there are two pairs of shoes a man 's pair and a woman 's pair and they play out this slow tense chase around the window in which the man scoots up behind the woman and gets in her
  personal space  and then she moves away each of the shoes has magnets in it  and there are magnets underneath the table that move the shoes around 
 my friend andy cavatorta was building a robotic harp for bjork 's biophilia tour and i wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and play
  the harp has four separate pendulums and each pendulum has eleven strings so the harp swings on its axis and also rotates in order to play different musical notes 
 and the harps are all networked together so that they can play the right notes at the right time in the music  
 i built an interactive chemistry exhibit at the museum of science and industry in chicago  
 and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to
  happen  and the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit and a researcher from a science education center in australia
 decided to study this exhibit and try to figure out what was going on 
 and she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit and were helping people learn in a social way  
 and when you think about it this makes a lot of sense that using
  specialized physical objects would help people
 use an interface more easily  i mean our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible objects think about which you find easier to use a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard like on a phone  
 but the thing that struck me about all of these different projects
  is that they really had to be built from scratch  down to the level of the electronics and the printed circuit boards and all the mechanisms all the way up to the software  
 i wanted to create something where we could move objects under computer control and create interactions around that idea without having to go through this process of building 
  something from scratch every single time  so my first attempt at this was at the mit media lab with professor hiroshi ishii  and we built this array of five hundred and twelve different
  electromagnets and together they were able to move objects around on top of their surface  
 but the problem with this was that these magnets cost over ten thousand dollars  although each one was pretty small altogether they weighed so much that the table that they were on started to sag  so i wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on
  to explore this idea i built an army of small robots and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels they 're these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions 
 and when you couple these robots with a video projector you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information
  we want to tweak the color we just enter the color mode and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color 
 or if we want to adjust the audio then we get two different dials for that these physical objects so here the left and right channel stay in sync  but if we want to we can override that by grabbing both of them at the same time  
 so the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility
  and versatility of a system that 's designed in software  
 and this is a mapping application for disaster response so you have these physical objects that represent police fire and rescue  and a dispatcher can grab 
  them and place them on the map to tell those units where to go  and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of those units in the real world
  this is a video chat application it 's amazing how much emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object 
 with this interface we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games
 and arcade games where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible 
 but one of the areas that i 'm most excited about using this platform for
 is applying it to problems that are difficult for computers or people to solve alone one example of those is protein folding  so here we have an interface where we have physical 
  handles onto a protein and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways 
  feel these physical handles pulling back against us so feeling what 's going on inside a molecular simulation is a whole different level of interaction 
 so we 're just beginning to explore what 's possible when we use software to control the movement of objects in our environment 
 maybe this is
  the computer of the future  there 's no touchscreen 
 there 's no technology visible at all but when we want to have a video chat or play a game or lay out the slides to our next ted talk 
 the objects on the table come alive
