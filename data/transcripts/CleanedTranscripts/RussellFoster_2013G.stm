  what i 'd like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects  and that is the neuroscience of sleep
  to most of us and of course it 's the sound of the alarm clock  and what that truly ghastly awful sound does is stop
 the single most important
 behavioral experience that we have and that 's sleep  if
 you 're an average sort of person thirty six percent of your life will be spent asleep  which means that if you live to ninety then
  years will have been spent entirely asleep  
 now what that thirty two years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important  and yet for most of us we don 't give sleep a second thought 
 we throw it away we really just don 't think about sleep and so what i 'd like to do today is change your views  change your ideas and your thoughts
  thoughts about sleep and the journey that i want to take you on  we need to start by going back in time 
 enjoy the  honey heavy dew of slumber any ideas who said that 
 shakespeare 's julius caesar  yes let me give you a few more
  o gentle sleep  nature 's soft nurse how have i frighted thee shakespeare again from i won 't say it the scottish play 
 from the same time sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together extremely prophetic by thomas dekker  another elizabethan dramatist  
 but if we jump forward four hundred years the tone
 about sleep
  changes somewhat this is from thomas edison from the beginning of the 20th century sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days bang 
 and if we
 also jump into the 1980s some of you may remember that margaret thatcher was reported to have said sleep is for wimps 
 and of course the infamous what was his name  the infamous gordon gekko from
  wall street said money never sleeps what do we do in the 20th century about sleep  well  of course  we use thomas edison 's light bulb
 to invade the night  and we occupied the dark  and in the process of this occupation we 've treated sleep as an illness  almost we 've treated it as an enemy an enemy
  we tolerate the need for sleep and at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep as an illness that needs some sort of a cure 
 and our ignorance ignorance about sleep is really quite profound  
 why is it why do we abandon sleep in our thoughts well it 's because you don 't do anything much while you 're asleep it seems  you don 't eat you
  most of us anyway  and so therefore it 's sorry  it
 's a complete waste of time right wrong 
 actually sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology  and neuroscientists are beginning to explain why it 's so very important  so let 's move to the brain  
 now here we have a brain  
 this is donated by a social
  scientist  and they said they didn 't know what it was or indeed how to use it so sorry 
 so i borrowed it i don 't think they noticed  ok 
 the point i 'm trying to make is that when you 're asleep this
  thing doesn 't shut down in fact some areas of the brain are actually more active during the sleep state than during the wake state  
 the other thing that 's really important about sleep is that it doesn 't arise from a single structure within the brain  
 but is to some extent a network property if we flip the brain on its back
 i love this little bit of spinal cord here
 this bit here is the hypothalamus  and right under there
  a whole raft of interesting structures not least the biological clock the biological clock tells us when it 's good to be up  when it 's good to be asleep  and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other
 areas within the hypothalamus the lateral hypothalamus the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei all of those combine and they send projections down to the brain stem here  the brain stem then
 projects forward and bathes the cortex this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here with neurotransmitters that keep us
  awake and essentially provide us with our consciousness  
 so sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactions within the brain  and essentially sleep is turned on and off as a result of a range of interactions in here  
 ok  so where have we got to we 've said that sleep
 is complicated and it takes
  of our life but what i haven 't explained is
 what sleep is about so why do we sleep 
 and it won 't surprise any of you that of course as scientists we don 't have a consensus there are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep 
 and i 'm going to outline three of those the first is sort of the restoration idea and it 's
 somewhat intuitive essentially  all the stuff we 've burned
 during the day  we restore we replace we rebuild during the night  and indeed as an explanation  it goes back to aristotle so that 's what two thousand three hundred years ago it
 's gone in and out of fashion it 's fashionable at the moment because what 's been shown is that within the brain a whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep 
 and those genes are associated with restoration and metabolic pathways  so there 's good
  evidence for the whole restoration hypothesis  what about energy conservation again  perhaps intuitive
 you essentially sleep to save calories  now  when you do the sums though it doesn 't really pan out if you compare an individual who has
 slept at night  or stayed awake and hasn 't moved very much 
 the energy saving of sleeping is about one hundred and ten calories a night  now that 's the equivalent
 of a hot dog bun
  bun now i would say that
 a hot dog bun is kind of a meager return for such a complicated and demanding behavior as sleep  so i 'm less convinced by the the energy conservation idea  
 but the third idea i 'm quite attracted to which is brain processing and memory consolidation what we know
 is that if after you 've tried to learn a task and you
  ability to learn that task is smashed  it 's really hugely attenuated  so sleep and memory consolidation is also very important  however  it 's not just the laying down of memory and recalling it 
 what 's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep in fact it 's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage
  sleeping at night
 enhances our creativity and what seems to be going on is that in the brain  those neural connections that are important those synaptic connections that are important are linked 
 and strengthened while those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important  
  vary and it 's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons  but sleep
 is not an indulgence  it 's not some sort of thing that we can
 take on board rather casually  i think that sleep was once
 likened to an upgrade from economy to business class you know the equivalent of   it 's not even
 an upgrade from economy to first class  the critical thing to realize is that
  't sleep  
 you don 't fly 
 essentially you never get there 
 and what 's extraordinary about much of our society these days is that we are desperately sleep deprived so let 's now look at sleep deprivation  
 huge sectors of society are sleep deprived and let 's look at our sleep o meter 
  good data suggests that most of us were getting around eight hours of sleep a night  nowadays  we sleep one and a half to two hours less every night  so we 're in the 
 league 
 for teenagers  it 's worse much worse they need nine hours for full brain performance  and many of them on a school night  are only getting five hours of sleep  it 's simply not enough 
 if we think about other sectors of society the aged
 are aged then your ability to sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted and many sleep  again less than five hours a night shift work shift work is extraordinary  
 perhaps twenty percent of the working population  and
 the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night  it 's locked onto the same light dark cycle as the rest of us so when the poor old shift worker is going home to try and sleep during the day desperately tired
  body clock is saying wake up this is the time to be awake so the quality
 of sleep  that you get as a night shift worker is usually very poor again in that sort of  five hour region  
 and then of course  tens of millions of people suffer from jet lag  so who here has jet lag
  well  my goodness gracious  well thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep because that 's what your brain is craving one of the things that the
  brain does is indulge in
 this involuntary falling asleep  and you have essentially no control over it now micro sleeps can be sort of somewhat embarrassing  but they can also be deadly  
 it 's been estimated that thirty one percent of drivers will fall asleep
 at the wheel at least once in their life and in the us the statistics are pretty good one hundred thousand accidents
 on the freeway have been associated with tiredness loss of vigilance and falling asleep a hundred thousand a year it 's extraordinary 
 at another level of terror  we dip into the tragic accidents at chernobyl and indeed the space shuttle challenger which was so tragically lost  
 and in the investigations that followed those
  poor judgment as a result of extended shift work and loss of vigilance and tiredness was attributed to a big chunk of of those those disasters  
 when you 're tired and you lack sleep you have poor memory you have poor creativity  you have increased impulsiveness and you have
 overall poor judgment but my friends  it 's so much
  the brain is craving things to wake it up  so drugs stimulants caffeine represents the stimulant of choice across much of the western world 
 much of the day is fueled by caffeine and if you 're a really naughty tired brain  nicotine of course you 're fueling the waking state with these
  what do we do about that when i 'm feeling completely wired well of course you then resort to alcohol
 now alcohol
 short term you know once or twice to use to mildly sedate you can be very useful it can actually ease the the sleep transition  but what you must be so aware of
 is that alcohol doesn 't provide sleep a biological mimic for sleep it sedates you so it actually harms some of
  processing that 's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall  so it 's a  short term acute measure  but for goodness sake don 't become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night  
 another connection between loss loss of sleep is weight gain  
 if you sleep around about five hours or less every night  then you have a fifty percent likelihood of being obese what 's the connection here
  well  sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin  the hunger hormone ghrelin is released  
 it gets gets to the brain  the brain says i need carbohydrates and what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars  so there 's a link between
 tiredness and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain 
  and one of the things of stress of course is loss of memory which is what i sort of just then had a little lapse of
 but stress is so much more  so   if you 're acutely stressed not a great problem  
 but it 's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that 's the problem
 sustained stress leads to suppressed immunity  and so tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection and there 's some very good studies
  showing that shift workers for example have higher rates of cancer  increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation glucose becomes
 a dominant part of the vasculature and essentially you become glucose intolerant  therefore  diabetes two 
 stress increases cardiovascular disease
  raising blood pressure  so there 's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss
 that are more than just a mildly impaired brain which is where i think most people think that sleep sleep loss resides  so at this point in the talk  this is a nice time to think well  do you think on the whole i 'm getting enough sleep 
 so a quick show of hands who feels that
 they 're getting enough sleep here oh well
  talk more about that later about what are your tips  so most of us of course  
 ask the question how do i know whether i 'm getting enough sleep well  it 's not rocket science  if you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning
  if you are taking a long time to get up  if you need lots of stimulants if you 're grumpy if you 're irritable  if you 're told by your work colleagues that you 're looking tired and irritable  chances are you are
  this is slightly offensive sleep for dummies 
 make your bedroom a haven for sleep  
 the first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can and also make it slightly cool very important actually 
 reduce your amount of light exposure at least half an hour before you go to bed light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep what 's the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed we
  in a massively lit bathroom
 looking into the mirror cleaning our teeth it 's the worst thing we can possibly do before we go to sleep  
 turn off those mobile phones turn off those computers  turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain
  try not to drink caffeine too late in the day  ideally not after lunch
  set about reducing light exposure before you go to bed  but light exposure in the morning is very good at setting the biological clock to the light dark cycle  so seek out morning light 
 basically  listen to yourself  
 wind down do those sorts of things that you know are going to ease you off into the into the honey heavy dew of slumber  
 ok  that 's some facts what about some myths teenagers
  poor things they have a biological predisposition to go to bed late and get up late so give them a break  we need eight hours of sleep a night  
 that 's an average some people need more some people need less and what you need to do is listen to your body do you need that much or do you need more simple as that 
 old people need less sleep not true 
 the sleep demands of the aged do not go down essentially sleep fragments and becomes less
 robust  but sleep requirements do not go down  
 and the fourth myth is early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy  wealthy and wise well that 's wrong at so many different levels 
 laughter there is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early gives you more wealth at all there 's no difference in socioeconomic status 
 in my experience
  only difference between morning people and evening people is that those people that get up in the morning early are just horribly smug 
 ok  
 so for the last few minutes what i want to do is change gears and talk about some really new breaking areas of neuroscience which is the association between
 mental health mental illness and sleep disruption
 we 've known for one hundred and thirty years that in severe mental illness there is always always sleep disruption
 but it 's been largely ignored in the  1970s when people started to think about this again they said yes well of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia  because they 're on antipsychotics  it 's the antipsychotics causing
  the fact that for a hundred years previously 
 sleep disruption had been reported before antipsychotics  so what 's going on several groups are studying
 conditions like depression schizophrenia and bipolar and what 's going on in terms of sleep disruption we have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia 
  and the data were quite extraordinary in those individuals with schizophrenia  
  they were awake during the night phase and then they were asleep during the day  other groups showed no 24 hour patterns whatsoever their sleep was absolutely smashed  and some
 had no ability to regulate their sleep by the light dark cycle they were getting up later and later and later and later each night  it was smashed  
 so what 's going on 
 and the really exciting news is that
 mental illness and
  sleep are not simply associated  
 but they are physically linked within the brain  the neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep give you normal sleep and those that give you normal mental health are overlapping  
 and what 's the evidence for that  well  genes
 that have been shown to be very important in the generation of normal
  when mutated when changed also predispose individuals to mental health problems 
 and last year we published a study which showed that a gene that 's been linked to schizophrenia 
 when mutated also smashes the sleep  so we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap between these two important systems  
 other work flowed from these studies  the first was that sleep disruption actually precedes certain types of mental illness
  and we 've shown that in those young individuals who are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clinical diagnosis of of bipolar 
 the other bit of data was that
 sleep disruption may actually exacerbate make
  mental illness state my colleague dan freeman has used a range of agents which have stabilized sleep
 and reduced levels of paranoia in those individuals by fifty percent so what have we got  we 've got  in
 these connections some really exciting things 
 in terms of the neuroscience by understanding these two systems we 're really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain  
 the second area is that
 if we can use sleep and sleep disruption as an early warning signal then we have the chance of going in if we know these individuals are vulnerable
 early intervention then becomes possible  and the third which i think is the most exciting is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target  stabilize sleep in those individuals
  who are vulnerable we can certainly make them healthier  but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness  so let me just finish what i started by saying is 
 take sleep seriously our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a pre industrial age when we were almost
 wrapped in a duvet we used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep and this isn 't
 some sort of crystal waving nonsense this is a pragmatic response to good health  if you have good sleep
  increases your concentration attention decision making creativity  social skills health  if you get sleep  it reduces your mood changes your stress your levels 
  of anger your impulsivity and your tendency to drink and take drugs  and we finished by saying
  illness and indeed is providing us new ways to treat these incredibly debilitating conditions  
 jim butcher  the fantasy writer said sleep is god go worship and i can only recommend that you do the same  thank you
