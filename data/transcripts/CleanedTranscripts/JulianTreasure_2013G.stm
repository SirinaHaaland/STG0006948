  the human voice  it 's the instrument we all play  
 it 's the most powerful sound in the world probably it 's the only one that can start a war or say i love you 
 and yet many people have the experience that when they speak people don 't listen to them and why is that how can we
  speak powerfully
 to make change in the world 
 what i 'd like to suggest there are a number of habits that we need to move away from i 've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking i 'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list 
 but these seven i think are pretty large
 habits that we can all fall into  first 
  speaking ill of somebody who 's not present not a nice habit and we know perfectly well the person gossiping five minutes later will be gossiping about us  
 second  judging 
 we know people who are like this in conversation and it 's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you 're being judged and found wanting at the same time  
 third negativity  you can fall
  into this my mother in the last years of her life became very very negative and it 's hard to listen i remember one day i said to her 
 it 's october one today and she said i know isn 't it dreadful it
 's hard to listen when somebody 's that negative 
 laughter and another form of negativity complaining well this is the national art of the u k it 's our national sport we complain about the weather
  about politics about everything but actually complaining is viral misery  it 's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world  
 excuses  we 've all met this guy  maybe we 've all been this guy some people have 
 they just pass it on to everybody else and don 't take responsibility for their actions and again hard to listen to somebody who is being like that 
 penultimate  the sixth of the seven  embroidery 
 exaggeration it demeans our language actually
  sometimes for example if i see something that really is awesome what do i call it 
 laughter and then of course this exaggeration becomes lying and we don 't want to listen to people we know are lying to us  
 and finally  dogmatism 
 the confusion of facts
 with opinions when those two things get conflated you 're listening into the wind
  is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true  it 's difficult to listen to that 
 so here they are seven deadly sins of speaking these are things i think we need to avoid  
 but is there a positive way to think about this yes there is i 'd
 like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones
  that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world  
 fortunately these things spell a word  the word is hail and it has a great definition as well  i 'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head  
 i 'm talking about this definition to greet or acclaim enthusiastically which is how i think our words will be received
 if we stand on these four things so what do they stand for see if you can guess  the h  honesty of course
 being true in what you say being straight and clear 
 the a is authenticity 
 just being yourself a friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth which i think is a lovely way to put it the i is integrity 
 being your word actually doing what you say  and being somebody people can trust 
  i don 't mean romantic love  but i do mean wishing people well 
 for two reasons first of all i think absolute honesty may not be what we want i mean my goodness you look ugly this morning perhaps
 that 's not necessary  
 tempered with love of course honesty is a great thing but also if you 're really wishing somebody well  it 's very hard to judge them at the same time  
 i 'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously
  so hail  
 also  now that 's what you say and it 's like the old song it is what you say it 's also the way that you say it 
 you have an amazing toolbox this instrument is incredible 
 and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened i 'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with 
 which will increase the power of your speaking 
 register for example
  now  falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time  
 but there 's a register in between i 'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches you can locate your voice however  so if i talk up here in my nose you can hear the difference if i go down here in my throat which is where most of us speak from most of the time  
 but if you want weight  you need to go down here to the chest you hear the difference
  for politicians with lower voices it 's true  because we associate depth with power
 and with authority 
 that 's register  
 then we have timbre  it 's the the way your voice feels again the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich  smooth  warm 
 like hot chocolate 
 well if that 's not you that 's not the end of the world
  because you can train go and get a voice coach  and there are amazing things you can do with breathing with posture and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice 
 then prosody i love prosody this is the sing song the meta language that we use in order to impart meaning it 's root one for meaning in conversation 
 people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don 't have any prosody at all
  that 's where the word  monotonic comes from or monotonous  monotone 
 also we have repetitive prosody now coming in where every sentence ends as if it were a question
 when it 's actually not a question it 's a statement 
 and if you repeat that one it 's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody which i think is a shame  
 so let 's try and break that habit
 pace i can get very very excited by saying something really really quickly or i can slow right down
 to emphasize  and at the end of that of course is our old friend silence there
 's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk is there we don 't have to fill it with ums
  can be very powerful 
 of course pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal but you can do it just with pitch where did you leave my keys where did you leave my keys so 
 slightly different
 meaning in those two deliveries  and finally volume i can get really excited
 by using volume sorry about that if i startled anybody or i can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet  some people broadcast the
  whole time try not to do that that 's called sodcasting 
 imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately not nice 
 of course where this all comes into play most of all is when you 've got something really important to do it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people it might be proposing marriage 
 asking for a raise 
 a wedding speech
  it is if it 's really important you owe it to yourself
 to look at this toolbox and the engine that it 's going to work on and no engine works well without being warmed up warm up your voice 
 actually let me show you how to do that would you all like to stand up for a moment  
 i 'm going to show you the six vocal warm up exercises that i do before every talk i ever do any time you 're going to
  to anybody important do these first arms up  deep breath in and sigh out ahhhhh like that one more time ahhhh 
 very good  now we 're going to warm up our lips  and we 're going to go ba
  now your lips should be coming alive we 're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la la la la la la la la la 
 beautiful you 're getting really good at this and then roll an r rrrrrrr 
 that 's like champagne for the tongue finally  and if i can only do one the pros call this the siren it 's really good
  next time you speak do those in advance now let me just put this in context to close this is a serious point here 
 this is where we are now right we speak not very
  people who simply aren 't listening in an environment that 's all about noise and bad acoustics i have talked about that on this stage in different phases what would the world be like
 if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously
 in environments which were actually fit for purpose or to make that a bit larger  what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously
 and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound that would
  be a world that does sound beautiful  and one where understanding would be the norm and that is an idea worth spreading  thank you
