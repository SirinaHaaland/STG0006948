  there have been many revolutions over the last century but perhaps none as significant as the longevity revolution 
 we are living on average today thirty four years longer than our great grandparents did think about that that 's an entire second
  adult lifetime that 's been added to our lifespan  
 and yet for the most part our culture has not come to terms with what this means we 're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch that 's the 
  metaphor the old metaphor you 're born you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude
  today philosophers artists doctors scientists
 are taking a new look at what i call the third act the last three decades of life 
 they realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life
 with its own significance as different from midlife as adolescence
  and they are asking we we should all be asking how do we use this time 
 how do we live it successfully what is the appropriate new metaphor for aging 
 i 've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject and i have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging is a staircase
 the upward ascension of the human spirit  bringing us into
  wisdom wholeness and authenticity  age not at all as pathology  age as potential and guess what 
 this potential is not for the lucky few  it turns out most people over fifty
 feel better are less stressed less hostile less anxious we tend to see commonalities more than differences some of the studies even
  say we 're happier this is not what i expected trust me i come from a long line of depressives  
 as i was approaching my late 40s when i would wake up in the morning my first six thoughts would all be negative and i got scared i thought oh my gosh i 'm going to become a crotchety old lady 
 but now
  in the middle of my own third act  i realize i 've never been happier  i have such a powerful feeling of well being 
 and i 've discovered that
 when you 're inside oldness as opposed to looking at it from the outside fear subsides you realize you 're still yourself
 maybe even more so picasso once said it takes a long time to become young
  want to romanticize aging obviously there 's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth
  some of it is a matter of luck  some of it obviously is genetic 
 one third of it in fact is genetic and there isn 't much we can do about that but that means
 that two thirds of how well we do in the third
  we can do something about 
 we 're going to discuss what we can do to make these added years really successful  and use them to make a difference 
 now let me say something about the staircase which may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors given the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs laughter
 myself included  
 as you may know the entire world operates on a universal
 law  entropy the second law of thermodynamics  
 entropy means that everything in the world everything is in a state of decline and decay the arch  
 there 's only one exception to this universal law 
 and that is the human spirit  which can continue to evolve upwards the staircase  bringing us into wholeness authenticity
  and wisdom 
 and here 's an example of what i mean this upward ascension can happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges about three years ago i read an article in the new york times it
 was about a man named neil selinger fifty seven years old a retired lawyer  
 who had joined the writers ' group at sarah lawrence where he found his writer 's voice  
  later he was diagnosed with  als commonly known as lou gehrig 's disease it 's a terrible disease it 's fatal 
 it wastes the body but the mind remains intact 
 in this article mr selinger wrote the following
 to describe what was happening to him  and i quote 
 as my muscles weakened my writing became stronger
 as i slowly lost my speech i gained my voice  
 as i diminished  i grew  as i lost so much i finally started to find myself 
 neil selinger to me is the embodiment of mounting the staircase in his third act  
 now we 're all born with spirit all of us
 but sometimes it gets tamped down beneath the challenges of life violence abuse  neglect 
 perhaps our parents suffered from depression perhaps they weren 't able to love us beyond how we performed in the world
  perhaps we still suffer from
 a psychic pain a wound  perhaps we feel that many of our relationships have not had closure  and so we can
  feel unfinished perhaps the task of the third act
 is to finish up the task of finishing ourselves for me it began as i was approaching
 my third act my 60th birthday 
 how was i supposed to live it what was i supposed to accomplish in this final act  and i realized that in order to know where i was going
 i had to know where i 'd been 
 and so i went back and i studied my first two acts  trying to see who i was then who i really was not who
 my parents or other people told me i was or treated me like i was but who was i who were my parents not as parents but as
  who were my grandparents how did they treat my parents these kinds of things 
 i discovered a couple of years later  that this process that i had gone through
 is called by psychologists doing a life review and they say it can give new significance and clarity and meaning to a person 's life 
  as i did that a lot of things that you used to think were your fault 
 a lot of things you used to think about yourself really had nothing to do with you 
 it wasn 't your fault you 're just fine  and you 're able to go back and forgive them  and forgive yourself 
 you 're able to free yourself
 from your past you can work to change your relationship to your past
  now while i was writing about this i came upon a book called man 's search for meaning by viktor frankl 
 viktor frankl was a german psychiatrist  who 'd spent five years in a nazi concentration camp  
 and he wrote that while he was in the camp 
 he could tell should they ever be released which of the people
  and which would not and he wrote this 
 everything you have in life can be taken from you except one thing 
 your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation 
 this is what determines the quality of the life we 've lived
 not whether we 've been rich or
  famous or unknown healthy or suffering what determines our quality of life
 is how we relate to these realities what kind of meaning we assign them what kind of attitude we cling to about them what state of mind we allow them to trigger 
 perhaps the central purpose of the third act
 is to go back
 and to try  if appropriate to change our relationship to the past
 it turns out that cognitive research shows when we are able to do this it manifests neurologically
 neural pathways are created in the brain you see if you have over time  reacted negatively to past events and people neural pathways are laid down by chemical
  and electrical signals that are sent through the brain  and over time these neural pathways become hardwired they become the norm even if it 's bad for us because it causes us stress and anxiety 
 if however we can go back
 and alter our relationship re vision our relationship to past people and events neural pathways can change and if we can maintain the more positive
 feelings about the past that
  the new norm  it 's like resetting a thermostat it 's not having experiences that makes us
 wise  it 's reflecting on the experiences that we 've had
 that makes us wise and that helps us become whole  brings wisdom and authenticity
  it helps us become what we might have been  
 women start off whole  don 't we i mean as girls we 're feisty yeah who says 
 we have agency we are the subjects of our own lives  but very often many if not most of us when we hit puberty  we start worrying about fitting in and being popular 
 and we we become the subjects and objects of other people 's
  but now in our third acts  it may be possible for us
 to circle back to where we started and know it
 for the first time  and if we can do that it will not just be for ourselves  
 older women are the largest demographic in the world 
 if we can go back and redefine ourselves and become whole this will
 create a cultural shift in the world
 and it will give an example to younger generations so that they can reconceive their own lifespan  thank you very much
