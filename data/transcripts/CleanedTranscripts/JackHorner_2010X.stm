  a show of hands or a clapping of people in different generations  i 'm interested in how many are three to twelve years old
  to kind of go in a different direction right now i hope you all realize that so i 'll just give you my message up front  try not to go extinct that 's it 
 people ask me a lot in
 fact one of the most asked questions i get is why do children like
  get to the goose in a minute  so that 's sort of the theme big different and gone the title of my
  the cause of a premature extinction  
 now i assume that we remember dinosaurs and there 's lots of different shapes lots of different kinds 
 a long time ago 
 back in the early 
  museums were out looking for dinosaurs  they went out and gathered them up and this is an
  interesting story every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had so
 if the museum in toronto went out and collected
 a tyrannosaur a big one then the museum in ottawa wanted a bigger one  and a better one  
 and that happened for all museums  so everyone was out looking for all these
 bigger and better dinosaurs and
  some scientists were sitting around and they thought what in the world
 look at these dinosaurs they 're all big where
 are all the little ones 
 laughter and they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it where are the
  go to a museum you 'll see 
 see how many baby dinosaurs there are people assumed and this was actually a problem people assumed that
 if they had little dinosaurs if they had juvenile
  be easy to identify  you 'd have
 a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur 
 laughter but all they had were big dinosaurs  and it comes down to a couple of things first off 
 scientists have egos  and scientists like to name dinosaurs 
 they like to name anything  everybody likes to have their own
  and so every time they found something that looked a little different they named it something different and what happened of course is we ended up with a whole bunch of
 different dinosaurs 
 a light went on in somebody 's head dr peter dodson at the university of
 pennsylvania actually realized that
 dinosaurs
 grew kind of like birds do  which is different than the way
 reptiles grow and in fact  he used
 the cassowary as an example  and it 's kind of cool if you look at the cassowary  or any of the birds that have crests on their
  grow to about eighty percent adult size before the crest starts to grow 
 now think about that they 're basically retaining their juvenile characteristics very late in what we call ontogeny  so allometric 
 cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth
  and you didn 't know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary  you would think they were two different animals
 so this was a problem and peter dodson pointed this out using some duck billed dinosaurs
 then called hypacrosaurus and he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it
  should look like if it grew in sort of a linear fashion  
 it would have a crest about half the size of the adult but the actual
  sixty five percent had no crest at all so this was interesting so this is this is where people
  taken that taken peter dodson 's work and
 gone on with that then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have 
 but scientists have egos  they like to name things  and so
 they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different 
 now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur or any animal is a young one or an older one
 and that 's by actually cutting into their bones  but cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is
 hard to do as you can imagine because in museums 
 bones are precious you go into a museum and they take really good care
  they 're very well taken care of 
 they don 't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside so
 they don 't normally let you do that but
 i have a museum and i collect dinosaurs and i can saw mine open  so that 's what i do
  if you cut open a little dinosaur it 's very spongy inside like a and if you cut into an older dinosaur it 's very massive you can
 tell it 's mature bone so it 's real easy to tell them apart  so
 what i want to do is show you these in north america in the northern plains of the united states and the southern
  plains of alberta and saskatchewan there 's this unit of rock called the hell creek formation that produces the last dinosaurs that lived on earth  
 and there are twelve of them that everyone recognizes i mean the twelve primary dinosaurs that went extinct  
 and so we will evaluate them 
 and that 's sort of what i 've been doing so my students my staff
 we 've been
 cutting them open  now as you can imagine cutting open a leg bone is one thing but when you
 go to a museum and say you don 't mind if i cut open your
 dinosaur 's skull do you
  here are twelve dinosaurs  and we want to look at these three first so these are dinosaurs that are called 
  and everybody knows that these three animals are related  and the assumption is that they 're related like cousins or
 whatever but no one ever considered that they might be more closely related
  in other words people looked at them and they saw the differences  
 and you all know that if you are going to determine whether you 're related to your brother or your sister  you can 't do it by looking at differences  
 you can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities  so
 people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are pachycephalosaurus has a big
  dome on its head  and it 's got some little bumps on the back of its head  and it 's got a bunch of gnarly things on the end of its nose  
 and then stygimoloch another dinosaur from the same age lived at the same time 
 has spikes sticking out the back of its head  it 's got a little tiny dome and it 's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose  
 and then there 's this thing called dracorex
 guess where that came from  dragon  so
 here 's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head  no dome
 and gnarly stuff on its nose  nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike 
 but they did look at these three and they said these are three different dinosaurs and dracorex is probably the most primitive of them and the other one is
 more primitive than the
  other it 's unclear to me how they
 actually sorted these three of them out but if you line them up if you just take those three skulls and just line them up 
 they line up like this dracorex is the littlest one  stygimoloch is the middle size one  
 pachycephalosaurus is the largest one and one would think 
 that should give me a clue
 laughter but it didn 't give them a clue because 
 well we know why  scientists like to name things so
 if we cut open dracorex i cut open our dracorex and look it was spongy inside  
 really spongy inside  i mean
  a juvenile and it 's growing really fast  
 so it is going to get bigger if you cut open stygimoloch it is doing the same thing the dome that little dome is growing really fast it 's inflating very fast 
 what 's interesting is
 the spike on the back of the dracorex was growing very fast as well the spikes on the back of the stygimoloch are actually resorbing  which means they 're getting smaller
 as that dome is getting bigger and if we look at pachycephalosaurus
  pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome
 and
 its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing  so
 just with these three dinosaurs as a scientist we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series
 of the same animal 
  of course means we have ten primary dinosaurs to deal with
  colleague of mine at berkeley he and i were looking at triceratops and before the year two thousand now remember triceratops was first found in  the 1800s before 
 two thousand no one had ever seen a juvenile triceratops 
  everyone had a big one  so we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones they 're everywhere  they 're all over the place  
 so we have a whole bunch of them at our museum 
 and everybody says it 's because i have a little museum when you have a little museum
  you look at the triceratops you can see it 's changing 
 as the juveniles are growing up their horns actually curve backwards  and then as they get older the horns grow forward  
 and that 's pretty cool if you look along the edge of the frill  they have these little triangular bones
 that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do
  do on the pachycephalosaurs  and then because the juveniles are in my collection i cut them open 
 and look inside  and the little one is really spongy  and the middle size one is really spongy but what was interesting was
 the adult triceratops was also spongy and this is a skull that is two meters long
  it 's a big skull  but there 's another dinosaur that is found in this formation
 that looks like a triceratops  except it 's bigger and it 's called torosaurus 
 and torosaurus when we cut into it has mature bone  but it 's got these big holes in its
  a triceratops and a torosaurus can 't possibly be the same animal because one of them 's bigger than the other one 
 and it has holes in its frill and
 i said well do we have any juvenile torosauruses and they said well no but
 it has holes in its frill so one of my graduate students
  looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in triceratops and 
 of course it 's open in torosaurus so he found the transitional ones
 between triceratops and torosaurus  which was pretty cool  so now we know that torosaurus is actually a grown up
  when we name dinosaurs  when we name anything the original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out so
 torosaurus is extinct  triceratops if you 've heard the news a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong they thought
 torosaurus should be kept and triceratops thrown out but that 's not going to
  here 's another one  so
 we look at the bone histology the bone histology tells us that edmontosaurus is a juvenile or at least a subadult and the other one is
  is is an adult and we have an ontogeny and
 we get rid of anatotitan 
 so we can just keep doing this and the last one is t rex so there 's these two dinosaurs
  they had a good question they were looking at them and they said one 's got seventeen teeth and the biggest one 's got twelve teeth and that doesn 't make any sense at all because we don 't know of any dinosaurs that
 gain teeth as they get older so
 it must be true they must be different 
  so we cut into them and sure enough nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and
 the bigger one has more mature bone it
 looks like it could still get bigger and at the museum of the rockies where we work  i have four t rexes so
 i can cut a whole bunch of them  but i didn 't have to cut any of them really because
 i just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had twelve teeth and the next smallest one
  had thirteen and the next smallest had fourteen and of course nano has seventeen and we just went out and looked at other people 's collections and we found one that
 has sort of fifteen teeth  so again  real easy to say that
 tyrannosaurus ontogeny included nanotyrannus and therefore we can take out
 another dinosaur
 so
 when it comes down to our end cretaceous we have seven left  
 and that 's a good number that 's a good number to go extinct i think now as you can imagine this is not very popular with
  they 're not happy with this 
 thank you very much
