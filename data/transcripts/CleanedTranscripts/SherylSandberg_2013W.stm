  it 's so not my regular experience as i know anyone else
  when we first started talking about maybe the subject wouldn 't be social media which we assumed it would be  but that you had very much on your mind
 the missing leadership
 positions particularly in the sector of technology and social media  but
 how did that evolve for you as a thought and end up being the ted talk that you gave ss so i was really
 scared to get on this stage and talk about women because i grew up in the business world as i think so many of us did you never talk about being a woman because someone might notice that 
 they might notice or worse if you say woman people on the other end of the table think you 're asking for special treatment  or complaining  or worse about to sue them and so i went through 
 right  i went through my entire business career and never spoke about being a woman never spoke about it publicly but i also had noticed
  that it wasn 't working 
 i came out of college over twenty years ago and i thought that all of my peers were men and women all the people above me were all men but that would change because
 your generation had done such an amazing job fighting for equality equality was now ours for the taking  
 and it wasn 't because year after year i was one of fewer and fewer and now often the only woman in a room
  people about should i give a speech at tedwomen about women and they said oh no no it will end your business career  
 you cannot be a serious business executive and speak about being a woman you 'll never be taken seriously again but
 fortunately there were the few the proud like you who told me i should give the speech 
 and i asked myself the question mark zuckerberg might the founder of facebook and my boss asks all of us which is what would i do if i wasn 't afraid
  and the answer to what would i do if i wasn 't afraid is i would get on the ted stage and talk about women and leadership  
 and i did and survived
  's an important part of the journey so i had tedwomen the original one was in d c so i live here so i had gotten on a plane the day before and
 my daughter was three she was clinging to my leg mommy don 't go 
 and pat 's a friend and so not related to the speech i was planning on giving which was chock full of facts and figures and nothing personal
  i told pat the story
  well i 'm having a hard day yesterday my daughter was clinging to my leg and don 't go and you looked at me and said you have to tell that story  
 i said  on the ted stage are you kidding  i 'm going to get on a stage and admit my daughter was clinging to my leg and you said yes because
 if you want to talk about getting more women into leadership roles you have to be honest about how hard it is and i did
  i think that 's a really important part of the journey the same thing happened when i wrote my book  i started writing the book
  i wrote a first chapter  i thought it was fabulous it was chock full of data and figures i had three pages on matrilineal maasai tribes 
 their sociological patterns my husband read it and he was like this is like eating your wheaties
  no one and i apologize to wheaties if there 's someone no one no one will read this book  
 and i realized through the process that i had to be more honest and more open and i had to tell my stories my stories of
 still not feeling as self confident as i should in many situations my first and failed marriage  crying at work felling like i didn 't belong
  feeling guilty to this day  and part of my journey starting on this stage going to lean in going to the foundation is
 all about being more open and honest about those challenges  so that other women can be more open and honest and all of us can work together towards real equality pm 
 i think that one of the most striking parts about the book and in my opinion one of the reasons it 's hit such a nerve and is resonating around the
  is that you are personal in the book and that you do make it clear that while you 've observed some things that are very important for other women to know 
  that you 've had the same challenges that many others of us have as you faced
  with the private part  and then you would also put yourself in the position of something of an expert on how to resolve those challenges ss 
 after i did the ted talk what happened was you know i never really expected to write a book i 'm not an author i 'm not a writer  and
 it was viewed a lot and it really started impacting people 's lives i got this great one of the first letters i got was from a woman
 who said that she was offered a really big promotion at work  and she turned it down  and she told her best friend she turned it down
  friend said you really need to watch this ted talk  and so she watched this ted talk and she went back the next day she took the job she went home and she handed her husband the grocery list 
 and she said i can do this and what really mattered to me it wasn 't only women in the corporate world even though i did hear from a lot of them and it did impact a lot of them it was also people
  all different circumstances there was a doctor i met who was an attending physician at johns hopkins and he said that until he saw my ted talk it never really occurred to him
 that even though half the students in his med school classes were women they weren 't speaking as much as the men as he did his rounds  so he started paying attention and as he
 waited for raised hands he realized the men 's hands were up  so he started encouraging the women to raise their hands more and it still didn 't work 
  so he could call evenly on men and women and what he proved to himself was that
 the women knew the answers just as well or better 
 and he was able to go back to them and tell them that and then there was the woman stay at home mom lives in a really difficult neighborhood with not a great school she said that ted talk
 she 's never had a corporate job but that ted talk inspired her to go to her school and fight for a better teacher
 for her child  and i guess it was part
  finding my own voice  
 and i realized that other women and men could find their voice through it  which is why i went from the talk to the book pm 
 and in the book
  you not only found your voice which is clear and strong in the book  but you also share what you 've learned the the experiences of other people in the lessons and that 's what i 'm
 thinking about in terms of putting
  yourself in a you became
 a sort of expert in how you lean in so what did that feel like and become like in your life to
 launch not just a book  not just a 
  talk  but a movement where people began to literally describe their actions at work as i 'm leaning in
  i mean i 'm grateful  i 'm honored i 'm happy  and it 's the very beginning  
 so i don 't know if i 'm an expert or if anyone is an expert i certainly have done a lot of research  i have read every study i have pored over the materials and
 the lessons are very clear because here 's what we know what we know is that stereotypes are holding women back from leadership roles all over the world  it 's so striking
  been all over the world talking about it and cultures are so different even within our own country to japan to korea to china to asia  europe they 're so different  
 except for one thing 
 gender 
 all over the world no matter what our cultures are we think men should be strong assertive aggressive have voice  we think women should speak
  we have all over the world  women are called bossy 
 there is a word for bossy for little girls in every language there 's one 
 it 's a word that 's pretty much not used for little boys because if a little boy leads  there 's no negative word for  it it 's expected
  but if a little girl leads  she 's bossy  
 now i know there aren 't a lot of men here but bear with me if you 're a man you 'll have to represent your gender  please raise your hand if you 've been told you 're too aggressive
  at work there
 's always a few  
 it runs about five percent okay get ready gentlemen if you 're a woman please raise your hand if you 've ever been told you 're too aggressive at work 
 that is what audiences have said in every country in the world and it 's deeply supported by the data now do we think women are more aggressive than men
  course not it 's just that we judge them through a different lens and a lot of the character traits that you must exhibit to perform at work to get results to lead 
 are ones that we think in a man he 's a boss 
 and in a woman she 's bossy and the good news about this is that we can change this by acknowledging it 
 one of the happiest moments i had in this whole journey is after the book came out i stood on a stage with john chambers the ceo of cisco he read the book
  he stood on a stage with me he invited me in front of his whole management team men and women and he said i thought we were good at this i thought i was good at this and then i read this book
  and i realized that we my company we have called all of our senior women too aggressive and i 'm standing on this stage and i 'm sorry  and i want you to know we 're never going to do it again 
 pm can we
 send that to a lot of other
  because he believes it 's good for his company  and so this kind of acknowledgement of these biases can change it and so next time you all see someone call a little girl bossy you walk right up to that person big smile and you say that little girl 's not bossy 
 that little girl has executive leadership skills pm 
 i know that 's what you 're telling your daughter
  did focus in the book and the reason as you said in writing it was to create a dialogue about this i mean let 's just put it out there face the fact that women are in a time when 
  we have more open doors and more opportunities are still not getting to the leadership positions so in the months that have come since the book in which lean in focused on that and said  
  here are some of the challenges that remain and many of them we have to own within ourselves and look at ourselves what has changed 
 ss well there 's certainly more dialogue which is great but what really matters to me and i think all of us is action so everywhere i go  ceos they 're mostly men say to me 
 you 're costing me so much money
 because all the women want to be paid as much as the men and to them i say i 'm not sorry at all 
 at all i mean the women should be paid as much as the men  everywhere i go women tell me they ask for
  raises  everywhere i go women say they 're getting better relationships with their spouses asking for more help at home  asking for the promotions they should be getting at work and importantly believing it themselves even little things 
 one of the governors of one of the states told me that he didn 't realize that more women were in fact literally sitting on the side of the room which they are  and now he made a rule that all the women on
  need to sit at the table 
 the foundation i started along with the book lean in helps women or men start circles small groups it can be ten it can be however many you want which meet once a month 
 i would have hoped that by now we 'd have about five hundred circles that would 've been great you know five hundred times roughly ten  
 there are over twelve thousand circles in fifty countries in the world pm wow that 's amazing ss and these are people who are meeting
 every single month i met one of them i was in beijing a group of women
 twenty nine or thirty they started the first lean in circle in beijing  several of them grew up in very poor rural china
  these women are twenty nine they are told by their society that they are left over because they are not yet married  
 and the process of coming together once a month at a meeting is helping them
 define who they are for themselves  what they want in their careers the kind of partners they want if at all
 i looked at them we went around and introduced ourselves and they all said their names and where they 're from and
 i said i 'm sheryl sandberg and this was my dream  and i kind of just started crying right which 
 i admit i do right i 've talked about it before  but the fact that a woman so far away out in the world who grew up in a rural village who 's being told to
  marry someone she doesn 't want to marry 
 can now go meet once a month with a group of people and refuse that and find life on her own terms that 's the kind of change we have to hope for pm 
 have you been surprised by the global nature of the message because i think when the book first came out many people thought well this is a really important handbook for young women on their 
  way up they need to look at this anticipate the barriers and recognize them put them out in the open have the dialogue about it  
  for women who are that doing that pursuing the corporate world  and yet the book is being read as you say in rural and developing countries what part of that has surprised you and perhaps led to a new perspective on your part ss 
 the book is about self confidence and about equality  and it turns out everywhere in the
  because the world tells us we 're not equal to men  everywhere in the world  we live in a world where the men get and 
 and women get or i 've never met a man who 's been asked how he does it all 
 again i 'm going to turn to the men in the audience  
 please raise your hand if you 've been asked how do you do it all 
 men only women women please raise your hand if you 've been asked how you do it all
 do it all slash have jobs and children we assume women can 't and that 's ridiculous because the great majority of women everywhere in the world including the united states work full time and have children  
 and i think people don 't fully understand how broad the message is 
 there is a circle that 's been started for rescued sex workers in
  they 're using lean in to help people make the transition
 back to what would be a fair life really rescuing them from their pimps and using it 
 there are dress for success groups in texas which are using the book  for women who have never been to college and
 we know there are groups all the way to ethiopia  and so these messages of equality of how women are told they can 't have what men can have
 how we assume that leadership is for men how we assume that voice is for men
  these affect all of us and i think they are very universal  and it 's part of what tedwomen does it unites all of us
 in a cause we have to believe in which is more women more voice more equality pm if you were invited now
 to make another tedwomen talk what would you say that is a result of this experience for you personally
 and what you 've learned about women and men as you 've made this journey ss 
 i think i would say i tried to say this strongly but i think i can say it more strongly
 i want to say that the status quo is not enough 
 that it 's not good enough that it 's not changing quickly enough  since i gave my ted talk and published my book another year of data came out from the u s census  and you know what we found
  no movement in the wage gap for women in the united states
 cents to the dollar if you are a black woman sixty four cents if you are a latina we 're at fifty four cents do you know when the last time those numbers went up
 we are stagnating we are stagnating in so many ways and i think
  not really being honest about that 
 for so many reasons it 's so hard to talk about gender  we shy away from the word feminist a word i really think we need to embrace 
 we have to get rid of the word bossy and bring back
 i think i would say in a louder voice we need to get rid of the word bossy and bring back the word
