  the ancient world
 don 't survive to us in their original form  they survive because medieval scribes copied them and copied them and copied them and so it is
  the great greek mathematician everything we know about archimedes as a mathematician we know about because of just three books  and they 're called a b and c 
 and a was lost by an italian humanist in 
 and b was last heard of in the pope 's library about a hundred miles north of rome in viterbo in
  desk in baltimore on the 19th of january one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and this is codex c here  
 now codex c is actually buried
 in this book it 's buried treasure  because this book is actually a prayer book  it was finished by a guy called johannes myrones on the
  and to make his prayer book he used parchment  but he didn 't use use new parchment he used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts and there were seven of them 
 and archimedes codex c was just one of those seven 
 he took apart the archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts  he erased all of their
  and then he cut the sheets down in the middle  he shuffled them up and he rotated them ninety degrees  and he wrote prayers on top of these books and essentially these seven manuscripts
 disappeared for seven hundred years  and we have a prayer book  
 the prayer book was discovered by this guy  johan ludvig heiberg in one thousand nine hundred and six and with just a magnifying glass  he transcribed as much of the text
  and the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript that were unique texts they weren 't in a and b at all they were completely new texts by archimedes and they were called the method and the stomachion 
 and it became a world famous manuscript 
 now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition 
 it got in worse condition in the 20th century after heiberg saw it forgeries were painted
  and it suffered very badly from mold this book is the definition of a write off 
 it 's the sort of book that you thought would be in an institution  
 but it 's not in an institution  it was bought by a private owner in 
 why did he buy this book  
 because he wanted to make that which was fragile safe he wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous he wanted to make that which was expensive
  free  and he wanted to do this as a matter of principle  because not many people are really going to read archimedes
 in ancient greek but they should have the chance to do it 
 so he gathered around himself the friends of archimedes  and he promised to pay for all the work and it was an expensive job  but actually it
 wouldn 't be as much as you think because these people they didn 't come from money
  they came from archimedes and they came from all sorts of different backgrounds they came from particle physics they came from classical philology  
 they came from book conservation  they came from ancient mathematics they came from data management they came from scientific imaging and program management  and they got together to work on this manuscript  
  first problem was a conservation problem and this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with 
 there was glue on the spine of the book  
 and if you look at this photograph carefully the bottom half of this is rather brown and that glue is hide glue now if you 're a conservator you can take off this glue reasonably easily  
 the top half is elmer 's wood glue it
 's polyvinyl acetate emulsion that doesn 't dissolve in water once it 's dry  and it 's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on and so before we
  could
 start imaging archimedes we had to take this book apart  
 so it took four years to take apart  and this is a rare action shot ladies and gentlemen 
 another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax because this was used in the liturgical services of the greek orthodox church and they 'd used candle wax and the candle wax was dirty and we couldn 't image through the
  wax  so very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax  it 's hard to tell you exactly how bad this condition of this book is but
 it came out in little bits very often and normally in a book you wouldn 't worry about the little bits but these little bits might contain unique archimedes text 
 so tiny fragments we actually managed to put back
 in the right place
  then having done that we started to image the manuscript and we imaged the manuscript in fourteen different wavebands of light  
 because if you look at something in different wavebands of light you see different things and here is an image of a page imaged in fourteen different wavebands of light  
 but none of them worked  so
 what we did was we processed the images together  and we put two images into one blank screen
  here are two different images of the archimedes manuscript 
 and the image on the left is the normal red image and the image on the right is an ultraviolet image and in the image on the right you might be able to see some of the archimedes writing 
 if you merge them together into one digital canvas the parchment is bright in both images and it comes out bright 
 the prayer book is dark in both images and it comes out dark the archimedes text is
  dark in one image and bright in another  and it 'll come out dark but red  and then you can start to read it rather clearly  and that 's what it looks like 
 now that 's a before and after image but you don 't read the image on the screen like that you zoom in
 and you zoom in
 and you zoom in
 and you zoom in and you can just
 if you process the same two images in a different way you can actually get rid of the prayer book text and this is terribly important because
 the diagrams in the in the manuscript are the unique source for the diagrams that archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth
  i can give them to you 
 with this kind of imaging this kind of infrared ultraviolet invisible light imaging we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries how were we going to do that well
 we took the manuscript and we decided to image it in x ray fluorescence imaging 
 so an x ray comes in in the diagram on the left and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom and that electron disappears  and as it disappears
 an electron from a shell farther out jumps in and takes its place  
 and when it takes its place it sheds electromagnetic radiation it sheds an x ray 
 and this x ray is specific in its wavelength to the atom that it hits 
 and what we wanted to get was the iron  because the ink was written in
  and if we can map where this x ray that comes out where it comes from we can map all the iron on the page then theoretically we can read the image 
 the thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this so we took it to the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory
 in california which is a particle accelerator electrons go around one way  positrons go around the other they meet in the middle  
 and they create subatomic particles like the charm quark and the tau lepton
  now we weren 't actually going to put archimedes in that beam  
 but as the electrons go round at the speed of light they shed x rays and this is the most powerful light source in the solar system 
 this is called synchrotron radiation and it 's normally used to look at things like proteins and that sort of thing but we wanted it to look at atoms 
 at iron atoms  so that we could read the page from before and after and lo and behold we found that we could do it
  took about seventeen minutes to do a single page  
 so what did we discover  well one of the unique texts in archimedes is called the stomachion 
 and this didn 't exist in codices a and b and we knew that it involved this square  
 and this is a perfect square and it 's divided into fourteen bits  but no one knew what archimedes was doing with these fourteen bits and now we think we know  
 he was trying to work
  out how many ways you can recombine those fourteen bits and still make a perfect square  anyone want to guess the answer
 it 's seventeen  thousand one hundred and fifty two divided into five hundred and thirty six families  and the important point about this
 is that it 's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics and combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics
  astonishing thing though about this manuscript is that we looked at the other manuscripts that the palimpsester had made the scribe had made
 his book out of and one of them was a manuscript containing text by hyperides  now hyperides
 was an athenian orator from the fourth century b c he was an exact contemporary of demosthenes  and in three hundred and
  he and demosthenes
 together decided that they wanted to stand up to the military might of philip of macedon  
 so athens and thebes went out to fight philip of macedon this was a bad idea because philip of macedon had a son called alexander the great and they lost the battle of chaeronea  
 alexander the great went on to conquer the known world hyperides found himself on trial for treason  
 and this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial and it 's a great speech best of all
  can 't win then you should fight for a noble cause because then you 'll be remembered  
 consider the spartans they won enumerable victories but no one remembers what they are because they were all fought for selfish ends  the one battle
 that the spartans fought that everybody remembers is the the battle of thermopylae where they were butchered to a man but fought for the
  it was such a great speech that the
 athenian law courts let him off  
 he lived for another ten years  then the macedonian faction caught up with him they cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory  and no one
 knows what they did with his body  so this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity speaking to us not from the grave because his grave doesn 't exist but from the
  now i should say at this point
 that normally when you 're
 looking at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off you don 't find unique texts and to find two in one manuscript is really something to find three
 is completely weird and we found three aristotle 's categories is one of the foundational texts of western philosophy  
 and we found a third century a d commentary
  on it possibly by galen and probably by porphyry 
 now all this data that we collected all the images all the raw images all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing have been put online under a creative commons 
  license for anyone to use for any commercial purpose 
 why did the owner of the manuscript do do this he did this because he understands data as
  well as books now the thing to do with books  if you want to ensure their 
  long term utility is to hide them away in closets and let very few people look at them the thing to do with data if you want it to survive is to let it out and have everybody have 
  it with as little control on that data as possible and that 's what he did 
  from this 
 because institutions at the moment confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing and if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the web 
 at the moment you have to go to the national library of y 's site or the university library of x 's site which is about the most boring way in which you can deal with digital data what you want to do is to aggregate it all together 
 because the web of the ancient manuscripts of the future isn 't going to be built by institutions it 's going to be built
 users by people who get this data together by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from people who just want to curate their own
 glorious selection of beautiful things and that is the future of the web and it 's an attractive and
  beautiful future if only we can make it happen  
 now we at the walters art museum have followed this example  and we have put up all our manuscripts on the web for people to enjoy all the raw data all the descriptions 
 all the metadata under a creative commons license  now the walters art museum is a small museum and it has beautiful manuscripts but the data is fantastic  
 twenty four of the twenty eight images you 'll find come from my institution 
 now 
 let 's think about this for a minute what 's in it for the institution  
 there are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution you can talk about the humanities and that sort of thing but let 's talk about selfish things  because what 's really
  in it for the institution is this  now why do people go to the louvre  
 they go to see the mona lisa  
 why do they go to see the mona lisa  because they already know what she looks like  
 and they know what she looks like because they 've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere
  for
 these restrictions at all and i think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses and it would be a great benefit to everybody why don 't we just let everybody 
 have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty
