  a virtually unknown german mathematician named theodor kaluza suggested a very bold
 bold and in some ways a very bizarre idea he proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions
 that we are all aware of that is in addition to left right back forth and up down kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason
 we don 't yet see now when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea sometimes that 's all it is bold and bizarre but it has nothing to do with
  the world around us  this particular idea however although we don 't yet know whether it 's right or wrong and at the end i 'll discuss experiments which in the next few years may tell us whether 
  it 's right or wrong this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting edge research so i 'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions  
  of back story go to one thousand nine hundred and seven this is a year when einstein is basking in the glow of having discovered the special theory of relativity and decides 
  to take on a new project to try to understand fully
  there are many people around who thought that that
 project had already been resolved newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late  1600s that works well  describes the motion of planets the motion of the moon and so forth
  the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees hitting people on the head all of that could be described using newton 's work but einstein realized that newton had left something out of the story because even newton had written that although
  he understood how
 to calculate the effect of gravity he 'd been unable to figure out how it really works how is it that the sun ninety three million miles away [ that ] somehow it affects the motion 
 of the earth how does the sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence  and that is a task to which einstein set himself to figure out how gravity works and let me show you what
  is that he found 
 so einstein found that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself the idea goes like this  imagine space is a substrate of all there is einstein 
  said space is nice and flat if there 's no matter present  but if there is matter in the environment such as the sun it causes the fabric of space to warp to curve  and that communicates the force of gravity
  even the earth warps space around it now look at the moon the moon is kept in orbit according to these ideas because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment 
 that the sun and the moon and the earth can all create by virtue of their presence we go to 
  view of this the earth itself is
 kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that 's curved because of the sun 's presence  that is this new idea about how gravity actually works now 
 this idea was tested in one thousand nine hundred and nineteen nineteen through astronomical observations it really works it describes the data and this gained einstein prominence around the world  and that is what
  like einstein was in search of what we call a unified theory that 's one theory that might be able to describe all of nature 's forces from one set of ideas 
 one set of principles one master equation if you will so kaluza said to himself einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of warps and curves in space 
  in fact space and time to be more precise maybe i can play the same game with
  the other known force which was at that time known as the electromagnetic force we know of others today but at that time that was the only other one people were thinking about you know 
 the force responsible for electricity and magnetic attraction and so forth  so kaluza says maybe i can play the same game and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves  
 that raised a question warps and curves in what 
 einstein had already
  used up space and time  warps and curves to describe gravity there didn 't seem to be anything else to warp or curve
  so kaluza said well  
 maybe there are more dimensions of space he said if i want to describe one more force maybe i need one more dimension so he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space 
  and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves in that fourth dimension  now here 's the thing when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves in a universe with four space dimensions not 
  three  he found the old equations that einstein had already derived in three dimensions those were for gravity but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension 
  and when he looked at that equation it was none other than the equation that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force
  just popped out he was so excited by this realization that he ran around his house screaming victory that he had found the unified theory  
 now clearly kaluza was a man who took
 theory very seriously he in fact there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to
  this is a man who would risk his life on theory  
 now but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded two questions immediately arise from his observation number one 
 if there are more dimensions in space where are they we
 don 't seem to see them  and number two does this theory really work in detail  when you try to apply it to the world around us
  now the first question was answered in 
 by a fellow named oskar klein he suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties there might be big easy to see dimensions  but there might also be tiny 
 curled up dimensions curled up so small even though they 're all around us that we don 't see them let me show you that one visually  
  a cable supporting a traffic light it 's in manhattan you 're in central park it 's kind of irrelevant but the cable looks 
 from a distant viewpoint but you and i all know that it does have some thickness it 's very hard to see it though from far away  but if we zoom in and take the perspective of say a little ant walking around 
 little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions the long dimension but also this clockwise
  and i hope you appreciate this it took so long to get these ants to do this 
 but this illustrates the fact that dimensions can be of two sorts big and small and the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us are the ones that we can easily see  
  but there might be additional dimensions curled up sort of like the circular part of that cable 
 so small that they have so far remained invisible let me show you what that would look like so if we take a look say at space itself
 i can only show of course two dimensions on a screen some of you guys will fix that one day  but anything that 's not flat on a screen is a new dimension goes smaller  smaller  smaller  and way 
  down in the microscopic depths of space itself this is the idea you could have additional curled up dimensions here is a little shape of a circle so small that we don 't see them  but if you were
  a little ultra microscopic ant walking around you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about that 's like the grid part but you could also access the tiny curled up dimension that 's so small 
  that we can 't see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment but deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself the idea is there could be more
  as we see there now
 that 's
 an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see but what about the second question that i asked  
 does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world well it turns out that einstein and kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine 
 this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time
  in detail it didn 't work in detail for instance they couldn 't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory so many people worked on it but by the ' 40s 
  certainly by the ' 50s this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away  
  something wonderful happened in our age in our era a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself many others around the world  it 's called superstring theory  as you were indicating 
 and the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions  
 but when we study superstring theory we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling new form so let me just tell you how that goes superstring
  theory what is it well it 's a theory that tries to answer the question what are the basic fundamental indivisible uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us 
 the idea is like this so imagine we look at a familiar object just a candle in a holder  and imagine
  that we want to figure out what it is made of so we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents so deep inside we all know you go sufficiently far down you 
  have atoms we also all know that atoms are not the end of the story they have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus with neutrons and protons 
 any of these particles there is something else this something else is this dancing filament of energy it looks like a vibrating string that 's where the idea string theory comes 
  from and just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello can vibrate in different patterns these can also vibrate in different patterns  they don 't produce different musical notes rather they produce the different particles making up the world around us so if these ideas are correct
  landscape of the universe looks like  it 's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy vibrating in different 
  frequencies the different frequencies produce the different particles  the different particles
  electrons and quarks  radiation particles photons gravitons are all built up from one entity  so matter and the forces of nature all
 are put together under the rubric of vibrating strings  and that 's what we mean by a unified theory  now here is the catch 
 when you study the mathematics of string theory you find that it doesn 't work in a universe that
  just has three dimensions of space it doesn 't work in a universe with four dimensions of space nor five nor six 
 finally you can study the equations and show that it works only in a universe that has ten dimensions of space
 and one dimension of time it
 leads us right back to this idea of kaluza and klein that our world when appropriately described has more
  dimensions than the ones that we see  
 now you might think about that and say well ok you know if you have extra dimensions and they 're really tightly curled up yeah perhaps we won 't see them if they 're small enough but
 if there 's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there and you make them small enough and we won 't see them either  that is
  one of the other predictions of string theory
 no that 's not one of the other predictions of string theory but it raises the question are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions  or
 do they tell us something about the world  in the remaining time i 'd like to tell you two features of them 
 first is many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to
 what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics theoretical
  science and that question is this 
 when we look around the world  as scientists have done for the last hundred years there appear to be about twenty numbers that really describe our universe these are numbers like the mass 
  of the particles like electrons and quarks  the strength of gravity the strength of the electromagnetic force a list of about twenty numbers that have been measured with incredible precision but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the
  particular values that they do now 
 does string theory offer an answer not yet but we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do may rely on the form of the extra dimensions and the wonderful thing is if 
  those numbers had any other values than the known ones the universe as we know it wouldn
  this is a deep question why are those numbers so finely tuned to allow stars to shine and planets to form when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers if i had twenty dials up here and i let you come up and fiddle with those numbers  almost any fiddling makes
 the universe disappear  so can we explain those twenty numbers and string theory suggests that those twenty numbers have to do with the extra
  let me show you how 
 so when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory  it 's not one extra dimension as in the older ideas of kaluza and klein  this 
  is what string theory says about the extra dimensions  they have a very rich  intertwined geometry this is an example of something known as a calabi yau shape name isn 't all that important 
  extra dimensions fold in on themselves and intertwine in a very interesting shape interesting structure 
 and the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us would look like this on the 
  tiniest of scales when you swing your hand you 'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again  but they 're so small that we wouldn 't know it so what is the physical implication though relevant to those twenty numbers consider this if you look at the
  the instrument a french horn notice that the vibrations of the airstreams are affected by the shape of the instrument  now in string theory  all the numbers
 are reflections of the way strings can vibrate so just as those airstreams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument 
 strings themselves will be affected by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving so let me bring some strings into the story  and if you watch these
  little fellows vibrating around they 'll be there in a second right there  notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions  so if we knew exactly what 
  the extra dimensions look like we don 't yet but if we did we should be able to calculate the allowed notes the allowed vibrational patterns  and if we could calculate the allowed vibrational
  we should be able to calculate
 those twenty numbers and if the answer that we get from our calculations
 agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation 
 this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation
 for why the structure of the universe is the way it is  now the second issue that i want to finish up with is 
 how might we test
  for these extra dimensions more directly is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some previously unexplained features of the world  
 or can we actually test for these extra dimensions and we think and this is i think very exciting that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions here 's how it goes
 in cern geneva switzerland a machine is being built called the large hadron collider  
 it 's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel opposite directions near the speed of light  
 every so often those particles will be aimed at each other so there 's a head on collision 
 the hope is that if the collision has enough energy it may eject some of the debris
  from the collision from our dimensions  
 forcing it to enter into the other dimensions  how would we know it  well we 'll measure the amount of energy after the collision compare it to the amount of energy before  and if there 's less energy
 after the collision than before  this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away and if it drifts away in the right pattern
  that we can calculate  this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there let me show you that idea visually so imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton 
  that 's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out if the extra dimensions are real  but here 's how the experiment will go you take these particles you slam them together you slam them together 
  and if we are right some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions  so this is the kind of experiment that
 'll be looking at in the next five 
 seven to ten years or so  and if this experiment bears fruit if we see that kind of particle ejected by noticing that there 's less energy in our dimensions than when we began  
 this will show that the extra dimensions are real  
 and to me this is a really remarkable
  a remarkable opportunity going back to newton with absolute space didn 't provide anything but an arena a stage in which the events of the universe take place 
 einstein comes along and says well space and time can warp and curve that 's what gravity is and now string theory comes along and says yes gravity quantum 
  mechanics electromagnetism all together in one package  but only if the universe has more dimensions
  that we see and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime amazing possibility  thank you very much
