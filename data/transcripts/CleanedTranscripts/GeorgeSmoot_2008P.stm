  i would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature  and so i have my first slide
 to talk about the dawning of the universe and
 what i call the cosmic scene investigation  that is  looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning  and then following it up and trying to understand it and so 
  one of the questions that i asked you is when you look around what do you see  well  you see this space that 's created
  and so the question is  how did that material get here  how did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped and so forth
 it 's a question of what 's the continuity so one of the things i look at is  how did the universe begin and shape what was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe to 
  getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials so that 's sort of the part  and let me move on then and show you the hubble ultra deep field if you look at this picture  what you will see is a lot of
  dark with some light objects in it 
 and everything but four of these light objects are stars and you can see them there little pluses  this is a star  this is a star everything else is a galaxy 
 ok so there 's there 's a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here and when i look out at particularly this galaxy which looks a lot like ours i wonder if
  an art design college conference going on and
 intelligent beings there are thinking about you know what designs they might do  and there might be a few cosmologists trying to understand where the universe itself came from and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours trying to figure out what 's going on over here  
 but there 's a lot of other galaxies and some are nearby and they 're kind of the color of the sun and some are further away and they 're a little bluer and so forth  but one of the questions is this should be to you how come there are so many galaxies  because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky
  is only one thousand galaxies  we think there 's on the order visible to the hubble space telescope if you had the time to scan it around about one hundred billion galaxies right 
 it 's a very large number of galaxies
 and that 's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy  but when you look at some of these regions like this you 'll see more galaxies than stars which is kind of a conundrum  so the question should come to your mind is what kind of design you know what kind
  of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that  and then i 'm going to show you it 's actually a lot more complicated  
 we 're going to try and follow it up we have a tool that actually helps us out in this study  and that 's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big
 that it 's a time machine in a certain sense  we draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it
 put the earth at the center of the nested spheres just because that 's where we 're making observations  and the moon is only two seconds away so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary light it
 's the moon two seconds ago and who cares two seconds is like the present the sun is eight minutes ago that 's not such a big deal right unless there 's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way you 'd like to have 
 a little advance warning  but you get out to jupiter and it 's forty minutes away  it 's a problem you hear about mars it 's a problem communicating to mars because it
  it takes light long enough to go there 
 but if you look out to the nearest set of stars to the nearest forty or fifty stars  it 's about ten years so if you take a picture of what 's going on it 's ten years ago  but you go and look to the center 
  of the galaxy it 's thousands of years ago if you look at andromeda  which is the nearest big galaxy and it 's two million years ago  if you took a picture of the earth two million years ago there 'd be no evidence of humans at all because we don 't think there were humans yet i mean it just gives you the scale 
 but if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further there 's some things even further and that was what i did in a lot of my work was to develop the techniques
 we could look out back to even earlier epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies  back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different and so that 's the sort of sequence 
 and so i have a more artistic impression of this there 's the galaxy in the middle which is the milky way
  around that are the hubble you know nearby kind of galaxies and there 's a sphere that marks the different times and behind that are some more modern galaxies you see the whole big picture  the beginning of time is funny 
  it 's on the outside  right  and then there 's a part of the universe we can 't see because it 's so dense and so hot light can 't escape  it 's like you can 't see to the center of the sun  you have to use other techniques to know what 's going on inside the sun  but you can see the edge of the sun  and the universe gets that way and you can see that
  and then you see this sort of model area around the outside  and that is the radiation coming from the big bang  which is actually incredibly uniform the universe is almost a perfect sphere  but there are these very tiny variations which
 we show here in great exaggeration  and from them in the time sequence we 're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced
  galaxies and eventually the solar system and so forth  so it 's a big design job 
 but we 'll see about how things are going on  so the way these measurements were done there 's been a set of satellites  and this is where you get to see  so there was the cobe satellite 
 which was launched in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine and we discovered these variations  and then in two thousand  the
  satellite was launched the wmap and it made somewhat better pictures  and later this year
 this is the cool stealth version the one that that actually has some beautiful design features to it 
 and you should look the the planck satellite will be launched and it will make very high resolution maps  and that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe and what we saw 
  was we saw these variations  and then they told us the secrets  both about the structure of space time and about the contents of the universe and about how
  the universe started in its original motions  so we have this picture which is quite a spectacular picture and i 'll come back to the beginning where we 're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the 
  universe off at the beginning  and we go through a period of accelerating expansion and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent then to the dark ages and then the first stars turn on  and they evolve into galaxies and then later they get to the
  more expansive galaxies and somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming and it 's maturing up to the present time and there 's some spectacular things and this wastebasket part that 's to represent what the structure of space time itself is doing during this period  
 and so this is a pretty weird model  right  what kind of evidence do we have for that  so let me show you some of nature 's patterns that are the result of this i always think of
 as being the real substance of space and the galaxies and the stars just
 like the foam on the ocean  it 's a marker of where the where the interesting waves are and whatever went on  so here is the sloan digital sky survey showing the location 
 of a million galaxies  so there 's a dot on here for every galaxy they go out and point a telescope at the sky  take a picture  identify what are stars and throw them away
 look at the galaxies estimate how far away they are and plot them up and just put radially they 're going out that way and you see these structures this thing we call the great wall but there are voids and those kinds of stuff 
 and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn 't sensitive enough to do it  now i 'm going to show you this in 3d what happens is you take pictures as the earth rotates you get a fan across the
  some places you can 't look because of our own galaxy  or because there are no
 telescopes available to do it so the next picture shows you the three dimensional version of this rotating around do you see the  fan like
 scans made across the sky  remember every spot on here is a galaxy  
 and you see the galaxies  you know sort of in our neighborhood and you sort of see the structure  and you see this thing we call the great
  and you see the complicated structure  and you see these voids there are places where there are no galaxies and there are places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together 
 right so there 's an interesting pattern  but we don 't have enough data here to actually see the pattern  we only have a million galaxies right so we 're keeping like a million balls in the air but what 's going on  there 's another survey which is very similar to this called 
 the two degree field of view
  galaxy redshift survey  now we 're going to fly through it it at
 warp a million 
 and every time there 's a galaxy at its location there 's a galaxy and  if we know anything about the galaxy  which we do because there 's a redshift measurement and everything 
 you put in the type of galaxy and the color  so this is the real representation  and when you 're in the middle of the galaxies it 's hard to see the pattern it 's like being in the middle of life it 's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience it 's hard to see 
  the pattern of this so we 're going to go out and swing around and look back at this 
 first the structure of the survey and then you 'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there 
 so again you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here  but you can see the voids  you can see the complicated structure  and you say well
 how did this happen
  you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that it 's not just throwing them out at random  there 's a more complicated process going on here  
 how are you going to end up doing that  
 and so now we 're in for some serious play that is we have to seriously play god not just change people 's lives but make the universe right so if that 's your responsibility  how are you 
  going to do that what 's the kind of technique what 's the kind of thing you 're going to do so i 'm going to show you the results of a very
 large scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like using essentially some of the play principles and some of the design principles that that you know humans have labored so hard 
  to pick up  but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning  and that is  you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules
 put in some randomness some fluctuations and some randomness  and realize a whole bunch of different representations so what i 'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales we 're going to zoom in but this is a
 plot of what it is  and we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right it 's called dark matter that is matter that doesn 't interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter does the way the light 's shining on me or on the
 it 's transparent to light but in order for you to see it we 're going to make it white  ok  so the stuff that 's in this picture that 's white  that is the dark matter it should be called invisible matter but the dark matter we 've made visible 
 and the stuff that is in the yellow color  that is the ordinary kind of matter that 's turned into stars and galaxies so i 'll show you the next movie  
 so this we 're going to zoom in notice this pattern
 and pay attention to this pattern  we 're going to zoom in and zoom in 
 and you 'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids and when
 a number of filaments come together in a knot that makes a supercluster of galaxies  this one we 're zooming in on is somewhere between one hundred thousand and a million galaxies in that small region  so we live in
  we don 't live in the center of the solar system we don 't live in the center of the galaxy and our galaxy 's not in the center of the cluster so we 're zooming in this is a region which probably has more than one hundred thousand 
 on the order of a million galaxies in that region  we 're going to keep zooming in  
 ok  and so i forgot to tell you the scale a
 parsec is three point two six light years  so a gigaparsec is three billion light years that 's the scale  so it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance now we 're into a distance sort of between
  here and here that 's the distance between us and andromeda  right  these little specks that you 're seeing in here they 're galaxies  
 now we 're going to zoom back out 
 and you can see this this structure that when we get very far out looks very regular but it 's made up of a lot of irregular
  simple building blocks  there 's a very simple fluid to begin with it 's got dark matter it 's got
 ordinary matter  it 's got photons and it 's got neutrinos which don 't play much role
 in the later part of the universe and it 's just a simple fluid and it it  over time develops into this complicated structure  
 and so you know when you first saw this picture
  didn 't mean quite so much to you here you 're looking across
 one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you 're seeing billions of galaxies right 
 and nodes  but you realize they 're not even the main structure there 's a framework  which is the dark matter the invisible matter that 's out there that 's actually holding it all together  
 so let 's fly through it and you can see how much harder it is when you 're in the middle of something to figure this out 
  so here 's that same end result you see a filament you see the light is the invisible matter and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies
 showing up and we 're going to fly around and we 'll fly around and you 'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect and you get a large cluster of galaxies 
 and then we 'll fly in to where the the very large cluster is  and you can see what it looks like  
 and so from inside it doesn 't look very complicated  right  it 's only when you look at
 explore it  and so forth  you realize it 's a very intricate complicated kind of a design right and it 's grown up in
 some kind of way  so the question is how hard would it be to assemble this right how big a contractor team would you need
 to put this universe
  so here we are you see how the filament you see how several filaments are coming together  therefore making this this supercluster of galaxies 
 and you have to understand this is not how it would actually look if you first you can 't travel this fast
 everything would be distorted but this is using simple rendering and
 graphic arts kind of stuff  this is how if you took billions of years to go around it might look to you
  you could see invisible matter too and
 so the idea is  you know  how would you put together the universe in a very simple way we 're going to start and realize
 that the entire visible universe everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope plus our other instruments was once in a region that was smaller than an atom  
 it started with tiny
  quantum mechanical fluctuations but expanding at a tremendous rate  and those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizes  and those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background  
 and then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies and clusters of galaxies
 and make these kinds of structures go on  so i 'm going to show you a smaller simulation this simulation was run on one thousand processors for a month
 in order to make
  this simple visible one so i 'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop in two days
 in the next picture so you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point now four times smaller and so forth  and you start seeing these networks this cosmic web 
 of structure forming  and this is a simple one because it doesn 't have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter
  and you see how the dark matter lumps up and the ordinary matter just trails along behind
  so there it is at the beginning it 's very uniform  the fluctuations are a part in one hundred thousand there
 are a few peaks that are a part in ten thousand  
 and then over billions of years  gravity just pulls in this is light over density  pulls the material around in that pulls in more material and pulls in more material
  but the distances on the universe are so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time
  for this to form  and it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now in terms of its expansion and at that point the universe 
 mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger scale structure  so we 're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see  and then
  only things that have started forming already are going to form and then from then on it 's going to go on  so we 're able to do the simulation  but this is two days
 desktop  we need you know  thirty days on one thousand processors to do the the kind of simulation that i showed you before  
 so we have an idea of how to play
 seriously creating the universe by starting with
 essentially less than an eyedrop full of material   and we create everything we can see in any
  direction right from
 almost nothing that is  something extremely tiny extremely small and
 it
 is almost perfect except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in one hundred thousand level  which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see that is galaxies and
 and stars and so forth  so we have a model
  can calculate it  and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like  
 and that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination ever was 
 so this is what we started with fifteen years ago  with the cosmic background explorer made the map on the upper right  
 which basically showed us that there were large scale fluctuations and actually fluctuations on several scales
  you can kind of see that since then we 've had wmap which just gives us higher angular resolution we see the same large scale structure but we see additional small scale structure  
 and on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and mapped the earth what kind of a map we would have got of the earth you can see well you can kind of pick out all the major continents but that 's about
