  what a great way to start  first of all i 've been watching this trend where we have these books like such and such for dummies
  for other books like this you know there 's also something called the complete idiot 's guide there
 's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense  we like to have technology make us feel bad for some strange reason  but
 i really like that so i wrote a book called the laws of simplicity i was in milan last week for the italian launch it 's kind of a book about questions  questions about simplicity
  very few answers i 'm also wondering myself what is simplicity is it good is it bad is complexity better i 'm not sure 
 after i wrote the laws of simplicity i was very tired of simplicity as you can imagine  and so in my life i 've discovered that vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over achiever 
 because your companies will always take away your life  but they can never take away your vacation in theory so 
 i went to the cape last
  summer to hide from simplicity  and i went to the gap because i only have black pants so i went and bought khaki shorts or whatever  and
 unfortunately their branding was all about keep it simple i
 opened up a magazine and visa 's branding was business takes simplicity 
 i develop photographs and kodak said keep it simple so i felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around 
 so i turned on the tv  and i don 't watch tv very
  very much but you know this person this is paris hilton apparently  and she has this show the simple life so i watched this it 's not very simple a little bit confusing
  my car and cape cod  there are idyllic roads and all of us can drive in this room  and when you drive these signs are very important it 's a very simple sign it says
  what would that be like on a beach what if the sky was forty one percent gray wouldn 't that be the perfect sky i mean that simplicity sky  but in reality  the sky looked like
 this it was a beautiful complex sky you know with the pinks and blues  we can 't help but love complexity we 're human beings we love complex things we love relationships very complex so we love this kind of stuff
 at this place called the media lab maybe some of you guys have heard of this place  
 it 's designed by i m pei one of the premier modernist architects modernism means white box  and it 's a perfect white box 
 and
 some of you guys are entrepreneurs etc whatever last month i was at google and boy that cafeteria man
 you guys have things here in silicon valley like stock options
  we get titles  lots of titles  
 last year at ted these were all my titles i had a lot of titles  i have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters 
 this year at ted i 'm happy to report that i have new titles in addition to my previous titles
 another associate director of research and this also happened so i have five daughters now
 because of the baby actually but that 's okay  
 we will still stay married i think  
 but looking way back when i was a child you see i grew up in a tofu factory in seattle many of you may not like tofu because you haven 't had good tofu but tofu 's a good food it 's a very simple kind of food it 's very hard work to make tofu 
 as a child we used to wake up at one one  a m and work till six p m six days a week my father was kind of like andy grove
 paranoid of the competition so often seven days a week  family business equals child labor  we were
 a great model
 so i loved going to school school was great  and maybe going to school helped me get to this media lab place i 'm not sure thank you but
 the media lab
  it 's important to me because as a student i was a computer science undergrad and i discovered design later on in my life and there was this person  muriel cooper who knows muriel cooper muriel cooper wasn 't she amazing muriel cooper  she was wacky  
 and she was a tedster  exactly  and she showed us she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again  and
 she 's very important in my life because she 's the one that told me to leave mit and go to art school it was the best advice i ever got so
  her she passed away 
 and ninety four and i was hired back to mit to try to fill her shoes but it 's so hard this amazing person muriel cooper  
 when i was in japan i went to an art school in japan
 i had a nice sort of situation because
 somehow i was connected to paul rand some of you guys know paul rand  the greatest graphic designer i 'm sorry out there the great graphic designer paul rand designed the
  logo the westinghouse logo  he basically said i 've designed everything and also ikko tanaka was a very important mentor in my life the paul rand of japan
 he designed most of the major icons of japan like issey miyake 's brand and also muji
  when you have mentors and yesterday  kareem abdul jabbar talked about
  these people in your life the problem with mentors is that they all die
 this is a sad thing  but it 's actually a happy thing in a way because you can remember them in their pure form
  i think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us when you get older and you 're all freaked out whatever  the mentors calm us down  and
 i 'm grateful for my mentors and i 'm sure all of you are too  because the human thing is very hard when you 're at mit  the t
  and because of that i always wondered about this human thing so i 've always been googling this word human to find out how many hits i get and in two thousand and one i had twenty six million hits and
 for computer because computers are against humans a bit  i have forty two million hits let me do an al gore here so if you sort of compare that 
 like this you 'll see that
 computer versus human i 've been tracking this for the last year computer versus human over the last year has changed it used to be kind of two to one now
  are catching up very good us humans we 're catching up with the computers in the simplicity realm it 's also interesting so
 if you compare
 complexities to simplicity
  it 's also catching up in a way too so somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined i think  
 i have a confession i 'm not a man of
  i spent my entire early career making complex stuff  lots of complex stuff i wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this i had clients in japan to make really complex stuff like this  
 and i 've always felt bad about it in a sense  so i hid in a time dimension  
 i
 built things in a time graphics dimension i did this series of calendars for shiseido this is a floral theme calendar
  you launch the number into space because the japanese believe that when you see fireworks you 're cooler for some reason this is why they have fireworks in the summer a very extreme culture
  lastly this is a fall based calendar because i have so many leaves in my yard so this is the leaves in my yard essentially  and
 so i made a lot of these types of things i 've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of
  and so i made all this kind of stuff that messes with with your eyes  i feel kind of bad about that  
 tomorrow paola antonelli is speaking i love paola she has this show right now at moma where
 some of these early works are here on display at moma on the walls if you 're in new york please go and see that  but i 've had a problem because i make all this flying stuff
  i know your work you 're the guy that makes eye candy 
 and when you 're told this you feel kind of weird eye candy sort of pejorative don 't you think  so  i say no i make eye meat instead laughter
 and eye meat is something different something more fibrous something more powerful perhaps but what could that be eye meat
  i 've been interested in computer programs all my life actually computer programs are essentially trees and when you make art with a computer program there 's kind of a problem
  art with a computer program you 're always on the tree  and the paradox is that for excellent art you want to be off the tree  so this is sort of a complication i 've found 
 so to get off the tree  i began to use my old computers i took these to tokyo in two thousand and one to make computer objects this is a
  you can 't type very much on this
 i also discovered that an ir mouse responds to crt emissions and starts to move by itself  so this is
 a self drawing machine  and also one year the g3 bondi blue thing that caddy would come out like dangerous
  made just to sort of understand what these things are 
 laughter shortly after this nine eleven happened and i was very depressed i was
 concerned with contemporary art that was all about piss and sort of really sad things and so i wanted to think about something happy so i focused on food as my area
 these sort of clementine peel things in japan  it 's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel just in one piece who 's done that before one piece clementine oh you guys are missing out
 very good  and i discovered i can make sculptures out of this actually  
 in different forms if you dry them quick you can make like elephants and steers and stuff and my wife didn 't like these because they mold so i had to stop that  
 so i went back to the computer  and i bought five large fries and scanned them all
  and i was looking for some kind of food theme and i wrote some software to automatically lay out
  and as a child i 'd hear that song you know oh beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain so i made this amber waves image  
 it 's sort of a midwest cornfield out of french fries  and also 
 as a child i was the fattest kid in class so i used to love cheetos oh i love cheetos yummy so i wanted to play with cheetos in some way
 i wasn 't sure where to go with this i invented cheeto paint cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with cheetos 
 i discovered that cheetos are good expressive material 
 and with these cheetos i began to think what can i make with these cheetos and so i began to crinkle up potato chip flecks and also pretzels
  i was looking for some kind of form and in the end i made one hundred
  people ask me how they make the antenna  sometimes they find a hair in the food that 's my hair 
 my hair 's clean it 's okay  i 'm a tenured professor which means basically i don 't have to work anymore it 's a strange business model 
 i can come into work everyday and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte 
 end of story but
 i realized that life could be very
  so i 've been thinking about life and
 i notice that my camera my digital camera versus my car a very strange thing 
 the car is so big the camera is so small yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual it
 doesn 't make any sense 
 so  i was in the cape one time
  this for the next twenty years or something  
 and i wrote this book the laws of simplicity it 's a very short simple book 
 there are ten laws and three keys the ten laws and three keys i won 't go over them because that 's why i have a book and also that 's why it 's on the web for free but the laws are kind of like
 sushi in a way  there are all kinds in japan they say that sushi is challenging you know the uni is the most challenging so number ten is challenging  people hate number ten like they hate uni actually  
  the three keys are easy to eat so this is anago  cooked already so easy to eat so enjoy your sushi meal later with the laws of simplicity
  i have what 's called the cookie versus laundry thing  anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie  which cookie are they going to take 
 the big cookie you can say the small cookie has godiva chocolate bits in it but it doesn 't work they want the big cookie  
 but
 if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold the small pile
 or the big pile  which will they choose  strangely not the big pile so i think it 's as simple as this  you know when you want more
  it 's because you want to enjoy it when you want less  it 's because it 's about work  and so to boil it all down 
 simplicity is about living life with more enjoyment and less pain i think this is sort of simple more versus less basically 
 it always depends 
 this book i wrote because i want to figure out life  i love life i love being
  to see things and so life is a big question i think in simplicity because you 're trying to simplify your life  
 and i just love to see the world the world is an amazing place by being at ted we see so many things at one time
  and i can 't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world like everything you see every time you wake up it 's such a joy to sort of experience
 everything in the world from everything from a weird hotel lobby to saran wrap placed over your window to this moment where i had my road in front of my house
  paved dark black and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun  and so this whole thing has struck me as
 exciting to be here because life is finite
  this was given to me by the chairman of shiseido  he 's an expert in aging this horizontal axis is how old you are twelve years old twenty four years old
  years old and this is some medical data so brain strength increases up to
  sixty  and then after sixty  it sort of goes down kind of depressing in a way 
 also if you look at your physical strength you know i have a lot of cocky freshmen at mit so i tell them oh your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger but in your late twenties and mid thirties cells they die 
 ok it gets them to work harder sometimes  and
 if you have your vision vision is interesting as you age from infant
 age
  your vision gets better and maybe in your late teens early twenties you 're looking for a mate and your vision goes after that 
 your social responsibility is very interesting so as you get older you may like have kids whatever and then the kids graduate and you have no responsibility any more that 's very good
