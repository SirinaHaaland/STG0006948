  the great philosopher aristotle said
 if something doesn 't exist  there 's no word for it and if there 's no word for something that something doesn 't
  so when we talk about elections we in established democracies we know what we 're talking about we 've got the words we have the vocabulary we know what a polling station is we know what a ballot paper is 
 but what about countries where democracy doesn 't exist 
 countries where there are no words to describe the concepts that underpin a democratic
  i work in the field of electoral assistance so that 's to say we assist emerging democracies to organize what is often their first elections 
 when people ask me what i do quite often i get this answer oh  so you 're one of these people who goes around the world imposing western democracy on countries that can 't handle it 
  the united nations does not impose anything on anybody  
 it really doesn 't and also what we do is firmly anchored in the one thousand nine hundred and forty eight
 universal declaration of human rights article twenty one that says that everybody should have the right to choose who governs them  
 so that 's the basis of the work i specialize in public outreach what does that mean another jargon it actually means designing
  information campaigns so that candidates and voters who have never had the opportunity to participate or to vote
 understand
 where when how to register where when how to vote  why  why it is important to take part so i 'll probably
 devise a specific campaign to reach out to women to make sure that they can take part that they can
 be part of the process  young people as well all sorts of people  handicapped people we try to reach everybody  
 and it 's not always easy because
 very often in this work i 've noticed now over the years that i 've been doing it
 that words are lacking  and so what do you do afghanistan  it 's a country with high levels of illiteracy
 the thing about that was it was in two thousand and five  and we organized
 two elections on the same day the reason was because the logistics are so incredibly difficult 
 it seemed to be more efficient to do that it was 
 but on the other hand explaining
 two elections
 instead of one was even more complicated so we used a lot of images and when it
  came to the actual ballot  we had problems because so many people wanted to take part we had
 three hundred candidates for for fifty two seats
 in the  wolesi jirga which is the parliamentary elections 
 and for the provincial council we had even more candidates we had three hundred and thirty for fifty four seats so talking about ballot design
  is what the ballot looked like it 's the size of a newspaper this was the wolesi jirga ballot yeah and
 this was the provincial council ballot even more so
 you see we did use a lot of symbols and things like
  we had other problems in southern sudan southern sudan was a very different story  we had
 so many people who had never of course voted but we had extremely extremely high levels of illiteracy 
 very very poor infrastructure for example i mean it 's a country the size of texas more or less we had seven kilometers of paved
  seven kilometers in the whole country  and that includes the tarmac where we landed the planes in juba airport so
 transporting electoral materials etc is exceedingly difficult 
 people had no idea about what a box looked like  it was very complicated  
 so using verbal communication was obviously the way to go  but
 there were one hundred and
  that was extremely challenging then
 i arrived in tunisia in two thousand and eleven  it was the arab spring a huge amount of
 of hope was generated by that enormous movement that was going on in the region there was libya there was egypt there was yemen  
 it was an enormous enormous historical moment and i was sitting with the election commission  and we were talking about various aspects of
  of the of the election and
 i was hearing them using words that i hadn 't actually heard before and i 'd worked with iraqis i 'd worked with
 jordanians egyptians and suddenly they were using these words and i just thought this is strange and what really gave rise to it was this word observer we were discussing
 election observers  and
  in a passive sort of sense as in i noticed he was wearing a light blue shirt did i go and check whether the shirt was light blue or not 
 that is the role of an election observer
  it 's very active it 's governed by all kinds of treaties and it has got that control function in it and then i got wind of the fact
  followers of an election so that 's not quite right either  because there is a term that 's already accepted and in use which was the word muraqib which means a controller it
 's got that notion of control so i thought three words for one concept this is not good  
 and with our colleagues we thought perhaps it 's our role to actually help
 make sure that the words are understood and actually
  create a work of reference that could be used across the arab region  
 and that 's what we did so together with these colleagues we launched the arabic lexicon of electoral terminology 
 and we worked in eight different countries
 it meant
 actually defining four hundred and eighty one terms which formed the basis of everything you need to know if you 're going to organize a democratic election
  we defined these terms and we worked with the arab colleagues and came to
 an agreement about what would be the appropriate word to use in arabic  
 because the arabic language is very rich  and that 's part of the problem but there are twenty two countries that speak arabic  and
 they use modern standard
  which is the arabic that is used across the whole region in newspapers and broadcasts 
 but of course then from one country to the next in day to day language and use it varies dialect colloquialisms etc  so that was another added layer of complication so
 in one sense you had the problem that language wasn 't fully
 ripe if you like neologisms were coming up new expressions and so we defined all these terms and then we had eight correspondents in
  in the in the region  we submitted the draft to them 
 they responded back to us yes we understand the definition we agree with it but this is what we say in our country because we were not 
  going to harmonize or force harmonization we were trying to facilitate understanding among people  
  the various countries 
 so this i 'm happy to say it took three years to produce this because we also finalized the draft and took it actually into the field sat with the election 
  commissions in all these different countries debated and defined and refined the draft 
  date there 's about three thousand downloads off
 the internet in pdf form 
 i heard just recently from a colleague that they 've taken it up in somalia they 're going to produce a version of this in somalia because there 's nothing in somalia at all so that 's that 's very
 good to know  and this newly formed arab
  are run in the region they 're using it as well
 and the arab league have now built up a
 pan arab observation unit and they 're using it so that 's all really good
  however this
 work of reference is is quite high pitched it 's complex and a lot of the terms are quite technical so the average person probably doesn 't need to know at least a third of it
  but the people of the middle east have been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education it 's part of our
 curriculum at school it doesn 't really exist in in that part of the world  
 and i feel it 's really the right of everybody to know how these things work and it 's a good thing to think about producing
 a work of reference for the average person and bearing in mind that now
 we have a basis to work with 
 but also we have technology so we can reach out using telephone apps  video  animation there 's all sorts of tools 
  that can be used now to communicate these ideas to people for the first time in their own language  
  terrorism we hear about sectarianism and all this horrible negative
 news that comes to us all the time what we 're not hearing is what are the people the everyday people thinking what are they aspiring to  
 let 's give them the means let 's give them the words 
 the silent majority is silent because they don 't have the words the silent
  majority needs to know it is time to provide people with the knowledge tools that they can inform themselves with 
 the silent majority does not need to be silent let 's help them have a voice  thank you very much
