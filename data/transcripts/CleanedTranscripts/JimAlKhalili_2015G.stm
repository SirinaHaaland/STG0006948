  like to introduce you to an emerging area of science one that is still speculative
 but hugely exciting and certainly one that 's growing very rapidly  quantum biology
 asks a very simple question does
  quantum mechanics that weird and wonderful and powerful theory of the subatomic world of atoms and molecules that underpins so much of modern physics and chemistry
 also play a role inside the living cell  in other words 
 are there processes mechanisms phenomena in in living organisms
 that can only be explained with a helping hand from quantum mechanics
 now quantum biology isn 't new it 's been around since the early 1930s 
 but it 's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments in biochemistry labs using spectroscopy
 have shown very clear firm evidence that there are certain specific mechanisms that require quantum mechanics to explain them  
 quantum biology brings together quantum physicists
 biochemists molecular biologists it 's a very interdisciplinary field i come from quantum physics so i 'm a a nuclear physicist i 've spent more than three decades trying to get my head around quantum mechanics
  one of the founders of quantum mechanics niels bohr said if you 're not astonished by it  then you haven 't understood it  
 so i sort of feel happy that i 'm still astonished by it that 's a good thing
  it means i study the very smallest structures
 in the universe the building blocks of of reality if we think about the scale of size start with an everyday object like the tennis ball 
 and just go down orders of magnitude in size from the eye of a needle down to a cell down to
  now nanotechnology may be a term you 've heard of 
 a nanometer is a billionth of a meter my area is the atomic nucleus which is the tiny dot inside an atom it 's even smaller
 in scale this is the domain of quantum mechanics and physicists and chemists have had a long time to try and get used to it  biologists
  on the other hand have got off lightly  in my view they are very happy with their 
  models of molecules 
 the balls are the atoms the sticks are the bonds between the atoms and when they can 't build them physically in the lab  nowadays they have very powerful computers that will simulate 
 a huge molecule  this is a protein made up of one hundred thousand atoms  
  quantum mechanics was developed in the 
 it is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas
 that explain the world of the very small  and it 's a world that 's very different from our everyday world made up of trillions of atoms it 's a world built on probability
  it 's a fuzzy world it 's a world of phantoms where particles can also behave like spread out waves
  if we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics then as the fundamental
 foundation of reality itself then
 it 's not surprising that we say quantum physics underpins organic chemistry  after all it gives us the rules that tell us how the atoms fit together to make organic molecules organic chemistry scaled up in complexity
  gives us molecular biology  which of course leads to life itself
  so in a way it 's sort of not surprising it 's almost trivial you say well of course life ultimately must depend of quantum mechanics 
 but
 so does everything else  so does all inanimate matter made up of trillions of atoms  ultimately there
  where we have to delve into this weirdness  but in everyday life  we can forget about it  because once you put together trillions of atoms that quantum weirdness just dissolves away  
 quantum biology isn 't about this  quantum biology isn 't this obvious of course quantum mechanics underpins life at
  quantum biology is about looking for
 the non trivial the counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics and to see if they do indeed play an important role in describing the processes of life 
 here is my
 perfect example of the 
 of the quantum world  this is the quantum skier he seems to be intact he seems to be perfectly healthy
  and yet he seems to have gone around both sides of that tree at the same time
  well if you saw tracks like that you 'd guess it was some sort of stunt of course but in the quantum world  this happens all the time 
 particles can multitask they can be in two places at once they can do more than one thing at the same time 
 particles can behave like spread out waves  it 's almost like magic 
 physicists and chemists have had nearly a
  century of trying to get used to this weirdness 
 i don 't blame the biologists for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics you see 
 this weirdness is is very delicate  and we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs we
 cool our system down to near absolute zero  we carry out our experiments in vacuums we try and
 isolate it from any external disturbance
 that 's very different from the warm messy  noisy environment of a living cell 
 biology itself if you think of molecular biology seems to have done very well in describing all the processes of life in terms of chemistry chemical reactions and these are
 reductionist deterministic chemical reactions
  is made of the same stuff as everything else  and if we can forget about quantum mechanics in the macro world  then we should be able to forget about it in biology as well  
 well  one man begged to differ with this idea
  influential it influenced francis crick and james watson the discoverers of the double helix structure of dna 
 to paraphrase a description in the book he says at the molecular level 
 living organisms have a certain order a structure to them
 that 's very different from the random thermodynamic jostling of atoms and molecules in inanimate
  matter
 of the same complexity  
 in fact living matter seems to behave in this order in a structure just like inanimate matter cooled down to near absolute zero  
 where quantum effects play a very important role 
 there 's something special
 about the structure the order inside a living cell so schrdinger speculated that maybe quantum mechanics
  mechanics plays a role in life it
 's a very speculative far reaching idea  and it didn 't really go very far 
 but as i mentioned at the start in the last ten years there have been experiments emerging showing where
 some of these
 certain phenomena in biology do seem to require quantum mechanics i want to share with you just a few of the
  this is one of the
 phenomena in the quantum world quantum tunneling  the box on the left shows the 
  distribution of a quantum entity a particle like an electron  which is not a little
 ball bouncing off a wall  it 's a wave that has a certain probability of being able to permeate through a solid wall  like a phantom leaping through to the other side you can
  see a faint smudge of light in the right hand box 
 quantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier  and yet somehow 
 as though by magic disappear from one side and reappear on the other  
 the nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall  you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall  in the quantum world you don 't have to throw it over the
  wall you can throw it at the wall  and there 's a certain non zero probability that it 'll disappear on your side and reappear on the other this isn 't speculation by the way  we 're happy well happy is not the right word 
 we are familiar with this 
 quantum tunneling takes place all the time  in fact  it 's the reason our sun shines
  particles fuse together and the sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling 
 back in the 70s and 80s it was discovered that quantum tunneling also takes place inside living cells
  enzymes those workhorses of of life
  the catalysts of chemical reactions enzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in in living cells by many many orders of
  magnitude and it 's always been a mystery how they do this 
 well it was discovered that one of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of 
 is by transferring subatomic particles like electrons and indeed protons from one
 part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling it
  's efficient it 's fast it can disappear a proton can disappear from one place and reappear on the other enzymes help this take place  
 this is research that 's been carried out back in the 80s particularly by a group in berkeley judith  klinman 
 other groups in the uk have now also confirmed that enzymes really do this 
 research carried out by my group so so as i mentioned
 i 'm a nuclear physicist but i 've realized i 've got these tools of using quantum mechanics in in atomic nuclei
 and so can apply those tools in other areas as well  one question we asked is
 whether quantum tunneling plays a role in mutations in dna  again this is not a new idea it goes all the way back to the early
 60s the two strands of dna the double helix structure are held together by rungs it 's like a twisted ladder and those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds
  protons that act as the glue between the two strands so if you zoom in   what they 're doing is holding these large molecules nucleotides together 
 zoom in a bit more so this a computer simulation 
 the two white balls in the middle are protons  and you can see that it 's a double hydrogen bond one prefers to sit on one side the other on the other side of the two strands
  of the two strands of the vertical lines going down which you can 't see 
 it can happen that these two protons can hop over watch the two white balls they can jump over to the other side  if the 
 two strands of dna then separate leading to the process of replication and the two protons are in the wrong
  this can lead to a mutation  this has been known for half a century the question is how likely are they to do that and if they do 
 how do they do it do they jump across like the ball going over the wall  or can they quantum tunnel across even if they don 't have enough energy
 early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here we still don 't know yet how important it is this is still an open question
  one of those questions that is so important that if quantum mechanics plays a role in mutations  surely this must have big implications to understand
 certain types of mutations possibly even those that lead to turning a
 cell cancerous another example
 of quantum mechanics in biology is is quantum coherence in one of the most important processes in
  plants and bacteria taking sunlight  and using that energy to create biomass 
 quantum coherence is the idea of of quantum entities multitasking it 's the quantum skier  it 's
 an object that behaves like a wave so that it doesn 't just move in one direction or the other but can follow multiple pathways at the same time 
 some years ago the world of science was shocked
 when a paper was published
 showing experimental evidence that quantum coherence takes place inside bacteria  carrying out photosynthesis  the idea is that the photon the particle of light 
 the sunlight the quantum of light captured by a chlorophyll molecule is then delivered to what 's called the reaction center where it can be turned into chemical energy  
 efficient way of reaching the reaction center without dissipating as waste heat  
 quantum coherence taking place inside a living cell a remarkable idea  and yet evidence is growing
 almost weekly with new papers coming out confirming that this does indeed take place
  my third and final example is the most beautiful wonderful idea it 's also still very speculative but
 i have to share it with you the european robin
 migrates from scandinavia down to the mediterranean every autumn 
 and like a lot of other marine animals and even insects  they navigate by sensing the earth 's magnetic field
  the earth 's magnetic field is very very weak it 's one hundred times weaker than than a fridge magnet and yet it affects
 the chemistry somehow within a living organism that 's not in doubt a german couple of ornithologists  wolfgang and
 in the 1970s confirmed that indeed the robin does find its way by somehow sensing the earth 's magnetic field to give it directional
  the puzzle the mystery was how does it do it  well  the only theory in town
 we don 't know if it 's the correct theory but the only theory in town is that it does it via something called quantum entanglement 
 inside the robin 's retina i kid you not inside the robin 's retina is a protein called
  are far apart  and yet somehow remain in contact with each other even einstein hated this idea he called it spooky action at a distance 
 so if einstein doesn 't like it then we can all be uncomfortable with it
  electrons within a single molecule dance a delicate dance that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the earth 's magnetic field  
 we don 't know if it 's the correct explanation but
 wow  wouldn 't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate  quantum biology is still in it infancy  it 's
 still speculative but i believe it 's built on solid science i also think that in the coming
 decade or so we 're going to start to see that actually it pervades life that
  life has evolved tricks that utilize the quantum world  watch this space
