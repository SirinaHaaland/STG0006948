  like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects i think it 's one of the most exciting that i 'm working on but i think it 's also the simplest  it 's a
 project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world it addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet
  the number one cause of death in children under five  which is 
 water borne diseases  diarrhea  malnutrition no it
 's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires acute respiratory infections caused by this can you believe that 
 i find this shocking and somewhat appalling can 't we make cleaner burning cooking
  fuels can 't we make better stoves how is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year  i know bill joy was talking to you about the wonders of of carbon nanotubes so i 'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro tubes 
 which is charcoal 
 so this is a picture of rural
  percent deforested 
 you 'll see scenes like this all over the island  it leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the
 throughout the nation a couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths that 's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil so the rains come they go down the rivers and
  now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this people need to cook and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it it
 's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage they know perfectly well but they have no other choice fossil fuels are not available and solar energy doesn 't cook the way that they like their food prepared and so this
  this is what they do you 'll find families like this who go out into the
 forest to find a tree cut it down and make charcoal out of it 
 so not surprisingly there 's a lot of effort that 's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels 
 about four years ago i took a team of students down to haiti and we worked with peace corps volunteers there this is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked and the idea was that you could take waste paper you could
  compress it and make
 briquettes that could be used for fuel  but this device was very slow  so our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes they were able to triple the throughput of this device  
 so you could imagine they were very excited about it and they they took the briquettes back to mit so that they could test them  
 and one of the things that they found was
 they didn 't burn
 so it was a little discouraging to the students 
 and in fact if you look closely  right here you can see it says us peace corps 
 as it turns out there actually wasn 't any waste paper in this village  and while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his
  was eight hundred kilometers away  and
 so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel 
 what we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level you see these all over haiti as well they 're small scale sugar mills and the waste 
  product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called bagasse it has no other use it has no nutritional value so they don 't feed it to the animals it just sits in a pile near the sugar
  mill until eventually they burn it 
 what we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with 
 something like charcoal  
 so over the next couple of years students
 and i worked to develop a process  so you start with the
  and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five gallon oil drum  after some time after setting it on fire you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln  and then you end up with this carbonized material here  
 however you can 't burn this it 's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking  
 so we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes 
 and conveniently one of my students was from ghana
 and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called kokonte which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root  
 and so what we did was we looked and we found that cassava is indeed grown in haiti under the name of manioc
 in fact it 's grown all over the world yucca  tapioca manioc cassava it 's all the same thing a very starchy root
  and you can make a very thick sticky porridge out of it which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes so we
 did this we went down to haiti these are the graduates of the first ecole de  charbon or charcoal institute and these that 's
 right so i 'm actually an instructor at mit as well as
 and these are the briquettes that we made now i 'm going to take you to a different continent
 this is india and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in india it 's cow dung and
 more than in haiti this produces really smoky fires and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with
 cow dung and biomass as a fuel  kids and women are especially affected by it because they 're the ones who are around the cooking fires  so we wanted to see
  if we could introduce this charcoal making technology there well unfortunately they didn 't have sugarcane and they didn 't have cassava but that didn 't stop us 
 what we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass and there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area  
 and what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure which they used ordinarily for their fuel  
 and we did
 side by side tests and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung and you can see that it 's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel and in fact it heats the water a lot 
  more quickly  and so we were very happy  thus far but one of the things that we found was when we did side by side comparisons with wood charcoal it didn 't burn as long and the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking so we
  wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in haiti  
 so we went back to mit we
 took out the instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces you needed in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it 
 and at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this we also had community partners
  in haiti
 working to develop the process to improve it and make it more
 more accessible to people in the villages there  and after some time we developed
 a  low cost press that allows you to produce charcoal which actually now burns not only
  than wood charcoal  so now we 're in a situation where we have a product which is actually better than what you can buy in haiti in the marketplace which is a very
 wonderful place to be 
 in haiti alone about thirty million trees are cut down every year there 's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of
  in addition the revenue generated from that charcoal is two hundred and sixty million dollars that 's an awful lot for a country like haiti
 with a population of eight million and an average income
 of less than four hundred dollars  
 so this is where we 're also moving ahead with our charcoal project and one of the things that i think is also interesting is i have a a friend up at uc berkeley who 's been doing risk analysis and he 's looked at the problem of
 the health impacts of
  burning wood versus charcoal and he 's found that worldwide you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel that 's remarkable but 
  up until now there weren 't ways to do it without cutting down trees but now we have a way that 's using an agricultural waste material
  i think it 's the coolest thing and it 's even lower tech than what you just saw  if you can imagine such a thing here it is so what is this 
 this is corncobs turned into charcoal and the beauty of this is that you don 't need to form briquettes it comes ready made this is my $ one hundred laptop right here
  so we can pass these around 
 they 're fully functional field tested ready to roll out 
 and i think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology is that the technology transfer is
  compared to the sugarcane charcoal where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder this comes pre briquetted and this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now which
 is perhaps a sad commentary on my life 
 but once you see it like you guys in the front row all right  yeah  ok so anyway 
  and this is i think a perfect example of what robert wright was talking about in those 
 things so not only do you have health benefits you have environmental benefits  but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also 
  have economic benefits people can make their own cooking fuel from waste products they can generate income from
  they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren 't making their own 
 it 's really rare that you don 't have  trade offs between health and economics or environment and economics  so this is a project that i just find extremely exciting and i 'm
 really really looking forward to see where it takes us 
  so when we talk about now the future we will create one of the things that i think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in 
 and now i don 't actually mean the world that we live in 
 i mean the world
 where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat  
 i mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand and where when you work ten hours a day
  you 're still only earning sixty dollars in a month i
 mean the world where women and children spend forty billion hours a year fetching water 
 that 's as if the entire workforce of the state of california worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water 
 it 's a place
 where for example if this were india
  in this room only three of us would have a car if this were afghanistan only one person in this room would know how the use the internet if this were zambia
 three hundred of you would be farmers one hundred of you would have aids or hiv  and more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a
  these are the issues that we need to
 come up with solutions for 
 these are the issues that we need to be training our engineers our designers our business people our entrepreneurs to be facing 
 these are the solutions that we need to find i have a few areas that i believe are especially important that we address 
 one of them is creating technologies
  so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out and that they 're not doing it using the same traditional basket making poultry rearing etc  but there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale 
 the next thing i believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own
  and we need to rethink our development strategies  so that we 're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers  but rather to stop being poor farmers  
 and we need to think about how we can do that effectively 
 we need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems 
 that 's the best way to do it we shouldn 't be doing it from outside  
 so we need to create this future
 we need to start doing it now  thank you
  can maintain their own water systems know when they 're working know when they treat them etc we 're also looking at 
  systems one of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that ca 
 what 's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale  do you need to find
  or venture capitalists or what do you need to take what you 've got and get it to scale as
 i think it 's large numbers of people moving it forward  it 's a difficult thing it 's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income so you can 't use the same models that you use in the united states for making things move forward and we
 're a pretty small staff
