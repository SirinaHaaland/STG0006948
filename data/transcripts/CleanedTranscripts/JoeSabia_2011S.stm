  ladies and gentlemen gather around i would love to share with you a story 
 once upon a time in  19th century germany  there was the book 
 now during this time the book was the king of storytelling it was venerable it was
  ubiquitous  but
 it was a little bit boring 
 because in its four hundred years of existence storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device 
 but then one author arrived and he changed the game
 forever 
 his name was lothar lothar meggendorfer
 lothar meggendorfer put his foot down and he said genug ist genug 
 he grabbed his pen he snatched his scissors 
 this man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold 
 history would know lothar meggendorfer as who else

 they were happy because the story survived and that the world would keep on spinning 
 lothar meggendorfer wasn 't the first to evolve the way a story was told and he certainly wasn 't the last whether storytellers realized it or not they were channeling meggendorfer

 and things got a lot more fun when the internet came around
  people broadcast their stories throughout the world but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices 
 for example one company would tell a story of love
 through its very own search

  one man would tell the stories of his father
 by using a platform called twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate
  and after all this everyone paused they took a step back 
 they realized that in six thousand years of storytelling they 've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls
 to depicting
 shakespeare
  on facebook walls and this was a cause for celebration 
 the art of storytelling has remained unchanged and for the most part the stories are recycled 
 but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure
