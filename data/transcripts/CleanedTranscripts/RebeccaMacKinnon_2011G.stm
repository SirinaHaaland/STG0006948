  so i begin with an advertisement inspired by george orwell that apple ran in
  underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today technology created by innovative companies will set us all free
 fast forward more than two decades apple launches the iphone in china and censors the dalai lama out along with several
 other politically sensitive applications at the request of the chinese government for its chinese app store 
 the american political cartoonist mark fiore also had his satire application censored in the united states because some of apple 's 
  staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups his app wasn 't reinstated until he won the pulitzer prize
  the german magazine stern a news magazine had its app censored because the apple nannies deemed it to be a little bit too racy for their users 
 and despite the fact that this magazine is perfectly legal for sale on newsstands throughout germany 
 and more controversially recently apple censored a palestinian protest app after the israeli government voiced concerns that
  it might be used to organize violent attacks  
 so here 's the thing we have a situation where private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary
 and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies or they 're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the
 or they 're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many or most of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question 
 so here 's the situation in a pre internet world sovereignty over our physical
  but now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace  and their decisions about software coding engineering design terms of 
  service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives  and their sovereignties cross cutting
  in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation states in very exciting ways but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control 
  over what people can and cannot do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world 
  after all even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year  
 and these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in tunisia and egypt this past spring and beyond 
 as wael ghonim 
  famously said to cnn after mubarak stepped down if you want to liberate a society  just give them the internet 
 but overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated on the left there 's a photo taken by an egyptian activist who was part of the storming of the egyptian state security offices in march  
 and
 many of the agents shredded
  documents as they could and left them behind in piles  but some of the files were left behind intact  and activists some of them found their own surveillance dossiers 
 full of transcripts of their email exchanges their cellphone text message exchanges even skype conversations and one activist actually found a contract 
 from a western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the egyptian security forces 
  technologies for surveillance are still being used by the transitional authorities running the networks there 
 and in tunisia censorship actually began to return in may not nearly as extensively as under president ben ali but you 'll see here a blocked page 
 of what happens when you try to reach certain facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite
  violence 
 in protest over this blogger slim amamou who had been jailed under ben ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution he resigned in protest from the cabinet 
 but there 's been a lot of debate in tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem  in fact on twitter there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution who said well actually we do want democracy
  and free expression  but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off bounds because it 's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy  but the problem is how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions
 and how do you make sure that they do not abuse their power as riadh guerfali the veteran digital activist from
  things were simple you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other today things are a lot more subtle 
 welcome to democracy our tunisian and egyptian friends the reality is that even in democratic societies today  we do not have 
  good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand
  and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks in fact  in the united states  whatever you may think of julian assange 
 even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the united states government and some companies have handled wikileaks amazon webhosting 
  dropped wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from u s senator joe lieberman despite the fact that wikileaks had not been
  charged  let alone convicted of any crime  
 so we assume that the internet is a border busting technology this is a map of social networks worldwide and certainly facebook has conquered much of the world
 which is either a good or a bad thing depending on how you like
  the way facebook manages its service 
 but borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace  in brazil and japan it 's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons 
 but if you look at china  vietnam and a number of the former soviet states 
 what 's happening there is more troubling you have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies
 is creating a situation where effectively the
  empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government now in china you have 
  the great firewall as it 's well known that blocks facebook and
  that 's done in part with the help from western technology but that 's only half of the story the other part of the story are requirements that the chinese government places on all companies operating on the chinese internet known as as a system of 
 in plain english that means censorship and surveillance of their users and this is a ceremony i actually attended in two thousand and nine where the internet society of china presented awards to the top twenty chinese companies
  that are best at exercising
  policing their content and robin li ceo of baidu china 's dominant search engine was one of the recipients 
 in russia they do not generally block the internet and directly censor websites  but this is a website called rospil that 's an
  this year there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to rospil through a payments processing system called yandex money
 suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to rospil 
 through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people
 at yandex money this has a chilling effect on people 's ability to use the internet to hold government accountable  
 so we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the 
  internet which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services
 so the important question i think is not this debate over whether the internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys of course it 's going to empower whoever is most 
  skilled at using the technology and best understands the internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is 
 citizen centric manner 
 because i think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens and i would argue that the only legitimate 
  purpose of technology is to improve our lives not to manipulate or enslave us 
  the question is we know how to hold government accountable we don 't necessarily always do it very well but we have a sense of what the models are politically and institutionally to do that 
 how do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most ceo 's argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit  
  you have situations for instance in france where president sarkozy tells the ceo 's of internet companies we 're the only legitimate
 representatives of the public interest but then he goes and champions laws like the infamous three strikes law that would disconnect citizens from the internet
 for file sharing which has been condemned by the u n special rapporteur on freedom of expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens ' right to communications and has raised questions amongst
  civil society groups about whether
 some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens 
 and here in the united kingdom there 's also concern over a law called the digital economy act that 's placing more onus on private intermediaries to police citizen behavior
 so what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a 
 internet in the future we need a broader and more sustained internet freedom movement after all companies didn 't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course  
 or employing 10 year olds as a matter of course just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do
  it was the result of decades of sustained activism shareholder advocacy and consumer advocacy similarly governments don 't enact
 intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day it 's the result of very sustained and prolonged political activism that you get the right regulations and that you get the right corporate behavior
  to make the same approach with the internet  
 we also are going to need political innovation  eight hundred years ago approximately
  the barons of england decided that the divine right of kings was no longer working for them so well 
 and they forced king john to sign the magna carta  
 which recognized that even the
 king who claimed to have divine rule
 still had to abide by a basic set of rules 
 this set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed which was implemented for the first 
  time by that radical revolutionary government in america across the pond
  we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked  and what does that look like 
 at the moment we still don 't know  but it 's going to require
 innovation that 's not only going to need to focus on politics on geopolitics 
  also going to need to deal with questions of business management investor behavior  consumer choice
 and even software design and engineering  
 each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology
 serve the world 's people and not the other way around  thank you very much
