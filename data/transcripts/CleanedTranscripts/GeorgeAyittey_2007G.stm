  ted global for putting
  this conference is going to rank as the most important
 in the beginning of the  21st century 
 think african governments will put together a conference like this you think the a u will put together a conference like this
 even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid 
 i would also like to pay
  and the other ted fellows i call them the cheetah generation 
 the cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption
  accountability and democracy is they 're not going to wait for government to do things for them  
 that 's the cheetah generation and africa 's salvation rests on the backs of these cheetahs  
 in contrast of course we have the hippo generation 
 laughter the hippo generation are the ruling elites  they are stuck in their intellectual patch
  about colonialism and imperialism  they wouldn 't move one foot if
 you ask them to reform the economies they 're not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo
  now there are a lot of africans who are very angry angry
 at the condition of africa 
  talking about a continent that is not poor  it is rich in mineral resources natural mineral resources  
 but the mineral wealth of africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty  
 that 's what makes a lot of africans very angry  
 and in a way africa is more than a tragedy in more ways than one 
 there 's another enduring tragedy and that tragedy is
  so many people so many governments so many organizations who want to help the people in africa  they don 't understand  
 now  we 're not saying don 't help africa  helping africa is noble  but helping africa
 has been turned
 into a theater of the absurd it 's like the blind leading the clueless
 there are certain things that we need to recognize africa
 leaks did you know that forty percent of the wealth created in africa is not invested here in africa it
 's taken out of africa that 's what the world bank
  there are people who think that we should pour more money more aid into this bowl which leaks what
 are the leakages  corruption alone costs africa one hundred and
  capital flight out of africa  eighty billion a year  
 put that aside 
 let 's take food imports  every year africa spends twenty billion dollars to import food 
 just add that up all these leakages  that 's far more than the fifty billion tony blair wants to raise for africa
 africa not only fed itself it also exported food not anymore  
 we know that something has gone fundamentally wrong you know it i know it but let 's not waste
 our time talking about these mistakes because we 'll spend all day here let 's move on and flip over
 to the next chapter
  and that 's what this conference is all about the next chapter the next chapter begins
 with first of all asking ourselves this fundamental question whom do we want to help in africa there
 is the people  and then there is the government
  previous speaker before me idris mohammed  indicated that
 we 've had abysmal leadership in africa that characterization  in my view is even more charitable
  to an internet discussion forum an african internet discussion forum  
 and i asked them  i said since one thousand nine hundred and
 sixty  we 've had exactly two hundred and four african heads of state  since one thousand nine hundred and sixty 
 and i asked them to name me just twenty good leaders 
  you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself i asked them to name me just twenty everybody mentioned nelson mandela
  couldn 't go beyond fifteen 
 even if they had been able to name me twenty what does that tell you 
 twenty out of two hundred and four
 means that
 the vast majority of the african leaders failed their people  
 and if you look at them the slate of the
 post colonial leaders
 an assortment of military fufu heads swiss bank socialists  crocodile liberators vampire elites  
 quack revolutionaries now
 this leadership
 is a far cry from the traditional leaders that africans have known for centuries  the second
  premise that we make when we 're trying to help africa is that sometimes we think
 that there is something called a government
 in africa that cares about its people  serves the interests of the people and represents the people  
  there is one particular quote
 a lesotho chief once said that here in lesotho we 've got two problems 
 rats and the government 
 what you and i understand as a government
 doesn 't exist in many african countries in fact what we call our governments are vampire states
  who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves their cronies  and tribesmen and exclude everybody else  
 the richest people in africa are
  and ministers and quite often the chief bandit is the head of state himself 
 where do they get their money 
 by creating wealth no by raking it off the backs of their suffering people  
 that 's not wealth creation it 's wealth redistribution  
 the third fundamental
  issue that we have to recognize is that
 if we want to help the african people  we must know where the african people are take any african economy 
 an african economy can be broken up into three sectors  there is the modern sector  
 there is the informal sector
 and the traditional sector
 the modern sector is the abode of the elites it 's the seat of government in many african countries
 the modern sector is lost it 's dysfunctional  
 it is a meretricious fandango of imported systems which the elites themselves don 't understand 
  that is the source of many of africa 's problems where the struggles for political power
 emanate and then spill over
 onto the informal and the traditional sector  claiming innocent lives 
 now the modern sector of course is where a lot of the development aid
 and resources went into more than eighty percent of ivory coast 's development went into the modern sector
 the other sectors the informal and the
 traditional sectors 
 are where you find the majority of the african people  the real people in africa  that 's where you find them  
 now obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people  you go where the people are
  the informal
 and
 the traditional sectors now traditional sector is where africa produces its agriculture 
 which is one of the reasons why africa can 't feed itself  and that 's why it must import food all
 right you cannot develop africa
 by ignoring
  develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work 
 these two sectors let me describe to you have their own indigenous institutions  
 first one is the political system 
 traditionally
  they hate tyranny if you look into their traditional systems africans organize their states
 in two types  the first one
 belongs to those ethnic societies
 who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous  so they didn 't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority
  the kikuyus for example  they have no chiefs  the other ethnic groups  which did have chiefs  made sure
 that they surrounded the chiefs
 with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power  
  for example the chief cannot make any decision
 without the concurrence of the council of elders without the council the chief can 't pass any law  and if the chief doesn 't govern according to the will of the people
 he will be removed if not the people will abandon the chief go somewhere else and set up set up a new settlement
  and even if you look in ancient african
  all organized around one particular principle the confederacy principle 
 which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority  decentralization of power  
 now this is what i have described to you this is part of africa 's indigenous political heritage  now compare that to the modern systems
 the ruling elites established on africa
  in the economic system
 in traditional africa  
 the means of production is privately owned it 's owned by extended families you
 see in the west the basic economic and social unit is the individual  the american will say i am because
 i am  and i can damn well do anything i want 
  connotes community
 the extended family system the extended family system pools its resources together  they own farms they decide what to do what to produce 
 they don 't take any orders from their chiefs  they decide what to do 
 and when they produce their crops
  they sell the surplus
 on marketplaces when they make a profit it is theirs to keep not for the chief to sequester it from them so
 in a nutshell what we had in traditional africa was a free market system  
 there were markets in africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent timbuktu was one great big market town  kano salaga they were all there even if you go to west africa
  you notice that
 market activity in west africa has always been dominated by women 
 so it 's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace the market is not alien to africa  
 what africans practiced was a different form of capitalism 
 but then after independence  all of a sudden markets capitalism became became a western institution 
 and the leaders said africans were ready for socialism nonsense
  and even then what kind of socialism did they practice  
 the socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of swiss bank socialism which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and plunder africa 
 treasuries for deposit in switzerland  that is not the kind of system africans had known for centuries  
 what do we do now  go back to africa 's indigenous institutions and this is
  where we charge the cheetahs
 to go into the informal sectors  the traditional sectors  that 's where you find the african people  and i 'd like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector 
 about the boat building that i myself  tried to mobilize africans in the diaspora to invest in 
  he will be able to employ more ghanaians it also means that he will be able to generate wealth
  of africans still rely on traditional medicine the modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed  now  this is an area
  a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area this is where we need to mobilize africans in the diaspora especially
  to invest in this we also need to mobilize africans in the diaspora not only to go into the traditional
 sectors but to go into agriculture and also to instigate
 change from within  
 we were able to mobilize ghanaians in the diaspora to to instigate change in ghana and bring about democracy in ghana 
 and i know that with the cheetahs  we can take africa back one village at a time thank you very much
