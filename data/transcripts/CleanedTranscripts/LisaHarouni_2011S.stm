  reality today
 that you can download products from the web product data i should say from the web
 perhaps tweak it and personalize it to your own preference or your own taste and have that information
  sent to a desktop machine
 that will fabricate it for you on the spot  we can actually build for you very rapidly a physical object 
 and the reason we can do this is through an emerging technology called additive manufacturing or 3d printing
  this is a 3d printer  
 they have been around for almost thirty years now which is quite amazing to think of but
 they 're only just starting to filter into the public arena
 and typically you would take data like the data of a pen here  which would be a geometric representation of that product in 3d 
 and we would pass that data with material into a machine and a process that would happen in the machine would mean layer by layer that
  product would be built  and we can take out the physical product and ready to use or to perhaps assemble into something else  
 but if these machines have been around for almost thirty years why don 't we know about them
 because typically they 've been
 too inefficient  inaccessible they 've not been fast enough they 've been quite expensive but today
 becoming a reality that they are now becoming successful many barriers are breaking down that means that you guys will soon be able to access one of these machines if not this minute
 and it will change and disrupt the landscape of manufacturing and most certainly our lives our businesses and the lives of our children  
 so how does it work
  it typically reads cad data  which is a product design data created on professional product design programs and here you can see an engineer it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer
 create a product in 3d and this data gets sent to a machine that slices the data into
  of that product
 all the way through almost like slicing it like salami 
 and that data layer by layer gets passed through the machine starting at the base of the product and depositing material layer upon layer infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer
 in an additive process  and this material that 's deposited either starts as a liquid
  material powder form 
 and the bonding process can happen by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting in this case we can see a laser sintering machine developed by eos it 's actually using a laser to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer 
 and over time quite rapidly actually in a number of hours we can build a physical product ready to take out of the machine and use  
 and this is quite an extraordinary idea  but it is reality today
  so all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way  they were all 3d printed  and
 you can see they 're ranging from shoes  rings that were made out of stainless steal  phone covers out of plastic 
 all the way through to spinal implants for example
  'll notice about all of these products is they 're very very intricate the design is
 quite extraordinary 
 because we 're taking this data in 3d form slicing it up before it gets past the machine we can actually create structures that are more
 intricate than any other manufacturing technology or in
  are impossible to build in any other way  
 and you can create parts with moving components hinges parts within parts so in some cases we can abolish totally the need for manual labor  
 it sounds great  
 it is great  
 we can have 3d printers today that build structures like these this is almost three meters high  
 and this was built by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer in layers of
  about five millimeters to ten mm in thickness slowly growing this structure  this was created by an architectural firm called shiro  
 and you can actually walk into it 
 and on the other end of the spectrum this is a microstructure it 's
 created depositing layers of about four microns  so really the resolution is quite incredible the detail that you can get today
  is quite amazing so who 's using it typically because we can create products very rapidly
 it 's been used by product designers or anyone who wanted to prototype a product
 and very quickly create or reiterate a design 
 and actually what 's quite amazing about this technology as well is that you can create bespoke products en masse  there 's very little economies
  of scale  so you can now create one offs very easily  
 architects for example they want to create prototypes of buildings  again you can see this is a
 building of the free university in berlin and it was designed by foster and partners  
 again not buildable in any other way and very hard to even create this by hand 
 now this is an
  engine
 component it was developed by a company called within technologies and  3t rpd  
 it 's very very  very detailed inside with the design now 3d printing can break away barriers in design which challenge the constraints of mass production 
  actually sitting here you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it 
 which means it 's a more efficient product  you can 't create this with standard manufacturing techniques even if you tried to do it manually  
 it 's more efficient
 because we can now create all these cavities within the object that cool fluid  and it 's used by aerospace
 and automotive  it 's a lighter part
 and
  uses less material waste so it 's overall performance and efficiency
 just exceeds standard mass produced products 
 and then taking this idea of creating a very detailed structure we can apply it to honeycomb structures and use them within
 implants  typically an implant is
 more effective within the body if it 's more porous because our body tissue will grow into it
 there 's a lower chance of rejection  
 but it 's very hard to create that in standard ways with 3d printing
 we 're seeing today that we can create much better implants  and in fact because we can create bespoke products en masse one offs we can create implants that are specific to individuals
  so as you can see  this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic and we 're starting to see it being used for final end products  
 and in fact  as the detail is improving the quality is improving the price of the machines
 are falling and they 're becoming quicker they 're also now small enough to sit on a desktop  you can buy a machine today for
  that you can create yourself 
 which is quite incredible  but then it begs the question  why don 't we all have one in our home  
 because simply most of us here today don 't know how to create the data that a 3d printer reads 
 if i gave you a 3d printer  you wouldn 't know how to direct it to make what you want it to but there are more and more
 technologies software and processes today that are breaking down those barriers  i believe we 're at a tipping point where
 this is now
 something that we can 't
 avoid this technology is really going to disrupt the landscape of manufacturing and i believe cause a revolution in manufacturing  
 so today  you can download products from the web
 anything you would have on your desktop
  you can use software like google sketchup to create products from scratch very easily  
 3d printing can be also used to download spare parts from the web  
 so imagine you have say a hoover in your home and it has broken down  you need a spare part but you realize that that hoover 's been discontinued 
 can you imagine going online this is a reality
 and finding that spare part from a database of geometries of that discontinued product and downloading that information that data and having the product
 made for you at home  ready to use on your demand  and in fact because we can create spare parts with things the machines are quite literally making
  you 're having machines fabricate themselves these are parts of a reprap machine which is a kind of desktop printer  
 but what interests my company the most is the fact that you can create individual unique products en masse
   there 's no need to do a run of thousands of millions or send that product to be injection molded in china you can just make it physically on the spot
  which means that we can now present to the public
 the next generation of customization this is something that is now possible today that you can direct personally how you want your products to look we
 're all familiar with the idea of customization or personalization brands like nike are doing it it 's all over the web in fact every major household name is allowing you to interact with their products
 on a daily basis all the way from smart cars to prada
 to ray ban for example  but this is not really mass customization it 's known as variant production variations of the same product 
 what you could do is really influence your product now 
  i 'm not sure about you guys but i 've had experiences when i 've walked into a store and i 've know exactly what i 've wanted and i 've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp that i know where i want to sit in my house
 and i just can 't find the right thing or that perfect piece of jewelry
 as a gift or for myself imagine that you can now engage with a brand
 and
  so that you can pass your personal attributes to the products that you 're about to buy  
 you can today download a product with software like this 
 view the product in 3d this is the sort of 3d data that a machine will read  this is a lamp and
 you can start iterating the design you can direct
 what color that product will
  perhaps what material  
 and also you can engage in shape manipulation of that product but within boundaries that are safe because obviously the public are not professional product designers the piece of software will keep an individual within the bounds of the possible 
 and when somebody is ready to purchase the product in their personalized design they click enter and this data gets converted into the data that a 3d printer reads
 and gets passed to
 perhaps on someone 's desktop  
 but i don 't think that that 's immediate i don 't think that will happen soon what 's more likely and we 're seeing it today is that that data gets sent
 to a local manufacturing center  this means lower carbon footprint  we 're now instead of shipping a
  data across the internet here 's the product being built  
 you can see  this came out of the machine in one piece and the electronics were inserted later it 's this lamp as you can see here
 so as long as you have the data you can create the part on demand  
 and you don 't necessarily need to use this for just aesthetic customization  you can use it for functional customization scanning parts of the body and creating
  things that are made to fit so we can run this through to something like prosthetics which is highly specialized to an individual 's handicap  
 or we can create very specific
 prosthetics for that individual
 scanning teeth today  you can have your teeth scanned and dental coatings made in this way to fit you 
 while you wait at the dentist a machine will quietly be creating this for you ready to insert in the teeth  
 and the idea of now creating implants
 scanning data an mri scan of somebody can now be converted into 3d data and we can create very specific implants
 for them  
 and applying this to the idea of building up what 's in our bodies you
 know this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree it 's very intricate you couldn 't really create this or simulate it in any
  but with mri data we can just build the product as you can see very intricately 
 using this process pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today so one of the pioneers for example is dr anthony atala  
 and he has been working on layering cells to create body parts
 bladders  valves kidneys now this is not
 something that 's ready for the public but it is in working progress  
 so just to finalize we 're all individual we all have different preferences different needs  
 we like different things we 're all different sizes and our companies the same businesses want different things  
 without a doubt in my mind i believe that this technology is going to cause a manufacturing revolution and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it thank you
