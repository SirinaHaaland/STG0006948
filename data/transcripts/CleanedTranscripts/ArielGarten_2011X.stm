  has been around since the ancient greeks some attribute this golden world knowledge to plato  others to pythagoras but
 the truth is it doesn 't really matter which sage said it first because it 's still
  it 's pithy
 almost to the point of being meaningless  but it rings familiar and true doesn 't it know thyself 
 i understand this timeless dictum as a statement about the problems or more exactly the confusions of consciousness  
 i 've always been fascinated with knowing the self  this
  led me to submerge myself in art study neuroscience and later to become a psychotherapist  
 today i combine all my passions as the ceo of interaxon a thought controlled computing company 
 my goal quite simply is to help people become more in tune with themselves i take it from this little dictum know thyself 
 if you think about it  this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species
 homo sapiens from earlier instances of our mankind today
 we 're often too busy tending to our iphones and ipods to really stop and get to know ourselves  under the deluge of  minute to minute text conversations e mails relentless exchange 
  of media channels and channels and passwords and apps and reminders and tweets and tags we lose sight of what all this fuss is supposed to be about in the first place ourselves
 much of the time we 're transfixed by all of the ways we can reflect ourselves out into the world and we can barely find the time
 to reflect deeply back in on our own selves  
 we 've cluttered ourselves up with all this and we feel like we have to get far far away to a secluded retreat leaving it all behind  
  go far away to the top of a mountain assuming that perching ourselves on a piece is bound to give us the respite we need to sort the clutter the chaotic everyday 
 and find ourselves again 
 but on that mountain
 where we gain that beautiful peace of mind  what are we really achieving  it 's really only a successful escape  
 think of the term we use retreat
  this is the term that armies use when they 've lost a battle it means we 've got to get out of here is this how we feel about the pressures of our world that in order to get inside ourselves you have to run for the hills 
 and the problem with escaping your day to day life is that you have to come home eventually  
 so when you think about it we 're almost like a tourist visiting ourselves over there and eventually that vacation 's got to come to an end  
 so my question to you is
 can we find ways to know ourselves without the escape 
 can we redefine our relationship with the technologized world in order to have the heightened sense of self awareness that we seek 
 can we live here and now in our wired web and still follow those ancient instructions know thyself
  i say the answer is yes and i 'm here today to share a new way that we 're working with technology to this end to get familiar with our inner self like never before
 humanizing technology
 and furthering that age old quest of ours to more fully know the self  it 's called
 you may or may not have noticed that i 'm wearing a tiny electrode on my forehead this is actually a brainwave
  sensor that 's reading the electrical activity of my brain as i give this talk these brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph  
 let me show you what it looks like 
 that blue line there is my brainwave it 's the direct signal being recorded from my head rendered in real time  
 the green and red bars show that same signal displayed by frequency with lower frequencies here and higher frequencies up here
 you 're actually looking inside my head as i speak 
 these graphs are compelling they 're undulating  but from a human 's perspective  they 're actually not very useful 
 that 's why we 've spent a lot of time thinking about how to make this data meaningful to the people who use it  for instance what if i could use
  find out how relaxed i am at any moment or what if i can take that information and put it into an
 organic shape up on the screen  the shape on the right over here has become
 an indicator of what 's going on in my head  the more relaxed i am  the more the energy 's going to fall through it  
 i may also be interested in knowing how focused i am  so i can put my level of attention into the circuit board on the other side and the more focused my
  the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy  ordinarily  i would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed i was in any tangible way 
 as we know our feelings about how we 're feeling are notoriously unreliable we 've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it until we lost it on someone who didn 't deserve it and then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves a little earlier 
 this new awareness opens up vast possibilities for applications that help improve our lives and ourselves
 're trying to create technology that uses the insights to make our work more efficient our breaks more relaxing and our connections deeper and more fulfilling than ever 
 i 'm going to share some of these visions with you in a bit  but first i want to take a look at how we got here 
 by the way  feel free to check in on my head at any time 
 my team at interaxon and i have been developing
 almost a decade now 
 in the first phase of development we were really enthused by all the things we could control with our mind  we were making things activate 
 light up and work just by thinking  
 we were transcending the space between the mind and the device  
 we brought to life a vast array of prototypes and products that you could control with
  home appliances or slot car games or video games or a levitating chair  
 we created technology and applications that engaged people 's imaginations and it was really exciting  and then we were asked to do something really big
 for the olympics  
 we were invited to create a massive installation at the vancouver two thousand and ten winter olympics were used in vancouver got to control the lighting on the cn tower
  the canadian parliament buildings and niagara falls from all the way across the country using their minds 
 over seventeen days at the olympics seven thousand visitors from all over the world actually got to individually control the light from the cn tower parliament and niagara in real time with their minds from across the country three thousand km away 
 so controlling stuff with your mind is pretty cool  but we 're always interested in multitiered levels of human interaction and so we began looking into inventing
  complex frame than just control and that was responsiveness  
 we realized that we had a system that allowed technology to know something about you and it could join into the relationship with you 
 we created the responsive room where the lights  music and blinds adjusted to your state  
 they followed these little shifts in your mental activity  so as you settled into relaxation at the end of a hard day on the couch
  in our office  the music would mellow with you 
 when you read  the desk lamp would get brighter if you nod off the system would know  dimming to darkness as you do 
 we then realized that if technology could know something about you and use it to help you there 's an even more valuable application than that 
 that you could know something about yourself  
 we could know sides of ourselves that were
 all but invisible
 and come to see things that were previously hidden  
 let me show you an example of what i 'm talking about here here 's an application that i created for the ipad  so the goal of the original game zen bound is to wrap a rope 
  around a wooden form so you use it with your headset  the headset connects wirelessly to an ipad or a smartphone in that headset you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear 
  zen bound game  you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad 
 in the game that we created of course  you control the wooden form that 's on the screen there with your mind 
 as you focus on the wooden form  it rotates  the more you focus  the faster the rotation this is for real 
 this is not a fake what 's really interesting to me though is at the end of the game you get stats
  and feedback about how you did  
 you have graphs and charts that tell you how your brain was doing not just how much rope you used or what your high score is but what
 was going on inside of your mind and this is valuable feedback that we can use to understand what 's going on inside of ourselves
  think about technology as interactive this technology is
 it
 understands
 what 's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information
  so you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop at interaxon
 intra active technology
 is one of our really defining mandates  
 it 's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop 
 for example
  can teach children with add how to improve their focus 
 with  add children have a low proportion of beta waves for focus states and a high proportion of theta states  
 so you can create applications that reward focused brain states  
 so you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their add symptoms as they do it  
 this can be as effective as ritalin  
 perhaps even more importantly
  computing can give children with add insights into their own fluctuating mental states  so they can better understand themselves and their learning needs  
 the way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will upend many of the damaging and widespread social stigmas that people who are diagnosed as different
 are challenged with we can peer inside our heads and interact with what was once locked away from us what once mystified and separated us 
 brainwave technology
 can understand us anticipate our emotions and find the best solutions for our needs  imagine
 this collected awareness of the individual computed and reflected across an entire lifespan imagine the insights that you can gain from this kind of second sight 
 it would be like plugging into your own personal google on the subject of google today you can search and tag
 images based on the thoughts and feelings you had while you watched them you can tag
  pictures of baby animals as happy or whatever baby animals are to you 
 and then you can search that database  navigating with your feelings  rather than the keywords that just hint at them 
 or you could tag facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories
 and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention just like
  humanizing technology is about taking what 's already natural about the human tech experience
 and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it as it aligns with our human behaviors  it can allow us to make better sense of what we do
 and more importantly  why  creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are 
 with humanized technology we can monitor the
  quality of your sleep cycles 
 when our productivity starts to slacken we can go back to that data and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play 
 do you know what causes fatigue in you or what brings out your energetic self what triggers cause you to be depressed or what fun things are going to bring you out of that funk
  imagine if you had access to data that allowed you to rank on a scale of overall happiness which people in your life made you the happiest 
 or what activities brought you joy would you make more time for those people would you prioritize would you get a divorce 
 what thought controlled computing can allow you to do is build colorful layered pictures of our lives and with this we can get the
 skinny on our psychological happenings and build a story of our behaviors over time we can begin to see the underlying narratives that propel us forward and tell us
 about what 's going on and from this  we can learn how to change the plot  the outcome and the character
 of our personal stories  
 two millennia ago  those greeks had some powerful insights they knew that a fundamental piece falls into place when you start to live out their little phrase
 when you come into contact with yourself  
 they understood the power of human narrative and the value that we place on humans as changing evolving and growing  
 but they understood something more fundamental
 the sheer joy in discovery  the delight and fascination that we get from the
  and being ourselves in it the richness that we get from seeing feeling and knowing the lives that we are 
 my mom 's an artist and as a child i 'd often see her bring things to life with the stroke of a brush one moment it was all white space pure possibility  the next it was alive with her colorful ideas and expressions 
 as i sat easel side watching her transform canvas after canvas
  i learned that you could create your own world  i learned that our own inner worlds our ideas emotions and imaginations
 were in fact not bound by our brains and bodies if you could think it  if you could discover it you could bring it to life 
 to me thought controlled computing is as simple and powerful as a paintbrush
 one more tool to unlock and enliven the hidden worlds within us  i look forward to the day
  day that i can sit beside you easel side watching the world that we can create with our new toolboxes
 and the discoveries that we can make about ourselves  thank you
