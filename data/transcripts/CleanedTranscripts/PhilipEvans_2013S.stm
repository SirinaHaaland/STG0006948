  talk a little bit about strategy and its relationship with technology 
 we tend to think of business strategy as being a rather abstract body of essentially economic
  perhaps rather timeless 
 i 'm going to argue that in fact business strategy has always been premised on assumptions about technology 
 that those assumptions are changing and in fact changing quite dramatically  
 and that therefore what that will drive us to is a different concept of what we mean by business strategy  
 let me start if i may with a little bit of
  the idea of strategy in business owes its origins to two intellectual giants bruce henderson the founder of bcg 
 and michael porter professor at the harvard business school 
 henderson 's central idea was what you might call the napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness of overwhelming the enemy 
 what henderson recognized was that in the business world there are many
  many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns scale experience  the more you do of something disproportionately the better you get 
 and therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass in order to achieve competitive advantage  and that was the first introduction 
 of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world
  agreed with that premise  but he qualified it he pointed out correctly that that 's all very well but businesses actually have multiple steps to them they have different components 
 and each of those components might be driven by a different kind of strategy a company or a business might actually be advantaged in some activities but disadvantaged in others 
 he formed the concept of the value chain essentially the sequence of steps with which a shall we say raw
  material becomes a component becomes assembled into a finished product and then is distributed for example 
 and he argued that advantage accrued to each of those components and that the advantage of the whole was in some sense the sum or the average
 of of that of its parts  and this idea of the value chain was predicated on the on the recognition
 that what holds a business together is transaction costs
  essence you need to coordinate organizations are more efficient at coordination than markets very often 
 and therefore the nature and role and boundaries of the cooperation are defined by transaction costs  
 it was on those two ideas henderson 's idea of
 increasing returns to scale and experience
  and porter 's idea of the value chain encompassing heterogenous elements that the whole edifice of business strategy
 was subsequently erected now
 what i 'm going to argue is that those premises are in fact  being invalidated 
 first of all let 's think about transaction costs  there are really two components to transaction costs one is about processing
  the other is about communication  these are the economics of processing and communicating as they have evolved over a long period of time 
 as we all know from so many contexts they have been radically transformed since the days when porter and henderson first formulated their theories 
 in particular since the mid ' 90s communications costs have actually been falling even faster than transaction costs  which is why communication the internet has exploded in such a dramatic fashion
  now those falling transaction costs have profound consequences because if transaction costs are the glue that hold value chains together and they are falling there is less to economize on 
  there is less need for vertically integrated organization  and value chains at least can break up they needn 't necessarily but they can 
  possible for a competitor in one business to use their position in one step of the value chain in order to penetrate or attack or 
  disintermediate the competitor in another 
 that is not just an abstract proposition there are many very specific stories of how that actually happened 
 a poster child example was the encyclopedia business 
 the encyclopedia business in the days of  leatherbound books was basically a distribution business most of the cost was the commission to the salesmen 
  internet came along new technologies
 made the distribution of knowledge many orders of magnitude cheaper and the encyclopedia industry collapsed it 's now of course a very familiar story 
 this in fact more generally was the story of the first generation of the internet economy  it was about falling transaction costs breaking up value chains and therefore allowing disintermediation or what we call deconstruction
 of the questions i was occasionally asked was well  what 's going to replace the encyclopedia when britannica no longer has a business model  
 and it was a while before the answer became manifest now of course we know what it is it 's the wikipedia  
 now what 's special about the wikipedia is not its distribution what 's special about the wikipedia is the way it 's produced the wikipedia of course is
  and this in fact defines what you might call the second decade of the internet economy  the decade in which the internet as a noun became the internet as a verb it became a set of conversations  
 the era in which user generated content and social networks became the dominant phenomenon  
 now what that really meant in terms of the
  the collapse of certain kinds of economies of scale  it turned out that tens of thousands of autonomous individuals writing an encyclopedia could do just as good a job and certainly a much cheaper job than professionals in a hierarchical organization 
 so basically what was happening was that one layer of this value chain was becoming fragmented as individuals could take over where organizations
  but there 's another question that obviously this graph poses which is okay we 've gone through two decades does anything distinguish the third  
 and what i 'm going to argue is that indeed something does distinguish the third and it maps exactly on to the kind of porter henderson logic that we 've been talking about and that is about data  
 if we go back to around two thousand a lot of people were talking about the information revolution
  was indeed true that the world 's stock of data was growing indeed growing quite fast 
 but it was still at that point overwhelmingly analog we go forward to two thousand and seven not only had the world 's stock of data exploded 
 but there 'd been this massive substitution of digital for analog  
 and more important even than that if you look more carefully at this graph what you will observe is that about a half of that digital data is
  on a server or it 's on a p c 
 but having an  i p address means that it can be connected to any other data that has an i p address  it means it becomes possible to put together half of the world 's knowledge in order to see patterns an entirely new thing  
 if we run the numbers forward to today  it probably looks something like this we 're not really sure  if we run the numbers forward to two thousand and twenty
  we of course have an exact number  courtesy of idc it 's curious that the future is so much more predictable than the present  and
 what it implies is a hundredfold multiplication
 in the stock of information that is connected via an i p address  
 now if the number of connections that we can make is proportional to the number of pairs of data points a hundredfold
  multiplication in the quantity of data is a 
  multiplication in the number of patterns that we can see in that data this just in the last ten or eleven years this i would submit is a sea change a profound change in the economics of the world that we live in 
 the first human genome that of james watson was mapped as the culmination of the human genome project in the year two thousand 
 and it took about two hundred million dollars and about ten years of work to map just one person 's genomic makeup
  since then the costs of mapping the genome have come down in fact they 've come down in recent years very dramatically indeed to the point where the cost is now below one thousand dollars and it 's confidently predicted 
 that by the year two thousand and fifteen it will be below one hundred dollars a five or six order of magnitude drop in the cost of genomic mapping in just a 15 year period an extraordinary phenomenon
  in the days when mapping a genome cost millions or even tens of thousands 
 it was basically a research enterprise  scientists would gather some representative people and they would see patterns and they would try and make generalizations about human nature and disease from the abstract patterns they find from these particular selected individuals  
 but when the genome can be mapped for one hundred bucks ninety nine dollars while you wait then
  what happens is it becomes retail  it becomes above all clinical you go the doctor with a cold and if he or she hasn 't done it already the first thing they do is map your genome 
 at which point what they 're now doing is not starting from some abstract knowledge of genomic medicine and trying to work out how it applies to you but they 're starting from your particular genome 
 now think of the power of that think of where that takes us when we can combine
  genomic data with clinical data with data about drug interactions with the kind of ambient data that devices like our phone and medical sensors will increasingly be collecting  
 think what happens when we collect all of that data and we can put it together in order to find patterns we wouldn 't see before this i would suggest  
 perhaps it will take a while but this will drive a revolution in medicine  fabulous lots of people talk about this  
  thing that doesn 't get much attention how is that model of colossal sharing across all of those kinds of databases
 compatible with the business models of institutions and organizations and corporations that are involved in this business today  
 if your business is based on proprietary data  if your competitive advantage is defined by your data how on earth is that company or is that society in
  fact going to achieve the value that 's implicit in the technology  they can 't 
 so essentially what 's happening here and genomics is merely one example of this is that technology is driving the natural scaling of the activity
 beyond the institutional boundaries within which we have been used to thinking about it and in particular beyond the institutional boundaries in terms of which business strategy as a
  discipline is formulated the basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated oligopolistic competition
 among essentially similar kinds of competitors
 is evolving by one means or another from a vertical structure to a horizontal one 
 why is that happening it 's happening because transaction costs are plummeting and because scale is polarizing  the plummeting of
  transaction costs weakens the glue that holds value chains together  and allows them to separate  
 the polarization of scale economies towards the very small small is beautiful
 allows for scalable communities to substitute for conventional corporate production  
 the scaling in the opposite direction towards things like big data drive the structure of business towards the creation of new kinds of institutions that can achieve
  that scale  but either way the typically vertical structure gets driven to becoming more horizontal 
 the logic isn 't just about big data  if we were to look for example at the telecommunications industry you can tell the same story about fiber optics  if we look at the pharmaceutical industry or for that matter university research you can say exactly
  and in the opposite direction if we look say at the energy sector where all the talk is about how households will be efficient producers of green energy and
 efficient conservers of energy that is in fact the reverse phenomenon that is the fragmentation of scale because the very small can substitute for the traditional corporate scale
  either way what we are driven to is this 
  of the structure of industries
 implies fundamental changes in how we think about strategy 
 it means for example that we need to think about strategy as the curation of these kinds of horizontal structure where things like business definition and even industry 
  definition are actually the outcomes of strategy not something that the strategy presupposes  
  collaboration and competition simultaneously think about the genome we need to accommodate the very large and the very small simultaneously  
 and we need industry structures that will accommodate very very different motivations from the amateur motivations of people in communities to maybe the social motivations of infrastructure built by governments or for that
  cooperative institutions built by companies that are otherwise competing because that is the only way that they can get to scale  
 these kinds of transformations render the traditional premises of business strategy obsolete they drive us into a completely new world they require us whether 
  we are in the public sector or the private sector to think very fundamentally differently about the structure of business
