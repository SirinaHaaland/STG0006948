  this is a vending machine in los angeles it 's in a shopping mall and it sells fish eggs it 's a caviar vending machine  
  machine that sells small artistic creations by different artists usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes in limited edition
  this is oliver medvedik he is not a vending machine  but he is one of the founders of genspace 
 a community biolab in brooklyn new york where anybody can go and take classes and learn how to do things like grow  e coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry dna 
 in fact i saw oliver do one of these strawberry dna extractions about a year ago and this is what led me into this bizarre path that i 'm going to talk to
  strawberry dna is really fascinating because it 's so beautiful i 'd never thought about dna being a beautiful thing before before i saw it in this form
 a lot of people especially in the art community don 't necessarily engage in science in this way  
 i instantly joined genspace after this and asked oliver if we can do this with strawberries can we do this with people about ten minutes later we were both spitting in vials coming up with a protocol for human dna extraction  i started doing this on
  this is what my my dna actually looks like  and i was at a dinner party with some artist friends and i was telling them about this project and they couldn 't believe that you could actually see dna 
 so i said all right let 's get out some supplies right now and i started having these bizarre dinner parties on friday nights  
 where people would come over and we 'd do dna extractions  and i would capture them on video because it created this kind of funny portrait as well 
 these are people who don 't necessarily regularly engage with science
  tell from their reactions but they became fascinated by it and it was really exciting for me to see them get excited about science and so
 i started doing this regularly laughter
 it 's an odd thing to do with your friday nights but this is what i started doing i started collecting a whole group of of my friends ' dna in small vials and categorizing them this is what that looked like and it started to make me think about a couple of things first this looked a
  lot like my facebook wall so in a way i created sort of a genetic social network and the second thing was one time a friend came over and looked at this on my table and was like 
 uh why are they numbered is this person more rare than the other one 
 and i hadn 't even thought about that they were just numbered because that was the order that i extracted the dna in but that made me think about
  's going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys  and being able to collect these rare toys you buy these boxes but aren 't sure what 's going to be inside  
 but when you open them you have different rarities of the toys 
 i thought that was interesting i thought about this and the caviar vending machine and the art o mat all together and for some reason i was one night drawing a vending machine  thinking of doing paintings of a vending machine the vial 
  of my dna was sitting there and i saw a beautiful collaboration between the strands of dna and the coils of a vending machine so i decided to create
  an art installation called the dna vending machine here it
  vending machine is currently in a couple of galleries in new york  and it 's selling out pretty well
  the first edition of one hundred pieces  hoping to do another edition pretty soon i 'd like to get it into more of a metro hub like grand central or penn station next to some of the other vending machines in 
  that location  but really with this and a lot of my art projects i want to ask the audience a question when biotechnology and dna sequencing becomes as cheap as  say laser cutting or  3d printing or buying caviar from a vending machine will you submit
  your sample of dna to be part of the vending machine how much will these samples be worth will you buy someone else 's sample  and what will you be able to do with that sample
