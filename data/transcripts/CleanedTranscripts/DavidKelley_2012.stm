  i wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence i 'm going to start way back in the third grade
 at oakdale school in barberton ohio  i remember one day
 day my best friend brian was working on a project  he was making a horse out of the clay our teacher kept under the sink  
 and at one point one of the girls that was sitting at his table  seeing what he was doing leaned over and said to him 
 that 's terrible that doesn 't look anything like a horse 
 and brian 's shoulders sank  and he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the
  never saw brian do a project like that
 ever again  and i wonder how often that happens you know it seems like when i tell that story of brian to my class
 a lot of them want to come up after class and tell me about their similar experience how a teacher shut them down or how a student was particularly cruel to them 
 and then some kind of opt out of thinking of themselves as creative at that point
  and i see that
 opting out that happens in childhood  and it moves in and becomes more ingrained even by the time you get to adult life 
 so
 we see a lot of this
 when we have a workshop or when we have clients in to work with us side by side 
 eventually we get to the point in the process that 's kind of fuzzy or unconventional  
 and eventually
  executives whip out their blackberrys
 and they say they have to make really important phone calls and they head for the exits  
 and they 're just so uncomfortable when we track them down and ask them what 's going on they say something like i 'm just not the creative type 
 but we know that 's not true if they stick with the process
  if they stick with it they end up doing amazing things  and they surprise themselves at just how innovative they and their teams really are  
 so i 've been looking at this fear of judgment that that we have that you don 't do things  you 're afraid you 're going to be judged  if you don 't say the the right creative thing you 're going to be judged  
 and i had a major breakthrough when
  know if you know albert bandura  but if you go to wikipedia it says that he 's the fourth most important psychologist in history
 you know like freud skinner  somebody and bandura 
  and he still works at stanford and he 's just a lovely guy 
 so i went to see him because he 's just worked on phobias for a long time which i 'm very interested in he had
  developed this
 this way this kind of 
 methodology that ended up curing people in a very short amount of time like in four hours he had a huge cure rate of people who had phobias and 
 we talked about snakes we talked about snakes and fear of snakes
  as a phobia  and it was really enjoyable really interesting he told me
 that he 'd invite
 the test subject in and he 'd say you know there 's a snake in the next room and we 're going to go in there 
 to which he reported most of them replied hell no i 'm not going in there certainly if there 's a snake in there but bandura has a
  process that was super successful  so he 'd take people to this two way mirror looking into the room where the snake was 
 and he 'd get them comfortable with that then through a series of steps  he 'd move
 move them and they 'd be standing in the doorway with the door open  and they 'd be looking in there and he 'd get them comfortable with that 
 and then many more steps later baby steps they 'd be in the room they 'd have a leather glove like a welder 's
  they 'd eventually touch the snake  
 and when they touched the snake
  everything was fine  they were cured in fact everything was better than fine  these people who had lifelong fears of snakes
 were saying things like look how beautiful that snake is  and they were holding it in their laps  bandura calls this
  i love that term  guided mastery  and something else happened  
 these people who went through the process and touched the snake ended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives
  they tried harder  they persevered longer and they were more resilient in the face of failure
  they just gained a new confidence
  the sense that you can change the world
 and that you can attain what you set out to do  
 well meeting bandura was really cathartic for me  because i realized that this famous scientist had documented and scientifically validated
 something that we 've seen happen for the last thirty years that we could take people who had the fear that they weren 't creative
 and we could take them through a series of steps  
 kind of like a series of small successes  and they turn fear into familiarity  
 and they surprise themselves that transformation is amazing we see it at the d school all the time people from all different kinds of disciplines 
 they think of themselves as only analytical  and they come in and they go through the process our process
  they build confidence and now they think of themselves differently and they 're totally emotionally
 excited about the fact that they walk around thinking of themselves as a creative person
 so i thought one of the things i 'd do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like 
 to me that journey looks like
 doug dietz
  doug dietz is a technical person he designs 
  large medical imaging equipment 
 he 's worked for ge and he 's had a fantastic career  but at one point he had a moment of crisis  
 he was in the hospital looking at one of his mri machines in use  when he saw a young family 
  and that little girl was crying and was terrified and doug was really disappointed to learn
 that nearly eighty percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital had to be sedated in order to deal with his mri machine
  and this was really disappointing to doug because before this time he was proud of what he did
 he was saving lives with this machine  but it really hurt him to see the fear that this machine caused in kids about that
  time  he was at the d school at stanford taking classes  he was learning about our process about design thinking about empathy 
 about iterative prototyping  and he would take this new knowledge and do something quite extraordinary  he would redesign
 the entire experience of being scanned  and this is what he came up with he turned it into an adventure for the
  kids  he painted the walls and he painted the machine and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids like children 's museum people 
 and now when the kid comes  
 it 's an experience and they talk to them about the noise and the movement of the ship  and when they come they say ok  you 're going to go into the pirate ship  but be very still
 because we don 't want the pirates to find you 
 and the results were super dramatic
  from something like eighty percent of the kids needing to be sedated to something like ten percent of the kids needing needing to be sedated and the hospital and ge were happy 
 too because you didn 't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time and they could put more kids through the machine in a day 
  one of the mothers waiting for her child to come out of the scan  and when the little girl came out of her scan she ran up to her mother and said 
 mommy can we come back tomorrow 
 laughter and so i 've heard doug tell the story many times
 of his personal transformation and the breakthrough design that happened from it but i 've never really seen him tell the story of the little girl without a
  tear in his eye doug 's story takes place in a hospital i know a thing or two about hospitals 
 a few years ago  i felt a lump on the side of my neck
  it was my turn in the mri machine 
 it was cancer  it was the bad kind i was told i had a forty percent chance of survival  so while you 're sitting around
  the other patients in your pajamas and everybody 's pale and
 thin you
 know and you 're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays  you think of a lot of things mostly you think about am i going to survive  
 and i thought a lot about what was my daughter 's life going to be like without me  
 but you think about other things i thought a lot about what was i put on earth to do
  what was my calling what should i do  i was lucky because i had lots of options we 'd been working in health and wellness 
 and the developing world so there were lots of projects that i could work on but then i decided and committed at this point to the thing i most wanted to do which
 was to help as many people as possible
 regain the creative confidence they lost along their way
 and if i was going to survive that 's what i wanted to do  i survived just so you know 
 i really believe that when people gain this confidence and we see it all the time at the
 d school and at ideo that they actually start working on the things that are really important
  in their lives we see people quit what they 're doing and go in new directions we see them
 come up with more interesting and just more ideas so they can choose from from better ideas  and they just make better decisions 
 i know at ted you 're supposed to have a
  happen  so i hope you 'll join me on my quest 
 you as kind of thought leaders it would be really great if you didn 't let people divide the world into the creatives and the non creatives like it 's some god given thing 
 and to have people realize that they 're naturally creative and that those natural people should let their
  you can do what you set out to do and that you can reach a place of creative confidence and touch the snake  thank you
