  the brilliant playwright  adrienne kennedy  wrote a volume called people who led to my plays 
 and if i were to write a volume it would be called artists who have led my
  because my work  in understanding art and in understanding culture has come by following artists 
 by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are
 j j from good times 
 significant to many people of course because of dy no mite but perhaps more significant as
 the first really black artist on primetime
  primetime tv
 jean michel basquiat 
 important to me because [ he was ] the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what i was about to enter into 
 my overall project is about art specifically about black artists very generally about the way in which art can change the way we
  think about culture and ourselves 
 my interest is in artists who understand and rewrite history who think about themselves within the narrative of the larger 
  world of art but who have created new places for us to see and understand i 'm showing two
  glenn ligon and kara walker two of many who really form for me the essential questions that i wanted to bring as a curator to the world 
 i was interested in the idea of why and how i could create a new story a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world 
 and to do this 
 i knew that i had to see the way in which artists work understand the artist 's studio as a
  laboratory imagine then reinventing the museum as a think tank
 and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper asking questions providing the space to look and to think about answers 
  when i was a curator at the whitney
  i made an exhibition called black male  it looked at the intersection of race and gender
 in contemporary american art  
 it sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for dialogue complicated dialogue dialogue with many many points of entry 
 and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas 
  races  but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view 
 what was significant
 about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator as a catalyst for this
  one of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is i was confronted with the idea of how powerful images can be in people 's understanding of themselves 
  and each other  i 'm showing you two works one on the right by leon golub one on the left
  in my sense of what art could be
 a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other  and she 
  pointed to the work on the left to tell me how problematic this image was as it related for her to the idea of how black people had been represented and 
  she pointed to the image on the right as an example to me of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work
  against those images in the media she then assigned these works racial identities basically saying to me that the work on the right
  clearly was made by a black artist the work on the left clearly by a white artist  when in effect that was the opposite case  bob colescott 
  leon golub  a white artist the point of that for me was to say in that space in that moment that i really
  really more than anything  wanted to understand how images could work how images did work and how artists provided a space bigger than 
  one that we could imagine in our day to day lives to work through these images
  experience  really the place where the harlem renaissance existed 
 harlem now  sort of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century looking both backwards and forwards i always say harlem is an interesting community because unlike many other places it thinks of itself in the past present and the future
  no one speaks of it just in the now  it 's always what it was and what it can be 
 and in thinking about that then my second project the second question i ask is can a museum be a catalyst in a community 
 can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves 
 this is harlem actually on january 20th thinking about itself in a very wonderful way 
 so i work now at the studio museum
  harlem thinking about exhibitions there thinking about what it means to discover art 's possibility now  what does this mean to some of you in some cases i know that many of you are involved in 
  you 're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation 
 think about the place that artists can play in that that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that i work towards  in working with young black
 think about artists not as content providers though they can be brilliant at that but again as real catalysts 
 the studio museum was founded in the late 60s and i bring this up because it 's important to locate
 this practice in history  to look at one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight in the incredible historic moment that it is and think of the arc that has happened since then to think of the possibilities that
  we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this museum that came out of a moment of great protest
 and one that was so much about examining the history and the legacy of important african american artists to the history of art in this country like jacob lawrence norman lewis romare bearden 
  muhammad ali gave a lecture at harvard university after his lecture a student got up and said to him give us a poem and mohammed ali said me we 
 a profound statement about the individual and the community the space in which now  in my project of discovery of thinking about artists of trying to define what might be
 black art cultural movement of the
  century what that might mean for cultural movements all over
 this moment the me we seems incredibly prescient totally important 
 to this end the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions all titled with an f
  which have set out to discover and define
 the young black artists working in this moment who i feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years this series of exhibitions
  was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now at this point in history to see art as a catalyst what it means now at this point in history as we define
 and redefine culture black culture specifically in my case but culture generally i named this group of artists
 around an idea which i put out there called post black 
 really meant to define them as artists who came and start their work now  looking back at history but start in
  it is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i 'm asking this new set of questions is what does it mean right now to be
 in america  what can artwork say about this  where can a museum exist
 as the place for us all to have this
  most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring 
 their works for me are about not always just simply about the aesthetic innovation that their minds imagine that their
 visions create and put out there in the world  but more perhaps importantly  through the excitement of the community that they create as
  important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation as well as in the future  
 i am continually amazed by the way in which
 the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don 't imagine it should be 
 i am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work
  it is why i look to art it 's why i ask questions of art  it is why i make exhibitions 
 now this exhibition as i said  forty young artists done over the course of eight years and for me it 's about considering the implications it 's considering the implications 
 of what this generation has to say to the rest of us it 's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the
  as their work travels but in their communities
 as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues
 that face us it
 's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it and imagining particularly in urban america about the nurturing of the spirit now where 
 perhaps  does this end up right now  for me it is about re imagining this cultural discourse in an international context so the last iteration of this project
 has been called flow with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world really looking not so much from 
  harlem and out but looking across and flow looked at artists all born on the continent of africa and as many of us think about that continent and think about
  have begun that looking through artists through artworks  and imagining what they can tell us about the future what they tell us about our future and what they create 
 in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue 
 i feel like the privilege i 've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works the discovery of exciting works but really  it has been what i 've discovered 
 about myself and what i can offer in the space of an exhibition to talk about beauty  to talk about power  to talk
  and to talk and speak to each other 
 that 's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world
