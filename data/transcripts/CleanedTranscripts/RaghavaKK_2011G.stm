  i 'm an artist and a dad second time around  
 thank you  and i want to share with you my latest art project it 's a children 's book for the ipad  it 's a little quirky and silly it 's called
 little kids do with their parents 
  so this is about potty training as most of you i hope know   you can tickle the rug  you can make the baby poop you can do
  but you know i have a problem with children 's books i think they 're full of propaganda 
 at least an indian trying to get one of these american books in park slope forget it it 's not the way i was brought up so i said i 'm going to counter this with my own propaganda if
 you notice carefully it 's a homosexual couple bringing up a child you
 don 't like it  shake it  and you have a lesbian couple
 and you have a heterosexual couple you know i don 't even believe in the concept of an ideal family  
 i have to tell you about my childhood  i went to this very proper christian school taught by nuns fathers brothers  sisters 
 basically i was brought up to be a good samaritan  and i am
 and i 'd go at the end of the day to a traditional hindu house which was probably the only hindu house in a predominantly
  islamic neighborhood
  basically  i celebrated every religious function in fact when there was a wedding in our neighborhood all of us would paint our houses for the wedding 
 i remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani laughter
 we all had to fast during
  it was a very beautiful time but i must say i
 'll never forget when i was thirteen years old 
 this happened babri masjid  one of the most beautiful mosques in india built by king babur  i think  in the 16th century
 was demolished by hindu activists this caused major riots in my city and for the first time  
 i was affected by this communal unrest 
 my little
  my work is inspired by events such as this even in my gallery shows i try and revisit historic events like babri
  only its emotional residue and image my own life imagine history being taught differently remember that children 's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change  
 i have another idea it 's a children 's book
 about indian independence very patriotic  but when you shake it  you get pakistan 's perspective  shake it again  
 and you get the british perspective 
 you have to separate fact from bias right
  even my books on children have cute fuzzy animals  but they 're playing geopolitics they 're playing out
 making a very important argument  and my argument [ is ] that the only way
 for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage 
 after all children 's books are manuals on parenting so you better give them children 's books
  that teach them perspectives and conversely only when you teach perspectives
 will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different
 from them  i 'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy  you know  
 i can 't promise my child a life without bias
 we 're all biased but i promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives thank you very much
