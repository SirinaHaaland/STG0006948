  i was three months pregnant with twins when my husband ross and i went to my second sonogram 
 i was thirty five years old at the time  and i knew that that meant we had a higher risk of having a child with a birth defect
  ross and i researched the standard birth defects and we felt reasonably prepared  
 well nothing would have prepared us for the bizarre diagnosis that we were about to face 
 the doctor explained that one of our twins thomas had a fatal birth defect called anencephaly 
 this means that his brain was not formed correctly
 because part of his skull was missing
 babies with this diagnosis typically die in utero or within a few minutes hours or days of being born  
 but the other twin callum  appeared to be healthy as far as the doctor could tell 
 and
 these twins were
  after a lot of questions about how this could have possibly happened  a selective reduction was mentioned  
 and while this procedure was not impossible it posed some unique risks for the healthy twin and for me  
 so we decided to carry the pregnancy to term  
 so there i was
  three months pregnant with two trimesters ahead of me and i had to find a way to
 manage my blood pressure and my stress  and it felt like having a roommate
 point a loaded gun at you for six months  but i stared down the barrel of that gun
 for so long that i saw a light at the end of the tunnel while there was nothing we could do to prevent
  i wanted to find a way for thomas 's brief life to have some kind of positive impact  so i asked my nurse about organ eye and tissue donation  
 she connected with our local organ procurement organization the washington regional transplant community
 explained to me that thomas would probably be too small at birth to donate for transplant
  and i was shocked  i didn 't even know you could be rejected for that 
 but they said that he would be a good candidate to donate for research 
 this helped me see thomas in a new light  as opposed to just a victim of a disease  
 i started to see him as a possible key to unlock a medical mystery 
 on march twenty three two thousand and ten the twins were born and they were both born alive  
 and just like the doctor said thomas was missing the top part of his skull
 but he could nurse  drink from a bottle cuddle and grab our fingers like a normal baby  and he slept in our arms 
 after six days thomas died in ross 's arms surrounded by our family  
 we called 
 who sent a van to our home and brought him to children 's national medical center
  hours later we got a call to say that the recovery was a success and thomas 's donations would be going to four different places his cord blood would go to duke university 
 his liver would go to a cell therapy company called cytonet in durham 
 his corneas would go to schepens eye research institute  which is part of harvard medical school and his retinas would go to the university of pennsylvania
  a few days later we had a funeral
 with our immediate family including baby callum 
 and we basically closed this chapter in our lives  but i did find myself wondering what 's happening now what are the researchers learning 
 and was it even worthwhile to donate
  invited ross and i to a grief retreat  and we met about fifteen other grieving families who had donated their loved one 's organs for transplant 
 some of them had even received letters from the people who received their loved one 's organs saying thank you  
 i learned that they could even meet each other if they 'd both sign a waiver  almost like an open adoption  and i was so excited i thought maybe i could write a
  i could get a letter and learn about what happened  but i was disappointed to learn that this process only exists for people who donate for transplant  so i was jealous i had
 transplant envy i guess 
 but over the years that followed  i learned a lot more about donation  and i even got a job in the field  
 and i came up with an idea  
 i wrote a letter that started out dear
  i explained who i was  and i asked if they could tell me why they requested infant retinas in march of two thousand and ten  
 and i asked if my family could visit their lab  
 i emailed it to the eye bank that arranged the donation the old dominion eye foundation and asked if they could send it to the right person 
 they said that they had never done this before  and they
  't guarantee a response but they wouldn 't be an obstacle and they would deliver it 
 two days later  i got a response from dr arupa ganguly of the university of pennsylvania  
 she thanked me for the donation and she explained that she is studying retinoblastoma  which is a deadly cancer of the retina that affects children under the age of five  
 and she said that yes we were invited to visit her lab  
 so next we talked on the phone and one of the first things she said to me was that she couldn 't possibly imagine how we felt
 and that thomas had given the ultimate sacrifice  and that she seemed to feel indebted to us
 so i said nothing against your study  but we didn 't actually pick it we donated to the system and the system chose your study  
 i said and second of all bad things happen to children every day  
 and if you didn 't want these retinas they would probably be buried in the ground right now  so to be able
  to participate in your study
 gives thomas 's life a new
 layer of meaning so never feel guilty about using this tissue 
 next she explained to me how rare it was 
 she had placed a request for this tissue six years earlier with the national disease research interchange 
 she got only one sample of tissue that fit her criteria  and it was thomas 's
  next we arranged a date for me to come visit the lab  and we chose march twenty three two thousand and fifteen which was the twins ' fifth birthday  
 after we hung up i emailed her some pictures of thomas and callum and a few weeks later we received this t shirt in the mail 
 a few months later ross callum and i piled in the car and we went for a road trip
 and arupa said that when i told her not to feel guilty that it was a relief  and that she hadn 't seen it from our perspective she also explained
 that thomas had a secret code name the same way henrietta lacks is called hela thomas was called
  about ten years she also shared with us a unique document  and it was
 the shipping label that sent his retinas from dc to philadelphia 
 this shipping label is like an heirloom to us now it 's the same way that a military medal or a wedding certificate
  also explained that she is using thomas 's retina and his rna
 to try to inactivate the gene that causes tumor formation and she even showed us some results that were based on res three hundred and sixty  
 then she took us to the freezer and she showed us the two samples that she still has
 that are still labeled res three hundred and sixty there 's two little ones left she said she saved it because she doesn 't know when she might get more after
  this we went to the conference room and we relaxed and we had lunch together  and
 the lab staff presented callum with a birthday gift it was a child 's lab kit  
 and they also offered him an internship 
 laughter so in closing i have two simple messages today one is that most of us probably don 't think about donating to research i know i
 i think i 'm a normal person
  but i did it it was a good experience and i recommend it and it brought my family a lot of peace  
 and second is if you work with human tissue and you wonder about the donor and about the family write them a letter tell them you received it tell them what you 're working on and invite 
  them to visit your lab because that visit may be even more gratifying for you than it is for them 
  successful in arranging one of these visits please tell me about it 
 the other part of my family 's story is that we ended up visiting all four facilities that received thomas 's donations and we met amazing people doing inspiring work 
 the way i see it now is that
 thomas got into harvard 
  and he has a job at cytonet and he has colleagues and he has coworkers who are in the top of their fields  and they need him in order to do their job 
 and a life that once seemed brief and insignificant
 revealed itself
 to be vital everlasting and relevant  and i only hope that my life can be as relevant
 thank you
