  democracy is in trouble no question about that and it comes in part from a deep dilemma in which it is embedded 
 it 's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions we face that have to do with
 global pandemics
 a cross border problem with hiv a transnational problem with markets and immigration something that goes beyond national borders with terrorism with war all now 
 problems in fact we live in a
  look for solutions in politics and in democracy  
 we are faced with political institutions designed four hundred years ago  autonomous  sovereign
 with jurisdictions and territories separate from one another each claiming to be able to solve the problem of its own people
 transnational world of problems and challenges
  world of political institutions in that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy  
 and like many others i 've been thinking about what can one do about this this asymmetry
  and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional political institutions like 
 and my suggestion is that we change the subject that we stop talking
 about nations about bordered states and we start talking about cities  
 because i think you will find when we talk about cities we are talking about
 the political institutions in which civilization and culture were born  we are talking about the cradle of democracy  we are talking about the venues 
 in which those public spaces where we come together to create democracy  and at the same time
  great names  the place de la bastille  
 zuccotti park tahrir square 
 taksim square in today 's headlines in istanbul or yes  
 tiananmen square
 in beijing 
 those are the public spaces where we announce ourselves as citizens
 as participants as people with the right
 to write our own
 narratives 
 cities are not only the oldest of institutions they 're the most enduring if you think about it  
 constantinople istanbul much older than turkey alexandria much
  older than italy cities endure the ages  
 they are the places where we are born  grow up are educated work marry
  pray  play get old and in time die they are home  
 very different than nation states which are abstractions we pay taxes
 we vote occasionally
  we watch the men and women we choose rule rule more or less without us  
 not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live moreover today more than half of the world 's population
  more than three out of four people live in urban
 institutions urban places in cities today so cities are where the action is cities are us  aristotle said in the ancient world man is a political animal  
 i say we are
  we are an urban species at home in our cities so to come back to the dilemma if the dilemma is we have  old fashioned political 
  to govern the world respond to the global challenges that we face like climate change  then maybe it 's time
 for mayors
  for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent to engage in global governance 
 when i say if mayors ruled the world when i first came up with that phrase it occurred to me that actually they already do 
 there are scores of international
  networks of cities in which cities are already quite quietly  
 below the horizon 
 working together to deal with climate change to deal with security to deal with immigration to deal with all of those tough 
 interdependent problems that we face 
 they have strange names
  and the list goes on citynet in asia city protocol a new organization out of barcelona that is using the web to share best practices
 among countries and then all the things we know a little better the u s conference of mayors the mexican conference of mayors the european
 conference
  mayors mayors
 are where this is happening  and so the question is 
 how can we create a world in which mayors and the citizens they represent play a more prominent role  well 
 to understand that we need to understand
 why cities are special why mayors are so different than prime
  ministers and presidents because
 my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister are at the opposite ends
 of a political spectrum to be a prime minister or a president you have to have an ideology you have to have a 
 you have to have a theory of how things work you have to belong to a
  on the whole don 't get elected to office but mayors are just the opposite mayors are pragmatists 
 their job is to get things done and if they don 't they 're out of a job mayor nutter
 of philadelphia said we could never get away here in philadelphia with the stuff that goes on in washington  the paralysis
  because potholes have to get filled  
 because the trains have to run because kids have to be able to get to school 
 and that 's what we have to do and to do that is about pragmatism in that deep american sense reaching outcomes
  real city mayors have to be pragmatists  they have to get things done they have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside and draw their cities together  
 we saw this a couple of decades ago when teddy kollek the great mayor of jerusalem in the ' 80s and the ' 90s 
 was besieged
 besieged one day in his office
 by
 religious leaders from all of the backgrounds  
 christian prelates rabbis imams they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites and the squabble went on and on and kollek listened and listened and he finally said gentlemen 
 spare me your sermons  and i will fix your sewers
  fix sewers  they get the trains running there isn 't a left or a right way of doing boris johnson in london calls himself an
 strange term but in some ways he is he 's a libertarian he
 's an anarchist he rides to work on a bike but at the same time he 's in some ways a conservative  bloomberg in new york
 was a democrat then he was a republican and finally he was an independent and said
  the party label just gets in the way luzhkov 
 twenty years mayor in moscow though he helped found a party united party with putin  in fact refused to be defined by the party and finally in fact lost his job not under brezhnev 
 not under gorbachev but under putin  
 who wanted a more faithful
  they get things done  but the second thing about mayors is they are also
 what i like to call homeboys 
 or to include the women mayors homies  
 they 're from the neighborhood  they 're part of the neighborhood they 're known ed koch used to wander around new york city saying how am i doing 
 imagine david cameron wandering around the united kingdom
 asking how am i
  doing he wouldn 't like the answer or putin  or any national leader  he could ask that because he knew new yorkers and they knew him 
 mayors are usually from the places they govern it 's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor you can run for the senate out of a different state but it 's hard to do that as a mayor 
  mayors and city councillors and local authorities have a much higher trust level and this is the third feature about mayors than national governing 
  officials in the united states we know the pathetic figures eighteen percent of americans approve
  court has fallen way down from what it used to be but when you ask do you trust your city councillor do you trust your mayor 
 the rates shoot up to seventy seventy five even eighty percent 
 because they 're from the neighborhood  because the people they work with are their neighbors because like mayor
  a mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work and go in and pull people out of a burning building
 that happened to mayor booker
 or intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work because he sees it no head of state would be permitted by their security details to do it nor be in a position to do it 
 that 's the difference and the difference has to do with the character of cities themselves because
  able to work with one another when states face each other china and the u s they face each other like this  
 when cities interact they interact
 like this  
  in california 
 are locked in all kinds of anger resentment  and rivalry for number one we heard more about who will be number one 
 cities don 't worry about number one they have to work together and they do work together they work together in climate change for example  
 organizations like the c40 like
  which i mentioned 
 have been working together many many years before copenhagen in copenhagen four or five years ago one hundred and eighty four nations came together to explain to one another 
  why their sovereignty didn 't permit them to deal with the grave grave crisis of climate change  
  and through inter city organizations eighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities which means cities are in a position to solve
 the carbon problem or most of it whether or not the states of which they are a part make agreements with one another and they are doing it los angeles cleaned up its port 
 which was forty percent of carbon emissions 
 and as a result got rid of about twenty percent
  of carbon new york has a program to upgrade its old buildings make them better insulated in the winter 
 to not leak energy in the summer not leak air conditioning 
 that 's having an impact bogota where mayor mockus when he was mayor he introduced a transportation system
 that saved energy that allowed surface buses to run in effect like subways express buses
  with corridors it helped unemployment because people could get across town 
 and it had a profound impact on climate as well as many other things there singapore 
 as it developed its high rises and its remarkable public housing also
 developed an island of parks and if you go there you 'll see how much of it is green land and park land cities are doing this but not just one by one they are doing it together they
  are sharing
 what they do  and they are making a difference by shared best practices 
 bike shares many of you have heard of it started twenty or thirty years ago in latin america now it 's in hundreds of cities around the world  pedestrian zones  congestion fees  emission limits in cities like california cities
  's lots and lots that cities can do even when opaque  stubborn nations refuse
 to act 
 so what 's the bottom line
 here 
 the bottom line is we still live politically in a world of borders a world of boundaries a world of walls a world where states
  we know that the reality we experience day to day is a world without borders 
 a world of diseases without borders and
 doctors without borders
  borders of terrorism and war without borders 
 that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or democratize globalization 
 we will 
 not only risk
 the failure to address all of these transnational problems but we will risk losing democracy itself
  up in the old
 box  unable to address global problems democratically so
 where does that leave us i 'll tell you the road to global democracy doesn 't run through states it runs through cities 
 democracy was born
 in the ancient polis
 i believe it can be reborn
 in the global cosmopolis  
 in that journey from polis to cosmopolis  we can rediscover the power of democracy on a global level  we can create not a league of nations which failed but a league of cities 
  but united cities of the world  we can create a global parliament of mayors that 's an idea it 's in
 my conception of the coming world but it 's also on the table in city halls in seoul korea in amsterdam in hamburg 
 and in new york mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually constitute a global parliament of mayors and i love that idea because a parliament of mayors is a
 parliament of citizens and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us of you
 and of me if ever there were citizens without borders  i think it 's the citizens of ted
 who show the promise to be those citizens without borders  i am ready
 to reach out and embrace a new
  global democracy to take back our
 democracy  and the only question is are you thank you so much my fellow citizens
