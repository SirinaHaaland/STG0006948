  i did that for two reasons
  i wanted to give you a good visual first impression  
 but the main reason i did it is that that 's what happens to me when i 'm forced to wear a lady gaga skanky mic 
 i 'm used to a stationary mic it 's the sensible shoe of public address
  but you clamp this thing on my head and something happens i just become skanky 
 so i 'm sorry about that  and i 'm already 
 ladies and gentlemen
  it all sort of started as a benign mistake like penicillin 
 what i really wanted was to be a graphic designer at one of the big design firms in new york city  
 but
 upon arrival there
 and doing a lot of interviews  i found that the only thing i was offered was to be assistant to the art director at alfred a knopf a book publisher  
 now i was stupid  but not so stupid that i turned it down  
 i had absolutely no idea what i was about to become part of  and i was incredibly lucky
  soon it had occurred to me what my job was my job was to ask this question what do the stories look like 
 because that is what knopf is 
 it is the story factory one of the very best in the world we bring stories to the public the stories can be anything 
 and some of them are actually true  but
 they all
  have one thing in common 
 they all need to look like something 
 they all need a face  why to give you a first impression
 of what you are about to get into 
 a book designer gives form to content  but also manages a very careful balance between the two now
  first day of my graphic design training at penn state university  
 the teacher lanny sommese  came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard and wrote the word apple underneath and he said ok  lesson one  listen 
  up and he covered up the picture and he said you either say this 
  but you don 't do this because this is treating your audience like a moron 
 and they deserve better 
 and lo and behold soon enough i was able to put this theory to the test on two books that i was working
  the first was katharine hepburn 's memoirs  and the second was a biography of marlene dietrich now
 the hepburn book was written in a very conversational style it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you 
 the dietrich book was an observation by her daughter it was a biography so the hepburn story is words and the dietrich story is pictures  and so we did this
 so there you are pure content and pure form side by side no fighting
  luckily for me  i live and work in new york city where there are plenty of dinosaurs 
 so i went to the museum of natural history  and i checked out the
  bones  and i went to the gift shop  and i bought a book and i was particularly taken with this page of the book 
 and more specifically the lower right hand corner  now
 i took this diagram  and i put it in a photostat machine
  and i took a piece of tracing paper  
 and i taped it over the photostat with a piece of scotch tape stop me if i 'm going too fast 
 and then i took a rapidograph pen explain it to the youngsters
  and i just started to
 reconstitute the dinosaur  
 i had no idea what i was doing  i had no idea where i was going but at some point i stopped when to keep going would seem like i was going too far and what i ended up with
 was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being we 're in the middle of the process
  and then i just threw some typography on it 
 very basic stuff slightly suggestive of public park signage 
 laughter everybody in house loved it  and so off it goes to the author  and even back
  that was a relief to see that pour out of the machine 
 i miss michael and sure enough somebody from mca universal calls our legal department
  to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image just in case they might want to use it  
 well they used it 
 and i was thrilled
  we all know it was an amazing movie and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture
 and become this phenomenon
 and to see all the different permutations of it  but not too long ago i came upon this on the web 
 no that is not me  
 but whoever it is i can 't help but thinking they woke up one day like oh my god that wasn 't there last night
  but if you think about it  from my head to my hands to his leg 
 that 's a responsibility and it
 's a responsibility that i don 't take lightly the book designer 's responsibility is threefold to the reader to the publisher
 and most of all to the author  i want you to look at the author 's book and say wow  i need to read that 
 david sedaris is one of my favorite writers and
 the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony and the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image
  he wanted to explore what was underlying that for me it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of
  but when you do you don 't get what you expect you get something that goes much deeper than that 
 and david especially loved this design because at book signings which he does a lot of he could take a magic marker
  and it 's about his time in rehab 
 in his 20s he was a hotshot ad executive and as mad men has told us a raging alcoholic 
 he did not think so however but
  his coworkers
 did an intervention and they said you are going to rehab  or
 you will be fired and you will die now to me  this was always going to be a typographic solution what i would call the opposite of type one hundred and one what does that mean usually on 
  the first day of introduction to typography you get the assignment of select a word and make it look like what it says it is so that 's type one hundred and one right very simple stuff
 this is going to be the opposite of that i want this book to look like it 's lying to you 
 desperately and hopelessly the way an alcoholic would the answer was the most low tech thing you can imagine i set up the type i
 printed it out on an epson printer with water soluble ink taped it to the wall and
  threw a bucket of water at it  presto 
 then when we went to press the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running 
 not long after it came out augusten was waylaid in an airport and he was hiding out in the bookstore spying on who was buying his books and this woman came up to it  and she squinted and she took it to the register  and she said to the man behind the counter
  guy behind the counter said i know lady they all came in that way 
 now that 's a good printing job 
 a book cover is a distillation it is a haiku
  if you will of the story this particular story
 by osama tezuka
 is his epic life of the buddha  
 and it 's eight volumes in all but the best thing is when it 's on your shelf you get a shelf life
 of the buddha  moving from one age to the next 
 all of these solutions
  derive their origins from the text of the book  but once the book designer has read the text then he has to be
 an interpreter
 and a translator this story was a real puzzle this is what it 's about
  all right so i got a collection of the paintings together and i looked at them and i deconstructed them and i put them back together and so here 's the design right and so here 's the front 
 and the spine and it 's flat  but the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf 
  they 've been discovered by the sultan he will not be pleased 
 huhh and now the sultan is in danger  and now we have to open it up to find out what 's going to happen next  
 try experiencing that on a kindle
  get me started 
 seriously 
 much is to be gained by ebooks  ease convenience portability  
 but something is definitely lost  tradition a sensual experience  the comfort of
  a little bit of humanity 
 do you know what john updike used to do the first thing when he would get a copy of one of his new books from alfred a knopf 
 he 'd smell it
 then he 'd run his hand over the rag paper  and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages 
 all those years all those books he never got tired of it  now i am all for the ipad
  but trust me smelling it will get you nowhere 
 now the apple guys are texting develop odor emission plug in 
 laughter and the last story i 'm going to talk about is quite
  japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway when she gets to the bottom she can 't help but feel that all of a sudden she 's entered a new 
  reality that 's just slightly different from the one that she left  but very similar  but different and so 
 we go back to hepburn and dietrich  but now we merge them 
 so we 're talking about different planes different pieces of paper  so this is on a 
 piece of velum it 's one part of the form and content when it 's on top of the paper board  which is the opposite
  even if you don 't know anything about this book you are forced to consider a single person straddling two planes of existence  
 and the object itself invited
 exploration
 interaction consideration
 and touch
  this debuted at number two on the new york times best seller list this is unheard of both for us the publisher 
 and the author  we 're talking a 900 page book that is as weird as it is compelling and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from 
  the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a german shepherd to explode 
 not exactly jackie collins
 fourteen weeks on the best seller list  eight printings and still going strong
  so even though we love publishing as an art 
 we very much know it 's a business too and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky that great art can be great business  
 so that 's my story 
 to be continued 
 what does it look like
  yes  it can it does and it will but for this book designer
