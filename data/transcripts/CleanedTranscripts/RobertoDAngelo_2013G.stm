  he 's our son he was born two and a half years ago and i had a pretty tough pregnancy
  had to stay still in a bed for like eight months
 but in the end everything seemed to be under control so he got the right weight at birth he got the right apgar index so we were pretty reassured by
 this but
 at the end ten days later after he was born we discovered that he had a stroke
  as you might know a stroke is a brain injury
 a perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth
 and in his case as you can see the right
 part of his brain has gone
 so the effect that this stroke could have on mario 's body could be the fact that he couldn 't be able to control the left
  side of his body
 just imagine if you have a computer and a printer and
 you want to transmit to input to print out a document but the printer doesn 't have the right drives so
 the same is for mario it 's just like he would like to move his left side of his body but he 's not able to transmit the right input to move his
  arm and left leg so life had to change we needed to change our schedule we needed to change
 the impact that
 this birth had on our life roberto d 'angelo as you may imagine unfortunately we were not ready
 nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities and as many
  questions as possible started to come to our minds
 and that has been really a tough time questions some basics like you know why did this happen to us and what went wrong
 some more
 tough like really what will be the impact on mario 's life i mean at the end will he be able to work will he be able to be normal and you know as a parent especially for the first time
 why is he not going
  to be better than us
 and this indeed really is tough to say but a few months later we realized that
 we were really feeling like a failure i mean the the only real product of our life
 at the end was a failure and you know it was not a failure for ourselves
  was a failure that will impact his full life
 honestly we went down i mean we went really down but at the end
 we started to look at him and we said we have to react
 so immediately as francesca said we changed our life we started physiotherapy we started the rehabilitation
 and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot basically we spent months
 doing this with mario you have an object
 and we showed him how to grab the object
 now the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains exactly now as you watch me doing this
 you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do
 the actions
 it looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation but one day
  we found that mario was not looking at our hand
 he was looking at us
 we were his mirror
 and the problem as you might feel is that we were down we were depressed we we were looking at him as a problem
 not as a son not from a positive perspective and that day really changed our perspective
  we realized that we
 had to become a better mirror for mario we restarted from our strengths and at the same time we restarted from his strengths we stopped 
 looking at him as a problem and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve
  our strengths that we really can bring to mario and we started from our passions i mean at the end my wife and myself are quite different but we have many things in common
 we love to travel we love music we love to be in places like this and we started to bring mario with us
 just to show to him the best things that we can show to him
 this short video is from last week
  i am not saying applause
 i am not saying it 's a miracle that 's not the message because we are just at the beginning of the path but we want to share what was the key learning
 the key learning that mario drove to us and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not
 only what
  and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity and this is the message that we want to share with you this is why we are here
 mario and this is why applause and this
 is why we
 decided to share the best mirror in the world
 with him and we thank you so much all of you applause ff thank you
