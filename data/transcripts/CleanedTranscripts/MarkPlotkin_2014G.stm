  a scientist who works in the rainforest to document how people use local plants i 've been doing this for a long time 
 and i want to tell you these people know these forests and these medicinal treasures better than we do and better than we ever will
 but also these cultures  these indigenous cultures are disappearing much faster than the forests themselves 
 and the greatest and most endangered species in the amazon rainforest is not the jaguar it 's not the harpy eagle 
 it 's the isolated and uncontacted tribes
  now four years ago i injured my foot in a climbing accident
 and i went to the doctor  she gave me heat  she gave me cold  aspirin  narcotic painkillers
 cortisone shots it didn 't work 
 several months later  i was in the northeast amazon  walked into a village  and the shaman said you
  and i 'll never forget this as long as i live  he looked me in the face and he said take off your shoe and give me your machete 
 he walked over to a palm tree and carved off a fern  threw it in the fire  applied it to my foot  
 threw it in a pot of water  and had me drink the tea  the pain disappeared
 for seven months when it came back i went to see the shaman again he gave me the same treatment  and i 've been
  cured for three years now who would you rather be treated by now
 make no mistake western medicine is the most successful system of healing ever devised but there 's
 plenty of holes in it where 's the cure for breast cancer where 's the cure for schizophrenia where 's the cure for acid reflux where 's the cure for insomnia
  fact is that these people can sometimes sometimes sometimes cure things we cannot 
 here you see a medicine man in the northeast amazon treating leishmaniasis a really nasty protozoal disease
 that afflicts twelve million people around the world western treatment are injections of antimony  they 're painful  they 're expensive
  and they 're probably not good for your heart it 's a heavy metal  this man cures it with three plants from the amazon rainforest  this is the magic frog 
 my colleague the late great loren mcintyre discoverer of the source lake of the amazon laguna mcintyre in the peruvian andes was lost on the peru brazil border about thirty years ago  
 he was rescued by a group of isolated indians called the matss 
 they beckoned for him to follow them into the forest which he did there they took out palm leaf
  baskets there they took out these green monkey frogs these are big suckers they 're like this and they began licking them 
 it turns out they 're highly hallucinogenic 
 mcintyre wrote about this and it was read by the editor of high times magazine you see 
  have friends in all sorts of strange cultures  this guy decided he would go down to the amazon and give it a whirl or give it a lick
  and he did 
 and he wrote my blood pressure went through the roof  i lost full control of my bodily functions  i passed out in a heap  
 i woke up in a hammock six hours later  felt like god for two days 
 an italian chemist read this and said i 'm not really interested in the theological aspects of the green monkey frog what 's this about the change in blood pressure
 who 's working on a new treatment for high blood pressure based on peptides in the skin of the green monkey frog  and other scientists are looking at a cure for drug resistant staph aureus 
 how ironic if these isolated indians and their magic frog prove to be one of the cures  
 here 's an ayahuasca shaman in the northwest amazon in the middle of a yage ceremony  i took him to los angeles to meet a foundation
  officer looking for support for monies to protect their culture this fellow looked at the medicine man and he said you didn 't go to medical school did you
 and the spirit  western medicine can 't touch those  i cure them 
 but all is not rosy in learning from nature about new medicines  this is a viper from brazil  the venom of which was studied at the universidade de so paulo here 
  this is a frontline treatment for hypertension hypertension  causes over ten percent of all deaths on the planet every day this is a $ four billion
 industry based on venom from a brazilian snake and the brazilians did not get a nickel  
 this is not an acceptable way of doing business  
 the rainforest has been called the greatest expression of life on earth  there 's a saying in suriname that i dearly love
  hold answers to questions we have yet to ask 
 but as you all know it 's rapidly disappearing here in brazil in the amazon  around the world  
 i took this picture from a small plane flying over the eastern border of the xingu indigenous reserve in the state of mato grosso to the northwest of here 
 the top half of the picture you see where the indians live  the line through the middle is the eastern
  border of the reserve top half indians  bottom half white guys  
 top half wonder drugs  bottom half just a bunch of skinny ass cows  
 top half carbon sequestered in the forest where it belongs  bottom half
 carbon in the atmosphere where it 's driving climate change in fact
  the number two cause of carbon being released into the atmosphere
 is forest destruction  
 but in talking about destruction  it 's important to keep in mind that the amazon is the mightiest landscape of all 
 it 's a place of beauty and wonder 
 the biggest anteater in the world lives in the rain forest tips the scale at ninety pounds  the goliath bird eating spider is the world 's largest spider it 's found in the amazon as well
  well the harpy eagle wingspan is over seven feet  and the black cayman
 these monsters can tip the scale at over half a ton  they 're known to be man eaters 
 the anaconda  the largest snake  the capybara  the largest rodent a specimen
 from here in brazil tipped the scale at two hundred and one pounds
 let 's visit where these creatures live the northeast amazon  home to the  akuriyo tribe  uncontacted peoples
 hold a mystical and iconic role in our imagination  
 these are the people who know nature best these are the people who truly live in total harmony with nature
  by our standards some would dismiss these people as primitive they don 't know how to make fire or they didn 't when they were first contacted 
 but they know the forest far better than we do 
 the akuriyos have  thirty five words for honey  and other indians look up to them as being the true masters of the emerald realm 
 here you see the face of my friend pohnay 
 when i was a teenager rocking out to the rolling stones in my hometown of new orleans pohnay was a forest nomad roaming the jungles of the
  northeast amazon in a small band 
 looking for game  looking for medicinal plants looking for a wife  in other small nomadic bands  
 but it 's people like these that know things that we don 't  
 and they have lots of lessons to teach us  
 however if you go into most of the forests of the amazon  there are no indigenous peoples  this is what you find
 rock carvings which indigenous peoples  uncontacted peoples used to sharpen the edge of the stone axe  these cultures that once danced  
 made love  sang to the gods  worshipped the forest all that 's left is an imprint in stone as you see here 
 let 's move to the western
  which is really the epicenter of isolated peoples  each of these dots represents a small uncontacted tribe and the big reveal today is we believe there 
  are fourteen or fifteen isolated groups in the colombian amazon alone 
  and i think it is their human right to remain so why are these the tribes that hide from man here 's why  obviously some of this was set off in 
 but at the turn of the last century was the rubber trade 
 the demand for natural rubber which came from the amazon  set off the botanical equivalent of a gold rush 
 rubber for bicycle tires  rubber for automobile tires
  rubber for zeppelins  
 it was a mad race to get that rubber  and the man on the left julio arana is one of the true thugs of the story
 his people his company  and other companies like them
 killed massacred  tortured  butchered indians like the witotos you see on the right hand side of the slide  
 even today when people come out of the forest the story seldom has a happy ending these are nukaks they were contacted in the
 80s within a year everybody over forty was dead and
 remember these are preliterate societies the elders are the libraries  every time a shaman dies it 's as if
 a library has burned down they have been forced off their lands  the drug traffickers have taken over the nukak lands
  live as beggars in public parks in eastern colombia 
 from the  nukak lands i want to take you to the southwest to the most spectacular landscape in the world  chiribiquete national park 
 it was surrounded by three isolated tribes and thanks to the colombian government and colombian colleagues it has now
 expanded it 's bigger than the state of maryland it is a treasure trove of botanical diversity
  by my mentor richard schultes seen here atop the bell mountain the sacred mountains of the  karijonas and let me show you what it looks like today  
 flying over 
 realize that these lost world mountains are still lost no scientist has been atop them in fact nobody has been atop the bell mountain since 
  end up here with the bell mountain just to the east of the picture let me show you what it looks like
  today 
 not only is this a treasure trove of botanical diversity not only is it home to three isolated tribes  but it 's the greatest treasure trove of pre colombian art in the world 
 over two hundred thousand paintings  the dutch scientist thomas van der hammen described this as the sistine chapel
 of the amazon rainforest but
  down to the southeast again in the colombian amazon remember the colombian amazon is bigger than new england 
 the amazon 's a big forest and brazil 's got a big part of it but not all of it moving down to these two national parks cahuinari and pur
 in the colombian amazon that 's the brazilian border to the right
 it 's home to several groups of isolated and uncontacted peoples to the trained eye you can look at the roofs of these
 these longhouses 
 and see that there 's cultural diversity these are in fact different tribes 
 as isolated as these areas are let me show you how the outside world is crowding in 
 here we see trade and transport increased in putumayo with the diminishment of the civil war in colombia  the outside world
 is showing up to the north we have illegal gold mining also from the east from brazil
  's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes  
 we see illegal logging coming from the south  and drug runners are trying to move through the park and get into brazil 
 this in the past is why you didn 't mess with isolated indians and if it looks like this picture is out of focus because it was taken in a hurry  here 's why
  this looks like a hangar from the brazilian amazon  this is an art exhibit in havana cuba 
 a group called los carpinteros this is their perception of why you shouldn 't mess with uncontacted indians 
 but the world is changing  these are mashco piros on the brazil peru border who stumbled out of the jungle because they were essentially chased out by drug runners
 and timber people and in peru there 's a very nasty business  it 's called human safaris  they will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture of
 course when you give them clothes when you give them tools you also give them diseases we call these inhuman safaris 
 these are indians again on the peru border who were overflown by flights sponsored by missionaries  they want to get in there and turn them into christians
 we know how that turns out what 's to be done 
 introduce technology to the contacted tribes not the uncontacted tribes  in a culturally sensitive way  this
 is the perfect marriage of ancient shamanic wisdom and 21st century technology we 've done this now
  over thirty tribes  
 mapped managed and increased protection of over seventy million acres of ancestral rainforest 
 so this allows the indians to take control of their environmental and cultural destiny  
 they also then set up guard houses to keep outsiders out 
  trained as indigenous park rangers  patrolling the borders and keeping the outside world at bay  
 this is a picture of actual contact 
 these are chitonahua indians on the brazil peru border they 've come out of the jungle asking for help  
 they were shot at
  is the single most despicable and disgusting human rights abuse on our planet today and it has to stop 
 but let me conclude by saying 
 this work can be spiritually rewarding but
 it 's difficult
 and it can be dangerous two colleagues of mine passed away recently in the crash
  of a small plane they were serving the forest to protect those uncontacted tribes  
 so the question is in conclusion is what the future holds 
 these are the uray people in brazil what does the future hold for them and what does the future hold for us  
 let 's think differently  let 's make a better world
  the climate 's going to change  let 's have a climate that changes for the better rather than the worse  let 's live on a planet
 full of luxuriant vegetation in which isolated peoples can remain in isolation can maintain that mystery
 and that knowledge if they so choose  let 's live in a world
 where the shamans live in these forests and heal themselves and us
  with their mystical plants and their sacred frogs thanks again
