  welcome to thailand  now when i was a young man forty years ago 
 the country was very very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty  we decided to do something about it  
 but we didn 't begin with a welfare program
 or a poverty
  reduction program  but we began with a family planning program  following a very successful maternal child health
 activity  sets of activities so basically no one would accept family planning if their children didn 't survive so the first step  get to the children get to the mothers  
  and then follow up with family planning not just child mortality alone  you need also family planning now let me take you back
  as to why we needed to do it in my country that was the case in 
 seven children per family tremendous growth at three point three percent there was just no future we needed to reduce the population growth rate  so
 we said let 's do it the women said we agree we 'll use pills  but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills 
 and we had very very few doctors  we didn 't take no as an answer we took no
  no as a question 
 we went to the nurses and the midwives who were also women and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill 
 that was wonderful but it covered only twenty percent of the country what do we do for the other eighty percent leave them alone and say well  they 're not medical personnel no we decided to do a bit more 
  ordinary people that you saw  actually below that yellow sign i wish they hadn 't wiped that because there was 
 we were so much bigger than coca cola in those days  
 and no difference  the people they chose were the people we chose
 they were well known in the community  they knew that customers were always right  and they were terrific  and they practiced their family planning themselves  so they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country in every village of the country  so there we are we went
  to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution wherever there were people and you can see boats with the women selling things here 's the floating market 
  selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives wherever you find people you 'll find contraceptives in thailand  
  get to religion because in the philippines the catholic church was pretty strong 
 and thai people were buddhist  we went to them and they said look could you help us i 'm there the one in blue not the yellow holding a bowl of holy water
 for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms
 for the sanctity of the family  
 and this picture was sent throughout the country  so some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves  and the women were saying no wonder we have no side effects it 's been blessed
  that was their perception  and then we went to teachers  you need everybody to be involved
 in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place  so we went to the teachers  over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet a b for birth c for condom i for iud v for vasectomy  
 and then we had a snakes and ladders game where you throw dice if you land on anything
  planning  you move ahead  like mother takes the pill every night  very good mother move ahead 
 uncle buys a condom very good uncle move ahead  uncle gets drunk doesn 't use condom come back start again 
 again education class entertainment  
 and the kids were doing it in school too we had relay races with condoms we had children 's condom blowing championship and before long the condom was know as the girl 's best friend
  in thailand for poor people diamonds don 't make it so the condom is the girl 's best friend  we introduced our first microcredit program 
 and the women who organized it said we only want to lend to women who practice family planning if you 're pregnant take care of your pregnancy if you 're not pregnant you can take a loan out from us 
  it 's still going on it 's a part of the village development bank it 's not a real bank  but it 's a fund microcredit  and we didn 't need a big organization to run it it was run by the villagers themselves  and 
 you probably hardly see a thai man there it 's always women women women women  
  and this is on the fourth of july  we decided to provide vasectomy to all men but in particular american men to the front of the queue right up to the ambassador 's residence
 during his [ unclear ] and the hotel gave us the ballroom for it very appropriate room 
  'll give you some lunch of course it must be american cola you get two brands coke and pepsi  and then the food is either hamburger or hotdog and i thought a hotdog will be more symbolic 
 laughter and here is this then young man called willy bohm who worked for the usaid 
 obviously he 's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten  
 and he was very happy it made a lot of news in america and it angered some people also i said don 't worry come over and i 'll do the whole lot of you
 and what happened in all this thing from seven children
 to one point five children population growth rate of three point three to zero point five  
 you could call it the coca cola approach if you like it was exactly the same thing i 'm not sure whether coca cola followed us or we followed coca cola but we 're good friends
  and so that 's the case of everyone joining in we didn 't have a strong government we didn 't have lots of doctors
 but it 's everybody 's job who can change attitude and behavior 
 then aids came along and hit thailand  and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight aids but unfortunately the government was in denial denial denial  so our 
  work wasn 't affected  so i thought well if you can 't go to the government go to the military so i went to the military and asked to borrow three hundred radio stations  they have more than the government and they 've got more guns than
 so i asked them could they help us in our fight against hiv  and after i gave them statistics they said yes okay you can use all the radio stations television stations and that 's when we went onto the airwaves  
 and then we got a new prime minister soon after that and he said mechai could you come and join he asked me in because he liked my
  he became the chairman of the national aids committee and increased the budget  fifty fold every ministry even judges had to be involved in aids education everyone and we said the public institutions religious institutions schools
 everyone was involved  
 and here every media person had to be trained for hiv  and we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising
  to earn more money so they were happy with that  
 and then aids education in all schools starting from university  and these are high school kids teaching high school kids and the best teachers were the girls not the boys  
 and they were terrific  and these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and hiv were known as mother theresa
  and then we went down one more step these are primary school kids
 third fourth grade going to every household in the village every household in the whole of thailand  giving aids information
 and a condom to every household given by these young kids and no parents objected because we were  trying to save lives  and this
 was a lifesaver  and we said everyone needs to be involved so you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don 't work and dead customers don 't buy so they all trained  and then we have this captain condom
  going to schools and night spots  and they loved him  you need a symbol of something
  in every country every program  you need a symbol and this is probably the best thing he 's ever done with his mba 
 and then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets everywhere everywhere in taxis you get condoms and also in traffic the policemen give you
  can you imagine new york policemen giving out condoms of course i can and they 'd enjoy it immensely i see them standing around right now everywhere imagine if they had condoms  giving
 out to all sorts of people and then new change we had hair bands  clothing and the condom for
 your mobile phone during the rainy season and these were the condoms that we introduced
 one says 
 weapon of mass protection we found you know somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction  but we have found the weapon of mass protection  the condom  and then it says here with the american flag 
 don 't leave home without it 
 but i have some to give out afterward  but let me warn you
  condoms can do so many things look at this i gave this to al gore and to bill senior also stop global warming use condoms
  and then this is the picture i mentioned to you
 the weapon of mass protection  and let the next olympics save some lives  why just run around
 and then finally 
 in thailand we 're buddhist we don 't have a god so instead we say in rubber we trust 
 so you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people we had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools because
  alcohol impairs judgment  and then what happened after all this time everybody joined in according to the 
 new cases of hiv declined by ninety percent and according to the world bank  seven point seven million lives were saved  otherwise there wouldn 't be many thais walking around today  so it just 
  showed you  you could do something about it ninety percent of the funding came from thailand  there was political commitment some financial commitment and everybody joined in the fight so just don 't leave it to the
  specialists and doctors and nurses  we all need to help  and then we decided to help people out of poverty now that we got aids somewhat out of the way this time not with government alone  but in cooperation 
 with the business community because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit those are the things to be provided by the business community
  trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs  little business people the only way out of poverty is through business enterprise so that was done the money goes from the company 
 into the village via  tree planting it 's not a free gift  they plant the trees  and the money goes into their microcredit fund which we call the village development bank  everybody joins in and they feel they own the bank  because they have brought the money in 
 those who are living in poverty  access to credit must be a human right  
 access to credit must be a human right  otherwise they 'll never get out of poverty  
 and then before getting a loan you must be trained here 's what we call a barefoot mba 
 teaching people how to do business so that when they borrow money they 'll succeed with the business these are
  and this is very interesting nike ice cream and nike biscuits 
 this is a village sponsored by nike they said they should stop making shoes and clothes make these better because we can afford them 
 and then we have silk  thai silk now we 're making scottish tartans as you can see on the left to sell to all people of scottish
  so anyone sitting in and watching tv get in touch with me  
 and then this is our answer to starbucks in thailand 
 coffee and condoms see starbucks you awake we keep you awake and alive that 's the difference 
 can you imagine at every starbucks that you can also get condoms  you can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino  
 and then now finally in education we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it 's a
  learning center for everyone we call this our school based integrated rural development  and it 's a center a focal point
 for economic and social development re do the school make it serve the community needs  
 and here is a bamboo building all of them are bamboo this is a geodesic dome made of
  and i 'm sure buckminster fuller would would be very very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome  and we use vegetables around the school ground  so they raise their own vegetables 
  and then finally i firmly believe if we want the mdgs to work the millennium development goals we need to add family planning to it of course child mortality first
  the next olympics to be involved
 in saving lives  and then finally that is our network  and these are our thai tulips 
 thank you very much indeed
