  is going to be a very good year a year of fulfillment  realization 
 i have that sense not because of anything particular in store for me  but because i read it would be a good
  year in 
  book by norman mailer he felt his own age 
 wrote mailer in the armies of the night 
 felt as if he were a solid embodiment of bone muscle heart mind and sentiment to be a man as if he had arrived 
 yes i know mailer wasn 't writing about me  but i also know that he was for all
  of us you me the subject of his book age more or less in step proceed from birth along the same great sequence 
 through the wonders and confinements of childhood the emancipations and frustrations of adolescence the 
 and millstones of adulthood the recognitions and resignations of old age
 there are patterns to life and they are shared as thomas mann wrote it will happen to me
 as to them 
 we don 't simply live these patterns we record them too 
 we write them down in books where they become narratives that we can then read and recognize 
 books tell us who we 've been who we are who we will be
 so they have for millennia as james salter wrote life passes into pages if it passes into anything 
 and so six years ago a thought leapt to mind  
 if life passed into pages there were somewhere passages written about every age if i
 i could find them  i could assemble them into a narrative  
 i could assemble them into a life a long life a hundred year life the entirety of that same great sequence through which the luckiest among us pass 
 i was then thirty seven years old an age of discretion wrote william trevor  
 i was prone to meditating on time and age
  illness in the family and later an injury to me had long made clear that growing old could not be assumed 
 and besides growing old only postponed the inevitable time seeing through what circumstance did not it was all a bit disheartening 
 a list though would last 
 to chronicle a life year by vulnerable year would be to clasp and to ground what was fleeting 
 would be to provide myself and others a glimpse into the future whether we made it there
  or not 
 and when i then began to compile my list i was quickly obsessed  searching pages and pages for ages and ages 
 here we were at every annual step through our first hundred years twenty seven a time of sudden revelations
  course that such insights were relative  for starters we now live longer  and so age more slowly  
 christopher isherwood used the phrase the yellow leaf 
 to describe a man at fifty three only one century after lord byron used it to describe himself at thirty six 
  that life can swing wildly and unpredictably from one year to the next and that people may experience the same age differently 
 but even so as the list coalesced so too on the page  clear as the reflection in the mirror did the life that i had been living  
 finding at twenty that one is less and less sure of who one is 
 emerging at thirty from the wasteland of preparation into active life learning at forty
  softly the doors to rooms [ i would ] not be coming back to 
 there i was 
 of course  there we all are 
 milton glaser the great graphic designer whose beautiful visualizations you see here and who today is eighty five all those
  a ripening and an apotheosis wrote nabokov
 noted to me that like art
 and like color literature helps us to remember what we 've experienced  
 and indeed when i shared the list with my grandfather he nodded in recognition he was then 
 and soon to die  which wrote roberto bolao is the
  and looking back he said to me that yes  proust was right that at twenty two we are sure we will not die  
 just as a thanatologist named edwin shneidman was right that at ninety we are sure we will 
 it had happened to him  as to them 
 now the list is done
 a hundred years  and looking back over it 
 i know that i am not done  i still have my life to live still have many more pages to pass into 
 and mindful of mailer i await
