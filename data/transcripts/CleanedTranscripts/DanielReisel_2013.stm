  i 'd
 like to talk today
 about how we can change our brains and our society  meet joe joe 's thirty two years old
 and a murderer  i met joe thirteen years ago on the lifer wing at wormwood scrubs
 high security prison in london i
 'd like you to imagine this place it looks and feels like it sounds wormwood scrubs
 built at the end of the victorian era by the inmates themselves  it is where england 's most dangerous prisoners are kept 
 these individuals have committed acts of unspeakable evil
  and i was there
 to study their brains  
 i was part of a team of researchers from university college london on a grant from the  u k department of health 
 my task was to study a group of inmates who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths 
 that meant they were the most callous and the most aggressive of the entire prison population 
 what lay at the root of their behavior 
 was there a neurological cause for their condition
  and if there was a neurological cause could we find a cure  
 so i 'd like to speak about
 change and especially about emotional change growing up  i was always intrigued by how people change 
 my mother a clinical psychotherapist would
 occasionally see patients at home in the evening  she would shut the door to the living room and i imagined
  magical things happened in that room  at the age of five or six i would
 creep up in my pajamas and sit outside with my ear glued to the door on more than one occasion i fell asleep and they had to
 push me out of the way at the end of the session  and i suppose that 's how i found myself
 walking into the secure interview room on my first
  sat across a steel table and greeted me with
 this blank expression
  the prison warden looking equally indifferent  
 said any trouble just press the red buzzer and we 'll be around as soon as we can 
 laughter i sat down  the heavy metal door slammed shut behind me  
 i looked up at the red buzzer far behind joe on the opposite wall
 i looked at joe  perhaps detecting my concern he leaned forward and said as reassuringly as he could
 looking specifically at their ability to
 to categorize different images of emotion and we looked at their physical response to those emotions 
 so for example when most of us look at a picture like this of somebody looking sad we instantly have
 a slight  measurable physical response  increased heart rate sweating of the skin
 whilst the psychopaths in our study were able to describe the pictures accurately they failed to show the emotions required  
 they failed to show a physical response  it was as though they knew the words but not the music of empathy  
 so we wanted to look closer at this to use mri to image their brains that turned out to be not such an easy task
  imagine transporting a collection of clinical psychopaths across central london in shackles and handcuffs
 in rush hour  and in order to place each
 of them in an mri scanner you have to remove all metal objects including shackles and handcuffs and as i learned all body piercings  
 after some time however we had a tentative answer these individuals
  were not just the victims of a troubled childhood  there was something else people like joe
 have a deficit in a brain area called the amygdala the amygdala is an almond shaped organ deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain  
 it is thought to be key to the experience
  the more empathic a person is  the larger and more active their amygdala is 
 our population of inmates had a deficient amygdala which likely led to their lack of empathy and to their immoral behavior  
 so
 let 's take a step back  normally  acquiring moral behavior is simply part of growing up  like learning
  to speak at the age of six months  virtually every one of us is able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects at the age of
 twelve months  
 most children are able to imitate the purposeful actions of others  so for example your mother raises her hands to stretch and you imitate her behavior  
 at first this isn 't
 perfect  i remember my cousin sasha  two years old at the time  looking through a picture book
 and licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand  licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand 
 bit by bit we build the foundations of the social brain so that by the time we 're
 three four years old most children not all have acquired the ability to understand the intentions of others  another prerequisite for empathy
  fact that this developmental progression
 is universal  
 irrespective of where you live in the world or which culture you inhabit  strongly suggests that the foundations of moral behavior are inborn 
 if you doubt this  try as i 've done to renege on a promise you 've made
  you will find that the mind of a four year old is not nave in the slightest it is
 more akin to a swiss army knife with fixed mental modules finely honed during development
 and a sharp sense of fairness  
 the early years are crucial there seems to be a window of opportunity  after which mastering moral questions becomes more difficult
  say it 's impossible a
 recent wonderful study from stanford university showed that people who have played a virtual reality game in which they took on the role of a good and helpful superhero 
 actually became more caring and helpful towards others afterwards  
  i am suggesting that we need to find ways to get joe and people like him to change their brains and their behavior  for their benefit
 and for the benefit of the rest of us  
 so can brains change  for over one hundred years neuroanatomists and
 later neuroscientists held the view that after initial development in childhood  no new brain cells could grow in the adult
  human brain the brain could only change within certain set limits that was the dogma but then in the 
 studies starting showing following the lead of elizabeth gould at princeton and others  studies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis  the birth of new brain cells in the adult mammalian
  first in the olfactory bulb which is responsible for our sense of smell then in the hippocampus
 involving short term memory  and finally in the amygdala itself 
 in order to understand how this process works  i left the psychopaths and joined a lab in oxford
 specializing in learning and development instead of psychopaths
 i studied mice because the same pattern of brain responses appears across many different species of social animals  so
 if you rear a mouse in a standard cage a
 shoebox essentially with cotton wool  alone and without much stimulation not only does it not thrive  but it will often develop strange  repetitive behaviors this naturally 
  sociable animal will lose its ability to bond with other mice even becoming aggressive when introduced to them
  however mice reared in what we called an enriched environment a large habitation with other mice with wheels and ladders and areas to explore  
 demonstrate neurogenesis the birth of new brain cells 
 and as we showed they also perform better on a range of learning and memory tasks now 
 they don 't develop morality to the point of carrying the shopping bags of little old mice across the street
 their improved environment results in healthy sociable behavior  mice reared in a standard cage by contrast 
 not dissimilar you might say from a prison cell have dramatically lower levels of new
 neurons in the brain  it is now clear that the
 amygdala of mammals including primates like us can show
  in some areas of the brain more than twenty percent of cells are newly formed we 're just beginning to understand
 what exact function these cells have but what it implies is that the brain is capable of extraordinary change
 way into adulthood  however our brains are also exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment stress
  released by the brain  suppress the growth of these new cells  the more stress the less brain development which in turn causes
 less adaptability and causes higher stress levels this is the interplay between nature and nurture
 in real time in front of our eyes  when you
  is ironic that our current solution for people with stressed amygdalae is to place them in an environment that actually inhibits any chance of further growth 
 of course imprisonment is a necessary part
 of the
 criminal justice system and of protecting society 
 our research does not suggest that criminals should submit their mri scans as evidence in court and get off the hook because they 've got a faulty amygdala  
 the evidence is actually the other way because
  our brains are capable of change  we need to take responsibility for our actions and they need to take responsibility for their rehabilitation 
 one way such rehabilitation might work is through restorative justice programs
  here victims if they choose to participate  and perpetrators meet face to face
  and the perpetrator is encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and the victim
 plays an active role in the process in such a setting the perpetrator can see  perhaps for the first time 
 the victim as a as a real person with thoughts and feelings and a genuine emotional response this stimulates the amygdala
 and may be a more effective
  rehabilitative practice than simple incarceration such programs won 't work for everyone  but for many it could be a way
 to break the frozen sea within so what can we
 do now how can we apply this knowledge i 'd like to leave you with
 three lessons that i learned  the first thing that i learned was that we need to change
  since wormwood scrubs was built one hundred and thirty years ago society has advanced in virtually every aspect in the way we run our schools our hospitals 
 yet the moment we speak about prisons  it 's as though we 're back in dickensian times  
 if not medieval times
 for too long  
 i believe 
 we 've allowed ourselves to be persuaded of the false notion that human nature cannot change and as a society it 's costing us dearly
 we know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change 
 and the best way to achieve that even in adults is to change and modulate our environment  the second thing
 i have learned is that we need to create an alliance of people who believe that science is integral
 to bringing about social change  it 's easy enough for a neuroscientist to
  place a high security inmate in an mri scanner  well actually  that turns out not to be so easy but ultimately what we want to show
 is is whether we 're able to reduce the reoffending rates in order to answer complex questions like that we need people of different backgrounds
 lab based scientists and clinicians social workers and policy makers  
 philanthropists and human rights activists to work
  together finally
 i believe we need to change our own amygdalae because this issue goes to the heart not just of who joe is 
 but who we are 
 we need to change our view
 of joe as someone
 wholly irredeemable  because if we see joe as wholly irredeemable how is he going to see himself as any different
  in another decade joe will be released from wormwood scrubs  
 will he be among the seventy percent of inmates who end up reoffending and returning to the prison system 
 wouldn 't it be better if while serving his sentence joe was able to train his amygdala which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells and connections
  so that he will be able to face the world once he gets released surely that would be in the interest of all of us
