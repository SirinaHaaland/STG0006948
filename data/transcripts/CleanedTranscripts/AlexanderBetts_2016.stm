  there are times when i feel really quite ashamed to be a european 
 in the last year  more than a million people arrived in europe in need of our help  and our
  has been pathetic there are just so many contradictions  we mourn the tragic death of 
 and yet  since then more than two hundred children have subsequently drowned in the mediterranean  
 we have international treaties that recognize that refugees are a shared responsibility  and yet we accept that tiny lebanon hosts more syrians
 than the whole of europe combined  
 we lament the existence of human smugglers  
 and yet we make that the only viable route to seek asylum in europe  
 we have labor shortages  and yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs from coming to europe
 our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist islam  and yet
 we have repressive policies
 that detain child asylum seekers that separate children from their families 
 and that seize property from refugees 
 what are we doing how has the situation come to this
  that we 've adopted such an inhumane response
 to a humanitarian crisis 
 i don 't believe it 's because people don 't care  or at least i don 't want to believe it 's because people don 't care 
 i believe it 's because our politicians lack a vision a vision for how to adapt an international refugee system created over fifty years ago
 for a changing and globalized world
  so what i want to do is take a step back
 and ask two really fundamental questions  the two questions we all need to ask 
 first why is the current system not working  and second what can we do
 to fix it so the modern refugee regime was created in the aftermath
  the second world war
 by these guys  its basic aim
 is to ensure that when a state fails or worse turns against its own people 
 people have somewhere to go to live in safety and dignity until they can go home 
 it was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in syria today  
 through an international convention
  convention on the status of refugees and an international organization
 states committed to reciprocally admit people onto their territory who flee conflict and persecution  
 but today  that system is failing  
 in theory  refugees have a right to seek asylum 
 in practice our immigration policies block the path to safety  in theory refugees
 have a right to a pathway to integration  or return to the country they 've come from 
 but in practice  they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo  in theory refugees are a shared global responsibility  
 in practice  geography means that countries proximate the conflict take the overwhelming majority of the world
  the system isn 't broken because the rules are wrong it 's that we 're not applying them adequately to a changing world  and that 's what we need to reconsider  
 so i want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works how does the refugee regime actually work  
 but not from a top down institutional perspective rather from the perspective of a refugee 
 so imagine a syrian woman let 's call her amira
  amira to me represents many of the people i 've met in the region 
 amira like around twenty five percent of the world 's refugees  is a woman with children 
 and she can 't go home because she comes from this city that you see before you homs a once beautiful and historic city
 now under rubble  and so amira
  can 't go back there 
 but amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country 
 because that 's a lottery ticket only available to less than one percent of the world 's refugees  
 so amira and her family
 face an almost impossible choice  they have three basic options  the first option
 is that amira can take her family to a camp 
  she might get assistance  
 but there are very few prospects for amira and her family camps are in bleak  arid locations  often in the desert 
 in the zaatari refugee camp in jordan you can hear the shells across the border in syria at nighttime 
 there 's restricted economic activity  education is often of poor quality
  and around the world  some eighty percent of refugees who are in camps have to stay for at least five years it 's a miserable existence and
 that 's probably why in reality only nine percent of syrians choose that option 
 alternatively amira can head to an urban area in a neighboring country like amman or beirut that 's an option that about
  of syrian refugees have taken  
 but there there 's great difficulty as well 
 refugees in such urban areas don 't usually have the right to work  
 they don 't usually get significant access to assistance  
 and so when amira and her family have used up their basic savings  they 're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution  
 so there 's a third
  and it 's one that increasing numbers of syrians are taking amira
 can seek some hope for her family
 by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country and it 's that which we 're seeing in europe today  
 around the world  we present refugees with an almost impossible
  three options encampment urban destitution and dangerous journeys 
 for refugees that choice is the global refugee regime today  
 but i think it 's a false choice i think we can reconsider that choice  the reason why we limit those options
 is because we think that those are the only options that are available to refugees and they 're not
 politicians frame the issue as a zero sum issue that if we benefit refugees we 're imposing costs on citizens 
 we tend to have a collective assumption that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society  but they don 't have to they can contribute 
 so what i want to argue is there are ways in which we can expand that choice set
 and still benefit everyone else  the host states and communities
 our societies and refugees themselves  
 and i want to suggest four ways we can transform the paradigm of how we think about refugees  
 all four ways have one thing in common 
 they 're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globalization  
 mobility and markets and update the way we think about the refugee issue 
 the first one i want to think about is the
  idea of enabling environments  and it starts from a very basic recognition
 that refugees are human beings like everyone else  but they 're just in extraordinary circumstances  
 together with my colleagues in oxford we 've embarked on a research project in uganda
 looking at the economic lives of refugees  we chose uganda not because it 's representative of all host countries it 's not
  exceptional  
 unlike most host countries around the world what uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunity  it gives them the right to work  
 it gives them freedom of movement 
 and the results of that are extraordinary both for refugees and the host community 
 in the capital city kampala  we found that
  percent of refugees own a business that employs other people 
 and forty percent of those employees are nationals of the host country 
 in other words refugees are making jobs for citizens of the host country  
 even in the camps  we found extraordinary examples of vibrant flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses
  for example in a settlement called
  we found examples of congolese refugees running digital music exchange businesses  
 we found a rwandan who runs a business that 's available to allow the youth to play computer games on recycled games consoles and recycled televisions
  against the odds of extreme constraint refugees are innovating and the gentleman you see before you is a
  arrived in the settlement with very little but he wanted to be a filmmaker  
 so with friends and colleagues he started a community radio station  
 he rented a video camera  
 and he 's now making films he made two documentary films with and for our team and he 's making a successful business out of very little 
 it 's those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees  rather than seeing refugees as
  inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance  we need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing  
 yes  clothes blankets  shelter  food are all important in the emergency phase  but we need to also look beyond that 
 we need to provide opportunities to connectivity
  the right to work  
 access to capital and banking 
 all the ways in which we take for granted that we are plugged in to the global economy can and should apply to refugees  
 the second idea i want to discuss is economic zones  
 unfortunately not every host country in the world takes the approach uganda has taken  
 most host countries don 't open up their economies to refugees in the same way  
 but there are still pragmatic
 alternative options that we can use  
 last april i traveled to jordan with my colleague the development economist paul collier  
 and we brainstormed an idea while we were there with the international community and the government 
 an idea to bring jobs to syrians while supporting jordan 's national development strategy
  the idea is for an economic zone 
 one in which we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees alongside the employment of jordanian host nationals  
 and just fifteen minutes away from the zaatari refugee camp home to eighty three thousand refugees  is an existing economic zone called the king hussein bin talal development area 
 the government has spent over a hundred million dollars connecting it to the electricity grid connecting it to the road network  but it lacked
 two things  access to labor and inward investment  
 so what if refugees were able to work there rather than being stuck in camps able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they go back to syria 
 we recognized that that could benefit jordan  whose development strategy requires it to make the leap as a middle income country to manufacturing  
 it could benefit refugees but it could
  also contribute to the postconflict reconstruction of syria
 by recognizing that we need to incubate refugees as the best source of eventually rebuilding syria  
 we published the idea in the journal foreign affairs  king abdullah has picked up on the idea it was announced at the london syria conference two weeks ago and a pilot
  the third idea that i want to put to you is preference matching between states and refugees to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie featuring angela merkel and a syrian refugee 
 what we rarely do is ask refugees what they want where they want to go  but i 'd argue we can do that and still make everyone better off
  economist alvin roth has developed the idea of matching markets ways in which the preference ranking of the parties shapes an eventual match  
 my colleagues will jones and alex teytelboym have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees to ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations
  but also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want on skills criteria or language criteria and allow those to match 
 now of course you 'd need to build in quotas on things like diversity and vulnerability  
 but it 's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching 
 the matching idea has been successfully used to match for instance students
 with university places
  to match kidney donors with patients  and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites  so why not apply that to give refugees greater choice  it could 
  also be used at the national level where one of the great challenges we face is to persuade local communities to accept refugees and at the moment  in my country for instance  
  we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities which makes no sense at all so matching markets offer a potential way to bring
  those preferences together and listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host and the refugees themselves  
 the fourth idea i want to put to you is of humanitarian visas  
 much of the tragedy and chaos we 've seen in europe was entirely avoidable 
 it stems from a fundamental contradiction in europe 's asylum policy which is the following that in order to seek asylum in europe
 you have to arrive spontaneously by embarking on those dangerous journeys that i described  
 but why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline
 and modern consular capabilities  they 're completely unnecessary journeys  and last year  they led to the deaths of over three thousand people on europe 's borders and within european territory
  if refugees were simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in europe  we would avoid that and there 's a way of doing that through something called a humanitarian visa 
 that allows people to collect a visa at an embassy or a consulate in a neighboring country and then simply pay their own way through a ferry or a flight to europe
  it costs around a thousand euros to take a smuggler from turkey to the greek islands  it costs two hundred euros to take a budget airline from bodrum to frankfurt 
 if we allowed refugees to do that  it would have major advantages  it would save lives  
 it would undercut the entire market for smugglers  
 and it would remove the chaos we see from europe 's front line in areas like the greek islands  it 's politics that prevents us doing that
  than a rational solution 
 and this is an idea that has been applied 
 brazil has adopted a pioneering approach where over two thousand syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas  enter brazil and claim refugee status on arrival in brazil 
 and in that scheme  every syrian who has gone through it has received refugee status and been recognized as a genuine refugee 
 there is a historical precedent for it as well
  nine hundred and forty two 
 these nansen passports were used as travel documents to allow four hundred and fifty thousand assyrians  turks and chechens to travel across europe and claim refugee status elsewhere in europe 
 and the nansen international refugee office received the nobel peace prize in recognition of this being
  a viable strategy  so all four of these ideas that i 've presented you
 are ways in which we can expand amira 's choice set 
 they 're ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees beyond those basic impossible three options i explained to you and still leave others better off  
  we really need a new vision 
 a vision that enlarges the choices of refugees but recognizes that they don 't have to be a burden 
 there 's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost yes  they are a humanitarian responsibility  
 but they 're human beings with skills talents  aspirations with the ability to make contributions if we let them 
 in the new world  migration is not going to go away what we 've seen in europe will be with us for many
  years people will continue to travel they
 'll continue to be displaced  and we need to find rational realistic ways of managing this not based on the old logics of humanitarian assistance not based on logics of charity  
 but building on the opportunities offered by globalization markets and mobility 
 i 'd urge you all to wake up and urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge  thank you very much
