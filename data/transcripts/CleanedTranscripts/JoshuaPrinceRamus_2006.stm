  i 'm going to present three projects in rapid fire i don 't have much time to do it 
 and i want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid fire presentation the first is what i like to call a hyper rational process it 's a process that
 takes rationality almost to an absurd level and it transcends all the
  baggage that normally comes with what people would call sort of a rational conclusion to something and it concludes in something that you see here that you actually wouldn 't expect as being
 the result of rationality the second
 the second
 is that this process does not have a signature  there is no authorship architects are obsessed with authorship  this is something that has editing and it has
  teams but in fact we no longer see within this process the traditional master architect creating
 a sketch that his minions carry out 
 and the third is that it challenges and this is in the length of this very hard to to support why  connect all these things
 but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility  high modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic almost anything can happen within them i call
  flexibility  turn your
 head this way shoot and you 're bound to kill something so this is the promise of high modernism within a single space actually any kind of activity can happen but as we 're seeing 
 operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters and
 so with this sort of idea what happens is whatever actually is in the building on opening day or whatever seems to be the most immediate need starts to
  dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it of anything else could ever happen  and so we 're proposing a different kind of flexibility something that we call
 compartmentalized
 flexibility and the idea is that you within that continuum identify a series of points and you design specifically to them they can be pushed off center a little bit but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum
 as you originally had hoped with high modernist
  flexibility  that doesn 't really work now
 i 'm going to talk about i 'm going to build up the seattle central library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams and i truly mean this is the design process that you 'll see 
 with the library staff and the library board we settled on two core positions this is the first one and this is showing over the last nine hundred years the evolution of the
  this diagram was our sort of position piece about the book and our position was books are technology that 's something people forget
 but it 's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media 
 the second premise and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first is that libraries since the inception of carnegie library tradition in america 
 had a second responsibility and that was for social roles
 come back to later  but something actually the librarians at first said no this isn 't our mandate our mandate is
 media and particularly the book so what you 're seeing now is actually the design of the building the upper diagram
 is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility sort of
  any activity could happen anywhere
  we don 't know the future of the library we don 't know the future of the book  and so we 'll use this approach  and what we saw were buildings that were very generic and worse not only were they very generic so not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like
 the magazine area
 but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it and in this
  was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book  and so we proposed what 's at the lower diagram very dumb approach  
 simply compartmentalize put those things whose evolution we could predict and i don 't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future 
 put those in boxes designed specifically for it and put the things that we can 't predict on the rooftops  so that was the core idea 
  important to media in order to get them to accept this what you 're seeing here is actually their program on the left that 's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory
  our first operation was to re digest it back to them show it to them and say you know what we haven 't touched it  
 but only one third of your own program is dedicated to media and
  of it is already dedicated that 's the white band below the thing you said isn 't important is already dedicated to social functions 
 so once we had presented that back to them they agreed that this sort of core concept could work we got the right to go back to first principles that 's the third diagram we recombined everything  
 and then we started making new decisions what you 're seeing on the right is the design of the library specifically in terms of square footage on the left of that diagram
  a series of five platforms sort of combs collective programs and on the right are the more indeterminate spaces things like reading rooms whose evolution in twenty thirty forty years we can 't predict  
 so that literally was the design of the building they signed it and to their chagrin we came back a week later and we presented them this
 and as you can see it is literally the diagram on the right we just sized no really i mean
  those are the boxes we sized them into five compartments they 're super efficient we had a very low budget to work with we pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships the reading room should be able to see the water 
 the main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code and so forth  
 so you see the five platforms those are the boxes within each one a very discrete
  thing is happening  the area in between is sort of an urban continuum these things that we can 't predict their evolution to the same degree 
 to give you some sense of the power of this idea the biggest block block is what we call the book spiral it 's literally built in a very inexpensive way it is a parking garage for books it
 just so happens to be on the 
  of the building but that is not necessarily an expensive approach  and it allows us to organize the entire dewey decimal system on one continuous run no matter how it grows
  or contracts within the building  it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we 've all experienced in public libraries 
 and so this was the final operation which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter
  and to hold onto them with a skin that skin serves double duty again for economics
  is the lateral stability for the entire building it 's a structural element but its dimensions were designed not only for structure but also for holding on every piece of glass
  the glass was then i 'll use the word impregnated but it had a layer of metal that was called stretched metal that metal acts as a microlouver 
 so from the exterior of the building the sun sees it as totally opaque but from the interior it 's entirely transparent 
 so now i 'm going to
 take you on a tour of the building let me see if i can find it for anyone who gets motion
  sickness i apologize so this is the building  
 and i think what 's important is when we first unveiled the building  
 the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego
 and it was defended believe it or not by the librarians they said look we don 't know what it is but we know it 's everything that we need it to be based on the observations that we 've done about the program
 is
 going into one of the entries so it 's an unusual building for a public library obviously  
 so now we 're going into what we call the living room this is actually a program that we invented with the library it was recognizing that public libraries
 are the last vestige of public free space there are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in
  in downtown seattle  but there are not so many
 free places that allow you to get out of the rain so this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything including eat yell play chess and so forth  
 now we 're moving up into what we call
 the mixing chamber that was the main technology area in the building  you 'll have to tell me if i 'm going too fast for you
  and now up 
 this is actually the place that we put into the building so i could propose to my wife
 i can very quickly get into the book spiral because i think it 's as i said the most this is the main reading room
 the most unique part of the building  you dizzy yet ok so here this is the book spiral
  one city block go up one full floor so that it 's on a continuum ok
 now i 'm going to go back and i 'm going to hit a second project i 'm going
 to go very very quickly through this now this is the
 dallas theater it was an unusual client for us because they came to us and they said 
 we need you to do a new building  we 've been working in a temporary space for thirty years  but because
  of that temporary space we 've become an infamous theater
 company theater is really focused in new york  chicago and seattle with the exception of the dallas theater company 
 and the very fact that they worked in a provisional space meant that for beckett they could blow out a wall they could do cherry orchard and blow a hole through the floor and so forth  so it was a very daunting task for us to do a
  be a pristine building but keep this kind of experimental nature  and the second is they were what we call a multi form theater they do
 different kinds of performances in repertory so they in the morning will do something in arena then they 'll do something in proscenium and so forth and so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations 
 and for operational budget reasons 
 this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi form theater in the united states so we needed to figure out a way
 so our thought was to literally put the theater on its head to take those things that were previously defined as front of house and back of house and stack them above house and below house 
 and to create what we called a theater machine we invest the money in the operation of the building it 's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere wherever you place it the area under it is charged for theatrical performances
 allowed us to go back to first principles and redefine fly tower acoustic enclosure light enclosure and so forth 
 and at the push of a button  it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium thrust and in fact arena
 and traverse and flat floor 
 in a very quick transfiguration so in fact using operational budget we can sorry capital cost we can actually achieve what
  the artistic director now has
 a palette that he or she can choose from between a series of forms and a series of processions because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front of house and back of house spaces has been liberated  
 so an artistic director has the ability to have a performance that enters in a wagnerian procession  shows the first first act in thrust  the intermission in a greek procession
  second act in arena and so forth
  so i 'm going to show you what what this actually means this is the theater up close  any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely 
 the light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure so you can do beckett with dallas as the backdrop 
 portions can be opened so you can now actually have motorcycles
 drive directly into the performance or you can even just have an open air performance or for intermissions
 the balconies all move to go between those configurations but they also disappear  the proscenium line can also disappear 
 you can bring enormous objects in so in fact the dallas theater company their first show will be a play about charles lindbergh and
 they 'll want to bring in a real aircraft  and then it also provides them in the off season the ability to actually
 rent out their space for entirely different things
 this is it from a distance 
 open up entire portions for different kinds of events  and at night  
 again  remove the light enclosure keep the acoustic enclosure  this is a monster truck show i 'm going to show now the last
  this also is an unusual client they inverted the whole idea of development 
 they came to us and they said unlike normal developers they said we want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in louisville that 's our main goal and so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money they saw
 an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown  and the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma so they worked in
  and that pro forma led us to a mixed use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the art but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within 
 and it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of
  this is louisville 's skyline and i 'm going to take you through the various constraints that led to the project
  the physical constraints we actually had to operate on three discrete sites all of them well well smaller than the size of the building  
 we had to operate next to the new muhammad ali center  and respect it  
 we had to operate within the 100 year floodplain now this area floods three to four times a year  and there 's a levee behind our site similar to the ones that broke in new orleans 
  a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites so we 're starting to build a sort of
 nightmare of constraints in a bathtub  underneath the bathtub are the city 's main power lines  and there is a
 pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings 
 and a view corridor because this is the historic district that they didn 't want to obstruct with a new building 
 and now we 're going to add one
  one million square feet and if we did the traditional thing that one point one million square feet
 these are the different programs the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements  
 place them on sites and now we 'd have a really terrible situation a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods
  and then we would size all the other elements the different commercial elements hotel  luxury housing offices and so forth and dump it on top  and we
  create something that was unviable in fact and you know this this is called the time warner building 
 so our strategy was very simple  just lift the entire block  
 flip some of the elements over  reposition them
 so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown and make circulation connections and reroute the road  so that 's the basic concept and now i 'm going to show
  you what it leads to ok it
 seems a very formal willful gesture but something derived entirely out of the constraints and again when we unveiled it there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement 
 not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems 
 now within that center zone as i said we have the
  they told us the dimensions the sizes and so forth and we focused on taking all the public components the lobbies the bars
 everything that different commercial elements would have and combined it in the center 
 in the sort of subway map in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum  
 so it creates a situation like this where you have artists who can operate within
 an art space that also has an amazing view on the
 22nd floor  but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close  it allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen or to see the art and so forth
 it also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool so they 're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary
 gallery space  so how
  it 's very simple  it 's a chair so we begin
 by building the cores as
 we 're building the cores we build the contemporary art museum at grade  that allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency this is not a high budget building 
 the moment the cores get to mid level  we finish the art museum we put all the mechanical equipment in it and then we jack it up into the air this is how they build really large aircraft hangars for instance the ones that they did for the a380 
 finish the cores  finish the meat
 and you get something that looks like this
 now i only have about thirty seconds so i want to start an animation and we 'll conclude with that thank you chris asked me to add
 the theater is under construction and this project will start construction in about a year  and finish in two thousand and ten
