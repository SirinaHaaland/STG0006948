  we are
 stealing nature
 from our children now 
 when i say this i don 't mean that we are destroying nature that they will have wanted us to preserve 
 although that is unfortunately also the case what i mean here is that we 've started to define nature in a way that 's so
  purist and so strict
 that under the definition we 're creating for ourselves there won 't be any nature left for our children when they 're adults  
 but there 's a fix for this so let me explain 
 right now  humans use half of the world
 to live to grow their crops and their timber to pasture their animals  if you added up all the human beings we would weigh ten times as
  much as all the wild mammals put together  
 we cut roads through the forest 
 we have added little plastic particles to the sand on ocean beaches  we 've changed the chemistry of the soil with our artificial fertilizers  
 and of course  we 've changed the chemistry of the air  
  more carbon dioxide than if you were breathing in one thousand seven hundred and fifty 
 so all of these changes and many others have come to be kind of lumped together under this rubric of the anthropocene 
 and this is a term that some geologists are suggesting we should give to our current epoch  given how pervasive human influence has been over it now it
 's still just a proposed
  but i think it 's a helpful way to think about the magnitude of human influence on the planet  
 so where does this put nature  what counts as nature in a world where everything is influenced by humans  
 so twenty five years ago environmental writer bill mckibben
 said that because
 nature was a thing apart from man and because climate change meant that every centimeter of the earth was altered by man then nature was over
  his book the end of nature 
 i disagree with this i just disagree with this i disagree with this definition of nature  
 because fundamentally we are animals right like we
 evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
 a planet  and all the other plants and all the other microbes and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity
 man or woman 
 i think that nature is anywhere where life thrives  anywhere where there are multiple species together  anywhere that 's green and blue and thriving and filled with life and growing  
 and under that definition things look a little bit different 
 now  i understand that there are certain parts of this nature that speak to us in a special way
 places like yellowstone or the mongolian steppe or the great barrier reef or the serengeti places that we think of as kind of edenic representations of a nature before we screwed everything up  
 and in a way they are less impacted by our day to day activities many of these places have no
  roads or few roads so on like such  but ultimately even these edens are deeply
 influenced by humans  now let 's just take north  north america for example since that 's where we 're meeting 
 so between about fifteen thousand years ago when people first came here they started a process of interacting with the nature that led to the extinction of a big slew of large bodied animals 
 from the mastodon to the giant ground sloth
  all of these cool animals that unfortunately are no longer with us  
 and when those animals went extinct you know the ecosystems didn 't stand still massive ripple effects changed
 grasslands into forests changed the composition of forest from one tree to another 
 so even in these edens even in these perfect looking places that seem to remind us of a past before humans 
 we 're essentially looking at a humanized landscape 
 not just these prehistoric humans but
  historical humans indigenous people all the way up until the moment when the first
 colonizers showed up and the case is the same for the other continents as well humans have just been involved in nature
 in a very influential way for a very long time now just recently someone told me oh but there are still wild places
  i was just there 
 it 's awesome  national geographic sent me to man national park which is in the peruvian amazon  but it 's a big chunk of rainforest  uncleared no roads protected as a national park one of the most in fact biodiverse parks in the world  
 and when i got in there with my canoe  what did i find  
 but people 
 people have been living there for hundreds and thousands of years people live there and they don 't just
  float over the jungle they have a meaningful relationship with the landscape 
 they hunt  
 they grow crops  they domesticate crops they use the natural resources to build their houses to thatch their houses they even make pets out of animals that we consider to be wild animals
 these people
 are there and they 're interacting with the environment in a way that 's really meaningful and that you can see in the environment now i was with an
  anthropologist on this trip  and he told me as we were floating down the river he said there are no demographic voids in the amazon 
 this statement has really stuck with me because what it means is that the whole amazon is like this there 's people everywhere  
 and many other tropical forests are the same and not just tropical forests people have influenced ecosystems in the past  and they continue to influence them in
  present even in places where they 're harder to notice  so  if
 all of the definitions of nature that that we might want to use that involve
 it being untouched by humanity or not having people in it if all of those actually give us
 a result where we don 't have any nature  then maybe they 're the wrong definitions maybe we should define it by the presence of multiple
  species by the presence of a thriving life now if we do it that way what do we get 
 it 's this kind of miracle all of a sudden there 's nature all around us all of a sudden we see this monarch caterpillar
 munching on this plant and we realize that there it is and it 's in this empty lot in chattanooga and look at this empty lot i mean  there 's like probably
 a dozen minimum plant species growing there supporting all kinds of insect life 
 and this is a completely unmanaged space a completely wild space  this is
 a kind of wild nature right under our nose that we don 't even notice  and there 's an interesting little paradox too so this nature this
  suburban agricultural existence that flies under the radar  it 's arguably more wild than a national park  
 because national parks are very carefully managed in the 21st century  
 crater lake in southern oregon which is my closest national park is a beautiful example of a landscape that seems to be coming out of the
  but they 're managing it carefully one of the issues they have now is white bark pine die off white bark pine is a beautiful charismatic i 'll say it 's a charismatic
 that grows up at high altitude and it 's got all these problems right now with disease  there 's a blister rust that was introduced bark beetle 
 so to deal with this the park service has been planting rust resistant white bark pine seedlings in the park  
 even in areas that they are otherwise
  managing as wilderness  and they 're also putting out beetle repellent in key areas as i saw last time i went hiking there 
 and this kind of thing is really much more common than you would think national parks are heavily managed  
 the wildlife is kept to a certain population size and structure fires are suppressed  fires are started non native species are
  native species are reintroduced  and in fact i took a look and banff national park is doing all of the things i just listed suppressing fire having fire radio collaring wolves reintroducing bison 
 it takes a lot of work to make these places look untouched 
 and in a further irony these places that we love the most are the places that we love a little too hard sometimes
  lot of us like to go there and because we 're managing them to be stable in the face of a changing planet  they often are becoming more fragile over time 
 which means that they 're the absolute worst places to take your children on vacation 
 because you can 't do anything there you can 't climb the trees you can 't fish the fish you can 't make a campfire out in the middle of
  you can 't take home the pinecones there are so many rules and restrictions that from a child 's point of view  this is like the worst nature ever 
 because children
 don 't want to hike through a beautiful landscape for five hours and then look at a beautiful view that 's maybe what we want to do as adults but what kids want to do is hunker down in one spot
 and just tinker with it just work with it just pick it up build a house
 build a fort do something like that 
 additionally these sort of edenic places are often distant from where people live  and they 're expensive to get to they 're hard to visit so this means 
  that they 're only available to the elites and that 's a real problem the
  just staying inside  and when they asked them why what are the barriers to going outside the response of sixty one percent
 was there are no natural areas near my home 
 and this is crazy  this is just patently false  
 i mean seventy one percent of people in the us live within a 10 minute walk of a city park  
 and i 'm sure the figures are similar in other countries
  and that doesn 't even count your back garden  the urban creek the empty lot everybody lives near nature  
 every kid lives near nature we 've just somehow forgotten how to see it we 've spent too much time
 watching david attenborough documentaries where the nature is really sexy and we 've forgotten how to see the nature that is literally
  right outside our door the nature of the street tree  
 so here 's an example  philadelphia  there 's this cool elevated railway that you can see from the ground that 's been abandoned 
 now  this may sound like the beginning of the high line story in manhattan and it 's very similar except they haven 't developed this into a park yet although they 're working on it 
 so for now  it 's still this little sort of secret wilderness in the heart of philadelphia  and if you know
  the hole is in the chain link fence you can scramble up to the top and you can find this completely wild meadow just floating above the city of philadelphia  
 every single one of these plants grew from a seed that planted itself there  this is completely autonomous self willed nature  and it 's right in the middle of the city 
 and they 've sent people up there to do sort of biosurveys and there are over fifty plant species up there
  this is an ecosystem a functioning ecosystem  
 it 's creating soil it 's sequestering carbon there 's pollination going on i mean this is really an ecosystem  
 so scientists have started calling ecosystems like these novel ecosystems because they 're often dominated by non native species and because they 're just super weird they 're just 
  unlike anything we 've ever seen before for so long we dismissed all these novel ecosystems as trash 
  fields timber plantations that are not being managed on a day to day basis second growth forests generally the entire east coast where after agriculture moved west the forest sprung up  
 and of course  pretty much all of hawaii where novel ecosystems are the norm where exotic species totally dominate 
 this forest here has queensland maple it has sword ferns from southeast asia
  you can make your own novel ecosystem too it 's really simple you just stop mowing your lawn 
 ilkka hanski was an ecologist in finland and he did this experiment himself he just stopped mowing his lawn and after a few years  he had some grad students come and they did sort of a bio blitz of his backyard  
 and they found three hundred and seventy five plant species  including two endangered species
 when you 're up there on that
 on that future high line of philadelphia  
 surrounded by this wildness surrounded by this diversity this abundance this vibrance  
 you can look over the side and you can see a local playground for a local school  
 and that 's what it looks like 
 these children have that
  under my definition there 's a lot of the planet that counts as nature  but this would be one of the few places that wouldn 't count as nature there 's nothing there except humans  no other plants 
 no other animals 
 and what i really wanted to do was just like throw a ladder over the side and get all these kids to come up with me into this cool meadow 
 in a way i feel like this is the choice that faces us if we dismiss these new natures as not acceptable or trashy or no good 
 we might as well just pave them over
  world where everything is changing we need to be very careful about how we define nature 
 in order not to steal it from our children we have to do two things first we cannot define nature as that which is untouched  
 this never made any sense anyway nature has not been untouched for thousands of years  
 and it excludes most of the nature that most people can visit and have a relationship with 
 including
 only nature that children cannot touch which brings me to the second thing that we have to do which is that we have to let children touch nature  
 because that which is untouched is unloved 
 we face some pretty grim environmental challenges on this planet climate change
  is among them  there 's others too habitat loss is my favorite thing to freak out about in the middle of the
 but in order to solve them we need people smart dedicated people who care about nature  
 and the only way we 're going to raise up a generation of people who care about nature is by letting them touch nature  
 i have a fort theory of ecology
  fort theory of conservation every ecologist i know  every conservation biologist i know  every conservation professional i know  built forts when they were kids 
 if we have a generation that doesn 't know how to build a fort we 'll have a generation that doesn 't know how to care about nature  
 and i don 't want to be the one to tell this kid who is on a special program that takes philadelphia kids from poor neighborhoods and takes them to city parks 
 i don 't want to be the one to tell him that the flower he 's holding is a non native invasive weed that he should throw away
  as trash  i think i would much rather learn from this boy
 that no matter where this plant comes from it is beautiful and it deserves to be touched and appreciated thank
