  the substance of things unseen cities past and future  
 in oxford  perhaps we can use lewis carroll and look in the looking glass that is new york city
 to try and see our true selves  or perhaps pass through to another world
 or in the words of f scott fitzgerald 
 as the moon rose higher  the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually i became aware of the old island here that once flowered for dutch sailors ' eyes 
 a fresh green breast of the new world 
 my colleagues and i have been working for ten years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call the mannahatta project
  we 're trying to discover what henry hudson would have seen on the afternoon of september 12th one thousand six hundred and nine when he sailed into new york harbor and i 'd
 like to tell you the story in three acts  and if i have time still an epilogue  so act i a map found 
 so i didn 't grow up in new york i grew up out west in the sierra nevada mountains like you see here in the red rock canyon  and from these early experiences as a child i learned to love
  landscapes  and so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies i studied this emerging field of landscape ecology 
 landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals 
 this experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the wildlife conservation
  which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world  and over the last decade 
 i traveled to over forty countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos  
 but every time i would return from my trips i 'd return back to new york city and on my weekends i would go up just like all the other tourists to the top of the empire state building  and i 'd look down on this landscape on 
  these ecosystems and i 'd wonder how does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals how does it work to make habitat for animals like me
 i 'd go to times square and i 'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall  and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them 
 i 'd go to central park and see the rolling topography of central park come up against the abrupt and sheer topography of midtown manhattan  
 i started reading about the history and the geography in new
  i read that new york city was the first mega city a city city of ten million people or more in one thousand nine hundred and fifty  
 i started seeing paintings like this for those of you who are from new york this is 125th street under the west side highway 
 it was once a beach  and this painting has john james audubon the painter sitting on the rock  
 and it 's looking up on the wooded heights of washington heights to jeffrey 's hook where the george washington bridge goes across today  
 or this painting from the 1740s from greenwich village
 those are two students at king 's college later columbia university sitting on a hill  overlooking a valley  and so i 'd go down to greenwich village and i 'd look for this hill  
 and i couldn 't find it and i couldn 't find that palm tree what 's that palm tree doing there 
 so it was in the course of these investigations that i ran into a map and it 's this map you see here
  held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in this map isn 't from hudson 's time but from the american revolution one hundred and seventy years later made by british military cartographers during the occupation of new york city 
 and it 's a remarkable map it 's in the national archives here in kew  and it 's ten feet long and three and a half feet wide  and if i zoom in to lower manhattan
 you can see the extent of new york city as it was right at the end of the american revolution here 's bowling green and here 's broadway  and this is city
  park so the city basically extended to city hall park and just beyond it you can see
 features that have vanished things that have disappeared this is the collect pond  which was the fresh water source for new york city for its first two hundred years 
 and for the native americans for thousands of years before that 
 you can see the lispenard meadows draining down through here through what is tribeca now  and the beaches that come up from the battery all the way to
  was made for military reasons they 're mapping the roads the buildings these fortifications that they built 
 but they 're also mapping things of ecological interest  
 also military interest the hills the marshes 
 the streams this is richmond hill  and minetta water which used to run its way through greenwich village  
 or the the swamp at gramercy
  or murray hill  and this is the murrays ' house on murray hill  two hundred years ago  here is times square  
 the two streams that came together to make a wetland in times square as it was at the end of the american revolution  
 so i saw this remarkable map in a book  and i thought to myself 
 you know  if i could georeference this map if i could place this map in the grid of the city today  i could find these lost features of the city
 in the block by block geography that people know  the geography of where people go to work and where they go to live  and where they like to eat 
 so after some work we were able to georeference it which allows us to put the modern streets on the city and the buildings  
 and the open spaces  
 so that we can zoom in to where the collect pond is 
  digitize the collect pond
 and the streams and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today  so this is fun for finding where things are
 relative to the old topography  
 but i had another idea about this map if we take away the streets  and if we take away the
  we take away the open spaces then we could take this map  
 if we pull off the 18th century features we could drive it back in time we could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals 
 to the hills to the streams 
 to the the basic hydrology and shoreline to the beaches  the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape then
 if we added maps like the geology the
  and the surface geology  what the glaciers leave if we make the soil map with the seventeen soil classes that
 are defined by the national conservation service 
 if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were 
 then we can calculate the slopes we can calculate the aspect 
 we can calculate the winter wind exposure so
  the winter winds blow across the landscape the white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds  
 we compiled all the information about where the native americans were the lenape and we built a probability map of where they might have been 
 so the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on manhattan places that are close to water places that are near the harbor to fish 
 places protected from the winter winds
  we know that there was a lenape settlement
 down here by the collect pond 
 and we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn beans and squash the three sisters garden  
 so we built a model that explains where those fields might have been  
 and the old fields the successional fields that go and we might think of these as abandoned but in fact they 're grassland habitats for grassland birds and and plants 
 and they have become successional shrub lands  and these then mix
 to a map of all the ecological communities  and it turns out that manhattan
 had fifty five different ecosystem types you can think of these as neighborhoods as distinctive as tribeca and the upper east side
 and inwood that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities the beaches and fifty five is a
  manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than yosemite does than yellowstone  than amboseli 
 it was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity  
 so act ii a home reconstructed  
 so we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees 
 the  eighty five different kinds of fish that were on manhattan  the heath hens the species that aren 't there anymore
  the beavers on all the streams  the black bears and the native americans to study how they used and thought about their landscape 
 we wanted to try and map these and to do that what we did was we mapped their habitat needs where do they get their food where do they get their water where do they get their shelter  where do they get their reproductive resources 
  to an ecologist the intersection of these is habitat but to most people the intersection of these is their home  
 so we would read in field guides the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves you know 
 what beavers need is a slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows near the water that 's the best thing for a beaver  
 so we just started making a list here is the beaver and here is the stream and the aspen and the alder and the willow 
 as if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver  or the bog turtle needing wet
  meadows and insects and sunny places  
 or the bobcat needing rabbits and beavers and den sites 
 and rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs  
 but a beaver also needs things and that having it on either side means that we can link it together that we can create the network of the habitat
  we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist but you can look up what an aspen needs an aspen needs fire and dry soils 
 and you can look at what a wet meadow needs  
 and it need beavers to create the wetlands and maybe some other things 
 but you can also talk about sunny places so what does a sunny place need not habitat per se but what are the conditions that make it possible 
 or fire  or dry soils 
 and that you can put these on a grid that
  thousand columns long across the top and one thousand rows down the other way and then we can visualize this data like a network like a social network  
 and this is the network of all the habitat relationships of all the plants and animals on manhattan and everything they needed going back to the geology going back to time and space at the very core of the web  
 we call this the muir web  and if you zoom in on it it looks like this each point is a different species
  species or a different stream or a different soil type and those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together they are
 the connections that actually make nature resilient  and the structure of this is what makes nature work seen with all its parts  
 we call these muir webs after the scottish american naturalist john muir who said when we try to
 pick out anything by itself we find that it 's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken to everything in the universe 
 so then we took the muir webs and we took them back to the maps so if we wanted to go between 
  and lex and third maybe there was a stream in that block and these would be the kind of trees that might have been there  and the flowers
 and the lichens and the mosses  the butterflies the fish in the stream the birds in the trees maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there
  a black bear walked by and maybe native americans were there  and then we took this data 
 you can see this for yourself on our website you can zoom into any block on manhattan and see what might have been there four hundred years ago  
 and we used it to try and reveal a landscape
 here in act iii we used the tools they use in hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies  and we tried to use it to visualize third avenue
 so we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography we 'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters and illuminate the landscape 
 we would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities  and feed into that the map of the species so that we would actually take a photograph flying above times square looking toward the hudson river 
  waiting for hudson to come using this technology we can make these fantastic georeferenced views we can basically take a picture
  out of any window on manhattan and see what that landscape looked like four hundred years ago  this is the view from the east river looking up murray hill at where the united nations is today  
 this is the view looking down the hudson river with manhattan on the left and new jersey out on the right looking out toward the atlantic ocean 
 this is the view over times square  with the beaver pond there looking out toward the east 
  see the collect pond and lispenard marshes back behind we can see the fields that the native americans made  
 and we can see this in the geography of the city today  
 so when you 're watching law and order and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the new york court house right into the collect pond four hundred years ago  
  these images
 are the work of my friend and colleague mark boyer who is here in the audience today  and i 'd just like if you would give him a hand to call out for his fine work there
 is such power in bringing science and visualization together that we can create images like 
  this perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass  and even though i 've only had a brief time to speak
  you appreciate that mannahatta was a very special place the place that you see here on the left side was interconnected it was based on this diversity it had this resilience
 that is what we need in our modern world  but i wouldn 't have you think that i i don 't like the place on the right which i quite do i 've come to love the city and its kind of
  on density and how we 're connected together in fact that i see them as reflections of each other
 much as lewis carroll did in through the looking glass
 we can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time that they really are the same place that there is no way that cities can escape from nature and i think this is what what we 're learning about building cities in the
  so if you 'll allow me a brief epilogue  not about the past but about four hundred years from now 
 what we 're realizing is that cities are habitats for people and need to supply what people need a sense of home food water shelter  reproductive resources 
 and a sense of meaning this is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity  and so many of the talks here at ted are about
  about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways through technology through art through science 
 so much so that i think we focus so much on that side of our lives that we haven 't given enough attention to
 the food and the water and the shelter  and what we need to raise the kids 
 so how can we envision the city of the future  well what if we go to madison square park and we imagine it without
 all the cars
  and bicycles instead and large forests  and streams instead of sewers and storm drains 
 what if we imagined the upper east side with green roofs  and streams winding through the city 
 and windmills supplying the power we need  
 or if we imagine the new york city metropolitan area currently home to twelve million people but twelve million people in the future perhaps living at the density of manhattan 
  percent of the area with the areas in between covered by farmland  covered by wetlands  covered by the marshes we need
