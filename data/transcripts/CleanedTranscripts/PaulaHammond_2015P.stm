  affects all of us especially the ones that come back over and over again the highly invasive and 
 the ones that defy medical treatment even when we throw our best drugs at them engineering at the molecular level
  working at the smallest of scales can provide exciting new ways to fight the most aggressive forms of cancer 
 cancer is a very clever disease 
 there are some forms of cancer which fortunately  we 've learned how to address relatively well with known and established drugs and surgery 
 but there are some forms of cancer that
  't respond to these approaches and the tumor survives or comes back even after an onslaught of drugs 
 we can think of these very aggressive forms of cancer
 as kind of supervillains in a comic book they 're clever they 're adaptable and they 're very good at staying alive
  these days their superpowers come from a genetic mutation  
 the genes that are modified inside these tumor cells can enable and encode for new and unimagined modes of survival 
 allowing the cancer cell to live through even our best chemotherapy treatments 
  the cell to push the drug out 
 before the drug can have any effect  imagine the cell effectively spits out the drug 
 this is just one example of the many genetic tricks in the bag of our supervillain cancer all due to mutant genes  
  we have a supervillain
 with incredible superpowers  and we need a new and powerful mode of attack 
 actually we can turn off a gene the key is a set of molecules known 
 as sirna sirna are short sequences of genetic code
 that guide a cell to block a certain gene each sirna molecule can turn off a specific gene inside the cell
  for many years since its discovery scientists have been very excited about how we can apply these gene blockers in medicine  but there is a 
  works well inside the cell  but if it gets exposed to the enzymes that reside in our bloodstream or our tissues  it degrades within seconds
  it has to be packaged protected through its journey through the body on its way to the final target inside the cancer cell
 here 's our strategy first we 'll dose the cancer cell with sirna the gene blocker  and silence those survival genes  and then we 'll whop it with a chemo drug  
 but how do we carry that out using molecular engineering 
  that can travel through the bloodstream  it has to be tiny enough to get through the bloodstream it 's got to be small enough to penetrate the tumor tissue  
 and it 's got to be tiny enough to be taken up inside the cancer cell 
 to do this job well  it has to be about one one  one hundredth the size of a human hair  
 let 's take a closer look at how we can build this nanoparticle 
 first let 's start
  with the nanoparticle core  it 's a tiny capsule that contains the chemotherapy drug 
 this is the poison that will actually end the tumor cell 's life around this core
  nice protective layer of positively charged polymer  
 the two oppositely charged molecules stick together through charge attraction 
 and that provides us with a protective layer that prevents the sirna from degrading in the bloodstream 
 we 're almost done 
 but there is one more big obstacle we have to think about in fact it may be the biggest obstacle of all how do we deploy
 this superweapon i mean every good weapon needs to be targeted we have to target this superweapon to the supervillain cells that reside in the tumor 
 but our bodies have a natural immune defense system 
 cells that reside in the bloodstream and pick out things that don 't belong so that it can destroy or eliminate
  and guess what our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object 
 we have to sneak our nanoparticle past the tumor defense system  
 we have to get it past this mechanism of getting rid of the foreign object by disguising it 
 so
 we add one more negatively charged layer
 around this nanoparticle which serves two purposes 
  this outer layer is one of the naturally charged highly hydrated polysaccharides that resides in our body  
 it creates a cloud of water molecules around the nanoparticle
 that gives us an invisibility cloaking effect 
 this invisibility cloak allows the nanoparticle to travel through the bloodstream long and far enough to reach the tumor  without getting eliminated by the body
 molecules which bind specifically to our tumor cell  
 once bound the cancer cell takes up the nanoparticle 
 and now we have our nanoparticle inside the cancer cell and ready to deploy  
 alright i feel the same way
  it acts for hours  giving enough time to silence and block those survival genes  
 we have now disabled those genetic superpowers  what remains is a cancer cell with no special defenses  then the chemotherapy
 drug comes out of the core
 and destroys the tumor cell cleanly and efficiently 
 with sufficient gene blockers we can address many different kinds of mutations  
 allowing the chance to sweep out tumors without leaving behind any bad guys 
 how does our strategy work  
 we 've tested these nanostructure particles in animals using a highly aggressive form of triple negative breast cancer this
  triple negative breast cancer exhibits the gene that spits out cancer drug as soon as it is delivered usually doxorubicin
 let 's call it dox is the cancer drug that is the first line of treatment for breast cancer 
 so we first treated our animals with a dox core  dox only 
 the tumor slowed their rate of growth  but they still grew rapidly  doubling in
  size over a period of two weeks  then we tried our combination 
  particle with sirna against the chemo pump  plus  we have the dox in the core and look we found that not only did the tumors stop growing  they actually decreased in
  and were eliminated in some cases the tumors were actually regressing 
 what 's great about this approach is that it can be personalized we can add many different layers of 
 to address different mutations and tumor defense mechanisms  and we can put different drugs into the nanoparticle core as doctors
  learn how to test patients and understand certain tumor genetic types 
 they can help us determine which patients can benefit from this strategy and which gene blockers we can use 
 ovarian cancer strikes a special chord with me  
 it is a very aggressive cancer in part because it 's discovered at very late stages when it 's highly advanced and there are a number of genetic mutations
 after the first round of chemotherapy this cancer comes back for seventy five percent of patients and it usually comes back in 
 ovarian cancer is one of the biggest supervillains out there and we 're now directing our superweapon toward its defeat 
 as a researcher  i usually don 't get to work with patients
  but i recently met a mother who is an ovarian cancer survivor mimi and her daughter paige 
 i was deeply inspired by the optimism and strength
 that both mother and daughter displayed
 and by their story of courage and support at this event  we spoke about the different technologies directed at cancer
 and mimi was in tears as she explained how learning about these efforts gives her hope for future generations including her own daughter 
 this really touched me it 's not just about building really elegant science it 's about changing people 's lives it
 's about understanding the power of engineering on the scale of molecules i know that as students
  like paige move forward in their careers 
 they 'll open new possibilities in addressing some of the big health problems in the world including ovarian cancer neurological disorders  infectious disease
 just as chemical engineering has found a way to open doors for me and
 has provided a way of engineering on the tiniest scale that of molecules to heal
  on the human scale  thank you
