  thank you very much good evening some of you may have noticed that my last name is nutt  
 and if you did you are forgiven for wondering how a nutt managed to end up in a war zone
  i actually was offered right out of medical school and accepted a volunteer contract
  to work with unicef in  war torn somalia that was worth one dollar 
 and you see i had to be paid this dollar in the event that the un needed to issue an evacuation order so that i would be covered  
 i was after all heading into one of the world 's most dangerous places 
 and
 by now some of you may be asking yourselves and i just want to reassure you that i did get half the money up front
 this is how with fifty cents in my pocket  i ended up in baidoa somalia  
 journalists called it the city of death and they called it the city of death because three hundred thousand people had lost their lives there
 three hundred thousand people mostly as a result of
  part of a team that was tasked with trying to figure out how best to respond to this humanitarian catastrophe 
 it was right on the heels of the rwandan genocide  and aid money to the region was drying up many aid organizations unfortunately had been forced to close their doors  
 and so the question that i was asked to specifically help answer
  which is one that aid workers ask themselves in war zones the world over is
 what the hell do we do now  
 you know the security environment in somalia at that moment in time and nothing has really changed too much can best be described as mad max by way of a clockwork orange 
 and i remember very distinctly a couple of days after my arrival i went up to a feeding clinic
 there were dozens of women who were standing in line and they were clutching their infants very close
 about twenty minutes into this conversation i was having with this one young woman i leaned forward
 and tried to put my finger in the palm of her baby 's hand 
 and when i did this i discovered that her baby was already in rigor  she was
 stiff  and her little lifeless hand was curled into itself she had died
 hours before
 of malnutrition and dehydration i later learned that as her baby was dying this young woman
 had been held for two days by some teenage boys who were armed with kalashnikov rifles
 and they were trying to shake her down for more money money she very clearly did not have and this is a scene that i have confronted
 in war zones the world over places where kids  some as young as eight they are this big
 and those kids they have never been to
  but they have fought and they have killed
 with automatic
 rifles 
 is this just the way the world is 
 some will you tell you that war is unavoidably human after all it is as old as existence itself
 we say never again and yet it happens again and again
 and again  but i will tell
  you that i have seen the absolute worst
 of what we as human beings are capable of doing to one another  
 and yet i still believe a different outcome is possible do you want
 to know why 
 because over twenty years of doing this work going in and out of war zones around the world  i have come to understand
  are aspects of this problem that we all of us as people occupying this shared space 
 that we can change not through force or coercion or invasion  
 but by simply looking at all of the options available to us
 and choosing the ones that favor peace at the expense of war  instead of war at the expense
 of peace how so well i want you to consider this there are at least eight hundred million
 small arms and light weapons in circulation in the world today 
 the vast majority of civilians like that young baby 
 who are dying in war zones around the world are dying at the hands of various armed groups who rely on a
 near infinite supply of cheap  easy and efficient weapons to rape  threaten  intimidate and brutalize those civilians at every turn  
 how cheap  well in some parts of the world you can buy an 
 for as little as ten dollars in many places in which i have worked  it is easier to get
  access to an automatic rifle
 than it is to get access to clean drinking water  and so now the important part 
 can anything be done about this 
 to answer that question let 's take a look at this map of the world  
 and now let 's add in all of the countries that are currently at war 
 and the number of people who have
  either died or have been displaced as a result of that violence it is a staggering number more than forty million people but you
 will also notice something else about this map you will notice that most of those countries are in the global south 
 now let 's look at the countries that are the world 's top twenty exporters of small arms in the world 
 and what do we notice well you see them
  green  you will notice that those are mostly countries in the global north  primarily western countries what does this tell us this tells us that most of the people who are dying in war
 are living in poor countries  and yet most of the people who are profiting from war
 are living in rich countries people like you and me  and then what if we go beyond small arms for a second
 if we look at all weapons in circulation in the world who does the biggest business well
 roughly eighty percent of those weapons come from none other than the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany it 's
 shocking isn 't it now some of you might be saying at this moment in time
  but you might be saying to yourselves you know all of these weapons in war zones they 're not a cause  but an effect of the violence that plagues them each and every single day you know places like iraq 
  and afghanistan where they need these weapons to be able to maintain law and order promote peace and security to combat terror
  groups surely this is a good thing 
 let 's take a look at that assumption for just one moment because you see there has been a boom in the small arms trade since the start of the war on terror in fact it is a business that has grown threefold over the past fifteen years  
 and now let 's compare that to the number of people who have directly died in armed conflict around the
  world in that same period
 what do you notice well you notice that in fact that also goes up roughly three to fourfold they basically go up and end at the same point 
 now we can have a circular argument here about whether this increase in fatalities is a response to the increase of small arms
  or the other way around but here 's what we should really take away from this what we should take away from this is that this is a relationship worth
 scrutinizing  especially when you consider that small arms that were shipped to iraq
 for use by the iraqi army or to syria for so called moderate opposition fighters that those arms many of them are now in the hands of
  or when you consider that arms that were shipped to libya are now actively drifting across the sahel  
 and ending up with groups like boko haram and al qaeda and other militant groups 
 and therein lies the problem because you see small arms anywhere
 are a menace
 everywhere  because their first stop is rarely their last
  spending on war per person per year now amounts to about two hundred and 
 dollars two hundred and forty nine dollars per person 
 which is roughly twelve times what we spend on foreign aid money that is used to educate and vaccinate children and combat malnutrition in the global south
  but we can shift
 that
 balance how do we do this well it is essentially a problem of both supply and demand so we can tackle it from both sides 
 on the supply side we can push our governments to adopt international arms transparency mechanisms like the arms trade treaty 
  which makes it so that rich countries have to be more accountable for where their arms are going and what their arms might be used for 
  the largest arms exporting country in the world by far 
 president obama has rightly signed the arms trade treaty  but none of it takes effect it isn 't binding  until it is approved and ratified by the senate 
 this is where we need to make our voices heard
  the curbing of small arms it 's not going to solve the problem of war increased control mechanisms won 't solve that problem 
 but it 's an important step in the right direction and it 's up to all of us who live in those rich countries to make change here
 what about on the demand side  you know  there are generations around the world who are being lost to war
  it is possible to disrupt that cycle of violence with investments in education in strengthening the rule of law and in economic development especially for women i have personally 
  seen just how incredibly powerful those kinds of efforts can be around the world  
  how much you give  
 regular contributions like monthly contributions are a far more effective way of giving because they allow humanitarian organizations to properly plan and be invested over the long term 
 and to be present in the lives of families
 who have been affected by war
  that many of us frankly all too quickly forget
 when i first got on that plane for somalia  as a young doctor  
 i had no idea what it meant to live with war  
 but i can tell you that i know what it means now  and i know what it means
 to lie in bed
  automatic gunfire and wonder with absolute dread
 how many minutes i have left until it will be right on top of me 
 i can tell you that it is a terrifying and agonizing fear one that millions of people around the world are forced to confront
 each and every single day
  especially children over the years of doing this work  unfortunately war has killed
 far too many people close to me  and on at least a couple of occasions war has very nearly killed me as well  
 but
  is why i get up and do what i do every single day 
 that we can make different choices here 
 because you see war is ours as human beings we buy it  sell it  spread it
 and wage it we are therefore not powerless to solve it on the contrary we
 are the only ones who can thank you very much and i want to wish you the
