  universe is teeming with planets  
 i want us in the next decade to build a space telescope that 'll be able to image an earth about another star and figure out whether it can harbor life  
 my colleagues at the nasa jet propulsion laboratory at princeton and i are working on technology
 that will be able to do just that in the coming years
 astronomers now believe that every star in the galaxy has a planet  
 and they speculate that up to one fifth of them have an earth like planet that might be able to harbor life  but we haven 't seen any of them we 've only detected them indirectly 
 this is nasa 's famous picture of the pale blue
  it was taken by the voyager spacecraft in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety when they turned it around as it was exiting the solar system to take a picture of the earth from six billion kilometers away  
 i want to take that of an earth like planet about another star 
 why haven 't we done that why is that hard  well to see let 's imagine we take the hubble space telescope and we turn it around and we move it out to the orbit of mars we 'll see something like that a slightly
 blurry picture of the earth because we 're a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of mars  
 now let 's move ten times further away  here we are at the orbit of uranus it 's gotten smaller it 's got less detail less resolve we can still see the little moon but let 's go ten times further away again 
 here we are at the edge of the solar system out at the kuiper belt  now it 's not resolved at all it 's that pale blue dot of carl sagan 's but let 's move yet again ten times further
  here we are out at the oort cloud outside the solar system and we 're starting to see the sun move into the field of view and get into where the planet is one more time ten times further away  now 
 we 're at alpha centauri our nearest neighbor star and the planet is gone all we 're seeing is the big beaming image of the star that 's ten billion times brighter than the planet  which should be in that little red circle  that 's what we want to see that 's why it 's hard the light from the star
  it 's scattering inside the telescope creating that very bright image that washes out the planet so to see the planet  we have to do something about all of that light we have to get rid of it i have a lot 
  of colleagues working on really amazing technologies to do that but i want to tell you about one today that i think is the coolest and probably the most likely to get us an earth in the next decade it was first suggested by lyman spitzer the father of the space telescope
  and he took his inspiration from an eclipse you
 've all seen that that 's a solar eclipse the moon has moved in front of the sun it blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it it would be the same thing if i put my thumb up and 
  blocked that spotlight that 's getting right in my eye  i can see you in the back row  well what 's going on well the moon
  removed and we can see that dim fine structure in the corona 
 spitzer 's suggestion was we do this in space  we build a big screen we fly it in space  we put it up in front of the star we block out most of the light we fly a space 
  telescope in that shadow that 's created and boom we get to see planets  well that would look something like this 
  well because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope it 's like water bending around a rock in a stream  and 
  all that light just destroys the shadow it 's a terrible shadow  and we can 't see planets  but spitzer actually knew the answer if we can feather the edges soften those edges so we can control
  well then we can see a planet  and in the last ten years or so we 've come up with optimal solutions for doing that it looks something like
 that 
 we call that our flower petal starshade if we make the edges of those petals exactly right if we control their shape we can control diffraction  and now we have a great shadow 
  it 's about ten billion times dimmer than it was before and we can see the planets beam out just like that
  of course has to be bigger than my thumb that starshade is about the size of half a football field and it has to fly fifty thousand kilometers away from the telescope that has to be held right in its shadow  and then we can see those planets this sounds formidable  but
 brilliant engineers colleagues of mine at jpl came up with a fabulous design for how to do that and it looks like this it
 starts wrapped around a hub it separates from the telescope 
  they open up the telescope turns around then you 'll see it flip and fly out that fifty thousand kilometers away from the telescope  it 's going to move in front of the star
 just like that  creates a wonderful shadow  boom  we get planets orbiting about it thank
 that 's not science fiction
  we 've been working on this for the last five or six years last summer we did a really cool test out in california at northrop grumman so those are four petals this is a sub scale
  star shade it 's about half the size of the one you just saw you 'll see the petals unfurl those four petals were built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at jpl  now you 're seeing it deploy 
 those petals have to rotate into place the base of those petals has to go to the same place every time to within a tenth of a millimeter  we ran this test sixteen times
  sixteen times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter this has to be done very precisely but if we can do this if we can build this technology if we can get it into space 
  you might see something like this that 's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the hubble space telescope 
  put it out there fly an occulter in front of it what we might see is something like that that 's a family portrait of our solar system but not ours we 're hoping it 'll be someone else 's solar system
 as seen through an 
  like that you can see jupiter you can see saturn uranus neptune  and right there in the center next to the residual light is that pale blue dot that 's earth we want to see that  see if there 's water 
  oxygen  ozone the things that might tell us that it could harbor life  i think this is the coolest possible science that
  's why i got into doing this because i think that will change the world that will change everything when we see that  thank you
