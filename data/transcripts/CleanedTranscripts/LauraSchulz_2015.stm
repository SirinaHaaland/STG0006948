  mark twain summed up what i take to be one of the fundamental problems of cognitive science with a single witticism 
 he said there 's something fascinating about science  one gets such wholesale returns of conjecture
 out of such a trifling investment in fact
 twain meant it as a joke of course but he 's right there 's something fascinating about science 
 from a few bones  we infer the existence of dinosuars 
 from spectral lines  the composition of nebulae 
 from fruit flies  
  the mechanisms of heredity 
 and from reconstructed images of blood flowing through the brain  
 or in my case from the behavior of very young children 
 we try to say something about the fundamental mechanisms of human cognition 
 in particular in my lab in the department of brain and cognitive sciences at mit  
 i have spent the past decade trying to understand the mystery of how children learn so much from so little so quickly
 because it turns out that the fascinating thing about science is also a fascinating thing about children 
 which to put a gentler spin on mark twain is precisely their ability to draw rich abstract inferences rapidly and accurately
 from sparse noisy data  i 'm going to give you just two examples today one is about a problem of generalization
  and the other is about a problem of causal reasoning  
 and although i 'm going to talk about work in my lab this work is inspired by and indebted to a field i 'm grateful to mentors colleagues and collaborators around the world  
 let me start with the problem of generalization 
 generalizing from small samples of data is the bread and butter of science  we poll a tiny fraction of the electorate and we predict the
  outcome of national elections we see how a handful of patients responds to treatment in a clinical trial  and we bring drugs to a national market  
 but this only works if our sample is randomly drawn from the population if our sample is cherry picked in some way
 say we poll only urban voters or say in our clinical trials for treatments for heart disease  we include only men
  may not generalize to the broader population  
 so scientists care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not but what does that have to do with babies well
 babies have to generalize from small samples of data all the time  
 they see a few rubber ducks and learn that they float  or a few balls and learn that they
  and they develop expectations about ducks and balls
 that they 're going to extend to rubber ducks and balls for the rest of their lives
  and the kinds of generalizations babies have to make about ducks and balls they have to make about almost everything shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings  
 so do babies care whether the tiny bit of evidence they see is plausibly representative of a larger population
  let 's find out 
 i 'm going to show you two movies  one from each of two conditions of an experiment  
 and because you 're going to see just two movies you 're going to see just two babies and any two babies differ from each other in innumerable ways  
 but these babies of course here stand in for groups of babies and the differences you 're going to see represent average group differences in babies ' behavior across
  in each movie you 're going to see a baby doing maybe just exactly what you might expect a baby to do and we can hardly make babies more magical than they already are 
 but to my mind the magical thing 
 and what i want you to pay attention to is the contrast between these two conditions  because the only thing that differs between these two movies is the statistical
  evidence the babies are going to observe  we 're going to show babies a box of blue and yellow balls and my 
  now colleague at stanford 
  going to pull three blue balls in a row out of this box and when she pulls those balls out she 's going to squeeze them  and the balls are going to squeak  
 and if you 're a baby that 's like a ted talk  it doesn 't get better than that
  but the important point is it 's really easy to pull three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly blue balls  you could do that with your eyes closed it 's plausibly a random sample from this population  
 and if you can reach into a box at random and pull out things that squeak then maybe everything in the box squeaks  
 so maybe babies should expect those yellow balls to squeak as well 
  those yellow balls have funny sticks on the end so babies could do other things with them if they wanted to they could pound them or whack them but let 's see what the baby does
  this one 's for you you can go ahead and play
  i don 't even have to talk right all
 right it 's nice that babies will generalize properties of blue balls to yellow balls and it 's impressive that babies can learn from imitating us  but we 've known those things about babies for a very long time  
 the really interesting question is what happens when we show babies exactly the same thing
  and we can ensure it 's exactly the same because we have a secret compartment and we actually pull the balls from there 
 but this time  all we change is the apparent population from which that evidence was drawn 
 this time  we 're going to show babies three blue balls pulled out of a box of mostly yellow balls 
 and guess what you [ probably won 't ] randomly draw three blue balls in a row out of a box of mostly yellow
  plausibly randomly sampled evidence 
 that evidence suggests that maybe hyowon was deliberately sampling the blue balls  maybe there 's something special about the blue balls  
 maybe only the blue balls squeak let
 's see what the baby does
  so you just saw two 15 month old babies do entirely different things based only on the probability of the sample they observed
  let me show you the experimental results  
 on the vertical axis you 'll see the percentage of babies who squeezed the ball in each condition 
 and as you 'll see babies are much more likely to generalize the evidence when it 's plausibly representative of the population
 than when the evidence is clearly cherry picked and this leads to a fun prediction
  suppose you pulled just one blue ball out of the mostly yellow box you [ probably
 won 't ] pull three blue balls in a row at random out of a yellow box but you could randomly sample just one blue ball that 's not an improbable sample  
 and if you could reach into a box at random and pull out something that squeaks  maybe everything in the box squeaks  
 so even though babies are going to see much less evidence for squeaking and have many fewer actions to imitate in this one ball condition than in the condition you
  just saw  we predicted that babies themselves would squeeze more and that 's exactly what 
  babies in this respect like scientists 
 care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not and they use this to develop expectations about the world what squeaks and what doesn 't 
 what to explore
 and what to ignore
  let me show you another example now this time about a problem of causal reasoning  
 and it starts with a problem of confounded evidence that all of us have which is that we are part of the world  
 and this might not seem like a problem to you  but like most problems it 's only a problem when things go wrong 
 take this baby for instance things are going wrong for him he would like to make this toy go and he can
 and there 's two possibilities broadly  maybe he 's doing something wrong 
 or maybe there 's something wrong with the toy  
 so in this next experiment  we 're going to give babies just a tiny bit of statistical data supporting one hypothesis over the other and we 're going to see if babies can use that
 to make different decisions about what to do here 's the setup
 hyowon is going to try to make the toy go and succeed 
 i am then going to try twice and fail both times  
 and then hyowon is going to try again and succeed  and this roughly sums up my relationship to my graduate students in technology across the
  but the important point here is it provides a little bit of evidence that the problem isn 't with the toy it 's with the person  
 some people can make this toy go and some can 't  
 now when the baby gets the toy he 's going to have a choice  his mom is right there so he can go ahead and hand off the toy and change the person  
 but there 's also going to be another toy at the end of that cloth  and
 can pull the cloth towards him and change the toy  so let 's see what the baby does
  see these toys yeah i 'm going to put this one over here and i 'm going to give this one to you you can go ahead and play
  of course babies love their mommies of course babies give toys to their mommies when they can 't make them work 
 so again the really important question is what happens when we change the statistical data ever so slightly 
 this time babies are going to
  the toy work and fail in exactly the same order but we 're changing the distribution of evidence this time hyowon is going to succeed once and fail once and so am i 
 and this suggests it doesn 't matter who tries this toy the toy is broken it doesn 't work all the time 
 again the baby 's going to have a choice her mom is right next to her so she can change the person  and there 's going to be another toy at the end of the cloth  
  let me try one more time
  to put this one over here  and i 'm going to give this one to you
  let me show you the experimental results  
 on the vertical axis you 'll see the distribution of children 's choices in each condition 
 and you 'll see that the distribution of the choices children make depends on the evidence they observe  
 so in the second year of life babies can use a tiny bit of statistical data to
  decide between two fundamentally different strategies for acting in the world  asking for help and exploring  
 i 've just shown you two laboratory experiments out of literally hundreds in the field that make similar points  
 because the really critical point
 is that children 's
  ability to make rich inferences from sparse data underlies all the 
 cultural learning that we do children learn about new tools from just a few examples  they learn new causal relationships
 from just a few examples they even learn new words in this case in american sign language 
 i want to close with just two points 
 if you 've been following my world the field of brain and
  sciences for the past few years three big ideas will have come to your attention the first is that this is the era of the brain 
 and indeed there have been staggering discoveries in neuroscience localizing functionally specialized regions of cortex turning mouse brains transparent 
 activating neurons with
  a second big idea
 is that this is the era of big data and machine learning 
 and machine learning promises to revolutionize our understanding of everything from social networks to epidemiology  
 and maybe as it tackles problems of scene understanding and natural language processing to tell us something about human cognition  
 and the final big idea you 'll have heard is that maybe it 's a good idea we 're going to know so much about brains and
  have so much access to big data  because left to our own devices 
 humans are fallible we take shortcuts  we err  we make mistakes  we 're biased  
 and in innumerable ways 
 we get the world wrong  
 i think these are all important stories  and they have a lot to tell us about what it means to be
  human but i want you to note that today i told you a very different story 
 it 's a story about minds and not brains 
 and in particular it 's a story about the kinds of computations that uniquely human minds can perform which involve rich structured knowledge and the ability to learn from small amounts of data 
 the evidence of just a few examples
 and fundamentally it 's a story about how starting as very small children
 and continuing out all the way to the greatest accomplishments of our culture  
 we get the world right  
 folks human minds do not only learn from small amounts of data human minds think of altogether new ideas
  ideas human minds generate research and discovery  and human minds generate art and literature and poetry and theater  
 and human minds take care of other humans our old our young our sick  
 we even heal them 
 in the years to come we 're going to see technological innovations beyond anything i can even envision
 but we are very unlikely to see anything even approximating the computational power of a human child
 in my lifetime
 or in yours 
 if we invest in these most powerful learners and their development in babies and children
 and mothers and fathers and caregivers and teachers
  teachers
 the ways we invest in our other most powerful and elegant forms of technology engineering and design  
 we will not just be dreaming of a better future  we will be planning for one  thank you very much
  the research is insane  i mean who would design an experiment like that 
 i 've seen that a couple of times and i still don 't honestly believe that that can truly be happening but
 other people have done similar experiments it checks out the babies really are that genius ls you know they look really impressive in our experiments but think about what they look like in real
  it starts out as a baby eighteen months later  it 's talking to you and babies ' first words aren 't just things like balls and ducks they 're things like all gone which refer to disappearance or uh oh 
 which refer to unintentional actions 
 it has to be that powerful it has to be much more powerful than anything i showed you  they 're figuring out the entire world a four year old can talk to you about almost anything
  how quirky and buggy our minds are that behavioral economics and the whole theories behind that that we 're not rational agents  
 you 're really saying that the bigger story is is how extraordinary and there really is
 genius there that is underappreciated ls 
 one of my favorite quotes in psychology comes from the social psychologist solomon asch and he said the fundamental task of psychology is to remove the veil of
 there are
  orders of magnitude more decisions you make every day that get the world right  you know about objects and their properties  you know them when they 're occluded you know them in the dark  you can walk through rooms you can figure out what 
  other people are thinking you can talk to them  you can navigate space you know about numbers you know causal relationships  you know about moral reasoning
  you do this effortlessly so we don 't see it but that is how we get the world right and it 's a remarkable and very difficult to understand accomplishment ca
 i suspect there are people in the audience who have this view of accelerating technological power who might dispute your statement that never in our lifetimes will a computer do what  a three year old child can do  
 what 's clear is that in any scenario our machines have so much to learn from our toddlers 
 ls i think so you 'll have some
  machine learning folks up here i mean you should never bet against babies or chimpanzees or technology
 as a matter of practice but
 it 's not just a difference in quantity  it 's a difference in kind we have incredibly powerful computers and they do do amazingly sophisticated things
  often with very big amounts of data
  human minds do  i think something quite different and i think it 's the structured hierarchical nature of human knowledge that remains a real challenge ca 
 laura schulz wonderful food for thought thank you so much
