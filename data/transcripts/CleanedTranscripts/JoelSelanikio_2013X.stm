  there 's an old joke about a cop who 's walking his beat in the middle of the night  and he comes across a guy under a street lamp who 's looking at the ground and moving from side to side and the cop asks him
 what he 's doing the guys says he 's looking for his keys  so the cop
 takes his time and looks over and kind of makes a little matrix and looks for about
 two three minutes  
 no keys the cop says are you sure  hey buddy are you sure you lost your keys here 
 and the guy says no actually i lost them down at the other end of the street  but the light is better here 
 there 's a concept that people talk about nowadays called big data and what they 're talking about is all of the information that we 're generating through our interaction with and over the internet
 everything from facebook and twitter to music downloads movies streaming all this kind of stuff the live streaming of ted  
 and the folks who work with big data for them they talk about that their biggest problem is we have so much information  
 the biggest problem is how do we organize all that information  
 i can tell you that working in global health
  that is not
 our biggest problem because for us even though the light is better on the internet  
 the data that would help us solve the problems we 're trying to solve is not actually present on the internet  
 so we don 't know for example how many people right now are being affected by disasters or by conflict situations we don 't know for really basically any of the clinics in the developing
 which ones have medicines and which ones don 't we have no idea of what the supply chain is for those clinics 
 we don 't know and this is really amazing to me we we don 't know how many children were born or how many children there are in bolivia or botswana or bhutan 
 we don 't know how many kids died last week in any of those countries  we don 't know
 the needs of the elderly the mentally ill for all of these different
 critically important problems or critically important areas that we want to solve
  in  we basically know nothing at all 
 and part of the reason
 why we don 't know anything at all is that the information technology systems that we use in global health to find the data to solve these problems
 is what you see here  this is about a 5 000 year old technology some of you may have used it before it 's kind of on its way out now but we still use it for ninety nine percent of our stuff
  this is a paper form  
 and what you 're looking at is a paper form in the hand of a ministry of health nurse in indonesia who is tramping out across the countryside in indonesia on i 'm sure a very hot and humid day  
 and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months 
 knocking on the doors and
  like to ask you some questions do you have any children were your children vaccinated 
 because the only way we can actually find out how many children were vaccinated in the country of indonesia 
 what percentage were vaccinated is actually not on the internet but by going out and knocking on doors
  sometimes tens of thousands of doors  sometimes it takes months to even years to do something like this
  you know a census of indonesia would probably take two years to accomplish and the problem of course with all of this
 with all those paper forms and i 'm telling you we have paper forms for every possible thing we have paper forms for vaccination surveys  we have paper forms to track people who come into clinics  
  we have paper forms to track drug supplies  blood supplies all these different paper forms
  a truckful of data
 this is the data from a single vaccination coverage survey in a single district in the country of zambia from a few years ago that i participated in 
 the only thing anyone was trying to find out is what percentage of zambian children are vaccinated and this is the data  collected on paper over
  from a single district  which is something like a county in the united states you can imagine that for the entire country of zambia answering just that single question 
 looks something like this
 truck after truck after truck filled with stack after stack after stack of data 
 and what makes it even worse is that that 's just the beginning  because once you 've collected all that data of course someone some unfortunate person is going to have to type that into a computer when i was a graduate student
  actually was that unfortunate person sometimes i can tell you i often wasn 't really paying attention  
 i probably made a lot of mistakes when i did it that no one ever discovered so data quality goes down 
 but eventually that data hopefully gets typed into a computer  and someone can begin to analyze it and once they have an analysis and a report  hopefully then you can take the results of that data collection and use it to vaccinate children better because if there 's
 worse in the field of global public health i don 't know what 's worse than allowing children on this planet to die of  vaccine preventable diseases
 diseases for which the vaccine costs a dollar  and millions of children die of these diseases every year  
 and the fact is millions is a is a gross estimate because we don 't really know
 how many kids die each year of this what makes it even more frustrating is that
 the data entry part the part that i used to do as a grad student can take sometimes six months  
 sometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer  
 and sometimes actually not infrequently it actually never happens now try and wrap your head around that for a second  
 you just had teams of hundreds of people they went out into the field to answer a particular question  you probably spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on fuel
 and photocopying and per diem
  diem 
 and then for some reason momentum is lost or there 's no money left 
 and all of that comes to nothing 
 because no one actually types it into the computer at all the process just stops happens all the time this is what we base our decisions on in global health 
 little data  old data  no data 
  i began to think about ways in which we could improve this process now one thousand nine hundred and ninety five obviously that was quite a long time ago it kind of frightens me to think of how long ago that was 
 the top movie of the year was die hard with a vengeance as you can see bruce willis had a lot more hair back then i was working in the centers for disease control and
 i had a lot more hair back then as well  but to me the most significant thing that i saw in
  the ultimate elite mobile device
 it wasn 't an iphone it wasn 't a galaxy phone it was a palmpilot  and when i saw the palmpilot for the first time i thought 
 why can 't we put the forms on these palmpilots 
 and go out into the field just carrying one palmpilot which can hold the capacity of tens of thousands of paper forms
  we try to do that because if we can do that if we can actually just collect the data electronically digitally  from the very beginning  
 we can just put a shortcut right through that whole process of
 of typing of having somebody type that stuff into the computer  we can skip straight to the analysis and then straight to the use of the data to actually save lives so that 's what i began to do  working at
  i began to travel to different programs around the world and to train them in using
 palmpilots to do data collection  instead of using paper  and it actually worked great  it worked exactly as well as anybody would have predicted 
 what do you know  digital data collection is actually more efficient than collecting on paper
  while i was doing it my business partner rose who 's here with with her husband matthew here in the audience  
 rose was out doing similar stuff for the american red cross the problem was after a few years of doing that i realized
 i had been to maybe six or seven programs
 and i thought  you know if i keep this up at this pace over my whole career maybe i 'm going to go to maybe twenty or thirty programs  
 but the problem is twenty or thirty programs like training twenty or thirty programs to use this technology that is a tiny drop in the bucket  the demand for
  the need for data to run better programs just within health not to mention all of the other fields in developing countries is enormous there are millions and millions and millions of programs millions of clinics that need to track drugs 
 millions of vaccine programs there are schools that need to track attendance there are all these different things
 for us to get the data that we need to do and i realized
 if i kept up kept up the way that i was doing i was basically hardly going to make any impact
  by the end of my career  
 and so i began to rack my brain trying to think about 
 what was the process that i was doing how was i training folks and what were the bottlenecks and what were the the obstacles to doing it faster and to doing it more efficiently 
 and unfortunately after thinking about this for some time 
 i identified the main obstacle 
 and the main obstacle it turned out and this is a sad realization the main obstacle was
  me  so what do i mean by that i had developed a process whereby i was the center of the universe of this technology
  if you wanted to use this technology you had to get in touch with me that means you had to know i existed  then you had to find the money to pay for me to fly out to your country
 and the money to pay for my hotel and my per diem and my daily rate  so you could be talking about
 20 or thirty thousand dollars if i actually had the time or it fit my schedule and i wasn 't on vacation
 the point is that anything any system that depends on a single human being or two or three or five human beings it just doesn 't scale 
 and this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology and we need to scale it now  and so i began to think of ways in which i could basically take myself out of the picture 
 and
  you know i was thinking 
 how could i take myself out of the picture for quite some time
 i 'd been trained that the way you distribute technology within international development is always consultant based it 's always guys that look pretty much like me  flying 
  from countries that look pretty much like this to other countries with people with darker skin 
  you spend time and you spend
 per diem and you spend for a hotel and all that stuff
 as far as i knew that was the only way you could distribute technology  and i couldn 't figure out a way around it  but the miracle that happened
 i 'm going to call it hotmail for short
 you may not think of hotmail as being miraculous  but for me it was miraculous because i noticed just as i was wrestling with this problem
  mostly at the time i noticed that every  sub saharan african health worker that i was working with
 had a hotmail account  and it struck me wait a minute
 i know the the hotmail people surely didn 't fly to the ministry of health in kenya
 to train people in how to use hotmail  so these guys are distributing technology getting software capacity out there but they 're not actually flying around the world
  to think about this more while i was thinking about it people started using even more things like this just as we were they started using linkedin and flickr and gmail and google maps all these things 
 of course  all of these things are cloud based and don 't require any training they don 't require any programmers  they don 't require consultants because the business model for all these businesses
  training  you just have to hear about it and go to the website  and so i thought
  what would happen if we built software to do what i 'd been consulting in  instead of training people how to put
 forms onto mobile devices let 's create software that lets them do it themselves with no training and without me being involved  and that 's exactly what we did  so we created
 software called magpi which has an online form
  creator no one has to speak to me you just have to hear about it and go to the website  
 you can create forms and once you 've created the forms you push them to a variety of common mobile phones  obviously nowadays we 've moved past palmpilots to mobile phones  
 and it doesn 't have to be a smartphone it can be a basic phone like the phone on the right the basic symbian phone that 's very common in developing countries 
 and the great part about this is it 's just like hotmail
  based and it doesn 't require any training  
 programming consultants  but there are some additional benefits as well now we knew when we built this system the whole point of it just like with the palmpilots was that you 'd be able 
  to collect the data and immediately upload the data and get your data set  but what we found of course since it 's already on a computer  we can deliver instant maps and analysis and graphing  we can take a process that took two years and compress that down
  to the space of five minutes  unbelievable improvements in efficiency cloud based no training no consultants  no me  
 and i told you that in the first few years of trying to do this the old fashioned way going out to each country we 
 probably trained about one thousand people what happened after we did this in the second three years we had fourteen thousand people find the website
  sign up and start using it to collect data data for disaster response  canadian pig farmers tracking pig disease and pig herds 
 people tracking drug supplies one
 of my favorite examples the irc international rescue committee they have a program where semi literate midwives using $ ten mobile phones
  send a text message using our software once a week with the number of births and the number of deaths which gives irc something that no one in global health has ever had a 
 system of counting babies of knowing how many kids are born of knowing how many children there are in sierra leone which is the country where this is happening  and knowing how many children die  
 physicians for human rights this is moving a little bit
  basically training people to do rape exams in congo where this is an epidemic a horrible epidemic  
 and they 're using our software to document the evidence they find including photographically  
 so that they can bring the perpetrators to justice 
 camfed another charity based out of the uk camfed pays girls ' families to keep them in school
  they understand this is the most significant intervention they can make they used to track the disbursements  
 the attendance the grades on paper  the turnaround time between a teacher writing down grades or attendance and getting that into a report was about two to three years now it 's real time and because 
  this is such a low cost system and based in the cloud it costs for the entire five countries that camfed runs this in with tens of thousands of girls  the whole cost combined is ten thousand dollars a year 
 just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation 
 so
 i told you before that when we were doing  it the old fashioned way i realized all of our work was really adding up to just a drop in the bucket ten twenty thirty different programs  
 we 've made a lot of progress but i recognize that right now even the work that we 've done with fourteen thousand people
  using this
 is still a drop in the bucket  but something 's changed and i think it should be obvious what 's changed now
 is  
 instead of having a program in which we 're scaling at such a slow rate that we can never reach all the people who need us  we 've made it unnecessary for people to get reached by us  we 've created a tool that lets programs
 keep kids in school  track the number of babies that are born and the number of babies that
  prosecute them to do all these different things to learn more about what 's going on to understand more to see more 
 and to save lives and improve lives
