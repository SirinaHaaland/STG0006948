  which seems like a fairly humble vocation  
 i know a lot about pots i 've spent about fifteen years making them  one of the things that really excites me
  in my artistic practice and and being trained as a potter
 is that you very quickly learn how to make great things out of nothing that i spent a lot of time
 at my wheel with mounds of clay
 trying stuff  and that the limitations of my capacity my ability was
 based on my hands and my imagination that if i wanted to make a really nice bowl and i didn 't know how to make a foot yet  i would have to
 learn how to make a foot that that process of learning has been very very helpful to my life 
 i feel like as a potter you also start to learn how to shape the world  
 there have been times in my artistic capacity
 that i wanted to
 reflect on other really important moments in
  the history
 of the u s the history of the world where tough things happened 
 but how do you talk about tough ideas without separating people from that content 
 could i use art
 like these old discontinued firehoses from alabama to talk about the complexities of a
  is it possible to talk about my father and i doing labor projects my dad was a roofer  construction guy he owned small businesses 
 and at eighty he was ready to retire and his tar kettle was my inheritance 
 now a tar kettle doesn 't sound like much of an inheritance  it wasn 't it was stinky
 and it took up a lot of space in my studio  but i asked my dad if he would be willing to
  make some art with me  if we could reimagine this kind of nothing material
 as something very special  and by elevating the material and my dad 's skill could we start to think about tar
 just like clay in a new way  shaping it differently  helping us to imagine what was possible 
 after clay  i was then
  kind of turned on to lots of different kinds of materials and my studio grew a lot because i thought well  it 's not really about the material it 's about our capacity to shape things 
 i became more and more interested in ideas and more and more things that were happening just outside my studio 
 just to give you a little bit of context i live in chicago i live on the south side now i 'm a west sider
  for those of you who are not chicagoans that won 't mean anything  but if i didn 't mention that i was a west sider there would be a lot of people in the city that would be very upset 
 the neighborhood that i live in is grand crossing it 's a neighborhood that has seen better days
  it is not a gated community by far there is lots of abandonment in my neighborhood and while i was
  kind of busy making pots and busy making art and having a good art career  there was all of this stuff that was happening just outside my studio 
 all of us know about failing housing markets and the challenges of blight  
 and i feel like we talk about it with some of our cities more than others but i think a lot of our u s cities and beyond have the challenge of blight 
 abandoned buildings that people no longer
  know what to do anything with and so i thought is there a way that i could start to think about these buildings as an extension or an expansion of my artistic practice 
 and that if i was thinking along with other creatives architects  engineers  real estate finance people
 that us together might be able to kind of think in more complicated ways about the reshaping of cities
  and so i bought a building the building was really affordable  
 we tricked it out  we made it as beautiful as we could to try to just get some activity happening on my block  
 once i bought the building for about eighteen thousand dollars i didn 't have any money left 
 so i started sweeping the building as a kind of
  people would come over and i would start sweeping because the broom was free and sweeping was free it worked out  
 we would use the building then to stage exhibitions small dinners  and we found that that building on my block dorchester we now referred to the block as dorchester projects
 that in a way that building became a kind of gathering site for lots
  of different kinds of activity  
 we turned the building into what we called now the archive house 
 the archive house would do all of these amazing things very significant people in the city and beyond would find themselves in the middle of the hood  
 and that 's when i felt like maybe there was a relationship between my history with clay and this new thing that was starting to develop  that we were
  starting to reshape how people imagined the south side of the city  
 one house turned into a few houses  
 and we always tried to suggest that not only is creating a a beautiful vessel important  
 but the contents of what happens in those buildings is also very important 
 so we were not only thinking about
  thinking about the program thinking about the kind of connections that could happen between one house and another  between one neighbor and another 
 this building became what we call the listening house and it has a collection of discarded books from the johnson publishing corporation  
 and other books from an old bookstore that was going out of business 
 i was actually just wanting to activate these buildings as much as i could with
  whatever and whoever would join me in chicago there 's amazing building stock this building which had been the former crack house
 on the block 
 and when the building became abandoned it became a great opportunity to really imagine what else could happen there  so this space we converted into what we call black
  black cinema house was an opportunity in the hood to screen films that were important and relevant to the folk who lived around me  
 that if we wanted to show an old melvin van peebles film we could if we wanted to show car wash we could 
 that would be awesome 
 the building we soon outgrew  and we had to move to a larger space black cinema house which was made from just a
 small piece of clay had to grow into a much larger piece of clay
  which is now my
 my studio what i realized was that for those of you who are
 zoning junkies  that some of the things that i was doing in these buildings that had been left behind  they were not
 the uses by which the buildings were built  
 and that there are city policies that say hey a house that is residential needs to stay residential but what do you do in neighborhoods when
  when
 ain 't nobody interested in living there 
 that the people who have the means to leave have already left 
 what do we do with these abandoned buildings and so i was trying to wake them up using culture 
 we found that that was so exciting for folk and people were so responsive to the work  that we had to then find bigger
  by the time we found bigger buildings  there was in part the resources necessary to think about those things in this bank that we called the arts bank  
 it was in pretty bad shape 
 there was about six feet of standing water  
 it was a difficult project to finance  because banks weren 't interested in the neighborhood because people weren 't interested in the neighborhood because nothing had happened there  it was dirt  
 it was nothing  it was nowhere  
 and so we just started imagining what else
 what else could happen in this building 
 and so now that the rumor of my block has spread and lots of people are starting to visit we 've found that the bank can now be a center for 
 exhibition  archives  music performance  and that there are people who are now interested in being adjacent to those buildings because we brought some heat
  that we kind of made a fire
 one of the archives that we 'll have there is this johnson publishing corporation  
 we 've also started to collect memorabilia from american history from people who live or have lived in that neighborhood 
 some of these images are degraded images of black people kind of histories of very
  and where better than a neighborhood with young people who are constantly asking themselves about their identity to talk about some of the complexities of race and class 
 in some ways the bank represents a hub  that we 're trying to create a pretty hardcore node of cultural activity  
 and that if we could start to make multiple hubs and connect some cool green stuff around there that the buildings that we 've purchased and
  rehabbed which is now around sixty or seventy units  that if we could land
 miniature versailles on top of that and connect these buildings by a beautiful greenbelt 
 that this place where people never wanted to be would become
  an important destination for folk from all over the country and world in some ways  it feels very much like
 i 'm a potter  that we we tackle the things that are at our wheel we try with the skill that we have to think about
 this next bowl that i want to make and it went from a bowl to a singular house to a block to a neighborhood to a cultural district
 to thinking about the city and at every point there were things that i didn 't know that i had to learn
 i 've never learned so much about zoning law in my life i never thought i 'd have to 
 but as a result of that i 'm finding that there 's not just room for my own artistic practice  there 's room for a lot of other artistic practices  
 so people started asking us well theaster how are you going to go to scale
  found was that
 i couldn 't export myself 
 that what seems necessary in cities like akron ohio  and detroit michigan and gary indiana is that there are people in those places who already believe in those places that are already dying to make those places beautiful  
 and that often those people who are passionate about a place are disconnected from the resources necessary to make cool things happen or
  from a contingency of people that could help make things happen so now we 're starting to give advice around the country
 on how to start with what you got  
 how to start with the things that are in front of you how to make something out of nothing how to reshape your world at a wheel
 or at your block or at the scale of the city  thank you so much
 thank you 
 so i think many people watching this will
 be asking themselves the question you just raised at the end how can they do this in their own city you can 't export yourself  
 give us a few pages out of your playbook about what someone who is inspired about their city can do to take on projects like yours
  the things i 've found that 's really important is giving thought to not just the kind of individual project like
 an old house but what 's the relationship between an old house a local school
  a small bodega and is there some kind of synergy between those things can you get those folk talking
  found that in cases where
 neighborhoods have failed they still often have a pulse 
 how do you identify the pulse in that place the passionate people 
 and then how do you get folk who have been fighting slogging for twenty years  reenergized about the place that they live and so someone has to do that work 
 if i were a traditional developer i would be talking about buildings alone  and then
  in the window i think that you actually have to curate more than that that there 's a way in which you have to be mindful about 
 what are the businesses that i want to grow here  and then are there people who live in this place who want to grow those businesses with me because i think it 's not just a cultural space or housing 
  there has to be the recreation of an economic core  so thinking about those things together
  's hard to get people to create the spark again when people have been slogging for twenty years are there any methods you 've found that have have helped break through tg yeah
 i think that now there are lots of examples of folk who are doing amazing work  
 but those methods are sometimes like  when the media is constantly saying that only violent things happen in a place
 then based on your skill set and the particular context what are the things that you can do in your in your neighborhood to kind of fight some of that
  if you 're a theater person you have outdoor street theater festivals 
 in some cases  we don 't have the resources in certain neighborhoods to do things that are a certain kind of splashy  but if we can then find ways of making sure that
  people who are local to a place  plus people who could be supportive of the things that are happening locally when those people get together  i think really amazing things can happen
  interesting and how can you make sure that the projects you 're creating are actually for the disadvantaged and not just for the sort of
 vegetarian indie movie crowd that might move in to to take advantage of them tg right on so i think this is where it starts to get into
  is different from who walks the streets every day  so it 's reasonable to say that grand crossing is already in the process of being something
 different than it is today  but are there ways to think about housing trusts or land trusts or 
  development that starts to protect some of the space that happens
  when you have seven thousand five hundred empty lots in a city you want something to happen there  but you need entities that are not just interested in the development piece but entities that are interested in the stabilization piece 
 and i feel like often the developer piece is really motivated  but the other work of a kind of neighborhood consciousness that part doesn 't live anymore  so how do you start to grow up
 important
 watchdogs that ensure that the resources that are
  available to new folk that are coming in are also distributed to folk who have lived in a place for a long time jc that makes
 so much sense one more question you make such a compelling case for for beauty and the importance of beauty and the arts  
 there would be others who would argue that funds would be better spent on basic services for the disadvantaged how do you combat
  believe that beauty is a basic service applause
 often what i have found is that when there are resources that have not been made available to certain under resourced
  cities or neighborhoods or communities  that sometimes culture is the thing that helps to
  i can 't do everything  but i think that there 's a way in which if you can start with culture and get people kind of reinvested in their place 
 other kinds of adjacent amenities start to grow  and then people can make a demand that 's a poetic demand
 and the political demands that are necessary to wake up our cities  they also become very poetic jc it makes perfect sense to me theaster thank you so much for
