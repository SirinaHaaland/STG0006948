  the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east of
 a man who left to his three sons seventeen camels  to the first son he left half the camels to the second son he left a third of the camels  
 and to the youngest son he left a ninth of the camels
  sons got into a negotiation seventeen doesn 't divide by two 
 it doesn 't divide by three it doesn 't divide by nine  brotherly tempers started to get strained finally in desperation they went and they consulted a wise old woman  
 the wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time and finally she came back and said well  i don 't know if i can help you but at least if you want  you can have my camel 
 so then they had eighteen camels
  first son took his half half of eighteen is nine the second son took his third a third of eighteen is six the youngest son took his ninth a ninth of eighteen is two 
 you get seventeen they had one camel left over  they gave it back to the wise old woman 
 now if you think about that story for a moment i think it resembles
 a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in they start off like
  camels no way to resolve it somehow what we need to do is step back from those situations like that wise old woman 
 look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18th camel
 finding that  18th camel in the world 's conflicts has been my life passion i basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers we 're
  all one family  
 we know that scientifically  
 thanks to the communications revolution all the tribes on the planet all fifteen thousand tribes are in touch with each other 
 and it 's a big family reunion  and yet like many family reunions  it 's not all peace and light 
 there 's a lot of conflict 
 and the question is how do we deal with our differences  how do we deal with our deepest differences given the human propensity for conflict
 and the human genius
 at devising weapons of enormous destruction
 that 's the question 
 as i 've spent the last better part of three decades almost four traveling the world 
 trying to work getting involved in conflicts ranging from yugoslavia to the middle east to chechnya to venezuela
 some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet
 i 've been asking myself that
  question  and i think i 've found in some ways  what is the secret to peace it 's actually surprisingly simple  
 it 's not easy  but it 's simple  
 it 's not even new it may be one of our most ancient human heritages the secret to peace is us  
 it 's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict  who can play a constructive role
  let me give you just a story  an example 
 about twenty years ago i was in south africa working with the parties in that conflict and i had an extra month so i spent some time
 living with several groups of san bushmen  i was curious about them about the way in which they resolve conflict  
 because after all  within living memory they were hunters and gatherers living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe
 ninety nine percent of the human story and all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting
 absolutely fatal  so how do they deal with their differences  
 well what i learned is  whenever tempers rise in those communities  someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush  
 and then everyone sits around in a circle like this and they sit and they talk
 and they talk it may take
  two days three days four days but they don 't rest until they find a resolution or better yet a reconciliation  
 and if tempers are still too high then they send someone off to visit some relatives as a cooling off period  
 well that system is i think probably the system that kept us alive to this point given our human tendencies  
 that system i call the third side because if you think
  about it  normally when we think of conflict when we describe it  there 's always two sides
 it 's arabs versus israelis labor versus management husband versus wife republicans versus democrats 
 but what we don 't often see is that there 's always a third side and the third side of the conflict is us  it 's the surrounding community it 's the friends the allies the family members the neighbors  and we can play an incredibly constructive role
  perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help
 is to remind the parties of what 's really at stake
 for the sake of the kids for the sake of the family for the sake of the community for the sake of the future  let 's stop fighting for a moment and start talking  
 because the thing is when we 're involved in conflict it 's very easy to lose perspective  it 's very easy to react human
  beings we 're reaction machines and as the saying goes when angry you will make the best speech you will ever regret 
 and so the third side reminds us of that the third side helps us go to the balcony which is a metaphor for a place of perspective where we can keep our eyes on the prize 
 let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience some years ago i was
  as a facilitator in some very tough talks between the leaders of russia and the leaders of chechnya 
 there was a war going on as you know  
 and we met in the hague in the peace palace in the same room where the yugoslav war crimes tribunal was taking place 
 and the talks got off to a rather rocky start
 when the vice president of chechnya began by pointing at the russians and said
  you should stay right here in your seats because you 're going to be on trial for war crimes 
 and then he turned to me and said you 're an american look at what you americans are doing in puerto rico 
 and my mind started racing puerto rico what do i know about puerto rico i started reacting 
 but then i tried to remember to go to the balcony and then when he paused and everyone looked at me for a response from a balcony perspective i was able
  to thank him for his remarks and say i appreciate your criticism of my country and i take it as a sign that we 're among friends and can speak candidly to one another 
 and what we 're here to do is not to talk about puerto rico or the past we 're here to see if we can figure out a way to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in chechnya 
 the conversation got back on track  that 's the role of the third side to help the parties go to the balcony
 now let me take you for a moment 
 to what 's widely regarded as the world 's most difficult conflict or the most impossible conflict the middle east  question is where 's the third side there 
 how could we possibly go to the balcony  now i don 't pretend to have an answer to the middle east conflict but i think i 've got a first step
 literally a first step something that any one of us could do
 let me just ask you one question first how many of you in the last
 years have ever found yourself worrying about the middle east and wondering what anyone could do just out of curiosity how many of you 
 ok  so the great majority of us 
 and here it 's so far away why do we pay so much attention
  this conflict 
 is it the number of deaths there are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in africa than in the middle east  no it 's because of the story because we feel personally involved in that story  
 whether we 're christians muslims or jews  religious or non religious we feel we have a personal stake in it  stories matter as an anthropologist i know that stories are what we use to
  they give meaning to our lives that 's what we tell here at ted we tell stories stories are the key and so my question is is
 yes  let 's try and resolve the politics there in the middle east  
 but let 's also take a look at the story  let 's try to get at the root of what it 's all about let 's see if we can apply the third side to it what would that mean  what is the story there  
 now as anthropologists we know that every culture has an origin story  
 what 's the origin story of the middle east
  east  in a phrase it 's four thousand years ago a man and his family walked across the middle east 
 and the world has never been the same since 
 that man of course was abraham  
 and what he stood for was unity the unity of the family he 's the father of us all  but it 's not just what he stood for it 's what his message was his
 basic message was unity too
 the interconnectedness of it all the unity of it all and his basic value
 was respect was kindness toward strangers that 's what he 's known for his hospitality  
 so in that sense  he 's the symbolic third side of the middle east  he 's
 the one who reminds us that we 're all part of a greater whole now 
 think about that for a
  moment
 today we face the scourge of terrorism  what is terrorism  
 terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger and treating them as an enemy whom you kill
 in order to create fear what 's the opposite of terrorism  
 it 's taking an innocent stranger and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home  in order to sow and create
 understanding or respect or love 
 so what if then you took the story of abraham  
 which is a third side story what if that could be because abraham stands for hospitality
 what if that could be an antidote to terrorism what if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance how would you bring that story to life
  now it 's not enough just to tell a story  
 that 's powerful  
 but people need to experience the story they need to be able to live the story  how would you do that and
 that was my thinking of how would you do that and that 's what comes to the first step here  
 because the simple way to do that is 
 you go for a walk  you go for a walk in the footsteps of abraham  
 you retrace the footsteps of abraham
  because walking has a real power  you know as an anthropologist walking is what made us human it 's funny when you walk you walk 
 in the same common direction  now if i were to come to you face to face and come this close to you 
 you would feel
  but if i walk 
  even touching shoulders  it 's no problem 
 who fights while they walk  that 's why in negotiations often when things get tough people go for walks in the woods  
 so the idea came to me of what about inspiring
 a path a route think the silk route think the appalachian trail that followed in the
  that 's crazy you can 't  you can 't retrace the footsteps of abraham it 's too insecure you 've got to cross all these borders it goes across ten different countries in the middle east because it unites them all 
 and so we studied the idea at harvard we did our due diligence  and then a few years ago a group of us about twenty five of us from ten different countries decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of abraham going from his initial birthplace in the city of urfa
 in southern turkey northern mesopotamia and
  we then took a bus and took some walks and went to harran  where in the bible he sets off on his journey then we crossed the border into syria went to aleppo which turns out 
 is named after abraham  we went to damascus which has a long history associated with abraham  
  where he 's buried in hebron  so effectively we went from womb to tomb we showed it could be done it was an amazing journey 
 let me ask you a question  how many of you have had the experience
 of being in a strange neighborhood or strange land  and a total stranger  perfect stranger  comes up to you and
 shows you some kindness maybe invites you into their home gives you a drink gives you a coffee gives you a meal
 have ever had that experience  that 's the essence of
 of the abraham path that 's what you discover as you go into these villages in the middle east where you expect hostility and you get the most amazing hospitality all associated with abraham in the name of father ibrahim 
 let me offer you some food so what we discovered is that abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people he 's alive
  presence  
 and to make a long story short in the last couple of years now  thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of abraham
 in the middle east  enjoying the hospitality of the people there  they 've begun to walk in israel and palestine in jordan in turkey in
  young people old people more women than men actually interestingly for those who can 't walk 
 who are unable to get there right now people started to organize walks in cities in their own communities in cincinnati for instance they organized a walk from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an abrahamic meal together it was abraham path day  
 in so paulo brazil it 's become an annual event for thousands of people to run in a virtual abraham path run uniting
  the different communities  the media love it  they really adore it  they lavish attention on it
 because it 's visual and it spreads the idea this idea of abrahamic hospitality of kindness towards strangers  and
 just a couple weeks ago there was an npr story on it  last month there was a
  quoted a villager who said this walk connects us to the world he said it was like a light that went on in our lives it brought us hope 
 and so that 's what it 's about
 but it 's not just about psychology it 's about economics 
 because as people walk they spend money  and this woman right here um ahmad is a woman who lives on the path in northern jordan
 she 's desperately poor  she 's partially blind her husband
 can 't work she 's got seven kids  
 but what she can do is cook  and so she 's begun to cook for some groups of walkers who come through the village and
  meal in her home they sit on the floor she doesn 't even have a tablecloth  
 she makes the most delicious food that 's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside  and so more and more walkers have come 
 and lately she 's begun to earn an income to support her family  
 and so she told our our team there she said you have made me visible
 in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me 
  that 's the potential of the abraham path there are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities across the middle east across the path 
 the potential is basically to change the game  
 and to change the game you have to change the frame the way we see things to change the frame from
 hostility to hospitality from terrorism to tourism and in that sense
  let me just show you one thing  i have a little acorn here that i picked up while i was walking on the path earlier this year 
 now the acorn is associated with the oak tree of course grows into an oak tree which is associated with abraham the
 path right now is like an acorn it 's still in its early phase  what would the oak tree look like when
 i think back to my childhood a good part of which i spent after being born here in chicago  i spent in europe
  you had been in the ruins of say london in 
  or berlin  and you had said sixty years from now  
 this is going to be the most peaceful prosperous part of the planet people would have thought you were certifiably insane  
 but they did it  thanks to a common identity  europe  and a common economy so my question is if it can be done in europe
  why not in the middle east  why not thanks to a common identity  which is the story of abraham  
 and thanks to a common economy that would be based in good part on tourism  
 so let me conclude then by saying that
 in the last thirty five years as i 've worked in some of the most dangerous
  difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet i have yet to see one conflict
 that i felt could not be transformed  
 it 's not easy of course  but it 's possible  
 it was done in south africa  
 it was done in northern ireland it could be done anywhere it simply depends on us it depends on us taking the third side  
 so let me invite you to consider taking the third side  even as a very small step
 we 're about to take a break in a moment 
 just go up to someone who 's from a different culture a different country a different ethnicity some difference and engage them in a conversation listen to them 
 that 's a third side act  that 's walking abraham 's path  after a ted talk  why not a ted walk 
 so let me just leave you with three things
  one is the secret to peace
 is the third side  the third side is us each of us with a single step 
 can take the world can bring the world a step closer to peace 
 there 's an old african proverb that goes when
