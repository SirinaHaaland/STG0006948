  i want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 
 on the exact same day at the exact same moment each conceiving a baby 
 ok so two couples each conceiving one baby now i don 't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception because
 so just imagine that for a moment  and in this scenario  
 i want to imagine that in one case  the sperm is carrying a y chromosome meeting that x chromosome of the egg  
 and in the other case  the sperm is carrying an x chromosome meeting the x chromosome of the egg   both are viable  both take off we
 'll come back to these people later  
 so i wear two hats in most of what i do
 as the one hat i do history of anatomy  i 'm a historian by training  and what i study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy meaning
 human bodies animal bodies how they dealt with bodily fluids  concepts of bodies how have they thought about bodies  
 the other hat that i 've worn in my work is as an activist as a patient advocate
  say as an impatient advocate for people who are patients of doctors 
 in that case what i 've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms  
 so some of what i 've worked on for example is people who are conjoined twins two people within one body 
 some of what i 've worked on is people who have dwarfism so people who are much shorter than typical and a lot of what i 've worked on is people who have atypical sex
 so people who don 't have the standard male or the standard female body types  and as a general term we can use the term intersex for this 
 intersex comes in a lot of different forms i 'll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn 't standard for male or female  
 so in one instance you can have somebody who has an xy
  gene on the y chromosome tells tells the proto gonads which we all have in the fetal life to become testes  so in the fetal life those testes are pumping out testosterone  but because this 
  individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone  the body doesn 't react to the testosterone and this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome  
  is born she looks like a girl  she is a girl  she is raised as a girl and it 's often not until she hits puberty and she 's growing and developing breasts 
 but she 's not getting her period  that somebody figures out something 's up here  
 and they do some tests and figure out that instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus she has testes inside and she has a y chromosome  
 now what 's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male but they 're really not
 females like males have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands they 're in the back of our body  and the adrenal glands make androgens which are a masculinizing hormone 
  most females like me i believe myself to be a typical female i don 't actually know my chromosomal make up but i think i 'm probably typical most females like me are actually 
  and we 're responding to androgens the consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens
 than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome  
 so sex is really complicated it 's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum in some ways they can be all over the place 
 another example a few years ago i got a call from a man who was nineteen years old 
 who was born a boy raised a boy had a girlfriend had sex with his girlfriend had a life as a guy  
 and had just found out that
  had ovaries and a uterus inside  
 what he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia 
 he had xx chromosomes  and in the womb his adrenal glands were in such high gear
 that it created essentially a masculine hormonal environment  and as a consequence his genitals were masculinized his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones 
 and he was born looking like a boy nobody suspected
  anything  and it was only when he had reached the age of nineteen that he began to have enough medical problems from menstruating internally  that doctors figured out that in fact he was female internally  
 ok so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex 
 some people who have xx chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis  which is when you have ovarian tissue with
  testicular tissue wrapped around it and we 're not exactly sure why that happens so sex can come in lots of different varieties  the reason that
 children with these kinds of bodies whether it 's dwarfism or it 's conjoined twinning or it 's an intersex type are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health 
 in many cases people are actually perfectly healthy
  the reason they 're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories 
 our system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity  
 so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity 
 what it means to be a black person is allegedly to have an african anatomy in terms of your history 
 and so we have this terribly simplistic idea  and when we 're faced with a body that actually presents us
  something quite different it startles us in terms of those categorizations  so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism  
 and our nation 's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children who are born who are two people inside of one body
  where i ran into the most
  heat from this most recently was last year when south african runner caster semenya had her sex called into question at the international games in berlin 
 i had a lot of journalists calling me asking me which is the test they 're going to run that will tell us whether or not caster semenya is male or female 
 and i had to explain to the journalists there isn 't such a test in fact we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to
  nature doesn 't draw the line for us between male and female or between male and intersex and female and intersex  we actually draw that line on nature  
 so what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes  the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories 
 that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought  
 and it 's not just in terms of sex it 's also in terms of race
  turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed 
 as we look we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas we look for example about the fact that we share at least  ninety five percent of our dna with chimpanzees 
 what are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides  
 and as we get farther and farther with our science we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge
  that the simplistic categories we 've had are probably overly simplistic  
 so we 're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life one of the places we 're seeing it for example  in our culture in the united states today is battles over the beginning of 
  life and the end of life we have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human such that it has a different right than a fetal life 
  nowadays probably not out in the open as much as within medicine about the question of when somebody 's dead in the past our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead at 
  most they 'd stick a feather on somebody 's nose and if it twitched they didn 't bury them yet if it stopped twitching 
  really difficult question about who 's dead  
 and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don 't have such simple categories as we 've had before  
 now you might think that all this breaking down of categories would make somebody like me really happy  i 'm a political progressive i defend people with unusual bodies but i have to admit to you that it makes me nervous  
 understanding that these
 categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense  it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy  
 so in order to tell you about that tension i have to first admit to you a huge fan of the founding fathers i know they were racists i know they were sexist  but they were great i mean
 they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that cheesy musical one thousand seven hundred and seventy six every few years and it 's not because of the music which is totally forgettable it 's because of what happened in
 hundred and seventy six with the founding fathers  the founding fathers were for my point of view the original anatomical activists  and this is why what they rejected
 was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for two hundred years  
 so as you all recall  what our founding fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy 
 and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of
  anatomy  the monarchs of the old world didn 't have a concept of dna  but they did have a concept of birthright they had a concept of blue blood they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from
 grandfather to father to son and so forth the founding fathers rejected that idea and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept and that concept was
  was all men are created equal they leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy not the difference
 in anatomy  and that was a really radical thing to do  
 now they were doing it in part because they were part of an enlightenment system where two things were growing up together  
 and that was democracy growing up but it was also science growing up at the same time
  really clear if you look at the history of the founding fathers a lot of them were very interested in science  and they were interested in the concept of a naturalistic world they were moving away from supernatural explanations 
 and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright  
  and if you look for example in the declaration of independence they talk about nature and nature 's god they don 't talk about god and god 's nature they 're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are 
 so as part of that they were coming to us with a concept
 that was about anatomical commonality  and in doing so they were really setting up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement of the future  they didn 't think of it that way but they did it for us and it was great  so what happened years afterwards what happened was
  women for example who wanted the right to vote took the founding fathers ' concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said the fact that we have a uterus and 
  ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn 't have the right to vote  
  like sojourner truth
 talking about ain 't i a woman we find men on the the marching lines of the civil rights movement saying i am a man again people of color appealing to 
  a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy  again successfully  we see the same thing with the disability rights movement 
  of course that as we begin to look at all that commonality we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions
 mind you i want to maintain some divisions anatomically in our culture  for example  i don 't want to give a fish the same rights as a human  
 i don 't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy i don 't want to say a five year old should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry  
 so there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that i think we should retain  but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they
  are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning so let 's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk 
 we have two beings both conceived in the in the middle of one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine on the exact same day  let 's imagine one of them mary is born three months prematurely  so she 's born 
  on june one one thousand nine hundred and eighty  henry by contrast is born at term so he 's born on march
 that mary was born prematurely three months she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than henry does
 the right to consent to sex the right to vote  the right to drink  
 henry has to wait for all of that not because he 's actually any different in age biologically  except in terms of when he was born  
 we find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are  henry by virtue of being assumed to be male although i haven 't told
  you that he 's the xy one
 by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted which mary does not need to worry about mary meanwhile  
 cannot in all the states have the same right that henry has in all the states namely the right to marry  henry can marry in every state a woman  
 but mary can only marry today in a few states
  so we have these anatomical categories that persist that are in many ways problematic and questionable  and the question to me becomes what do we do 
 as our science gets to be so good
 in looking at anatomy that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that 's been based on anatomy
 might start falling apart  i don 't want to give up the
  but at the same time it feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us so where do we go 
 it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude we have to draw the line somewhere so we will draw the line somewhere 
 but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position so for example  texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don 't have a y chromosome 
  and what it means to marry a woman means you have a y chromosome in practice they don 't test people for their chromosomes but this
  is also very bizarre because of the story i told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome 
 if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy dr martin luther king he offers us something of a solution in his i have a dream speech he says we should judge people based not on the color of their skin  but on the content of their character 
 moving beyond
  that sounds like a really good idea but in practice how do you do it how do you judge people based on the content of character  
 i also want to point out that i 'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans because i have to admit that there are some golden retrievers i know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans i know 
 i also want to say there are probably also some yellow labradors that i know that are more capable of
  mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40 year olds that i know so how do we operationalize
 the question of content of character it turns out to be really difficult and part of me also wonders  what if content of character turns out to be something that 's scannable
 in the future
 able to be seen with an fmri do we really want to go there 
 i 'm not sure where we go  what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of
 the united states being in the lead
  thinking about this issue of democracy we 've done a really good job struggling with democracy  and i think we would do a good job in the future  we don 't have a situation that iran has for example where a man 
  who 's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered unless he 's willing to submit to a sex change in which case he 's allowed to live  
  who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them partly to make a name for himself but when i was on the phone with him asking why he 'll do this surgery this was a very high risk surgery his 
  answer was that in this other nation these children were going to be treated very badly and so he had to do this my response to him was well have you considered political asylum instead instead of a separation
  the united states has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state  
 so i think we have to be in the lead 
 well just to close i want to suggest to you that i 've been talking a lot about the fathers  and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like or might have looked like if we had more involved the mothers  
 and i want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist  and that is that i think that there may be
  different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies particularly when we have people thinking in groups 
 for years because i 've been interested in intersex i 've also been interested in sex difference research and one of the things that i 've been interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world  
 and what we know from cross cultural studies is that females on average not everyone  but on average
  are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations
 and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group  
 and so if we think about that 
 we have an interesting situation in hands years ago when i was in graduate school 
 one of my graduate advisors who knew i was interested in feminism i considered myself a feminist as i still do asked a really strange question he said 
 tell me what 's feminine about
 and i thought well that 's the dumbest question i 've ever heard feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender so there 's nothing feminine about feminism 
 but the more i thought about his question the more i thought there might be something feminine about feminism that is to say there might be something on average different about female brains from male brains
  us more attentive
 to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable 
 so whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state 
 it 's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept what we would have is more of a concept of not just how to protect but how to care for each other 
 and maybe that 's where we need to go in the future when we take democracy beyond anatomy is to think less about the
  individual body in terms of the identity  and think more about those relationships  so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union we 're thinking about what we do for each other
