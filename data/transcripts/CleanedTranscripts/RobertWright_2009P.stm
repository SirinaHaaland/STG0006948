  compassion and the golden rule from a secular perspective and even from
 a kind of scientific perspective i 'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule
  sometimes using kind of clinical language  and so it 's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk i want to warn you about that 
 so i do want to say at the outset that i think compassion 's great the golden rule is great i 'm a big supporter of both  and i think it 's great that 
  the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule
 as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths at the same time i think
 religions don 't deserve all the credit i think nature
 gave them a helping hand here i 'm going to going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are in a certain sense built into human nature 
  but i 'm also going to argue that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature you realize that
 just affirming compassion and affirming the golden rule is really not enough there 's a lot of work to be done after that   
 ok so a quick natural history first of compassion in the beginning  there was compassion 
 and i mean
  not just when human human beings first showed up but actually even before that i think it 's probably the case that in the human evolutionary lineage even before there were homo sapiens 
  feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had had earned their way into the gene pool and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened 
  if an animal feels compassion for a close relative  
 and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative  then in the end 
 the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself so from a biologist 's point of view 
 compassion is actually a gene 's way
  i warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy  i 'll
 get there i hope to get a little fuzzier this doesn 't bother me so much that the underlying darwinian rationale of compassion
 is kind of self serving at the genetic level actually i think the bad news about kin selection
 is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family  that 's the bad news the good news is
  compassion is natural  the bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family 
 now there 's more good news that came along later in evolution a second kind of evolutionary logic biologists call that reciprocal altruism ok and there the basic idea is that
 compassion
 compassion leads you to do
 good things for people who then will return the favor  
 again  i know this is this is not not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you you may have
 heard in the past but from a biologist 's point of view this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately
  so  you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies i 'm sure a lot of you 
 if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them  you feel really bad
 but if you read in the newspaper that something really horrible happened to somebody you 've never heard of you can probably live with that  that 's just  human
  another good news bad news story it 's good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic  the bad news is is this doesn 't bring us universal compassion by itself  
 so there 's still work to be done now
 there 's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism  
 which i think is kind of good news which is that the way that this is played out in the human species   
  intuitive appreciation of the golden rule  i don 't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes but you can go to a to a hunter gatherer 
  society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions no exposure to ethical philosophy  and you 'll find if you spend time with these people that basically they believe that one good turn deserves another and that bad deeds should be punished and evolutionary
  if you want to be treated well you treat other people well and it 's good to treat other people well that 's close to being a kind of built in intuition so that 's good news now  if you 've been paying 
  attention you 're probably anticipating that there 's bad news here we still aren 't to universal love and it
  an appreciation of the golden rule is natural it 's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule   i mean for example  
 none of us probably want to go to prison  
 but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison  right so we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated now we have a rationale for that we say they did these bad things
  that make it just that they should go to prison  none of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion we have the capacity to carve out exceptions put people in a special category 
 and the problem is
 that although in the case of sending people to prison you have this impartial judiciary
 determining who gets excluded from the golden rule that in everyday
  the way we all make these decisions about who we 're not going to extend the golden rule to is we use a much
 rougher and readier formula basically it 's just like  if you 're my enemy if you 're my rival if you 're not my friend if you 're not in my family
 i 'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you  we all do that  and you see it all over the world
  you see it in the middle east people who from gaza are firing missiles at israel they wouldn 't want to have missiles fired at them but they say well but the israelis or some of them have done things that put them in a special 
  category the israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them but they impose one on gaza and they say well  the palestinians or some of them have brought this on themselves so 
  it 's natural to do that so the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us is not by itself going to bring us universal
 love it 's not going to save the world  now there 's one piece of good news i have that may save the world  okay
  are you on the edges of your seats here good because before i tell you about that good news i 'm going to have to take a little excursion
 through some
  academic terrain so i hope i 've got your attention with this promise of good news that
 that may save the world  it 's this non zero sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about it 's just a quick
 introduction to game theory this won 't hurt okay it 's about 
  games if you ask what kind of a situation is conducive to people becoming friends and allies  the technical answer
 is a non zero sum situation and if you ask what kind of situation is conducive to people defining people as enemies it 's a zero sum situation so what do those terms mean  
 basically a zero sum game is the kind you 're used to in sports where there 's a winner and a loser  so  their fortunes add up to zero  so in tennis
  is either good for you and bad for the other person or good for them bad for you either way your fortunes add up to zero 
 that 's a zero sum game  now if you 're playing doubles  then the person on your side of the net is in a 
  relationship with you because every point is either good for both of you positive win win or bad for both of you it 's lose lose that 's a 
  in real life there are lots of non zero sum games
  in the realm of economics say if you buy something that means you 'd rather have the merchandise than the money
  but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise you both feel you 've won in a war two allies are playing a
  the golden rule is deployed by just saying 
 well compassion most naturally flows along non zero sum channels where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win win situation with some of their friends or allies  
 the deployment of the golden rule most most naturally happens along these non zero sum channels so  kind of webs of 
  are where you would expect
 compassion and the golden rule to kind of work their magic
 with zero sum channels you would expect something else  okay so now you 're ready for the good news that i i said might save the world and
 now i can admit that it might not too  now that i 've held your attention for three minutes of
 of technical stuff  but it may and the good news is that
  these webs that can be these channels for compassion  you can go back all the way to the stone age 
  technological evolution
 roads the wheel  writing a lot of transportation and communication technologies has just inexorably made it so that more people can be in more non zero sum relationships with more and more people
  at greater and greater distances  that 's the story
 of civilization it 's why social organization has grown from the hunter gatherer village to the ancient state the empire and now here we are in a globalized world and the story of of globalization is largely a story of 
  you 've probably heard the term interdependence applied to the modern
  you see this all the time in the modern world you saw it with the recent economic crash where
 bad things happen in the economy bad for everybody for much of the world good things happen and it 's good for
 for much of the world and you know i 'm happy to say i think there 's really evidence
  kind of connection can expand the moral compass i mean if you look at the american attitudes toward japanese during world war ii
 look at the depictions of japanese in the american media as just about subhuman and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs really without giving it much of a thought
 and you compare that to the attitude now i think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence any form of interdependence
  forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people so i think that 's good and the world is full of 
 dynamics environmental problems in many ways put us all in the same boat  and there are 
 relationships that that maybe people aren 't aware of for example probably a lot of american christians don 't think of themselves as being in a
  with with muslims halfway around the world but they really are 
 because if if these muslims become happier and happier with their with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it that 's good for americans because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten american security 
 if they get less and less happy that will be bad for americans  so there 's
  the world not yet been suffused in love peace and understanding the answer 's complicated it 's the occasion for a whole other talk certainly  
 a couple of things are that first of all there are a lot of zero sum situations in the world and also  sometimes people don 't
  i think politicians can play a role this isn 't only about religion i think politicians can help foster
  relationships economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on in this regard and politicians can be aware and should be aware
 that when people around the world are looking at them are looking at their nation
 and picking up their cues for whether they are in a 
  relationship with a nation like say america or any other nation human psychology is such that they use cues like do we feel we 're being respected  
 because you know historically if you 're not being respected
 you 're probably not going to wind up in a
  mutually profitable
 relationship with people so we need to be aware of what kind of signals we 're sending out
   and some of this
 again is in in the realm of political work if there 's one thing i can encourage everyone to do politicians religious leaders and us 
 it would be what what i call expanding the moral imagination that is to say your ability to put yourself
 in the shoes of people in very different circumstances this is
  is not the same as compassion but it 's conducive to compassion it opens the channels
 for compassion 
 and i 'm afraid we have another good news bad news story which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature that 's good but again we tend to deploy it selectively 
   once we define somebody as an enemy we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes just naturally
  so if you want to take a particularly hard case for an american somebody in iran who is burning an american flag and you see them on tv well
  the average american is going to going to resist the the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person 's head and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person 
 and if you tell them well
  they think america disrespects them and even wants to dominate them and they hate america has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly you know they 'll resist that comparison and that 's natural 
 that 's human and similarly the person in iran when you try to humanize somebody in america who said that islam is evil they 'll have trouble with that  so  it 's a very 
  difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination to a place it doesn 't naturally go i think it 's worth the trouble because
  again it just helps us to understand if you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags it helps to understand what makes them do it  and i think it 's good
 good moral exercise i would say here is where religious leaders come in because
 religious leaders are are good at reframing issues for people at
 harnessing the emotional centers of the brain to get people to alter their awareness and
 reframe the way they think  i mean 
 religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business it 's their great calling right now to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations appreciating
 that in so many ways they 're in the same boat
  that compassion and the golden rule are in
