  not wearing a dress  and no i 'm not saying what i 'm wearing underneath 
 this is a gho this is my national dress
  this is how all men dress in bhutan 
 that is how our women dress like our women  we men get to wear
 pretty bright colors  but unlike our women  we get to show off our legs 
 our national dress is unique but this is not the only thing that 's unique about my
  country  our promise to remain carbon neutral is also unique  and this is what i 'd like to speak about today  our promise to remain carbon neutral  
 but before i proceed i should set you the context  
 i should tell you our story  
 bhutan
 is a small country in the himalayas
  but let me tell you right off the bat we are not shangri la my country is not one big monastery populated with happy monks 
 the reality is that there are barely seven hundred thousand of us
 sandwiched between two of the most populated countries on earth
  reality is that we are a small  underdeveloped country doing our best to survive  
 but we are doing ok  we are surviving in fact  we are thriving 
 and the reason we are thriving is because we 've been blessed
 with extraordinary kings  our enlightened monarchs have worked tirelessly to develop our country
  balancing economic growth carefully with social development environmental sustainability and cultural preservation 
 all within the framework of good governance  
 we call this holistic approach to development gross national happiness or gnh  
  our fourth king famously pronounced that for bhutan  
 gross national happiness is more important than gross national product 
 ever since 
 all development in bhutan is driven by gnh  a pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness
  but that 's easier said than done
 especially when you are one of the smallest economies in the world our entire gdp is less than two billion dollars  
 i know that some of you here are worth more individually
 than the entire economy of my country  
 so our economy is small  but here is where it gets interesting
 education is completely free 
 all citizens are guaranteed free school education and those that work hard are given free college education healthcare is also completely free  
 medical consultation medical treatment medicines they are all provided by the state 
 we manage this
 because we use our limited resources very carefully and
  because we stay faithful to the core mission of gnh  which is development
 with values 
 our economy is small  and we must strengthen it economic growth is important  
 but that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture
  our culture is flourishing  we continue to celebrate our art and architecture food and festivals  
 monks and monasteries  and yes  we celebrate our national dress too 
 this is why i can wear my gho
  a fun fact you 're looking at the world 's biggest pocket 
 it starts here  goes around the back 
 and comes out from inside here in this pocket
 we store all manner of personal goods from phones and wallets
  sometimes even precious cargo  
 so our culture is flourishing  
 but so is our environment seventy two percent of my country is under forest cover  
 our constitution
 demands that a minimum of sixty percent of bhutan 's total land shall
  remain under forest cover for all time 
 our constitution 
 this constitution  
 imposes forest cover on us 
 incidentally  our king used this constitution to impose democracy on us you see
  we the people didn 't want democracy we didn 't ask for it we didn 't
 demand it  and we certainly didn 't fight for it instead  our king imposed democracy on us
 by insisting that he include it in the constitution 
 but he went further he included provisions in the constitution
 that empower the people to
  impeach their kings  and included provisions in here that require all our kings to retire
 at the age of sixty five 
 fact is 
 we already have a king in retirement 
 our previous king the great fourth retired ten years ago at the peak of his popularity
 he was all of fifty one years
 at that time  
 so as i was saying
 seventy two percent of our country is under forest cover and all that forest is pristine 
 that 's why we are one of the few remaining global biodiversity hotspots in the world  and that 's why we are a carbon neutral country 
 in a world that is threatened with
  climate change we are a carbon neutral country  
 turns out it 's a big deal of the 200 odd countries in the world today it looks like we are the only one
 that 's carbon neutral  
 actually that 's not quite accurate bhutan is not carbon
  is carbon negative our entire country generates
 two point two million tons of carbon dioxide but our forests they sequester more than three times that amount 
 so we are a net carbon sink for more than four million tons of carbon dioxide each year  
 but that 's not all 
 we export most of the
  renewable electricity we generate from our fast flowing rivers  so today  the clean energy that we export offsets
 about six million tons of carbon dioxide
 in our neighborhood by two thousand and twenty we 'll be exporting enough electricity
 to offset seventeen million tons of carbon dioxide and if we were to harness even half our
  hydropower potential and that 's exactly what we are working at 
 the clean green energy that we export would offset something like fifty million tons of carbon dioxide a year  
 that is more co2 than what the entire city of new york
 generates in one year  so inside our country we are a net carbon sink  outside  we are offsetting
  carbon and this is important stuff you see the world is getting warmer and climate change is a reality 
 climate change is affecting my country  
 our glaciers are melting causing flash floods and landslides  which in turn are causing disaster and widespread destruction
 in our country  
 i was at that lake recently
  it 's stunning that 's how it looked ten years ago  and that 's how it looked
 twenty years ago  just twenty years ago that lake didn 't exist  it was a solid glacier 
 a few years ago a similar lake breached its dams and wreaked havoc in the valleys below
 that destruction was caused by one glacier lake we have two thousand seven hundred of them
 to contend with the point is this my country and my people have done nothing
 to contribute to global warming  but we are already bearing the brunt
 of its consequences
  and for a small poor country one that is landlocked and mountainous  it is very difficult  
 but we are not going to sit on our hands doing nothing  we will fight climate change  that 's why we have promised
 to remain carbon neutral  
 we first made this promise in two thousand and nine during cop fifteen in copenhagen
 but nobody noticed  
 governments were so busy arguing with one another and blaming each other for causing climate change  that when a small country raised our hands and announced we promise to remain carbon neutral for all time 
 nobody heard us 
 nobody cared  
 last december in paris at cop
 we reiterated our promise
 to remain carbon neutral for all time to come 
 this time we were heard we were noticed and everybody cared  
 what was different in paris was that governments came round together
 to accept the realities of climate change  and were willing to come together and act together and work together
 all countries from the very small to the very large  committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions  
 the un framework convention on climate change says that
 if these so called intended commitments are kept  we 'd be closer to containing global warming by two degrees celsius
  by the way  i 've requested the ted organizers here to
 turn up the heat in here by two degrees 
 so if some of you are feeling warmer than usual you know who to blame  
 it 's crucial
  that all of us keep our commitments as far as bhutan is concerned we will keep our promise
 to remain carbon neutral  here are some of the ways we are doing it  
 we are providing free electricity to our rural farmers  the idea is that with free electricity they will no longer have to use
 firewood to cook their food we are investing in sustainable transport
 and subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles
  similarly  we are subsidizing the cost of led lights and our entire government
 is trying to go paperless  
 we are cleaning up our entire country through clean bhutan 
 a national program  and we are planting trees throughout our country through green bhutan  
 another national program
  but it is our protected areas that are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy 
 our protected areas are our carbon sink they are our lungs 
 today more than half our country is protected as national parks nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries  
 but the beauty is that we 've connected them all with one another through a network of biological corridors
 now what this means is that our animals are free to roam throughout our country  
 take this tiger for example it was spotted
 at two hundred and fifty meters above sea level in the hot subtropical jungles 
 two years later that same tiger was spotted near four thousand meters
 in our cold alpine
  mountains  isn 't that awesome 
 we must keep it that way 
 we must keep our parks awesome  
 so every year we set aside resources to prevent
 poaching hunting mining and pollution in our
  and resources to help communities who live in those parks manage their forests  adapt to climate change  and lead better lives while continuing to live in harmony with mother nature  
 but that is expensive over the next few years our small economy
 won 't have the resources to cover all the costs that are required to protect
  in fact when we run the numbers it looks like
 it 'll take us at least fifteen years before we can
 fully finance all our conservation efforts  but neither bhutan  nor the world
 can afford to spend fifteen years going backwards 
 this is why his majesty the king started bhutan for life bhutan for life gives us the time we need
  gives us breathing room  
 it is essentially a funding mechanism to look after our parks to protect our parks 
 until our government can take over on our own fully  
 the idea
 is to raise a transition fund
 from individual donors corporations and institutions  but the deal is closed only after predetermined conditions are met
 and all funds committed so multiparty  single closing  an idea we borrowed from wall street  
 this means that individual donors can commit
 without having to worry that they 'll be left supporting an underfunded plan  
 it 's something like a kickstarter project only with a 15 year time horizon and millions
  of tons of carbon dioxide at stake  once the deal is closed we use the transition fund
 to protect our parks  giving our government time
 to increase our own funding gradually until the end of the
  we are almost there we expect to close later this year  naturally i 'm pretty excited 
 the world wildlife fund
 is our principle partner
 in this journey  and i want to give them a big shoutout for the excellent work they are doing in bhutan and across the
 it is getting warm in here
 i thank you for listening to our story 
 a story of how we are keeping
  to remain carbon neutral  a story of
 how we are keeping our country pristine for ourselves  our children for your children and for the world  
 but we are not here to tell stories are we we are here to dream together  so in
  like to share one more dream that i have what if we could mobilize
 our leadership and our resources our influence and our passion 
 to replicate the bhutan for life idea to other countries so that they too
 can conserve their protected areas for all time  
 after all there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face they too have natural resources
 that can help win the world 's fight for sustainability
  only they may not have the ability to invest in them now  so what if we set up earth for life 
 a global fund to kickstart the bhutan for life throughout the world  
 i invite you to help me to carry this dream beyond our borders to all those
 who care about our planet 's future  after all
  to dream together 
 to work together to fight climate change together to protect our planet together  because the reality is we are
 in it together  some of us might dress differently  but we are in it together  thank you very much
