  how do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting value  instead of just being chaos  and the economic
 framing of that problem is called coordination costs
 and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output 
 and we 've had a classic answer for coordination costs which is  if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people you start an institution right you raise some resources you found something it can be
 private or public it can be for profit or not profit it can be large or
  but you get these resources together you found an institution and you use the institution to coordinate the activities of the group 
 more recently because the cost of of letting groups communicate with each other has fallen through the floor and communication costs are one of the big inputs to coordination
 there has been a second answer which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure 
 to design systems that coordinate the output of the group as a by product of the operating of the system
  without regard to institutional models so that 's what i want to talk about today  i 'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples but always
 always pointing to the broader themes so i
 'm going to start by trying to answer a question that i know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other and which the internet is  purpose built to answer which is where can i get a picture of a  roller skating
  in new york city on the first saturday of every summer coney island our local charmingly run down amusement park hosts the mermaid parade it
 's an amateur parade people come from all over the city people get all dressed up some people get less dressed up 
 young and old  dancing in the streets colorful characters  and a good time is had by all  and what i want to call your attention to is not the mermaid parade itself charming though it is but rather to these photos  i didn 't take them 
 how did i get them
 and the answer is i got them from flickr  
 flickr is a photo sharing service that allows people to take photos  upload them share them over the web and so forth
  recently flickr has added an additional function called tagging tagging was pioneered by delicious and joshua schachter delicious is a social bookmarking service 
 tagging is a cooperative infrastructure
  if i had given this talk last year i couldn 't do what i just did  because i couldn 't have found those photos  
 but instead of saying we need to hire a professional class of librarians to organize these photos once they 're uploaded flickr simply turned over to the users the ability to characterize the photos 
 so i was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged mermaid parade 
  there were three thousand one hundred photos taken by one hundred and eighteen photographers all aggregated and then put under this nice neat name
 shown in reverse chronological order  and i was then able to go and retrieve them to to give you that little slideshow now
 what hard problem is being solved here 
 and it 's in the most schematic possible view  it 's a coordination problem 
 right there are a large number of people on the internet a very small fraction of them have photos of the mermaid parade how do we get those people together to contribute that work
  the classic answer is to form an institution right to draw those people into some prearranged structure that has explicit goals  
 and i want to call your attention to some of
 the side effects of of going the institutional route 
 first of all when you form an institution you take on a management problem  right no good just hiring employees you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees
  to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth  
 secondly you have to bring structure into place right you have to have economic structure you have to have legal structure you have to have physical structure  and that creates additional costs  
 third  forming an institution is inherently exclusionary  you notice we haven 't got everybody
 who has a photo you can 't hire everyone in a company
  you can 't recruit everyone into a governmental organization you have to exclude some people 
 and fourth as a result of that exclusion 
 you end up with a professional class  look at the change here we 've gone from people with photos to photographers right we 've created a professional class of photographers whose goal is to go out and photograph the mermaid parade or whatever else they 're sent out
  when you build cooperation into the infrastructure which is the flickr answer you can leave the people where they are
 and you you take the problem to the individuals rather than moving the individuals to the problem you arrange the coordination in in the group  
 and by doing that you get
  the institutional difficulties  you lose the institutional imperative you lose the right to shape people 's work when it 's volunteer effort  
 but you also shed the institutional cost which gives you greater flexibility 
 what flickr does
 is it replaces planning with coordination and this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems 
 right you 'll have experienced this in your life whenever you bought your first mobile phone  and you stopped making plans  you just said
  call you when i get there call me when you get off work right  that is a point to point replacement of
 coordination with planning 
 right we 're now able to do that kind of thing with groups to say instead of we must make an advance plan we must have a five year projection of where the wikipedia is going to be or whatever 
 you can just say let 's coordinate the group effort  and let 's deal with it as we go because we 're now
  coordinated that we don 't have to take on the the problems of deciding in advance what to do 
 so here 's another example this one 's somewhat more somber these are photos on flickr tagged iraq 
 and everything that was hard about the coordination cost with the mermaid parade is is even harder here
  there are more pictures there are more photographers it 's taken over a wider geographic area
 the photos are spread out over a longer period of time and
 worst of all  that figure at the bottom  approximately ten photos per photographer 
 is a lie  it 's mathematically true but it doesn 't really talk about anything important
 because in these systems the average isn 't really what matters what matters is this this is a graph
 of photographs tagged iraq
 as taken by the five hundred and twenty nine photographers who contributed the five thousand four hundred and forty five photos  and it 's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer  you can see here 
 over at the end our most prolific photographer
 has taken around three
  and fifty photos and you can see there 's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos  then there 's dozens of people who 've taken dozens of photos and
 by the time we get around here we get ten or fewer photos and then there 's this long  flat tail  
 and by the time you get to the middle you 've got hundreds of people who have contributed only one photo each 
 this is called a power law distribution
  it appears often in unconstrained social systems where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as
  they like
 this is often what you get 
 right the math behind the power law distribution is that whatever 's in the nth position is doing about one nth of whatever 's being measured relative to the person in the first position 
 so we 'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer to have contributed about a tenth of the photos  and the hundredth most prolific photographer to have contributed only about a hundred as many photos as the most prolific photographer did
 the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter  but that basic math accounts both for the steep slope and for the long flat tail 
 and curiously in these systems as they grow larger the systems don 't converge they diverge more 
 in bigger systems  the head gets bigger and the tail gets longer so the imbalance increases  
 you can see the curve is obviously heavily left weighted here 's how heavily
  if you take the top ten percent of photographers contributing to this system 
 they account for three quarters of the photos taken just the top ten percent most prolific photographers  
 if you go down to five percent you 're still accounting for sixty percent of the photos  if you go down to one percent exclude 
  percent of the group effort  you 're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos
 and because of this left weighting  the average
 is actually here  way to the left  and that sounds strange to our ears but what ends up happening
 is that eighty percent of the contributors have contributed a below average amount that sounds strange because we expect average and middle to be about the same but they 're not at all  
 this is the math underlying the eighty twenty rule right whenever you hear anybody talking
  about the eighty twenty rule  this is what 's going on
 twenty percent of the merchandise accounts for eighty percent of the revenue twenty percent of the users use eighty percent of the resources this is the shape people are talking about when that happens 
 institutions only have two tools  carrots and sticks  
 and the eighty percent zone is a
 mean that you cannot
 take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame 
 the institutional model always pushes leftwards  treating these people as employees the institutional response is  i can get  seventy five percent of the value for ten percent of the hires great
  that 's what i 'll do 
 the cooperative infrastructure model says  why do you want to give up a quarter of the value  
 if your system is designed so that you have to give up a quarter of the value
  the system  don 't take on the cost that prevents you from getting to the contributions of these people 
 build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount  so
  how are these people as employees  but rather what is their contribution like right 
 we have over here psycho milt a flickr user who has contributed one and only one photo
 titled iraq and here 's the photo
 right  labeled bad day at work right  so the question
  do you want that photo yes or no the question is not is psycho milt a good employee  and the tension here
 is between institution as enabler and institution as obstacle
  when you 're dealing with the left hand edge of one of these distributions when you 're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time producing a lot of the material you want 
  world you can hire those people as employees you can coordinate their work and you can get some output  but when you 're down
  here where the psycho milts of the world are adding one photo at a time  that 's institution as obstacle
  institutions hate being told they 're obstacles 
 one of the first things that happens when you institutionalize a problem is that 
 the first goal of the institution immediately shifts from
  and the actual goal of the institution goes to goes to two through n 
 right so when institutions are told they are obstacles  and that there are other ways of coordinating the value they go through something a little bit like the kubler ross stages
  phase many  many institutions are still in denial but we 're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining
  there 's a wonderful small example going on right now in france a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool  
 right  because the fact that they have coordinated themselves to create cooperative value
 is depriving them of revenue  you can follow this in the guardian
 quite entertaining
  the bigger question is what do you do about the value down here  
 right  how do you capture that and institutions as i 've said are prevented from capturing that 
 steve ballmer now ceo of microsoft was criticizing linux a couple of years ago and he said oh this business
  of thousands of programmers contributing to linux this is a myth we 've looked at who 's contributed to linux and most of the patches
 have been
 produced by programmers who 've only done one thing right you can hear this distribution
 under that complaint and you can see why from ballmer 's point of view that 's a bad idea right  we hired this programmer he came in he drank our cokes and played foosball for three years and he had one idea
  the psycho milt question is  was it a good idea  
 what if it was a security patch 
 what if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit of which windows has not some [ but ] several do you want that patch  right  the fact that 
  a single programmer can without having to move into a professional relation to an institution
  improve linux once and never be seen from again should terrify ballmer 
 because this kind of value is unreachable in classic institutional frameworks  but is part of cooperative systems of open source software of file sharing of the wikipedia  i 've used a lot of examples from flickr but there are actually stories about this from all
  a service founded so that users could find people in their local area who share their interests and affinities and actually have a  real world meeting offline in a cafe or a pub or what have you 
 when scott heiferman founded meetup he thought it would be used for you know train spotters and cat fanciers classic affinity groups the inventors don 't know what the invention is  
 number one group on meetup right now most chapters in most cities with most members most
  are actually missing the social infrastructure
 that comes from extended family and local small scale neighborhoods so they 're reinventing it using these tools meetup is the platform but the value here is in social infrastructure 
 if you want to know what technology is going to change the world don 't pay attention to
  pay attention to young mothers because they have got not an ounce of support for technology that doesn 't materially make their lives better  
 this is so much more important than xbox but it 's a lot less glitzy  
 i think this is a revolution
  i think that this is a really profound change in the way human affairs are arranged and i use that word advisedly  it 's a revolution in that it 's a change in equilibrium
  it 's a whole new way of doing things  which includes new downsides in the united states right now a woman named judith miller is in jail for not having
 given to a federal grand jury her sources she 's a reporter for the new york times her sources in a very abstract and hard to follow case 
 and journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws the shield laws are our laws pretty much a patchwork of state laws that prevent a
  journalist from having to betray a source  
 this is happening however against the background of the rise of web logging web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization 
  publishing want to publish globally anything you think today  it is a one button operation that you can do for free  that has sent
 the professional class of publishing down into the ranks of mass amateurization and so the shield law
  as we want it we want a professional class of 
  truth tellers it is becoming increasingly incoherent  because the institution is becoming incoherent
  there are people in the states right now tying themselves into knots trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists  
 and the answer to that question is it doesn 't matter  because that 's not the right question journalism was an answer to an even more important question which
  will society be informed how will they share ideas and opinions 
 and if there is an answer to that that happens outside the professional framework of journalism it makes no sense
 to take a professional metaphor and apply it to this distributed class 
 so as much as we want the shield laws the background the the institution to which they were attached is becoming incoherent
 's another example pro ana the pro ana groups 
 these are groups of teenage girls who have taken on web logs  bulletin boards other kinds of cooperative infrastructure  
 and have used it to set up support groups for remaining anorexic by choice  
 they post pictures of thin models which they call thinspiration they have little slogans like salvation through
  these red bracelets which signify in the small group i am trying to maintain my eating disorder they trade tips like  if you feel like eating something clean a toilet or the litter box the feeling will pass 
 we 're used to support groups being beneficial
 we have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial but it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral a support group is simply a small
  to maintain a way of living in the context of a larger group now when the larger group is a bunch of drunks and the small group wants to stay sober then we think that 's a great support group but
 when the small group is teenage girls who want to stay anorexic by choice  then we 're horrified what 's happened
 is that the normative goals of the support groups that we 're used
  came from the institutions that were framing them and not from the infrastructure  
 once the infrastructure becomes generically available the logic of the support group has been revealed to be accessible to anyone  including people pursuing these kinds of goals so there are significant downsides to these changes as well as upsides 
 and of course in the current environment one need
 allude only lightly to
 the work of of non state actors trying to influence global affairs and taking advantage of these this is a social map of the
  hijackers and their associates who perpetrated the the nine eleven attack
  it was produced by analyzing their their communications patterns using a lot of these tools and doubtless the
 the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for for the attacks of last week now 
 this is the part of the talk where i tell you what 's going to come as a result of all of this but i 'm running out of time  which is good because i don 't know
 right as with the printing press if it 's really a revolution it doesn 't take us from point a to point b it takes us from point a to chaos 
   the printing press precipitated two hundred years of chaos 
 now i 'm not predicting two hundred years of chaos as a result of this fifty fifty years in which
 loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage  
 and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives like deciding in advance what 's going to happen or the profit
 profit motive the more leverage they 'll get 
 and institutions are going to come under an increasing degree of pressure and the more rigidly managed and the more they rely on information monopolies the greater the pressure is going to be  
 and that 's going to happen one arena at a time one institution at a time the forces are general but the results are going to be specific
