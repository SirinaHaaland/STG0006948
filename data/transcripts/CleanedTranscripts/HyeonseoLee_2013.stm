  grew up singing a song called nothing to envy and i was very proud in school we spent a lot of time
  although i often wondered about the outside world  
 i thought i would spend my entire life in north korea  until everything suddenly changed  
 when i was seven years old  i saw my first public execution  but i thought my life in north korea was normal
  family was not poor  and myself i had never experienced hunger  but one day in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five my mom brought home a letter
 from a coworker 's sister it read 
 when you read this our five family members will not exist in this world  
 because we haven 't eaten for the past three weeks 
 we are lying on the
  floor together  and our bodies are so weak we are waiting to die 
 i was so shocked  this was the first time i heard that people in my country were suffering 
 soon after when i was walking past a train station  i saw something terrible that to this day
 can 't erase from my memory 
 a lifeless woman was lying on the ground  
 while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother 's face  
 but nobody helped them  because they were so focused on taking care of themselves
  more than a million north koreans died during the famine  and many only survived by eating grass  
 bugs and tree bark  
 power outages also became more and more frequent so everything around me
 was completely
  for the sea of lights in china just across the river from my home i always wondered why they had lights but we didn 't 
 this is a satellite picture showing north korea at night  compared to neighbors 
 this is the amnok river  which serves as a part of the border between north korea
  as you can see the river can be very narrow at certain points allowing north koreans to secretly cross  
 but many die sometimes  i saw dead bodies floating down the river 
 i can 't reveal many details about how i left north korea  but i only can
  that during the ugly years of the famine i was sent to china to live with distant relatives  but i only thought
 that i would be separated from my family for a short time 
 i could have never imagined that it would take fourteen years to live together 
 in china it was hard living as a young girl without my family  i had no idea what life was going to be like as a north korean
 but i soon learned it 's not only extremely difficult  it 's also very dangerous  
 since north korean refugees are considered in china
 as illegal migrants 
 so i was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed  and i would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in north korea
  one day my worst nightmare came true  when i was caught by the chinese police  and brought to the police station for interrogation 
 someone had accused me of being north korean  
 so they tested my chinese language abilities  and asked me tons of questions  
 i was so scared
  if anything seemed unnatural i could be imprisoned and repatriated i thought my life was over  
 but i managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions  
 after they finished questioning me one official said to another this was a false report  
  me go it was a miracle 
 some north koreans in china seek asylum in foreign embassies  
 but many can be caught by the chinese police and repatriated 
 these girls were so lucky  even though they were caught they were eventually released after heavy international pressure
 these north koreans were not so lucky
  koreans are caught in china and repatriated to north korea 
 where they can be tortured  imprisoned or publicly executed 
 even though i was really fortunate to get out  many other north koreans have not been so lucky  
 it 's tragic that north koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive
  even after learning a new language and getting a job their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant 
 that 's why after ten years of hiding my identity i decided to risk going to south korea 
 and i started a new life yet again  settling down in south korea was a lot more challenging than i had expected  
 english was so
 in south korea so i had to start learning my third language 
 also i realized there was a wide gap between north and south 
 we are all korean but inside we have become very different  due to sixty seven years of division 
 i even went through an identity crisis am i south korean or north korean
  where am i from who am i suddenly there was no country i could proudly call my own 
 even though adjusting to life in south korea was not easy  i made a plan i started studying for the university entrance exam 
 just as i was starting to get used to my new life  i received a shocking phone call
 the north korean authorities intercepted some money that i sent to my family and as a punishment my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside 
 they had to get out quickly so i started planning how to help them escape 
 north koreans have to travel incredible distances on the
 it 's almost impossible to cross the border between north korea and south korea  
 so ironically  i took a flight back to china and and 
 north korean border  since my family couldn 't speak chinese i had to guide them
 somehow through more than two thousand miles in china and then into southeast asia
 the journey by bus took one week  and we were almost caught several times one time our bus was stopped
 and boarded by a chinese police officer  
 he took everyone 's i d cards  and he started asking them questions  since my family couldn 't
 as the chinese officer approached my family  i impulsively stood up  and i told him that these are deaf and dumb people that i was chaperoning 
 he looked at me suspiciously   but luckily he believed me
 we made it all the way to the border of laos
  my money to bribe the border guards in laos  but even after we got past the border my family was arrested and jailed
 for illegal border crossing 
 after i paid the fine and bribe my family was released in one month  but soon after my family was arrested and jailed
  in the capital of laos  this was one of the lowest points in my life  i did everything
 to get my family
 to freedom  and we came so close  but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the south korean embassy  
 i went back and forth between the immigration office and the police
  desperately trying to get my family  out 
 but i didn 't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore  
 i lost all hope at that moment i heard one man 's voice ask me what 's wrong i was so surprised
 that a total stranger cared enough to ask in my broken english  and with a dictionary i explained the situation
  and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other north koreans to get out of jail 
 i thanked him with all my heart  and i asked him why are you helping me 
 i 'm not helping you he said i 'm helping the north korean people 
 i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life the kind stranger symbolized new hope
  me and the north korean people  when we needed it most  and he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community
 are truly the rays of hope we north korean people need  
 eventually after our long journey my family and i were reunited in south
  but getting to freedom is only half the battle 
 many north koreans are separated from their families  and when they arrive in a new country they start with little or no money 
 so we can benefit from the international community for education  english language training  job training  and more 
 we can also act as a bridge between the people inside north korea and the outside world  because many
  of us stay in contact with family members still inside  and we send information and money that is helping to change north korea from inside  
 i 've been so lucky  received so much help and inspiration in my life so i want to help give aspiring north koreans a
  i 'm confident that you will see more and more north koreans succeeding all over the world  including the ted stage  thank you
