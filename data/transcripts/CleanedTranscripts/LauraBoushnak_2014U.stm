  as an arab female photographer i have always found ample inspiration for my projects in personal experiences 
 the passion i developed for knowledge which allowed me to break barriers towards a better life
 was the motivation for my project i read i write
  by my own experience as i was not allowed initially to pursue my higher education  i decided to explore and document stories of other women
 who changed their lives through education  while exposing and questioning the barriers they face 
 i covered a range of topics that concern women 's education  keeping in mind the differences among arab countries due to economic and social factors
 these issues include female illiteracy  which is quite high in the region  
 educational reforms  programs for dropout students  and political activism among university students  
 as i started this work it was not always easy to convince the women to participate 
 only after explaining to them how their stories might influence other women 's lives how they would become role models for their
  own community did some agree  
 seeking a collaborative and reflexive approach i asked them to write their own words and ideas on prints of their own images  
 those images were then shared in some of the classrooms and worked to inspire and motivate other women going through similar educations and
  a teacher from yemen wrote i sought education in order to be independent and to not count on men with everything 
 one of my first subjects was umm  el saad from egypt 
 when we first met she was barely able to write her name  she was attending a nine month literacy program run by a local ngo in the cairo suburbs  
 months later she was joking that her husband had threatened to pull her out of the classes as he found out that his
  now literate wife was going through his phone text messages 
 naughty umm  el saad 
 of course that 's not why umm  el saad joined the program 
 i saw how she was longing to gain control over her simple daily routines  small details that we take for granted from counting money at the market to helping her kids in homework 
 despite her poverty
 and her community 's mindset which
  belittles women 's education umm el saad along with her egyptian classmates was eager to learn how to read
 and write 
 in tunisia  i met asma one of the four activist women i interviewed 
 the secular bioengineering student is quite active on social media  regarding her country which treasured what has been called the arab spring she said
  always dreamt of discovering a new bacteria now after the revolution we have a new one every single day 
 asma was referring to the rise of religious fundamentalism in the region  which is another obstacle to women in particular 
 out of all the women i met fayza from yemen affected me the most
  was forced to drop out of school at the age of eight when she was married that marriage lasted for a year 
 at fourteen she became the third wife of a 60 year old man and by the time she was eighteen she was a divorced mother of three  
 despite her poverty despite her social status as a divorce in an  ultra conservative society 
 and despite the opposition of her parents to her going back to school fayza knew that her only way
  to control her life was through education  
 she is now twenty six she received a grant from a local ngo to fund her business studies at the university her goal is to find a job  rent a place to live in and bring her kids back with her 
 the arab states are going through tremendous change and the struggles women face are overwhelming
  the women i photographed i had to overcome many barriers to becoming the photographer i am today 
 many people along the way telling me what i can and cannot do
 asma and fayza and many women across the arab world show that it is possible to overcome barriers to education  which
  they know is the best means to a better future 
 and here i would like to end with a quote by yasmine one of the four activist women i interviewed in tunisia  
 yasmine wrote 
 question your convictions be who you to want to be not who they want you to be  don 't accept their enslavement for your mother birthed you free
