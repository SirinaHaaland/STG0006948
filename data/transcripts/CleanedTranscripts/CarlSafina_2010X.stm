  this is the ocean as i used to know it and
 i find that since i 've been in the gulf a couple of times i really kind of am traumatized because whenever i look at the ocean now no matter where i am 
 even where i know that none of the oil has gone
 i sort of see slicks and i 'm finding that i 'm very much haunted
 by it  
 but what i want to talk to you about today is a lot of things that try to put all of this in context not just about the oil eruption but
 what it means and why it has happened
  just a little bit about me i 'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing ever since i was a little kid and because i did i wound up studying sea birds to try to stay in the coastal habitats that i so loved  
 and now i mainly write books about how the ocean is changing 
 and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly now we saw this graphic earlier on 
 that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to
  it it 's like you dipped a marble in water  and the same thing with the atmosphere if you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball  you would get that little sphere of gas on 
  the right so we live on the most fragile little soap bubble you can imagine a very sacred soap bubble but one that is very very easy to
  and all the burning of oil and coal and gas 
 all the fossil fuels have changed the atmosphere greatly  carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up we 're warming the climate  so the 
 blowout in the gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization 
  so and already affecting animals  
 now in the laboratory if you take a clam and you put it in the ph that is not eight point one which is the normal ph of seawater but seven point five 
  it dissolves in about three days  if you take a sea urchin larva from eight point one put it in a ph of seven point seven not a huge change
  deformed and dies  already 
 commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places 
 coral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem so this really matters now let 's take a little tour around the gulf a little bit 
  things that really impresses me about the people in the gulf they are really really aquatic people 
 and they can handle water they can handle a hurricane that comes and goes when the water goes down they know what to do 
 but when it 's something other than water and their water habitat changes  
 they don 't have many options in fact those entire communities really don 't have many options they don 't have another thing they can do they can 't go and work in the local hotel business because there
  isn 't one in their community  
 if you go to the gulf and you look around you do see a lot of oil you see a lot of oil on the ocean you see a lot of oil on the shoreline  if you go to the 
  site of the blowout  it looks pretty unbelievable it looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car and you just dumped
  in the ocean and one of the really most incredible things i think is that there 's nobody out there trying to collect it at the site where it is
 densest parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic 
 you go in along the shore you can find it everywhere  it 's really messy if you go to the places where it 's just
  like the eastern part of the gulf in alabama there 's still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach  and they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach they 're not allowed to put 
  more than ten pounds of sand in a 50 gallon plastic bag they have thousands and thousands of plastic bags i don 't know what they 'll do with all that stuff meanwhile there are still people trying to use the beach they don 
  't see the sign that says stay out of the water their kids are in the water  they 're getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals it 's a mess if you go to where the
 where the oil has been for a while  it 's an even bigger mess and there 's basically nobody there anymore a few people trying to keep using it  
 you see people who are really shell shocked they are very hardworking people all they know about life is they get up in the morning and if their engine starts  they go to work 
 they always
 felt that they could rely on the assurances that nature brought them through the ecosystem of the gulf they 're finding that their world is really collapsing and so you can see literally signs of
 their shock signs of their outrage  
 signs of their anger
  and signs of their grief these are the things that you can see there
 's a lot you can 't see  also  underwater 
 what 's going on underwater  well some people say there are oil plumes some people say there are not oil plumes 
  going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes 
 but i couldn 't take a submarine ride especially between the time i knew i was coming here and today so i had to do a little experiment myself to see if there was oil in the gulf of mexico  so this is the gulf of mexico  
 sparkling place full of fish  
 and i created a little oil spill in the gulf of mexico
  i learned in fact i confirmed the hypothesis that oil and water don 't mix  until you add a dispersant  
 and then 
 they start mixing  and you add a little
 energy from the wind and the waves  and you get a big mess a big mess that you can 't
  clean you can 't touch you can 't extract and i think most importantly this is what i think
 you can 't see it  i think
 it 's being hidden on purpose now this is such a catastrophe and such a mess that lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream  but as many people have said
  's a large attempt to suppress what 's going on personally i think that the dispersants are a major
 strategy to hide the body because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene 
 but you can see it you can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface  and then it is attacked 
 because they don 't want the evidence in
  we heard that bacteria eat oil so do sea turtles when it breaks up 
 it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria 
 turtles eat it  it gets in the gills of fish  these guys have to swim around through it  i heard the most incredible story today when i was on the train coming here 
 a writer named ted williams
  he was asking me a couple of questions about what i saw because he 's writing an article for audubon magazine he said that he had been in the gulf a little while ago like about a week ago and
 a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide took him out
 to show him what 's going on that guide 's entire calendar year is
 canceled bookings he has no bookings left  everybody wanted their deposit back everybody is fleeing that 's the story of thousands of people
  but he told
 ted that on the last day he went out a bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat 
 and it was splattering oil out its blowhole  
 and he
 moved away because it was his last fishing trip  and he knew that the dolphins scare fish so he moved away from it
  turned around a few minutes later it was right next to the side of the boat again he said that in thirty years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that and he felt that he
 felt that it was coming to ask for help sorry 
 now in the exxon valdez spill about thirty percent of the killer whales died in
  the first few months their numbers have never recovered  so the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be
 variable it 's going to take
 longer for some things and some things i think will probably come back a little faster  the other thing about the gulf that is important is that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the gulf at certain parts of the
  the gulf is a really important piece of water more important than
 a similar volume of water in the open atlantic ocean 
 these tuna swim the entire ocean they get in the gulf stream they go all the way to europe when it comes time to spawn  they come inside and these two tuna that were tagged  you can see them on the spawning 
  grounds very much right in the area of the slick they 're probably having at the very least a catastrophic
  spawning season this year i 'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water
  they don 't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway  but these are really  high performance athletic animals  
 i don 't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills i don 't know if it 'll affect the adults if it 's not it 's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae i would certainly think but if you look at that graph that goes
  down and down and down that 's what we 've done to this species through overfishing over many decades  so while the oil spill  the leak the eruption is a catastrophe
  i think it 's important to keep in mind that we 've done a lot to affect what 's in the ocean for a very very long time it 's not like we 're starting with
  starting with something that 's had a lot of stresses and a lot of problems
 to begin with 
 if you look around at the birds there are a lot of birds in the gulf that concentrate in the gulf at certain times of the year  but then leave  and they populate much larger areas
 for instance most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds they were all on the gulf in may while oil was starting to come ashore in certain places 
 down on the lower
  left there there are ruddy turnstones and sanderlings  they breed in the high arctic  and they winter down in southern south america but they concentrate in the gulf and then fan out all across the arctic  i saw birds that breed in greenland 
 in the gulf  
 so this is a hemispheric issue the economic effects
 go at least nationally in many ways
  the biological effects are certainly hemispheric  
 i think that this is one of the most absolutely 
 examples of total unpreparedness that i can even think of even when
 the japanese bombed pearl harbor at least they shot back and we just seem to be
 unable to figure out what to do there was
  nothing
 ready  
 and you know as we can see by what they 're doing 
 mainly what they 're doing is booms and dispersants the booms are absolutely not made for open water they don 't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated they get near shore look at these two boats that one on the right is called
  and i think you know that 's a great name for boats that think that they 're going to
 do anything to make a dent in this by dragging a boom between them when there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles in the gulf right now with oil at the surface the dispersants
 make the oil go right under the booms the booms are only about thirteen inches in diameter  so it 's just
  absolutely crazy here are shrimp boats employed there are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets here they are working  you can see easily 
 that all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom all they 're doing is stirring it  it 's just ridiculous  
  's adjacent shoreline that doesn 't have any booms there is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them and that lower photo 
 that 's a bird colony that has been boomed everybody 's trying to protect the bird colonies there  well 
 as an ornithologist i can tell you that birds fly  and that 
 and that booming a bird colony
 doesn 't do it  it doesn 't do it  these birds make a living by diving into the water in fact 
 really what i think they
 should do if anything they 're trying so hard to protect those nests
 actually if they destroyed every single nest some of the birds
  and that would be better for them this year
 as far as cleaning them
  i don 't mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds it 's really really important that we express our compassion  i think that 's the most important thing that people have is compassion  
 it 's really important to get those images and to show it  but really where are those birds going to get released to it 's like taking somebody out of a burning building
  them for smoke inhalation and sending them back into the building because the oil is still gushing 
 i refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident  i think that this is the result of
 gross negligence 
 not just bp
  bp operated
 very sloppily and very recklessly because they could  and they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of oversight of the government that is supposed to be
 our government protecting us 
 it turns out that you see this sign on every commercial vessel in the united states you know if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil you would be in big trouble  and you have to really
  wonder who are the laws made for and who has gotten above the laws and there are things that we can do in the future we could have 
 the kinds of equipment that we would really need it would not take an awful lot to anticipate that after making thirty thousand holes in the sea floor of the gulf of mexico looking for oil oil might start coming out of one of them and you 'd have some idea
  of what to do that 's certainly one of the things we need to do but i think we have to understand where this leak really started from 
 it really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there
 because it 's our government meant to protect the larger public interest 
 so i think that the oil blowout
  the bank bailout the mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause  
 we still seem to understand that at least we need the police to protect us
 from a few bad people and even though the police can be a little annoying at times giving us tickets and stuff like that nobody says that we should just get rid of them
  but in the entire rest of government right now and for the last at least thirty years 
 there has been a culture of deregulation that is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from 
 buying the government out from under us
  this has been a problem for a very very long time you can see that
 corporations were illegal at the founding of america and even thomas jefferson complained that they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country 
  people who say they 're conservative  
 if they really wanted to be really conservative and patriotic  they would tell these corporations to go to hell 
 that 's what it would really mean to be conservative  
 so what we really need to do is regain
 the idea that it 's our government safeguarding our interests and regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country that really has been lost
 i think there are signs of hope we seem to be waking up a little bit 
 the glass steagall act which was really to protect us from the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen and the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts that was put in effect in one thousand nine 
 was systematically destroyed now there 's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place but the
  are already there trying to weaken the regulations
 after the legislation has just passed so it 's a continued fight it 's a historic moment right now we 're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe 
 of this oil leak in the gulf  or we will make the moment we need out of this as many people have noted today
  there 's certainly a common theme about needing to make the moment out of this 
 we 've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling the first offshore wells were called whales the first offshore drills were called harpoons we emptied the ocean of the whales at that time 
 now are we stuck with this ever since we lived in caves every time we wanted any energy  we lit something on fire
  and that is still what we 're doing we 're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy 
 and people say we can 't have clean energy because it 's too expensive 
 who says it 's too expensive people who sell us fossil fuels we 've been here before with energy  and people saying the economy cannot withstand 
 a switch because the cheapest energy was slavery energy is always a moral issue  it 's an issue that is moral right now  it 's a matter of right and wrong  thank you very much
