  are some images of clusters of galaxies  they 're exactly what they sound like  they are these huge collections of galaxies  bound together by their mutual gravity  so most of the points that you see on the
  but collections of stars or galaxies  
 now by showing you some of these images i hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects  but more than that i think galaxy clusters are mysterious  they are surprising  
 and they 're useful useful as the universe 's most massive laboratories  
 and as laboratories to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them
 and i think there are four major types  and the first type that i want to describe is probing the very big  
 so how big  well  here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster it is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent 
 it 's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster and in fact if you look very carefully you 'll be able to see rings around
 now to give you a number this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns it 's just mind boggling how massive these systems can get
  but more than their mass they have this additional feature  they are essentially isolated systems  so if we like we can think of them as
  of the entire universe and many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales  such as how does gravity work might be answered by studying these systems 
 so that was very big  the second things is very hot  okay  if i take an image of a galaxy cluster  and i subtract away all of the starlight what i 'm left with is this big blue blob this is in false color
  light that we 're seeing  and the question is  if it 's not galaxies  what is emitting this light the answer is hot gas
 gas in fact it 's plasma  and the reason why it 's so hot goes back to the previous slide
 the extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds  and great speeds means great temperatures  so this is the main idea  but science is a rough draft there are many basic
  properties about this plasma that still confuse us still puzzle us  and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot 
 third thing  probing the very small  now to explain this i need to tell you a very disturbing fact  
 most of the universe 's matter is
  not made up of atoms you were lied to 
 most of it is made up of something very very mysterious  which we call dark matter 
 dark matter is something that doesn 't like to interact very much  except through gravity  and of course we would like to learn more about it if you 're a particle physicist you want to know what happens 
  when we smash things together  and dark matter is no exception  well  how do we do this to answer that question i 'm going to have to ask another one  which is what happens when galaxy clusters collide 
  is an image  
 since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe scaled down versions  
 they are mostly made up of dark matter  and that 's what you see in this bluish purple  
 the red represents the hot gas and of course you can see many galaxies  what 's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge huge
  and this is very important because what it means is that very very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature so 
 it 's very funny  the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter  the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small is precisely because they are so very big  
 fourth thing the physics of the very strange
  certainly what i 've said so far is crazy  okay  if there 's anything stranger i think it has to be dark energy  
 if i throw a ball into the air  i expect it to go up 
 what i don 't expect is that it go up at an ever increasing rate  
 similarly cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding  they don 't understand why it 's expanding at an ever increasing rate  they give the cause
  of this accelerated expansion a name  and they call it dark energy and again we want to learn more about it 
 so one particular question that we have is how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales  depending on how strong it is maybe structure forms faster or slower  
 well  the problem with the large scale structure of the universe is that it 's horribly complicated  here is a computer simulation
 and we need a way to simplify it 
 well  i like to think about this using an analogy  
 if i want to understand the sinking of the titanic  
 the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off  the most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts
  similarly
  i can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies
  so 
 as i come to a close you might feel slightly cheated  i mean i began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful  and i 've given some reasons  but what is their use really  
 well to answer
  i want to give you a quote by henry ford when he was asked about cars he had this to say if i had asked people what they wanted  they would have said faster horses 
 today we as a society are faced with many many difficult problems  
 and the solutions to these problems are not obvious  they are not faster horses  they will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity
  we need to focus  yes we need to concentrate  
 but we also need to remember that innovation ingenuity  inspiration these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out  and i can 't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us
