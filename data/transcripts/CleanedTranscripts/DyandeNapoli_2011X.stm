  i can remember i have felt a very deep connection to animals and to the ocean  
 and at this age my personal idol was flipper the dolphin
  and when i first learned about endangered species i was truly
 distressed to know that every day animals were being wiped off the face of this earth forever  
 and i wanted to do something to help but i always wondered what could one person possibly do to make a difference  and it would be thirty years but i would eventually get the answer to that question 
 when these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the gulf of mexico last year during the
  horrific bp oil spill 
 a german biologist by the name of silvia gaus was quoted as saying 
 we should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released 
 and i could not disagree more
 in addition i believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life and i want to tell you why i feel so strongly
  about this 
 on june twenty three two thousand a ship named the treasure sank off the coast of cape town south africa  spilling one thousand three hundred tons of fuel which polluted the habitats of
 nearly half the entire world population of african penguins  
 now the ship sank between robben island to the south
  a ship named the apollo sea sank near dassen island  oiling ten thousand penguins  half of which died 
 now when the treasure sank in two thousand it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the african penguin which at the time was listed as a threatened
  species  and soon nearly twenty thousand penguins were covered with this toxic oil the local seabird rescue center named sanccob immediately launched 
  a massive rescue operation and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken
  aquarist at the new england aquarium 
 and exactly eleven years ago yesterday  
 the phone rang in the penguin office and with that call my life would change forever  
 it was estelle van der merwe calling from sanccob saying please come help we have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing but completely 
  inexperienced volunteers  and we need penguin experts to come train and supervise them so two days later i was on a
  plane headed for cape town with a team of penguin specialists
  and the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal in fact many people compared it to a war zone
 last week a 10 year old girl asked me what did it feel like when you first walked into that building and saw
  and this is what happened i was instantly transported back to that moment in time 
 penguins are very vocal birds and really really noisy so i expected to walk into this building and be met with this cacophony of honking and braying and squawking 
 but instead when we stepped through those doors and into the building
  so it was very clear these were stressed sick  traumatized birds  
 the other thing that was so striking was the sheer number of volunteers  up to one thousand people a day came to the rescue center eventually over the course of this rescue more than 
 thousand volunteers came from all over the world to cape town to help save these birds and the amazing thing was
  that not one of them had to be there 
 yet they were so for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe inspiring 
 so the day after we arrived two of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two
 room two had more than four thousand oiled penguins in it now mind you three days earlier
  we had sixty penguins under our care so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified at least i was 
 personally i really didn 't know if i was capable of handling such a monstrous task  and collectively we really didn 't know if we could pull this off  because we all knew that just
  half as many penguins had been oiled and rescued 
 and only half of them had survived so would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins we just did not know 
 but what gave us hope were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers three of whom here are force feeding penguins you may notice they 're wearing very thick gloves and what you
  and before long our bodies were covered head to toe with these nasty wounds inflicted by the terrified penguins  
 now the day after we arrived a new crisis began to unfold the oil slick was now moving north towards dassen island  and the rescuers despaired because they knew if the oil hit 
 it would not
 be possible to rescue any more oiled birds and there really were no good solutions but then finally one of the researchers threw out this crazy idea he said ok why don 't we 
  try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled they collected twenty thousand and we 'll ship them five hundred miles up the coast
  three of those penguins peter pamela and percy wore satellite tags and the researchers crossed their fingers and hoped that by the time they got back home the oil would be cleaned up from their islands  
  and luckily the day they arrived  it was so it had been a huge gamble  but it had paid off and so they know now that they can use this strategy in future oil spills  
  rescue as in life we learn from each previous experience  and we learn from both our successes and our failures  
 and the main thing learned during the apollo sea rescue 
 was that most of those penguins had died due to the unwitting use of poorly ventilated transport boxes and trucks because they just had not been prepared to deal with so many oiled penguins at once  
  six years between these two oil spills they 've built thousands of these well ventilated boxes and as a result during the treasure rescue just one hundred and sixty 
  penguins died during the transport process as opposed to five thousand so this alone was a huge victory 
  these training boxes and we used this technique again during the treasure rescue  but
 an interesting thing was noted during the training process  
 the first penguins to make that transition to free feeding were the ones that had a metal band on their wing from the apollo sea spill six years earlier  
 so penguins learn from previous experience too 
 so all of those
  penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned from their bodies it would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin
 when you clean a penguin you first have to spray it with a degreaser  and this brings me to my favorite story from the treasure rescue 
 about a year prior to this oil spill a
  student had invented a degreaser  and they 'd been using it at sanccob with great success so they began using it during the treasure rescue  but partway through they ran out  
 so in a panic estelle from sanccob called the student and said please you have to make more so he raced to the lab and made enough to clean the rest of the birds  so i 
  just think it is the coolest thing that a teenager invented a product that helped save the lives of thousands of
  animals  
 so what happened to those twenty thousand oiled penguins and was silvia gaus right should we routinely euthanize all oiled birds because most of them are going to die anyway  
 well she could not be more wrong 
 after half a million hours of grueling volunteer labor more than ninety percent of those oiled penguins were successfully returned to the wild
 and we know from follow up studies that they have lived just as long as never oiled penguins and bred nearly as successfully 
 and in addition about three thousand penguin chicks were rescued and hand raised and again we know from long term monitoring that more of these 
 chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age than do
 armed with this knowledge sanccob has a  chick bolstering project and every year they rescue and raise abandoned chicks and they have a very impressive  eighty percent success rate this is critically important because
 one year ago the african penguin was declared endangered 
 and they could be extinct in less than ten years if we don 't do something now to protect them
 so what did i learn from this intense and unforgettable experience  personally i learned that i am capable of handling so much more than i ever dreamed possible 
  and i learned that one person can make a huge difference just look at that 17 year old 
  so much larger than yourself is the most rewarding experience you can possibly have  
 so i 'd like to leave you with one final thought and a challenge if you will 
 my mission as the penguin lady is to raise awareness and funding to protect penguins  
 but why should any of you care about penguins  well you should care because they 're an indicator species  and simply put if penguins are
  dying it means our oceans are dying  and we ultimately will be affected because as sylvia earle says the oceans are our life support system 
 and the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming and these are two things that each one of us actually has the power to do something about 
 so if we each do our part together we can make a difference
 and we can help keep penguins from going extinct humans have always been the greatest threat to penguins  but we are now their only hope  thank you
