  in this rather long sort of marathon presentation i 've tried to break it up into three parts  the first being
 a whole lot of examples on how it can be a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer and really address the qualities of the human interface
 these will be some simple design qualities and they will also be some qualities of  if you will the intelligence of interaction 
 then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies new media
 falling very much into that mold 
 again i will go through them as fast as possible and then the last one will be some examples i 've been able to collect  which i think
  illustrate this at least as best i can in the world of entertainment people have this this
 belief and i share most of it that we will be
 using the tv screens or their equivalents for electronic books of the future but then you think my god what a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on tv
 it doesn 't have to be terrible and that is a slide taken from a tv set
 and it was pre processed to be very sympathetic to the tv medium and it absolutely looks beautiful well
 what 's happened how did people
 get into this mess  where you are now all of a sudden  sitting in front of personal computers and
  video text teletext systems and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen 
 well you have to remember that tv was designed to be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal  so you get
  whatever tv and then you should multiply that by eight and that 's the distance you should sit away from the tv
  in front of a tv and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen 
 all of a sudden are staring you in the face the shadow mask the scan lines all of that 
 and they can be treated very easily there are actually ways of getting rid of them there are actually ways of
 of just making absolutely beautiful pictures  i 'm talking here a little bit about display technologies
 let me talk about how you might input information and my favorite example is always fingers i 'm very interested in
  for for inputting to a display in fact they 're not it 's really a very very high resolution input medium you have to just do it twice you have to
 touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly and you can move a cursor
 with great accuracy and so when you see on the market these these systems that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution
 it 's nice that they exist because it still
  is better than nothing  but it in some sense misses the point  namely that fingers are a very very high resolution input medium now 
 what are some of the other advantages  well
 the one advantage is that you don 't have to pick them up and people don 't realize how important that is not having to pick up your
  when you think for a second of the mouse on on macintosh and i will not criticize the mouse
 too much when you 're typing
 what you have you want to now put something first of all you 've got to find the mouse you have to probably stop
 maybe not come to a grinding halt but you 've got to sort of find
  then you find the mouse  and you 're going to have to wiggle it a little bit to see where the cursor is on the screen 
 and then when you finally see where it is then you 've got to move it to get the cursor over there  and then bang you 've got to hit a button or do whatever 
 that 's four separate steps versus typing and then touching and typing and just doing it
 all in one motion or one and a half depending on how you want to count 
 again  what i 'm trying to do is just illustrate the kinds of problems that i think
 face the designers of new computer systems and entertainment systems and educational systems
 from the perspective of of the quality of that interface  and another advantage of course of using fingers is you have ten of them  and
 we have never known how to do this technically so this slide is a fake slide 
 we never succeeded in using ten fingers  
 but there are certain things you can do obviously with more than one finger input  which is is rather fascinating 
 what we did stumble across was something again  which is typical of the computer field is when you have a bug
 that you can 't get rid of you turn it into a feature and
 maybe 
  a mouse is a new kind of bug but the the bug in our case was in 
 we wanted to be able to draw you know rub your finger across the screen to input continuous points and there was just too much friction
 created between your finger and the glass if glass was the substrate  which it usually is
 so we found that that actually was a feature in the sense you could build a pressure sensitive display  and when you touch it with your finger you can
  actually then introduce all the forces on the face of that screen  and
 that actually has a certain amount of value let me see if i can
 load another disc and show you 
 quickly an example
  to the forces both in the plane of the screen x y  and z at least in one direction we couldn 't figure out how to come in the other direction  but
 let me get rid of the slide and let 's see if this comes on
  's just  if you will  pushing on the screen to make a curve but this is the interesting part
   i want to stop it for a second
 because the movie is very badly made  and the particular display was built about six years ago and when we moved from one room to another room
  a rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed so all we have is this this record 
 imagine that screen having lots of objects on it and the person has touched an object
 one of n like he did there  and then pushed on it now
  a program where some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light one is an anvil
 on a
 fuzzy rug and the other one is a ping pong ball on a sheet of glass  
 and when you touch it you have to really push very hard to move that anvil across the screen and yet you touch the ping pong ball very lightly and it
 just scoots across the screen and what you can do
  i didn 't mean to do that
 what you can do is actually
 feed back to the user the feeling of the physical properties so again they don 't have to be weight they could be
 a general trying to move troops and he 's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat
  one that at the interface there are physical properties in that transducer in this case it 's pressure and touches
 that allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before  
 so it 's not simply looking at the quality or  if you will the luxury of that interface  but it 's actually looking at the
  of presenting things that previously couldn 't be presented before i want to move on to another example  which is one
 of a of a
 different sort where we 're trying to use computer and video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book
 here the idea is that you 're going to take this book if you will and it 's going to come alive
  you 're going to sort of breathe life into it we are so used
 to to doing monologues  filmmakers for example are the experts in monologue making you make a film and it has a well formed beginning middle and end and in some sense the art of it is that 
 and
 you then say there 's an opportunity for making conversational movies well what does that mean  and
  of the whole profession and all the assumptions of that medium so book writing is the same thing what i 'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book
 where it is mixed now with all sorts of things live in there but you have to keep a few things in mind one is that
 this book knows about itself
  in the medium itself it 's just not a static movie frame that 's one thing the other is that you have to realize that it is a random access medium  and you can in fact branch and expand and elaborate and shrink 
  that tells you how to do something like penguin and you get to the end of the recipe and it says cook until done
  would be if you will the top green track which doesn 't mean too much  but you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn 't an expert  and say cook at three hundred and eighty degrees 
  for forty five minutes and then for a real beginner  you would go down even further and elaborate more say open the oven preheat wait for the light to go out open the door 
  and that 's a much more elaborate one than you dribble back that 's one kind of of use of random access and the other is where 
 you want to explain the same thing in different ways if you 're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question
  the last thing you do is repeat what you just said  you try and think of a different way of saying the same thing or if you know the particular
  student and that student 's cognitive style then you might
 say it in a way that you think would would have a good impedance match with that student there are all sorts of techniques you will use and again this is a different kind of
 branching  so what i will show you is it 's a rather boring book  but i 'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books
 because your sponsors
  aren 't necessarily
 interested in fiction and entertainment  and this is a book on how to repair a transmission 
 now i don 't even know what vintage the transmission is  but let me just show you very quickly some of it
  for each of these chapters nicholas negroponte now this is his table of contents just a picture of the transmission and as you rub your finger across the transmission it highlights the various parts narrator 
 when i find a chapter that i want to see i just touch the text
 and the system will format pages for me to read  
 the words
  or phrases that are lit up in red are
 glossary words so i can get a different definition by just touching the word  and the definition appears superimposed over the illustration
  about the oil pan or the oil filter and 
  another example of a page with glossary words highlighted in red 
 i can get a definition of these words just by touching them  
 and the definition will appear in the illustration corner 
 i can get back to the illustration  but in this case it 's not a single frame  but it 's actually a movie of someone coming
  into the frame and doing the repair that 's described in the text the two headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie
 at various speeds in forward or reverse  and the movie is displayed as a full frame movie 
 i can go back to the beginning  
 and play the movie at full speed
 's another
  loosen them too far if you loosen them too far you 'll have a big mess nn i suspect that
 some of you might not even understand that language 
 ok  i 'm at the third and last part of this which i said i would make an attempt to
 at least give you some examples that may be more directly related to the world of entertainment and of course  
 good education has got to be good entertainment  so my
 first example will be drawn from
 a
 very recent experiment that we 've been doing in this case in senegal where we have tried to use
  personal computers as
 as a pedagogical medium but not as teaching machines at all
 the whole notion is to use this as an instrument where there is a complete reversal of roles the child is if you will the teacher and the machine is the student 
 and the art of of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of approximates thinking about thinking but teaching kids programming per se is
  utterly irrelevant  and
 there are just a few slides i want to go through but
 there  there 's a story i 'd like to
 to tell  and that was when before we did this in any developing countries we 're doing it in fact in three developing countries right now pakistan colombia and senegal we did it in
 some pretty rough
  areas of new york city  and one child  whose name i 've forgotten was about seven or eight years old absolutely
 considered
 mentally handicapped couldn 't couldn 't read  didn 't even make it in the lowest section of the of the school 's classes
 and was pretty much not in school though physically there  but
  where there were quite a few computers and learned this particular language called logo
 and learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun it was very
 interesting  and one day by chance some visitors from the nie came by
 in their double breasted suits looking at this at this setup  and none of the children who were normally there except for this one child were
  and he said let me show you how this works and they
 got an absolutely ingenuous wonderful description of logo and the child was just zipping right through it showing them all sorts of things until they asked him how to do something which he couldn couldn 't explain
 and so he flipped through the manual found the explanation and typed the command and got it to do what they asked they were delighted and by the time
 it was time to
  go see the principal whom they 'd actually come to see not the computer room they went upstairs and they said this is absolutely remarkable that child
 was very articulate and showed us and
 even dealt with the things he couldn 't
 do automatically with with that manual it was just absolutely fantastic the principal said there 's a dreadful
  because that child can 't read 
 and you obviously have been hoodwinked or you 've talked about somebody else 
 and they all got up and they all went downstairs and the child was still there and they did something very intelligent they asked the child 
 can you read 
 and the child said
  reading is this junk they give me
 in little books to read it 's absolutely irrelevant 
 laughter and i get nothing for it 
  but here with a little bit of effort i get a lot of return and it really meant something to the child the child read beautifully it turned
  that story has many other anecdotes that are similar but wow 
 the key to the future of computers in education is is right there and it is when does it mean something to a child there is a
 myth and it truly is a myth we believe and i 'm sure a lot of you believe in this room that it is harder to read and write
 than it is to learn how to speak
  and it 's not but we think speech my god little children
 pick it up somehow and by the age of two they 're doing a mediocre job and by three and four they 're speaking reasonably well  and yet you 've got to go to school to learn how to read and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you hence it must be harder
  child
 the child can get a great deal by talking to you reading and writing is utterly useless there is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith  
 and that it 's going to help you 
 so what happens is you go to school and people say just believe me you 're going to like it you 're going to like reading and just read and read 
 on the other hand you give a kid
 three year old kid a computer
 and they type a little command and poof something happens and all of a sudden  you may not call that reading and writing but a certain bit of typing and reading stuff on the screen has a huge payoff  
 and it 's a lot of fun  and in fact it 's a powerful educational instrument well  in senegal we found
 that this was the traditional classroom one hundred and twenty kids three per desk
 one teacher a little bit of chalk this student was one of our first students  and it 's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard  
  and she came within two days i want to show you the the program she wrote  and remember her her hairstyle 
 and actually did it
 within two days an hour each day and found it was to her absolutely the most meaningful piece but rooted in that little 
  did she know how much knowledge she was acquiring about geometry and and
 to to my last example and then quit  and my last example as
 some of my former colleagues whom i see in the room can imagine what it will be yes it is it 's our work that was a while ago and it still is my favorite project
 of
  and the reason it remains a favorite project is that we were asked to do
 a teleconferencing system
 where you had the following situation you had five people at five different sites they were known people and
 you had to have these people in teleconference  such that each one was utterly convinced that the other four were physically present
  that is sufficiently
 zany that we would obviously jump to the bait  and we did and the fact that we knew the people we had to take a page out of
 the history of walt disney we actually went so far as to build crts in the shapes of the people 's faces  
 so if i wanted to call
 my friend peter sprague on
  my secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk and that would be the tv used
 for the occasion  
 and it 's uncanny there 's no way i can explain to you the amount of eye contact you get with that physical face projected on a 3d
 crt of that sort  the next thing that we had to do is to persuade them that there needed to be spatial
  correspondence  which is straightforward  but again it 's something that didn 't fall naturally out of a telecommunications or computing style of thinking it was a very  if you will architectural or spatial 
 concept and that was to recognize that when you sit around the table the actual
  go answer a phone or use a bathroom or something the empty seat
 becomes if you will that person and you point frequently to the empty seat and you say he or she wouldn 't agree and the empty chair is that person
 and the spatiality
 is crucial  so we said well  these will be on round tables and the order around the table had to be the same so that at my site i would be  if you will real and then at each other 's site you 'd have these
 plastic
 heads  and the plastic heads sometimes you want to project them and there are a number of schemes  which i don 't want to dwell on
