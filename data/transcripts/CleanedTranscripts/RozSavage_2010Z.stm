  my name is roz savage and i row across oceans  
 four years ago  i rowed solo across the atlantic and since then i 've done two out of three stages across the pacific 
 from san francisco to hawaii and from hawaii to kiribati
  tomorrow i 'll be leaving this boat to fly back to kiribati to continue with the third and final stage of my row across the pacific
  cumulatively i will have rowed over eight thousand miles taken over three million oar strokes and spent more than three hundred and twelve days alone
 on the ocean on a
  foot rowboat 
 this has given me a very special relationship with the ocean we have a bit of a love hate thing going on 
 i feel a bit about it like i did about a very strict math teacher that i once had at school  
 i didn 't always like her  but i did respect her and she taught me a heck of a lot 
 so today i 'd like to share with you some of my ocean adventures and tell you a little bit about what they 've taught
  and how i think we can maybe take some of those lessons
 and apply them to this environmental challenge that we face right now 
 now some of you might be thinking hold on a minute she doesn 't look very much like an ocean rower isn 't she meant to be about this tall and about this wide and maybe look a bit more like these guys you
 'll notice they 've all got something that i don 't 
 well i don 't know what you 're thinking but i 'm talking about the beards
  matter how long i 've spent on the ocean i haven 't yet managed to muster a decent beard and i hope that it remains that way 
 for a long time i didn 't believe that i could have a big adventure  the story that i told myself was that adventurers looked like this 
 i didn 't look the part  i
 thought there were them and there were us and i was not one of them
  so for eleven years  i conformed i did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do i was working in an office in london
 as a management consultant  
 and i think i knew from day one that it wasn 't the right job for me  
 but that kind of conditioning just kept me there for so many years  until i reached my mid 30s and i thought you know 
 i 'm not getting any younger i feel like i 've got a purpose in this life  and i don 't know what it is but i 'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it
 so fast forward
 a few years i 'd gone through some changes 
 to try and answer that question of what am i supposed to be doing with my life i sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary 
 the one that i wanted a life of adventure  and the one that i was actually heading for
 which was a nice normal pleasant life  but it wasn 't where i
  to be by the end of my life i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of  
 and i remember looking at these two versions of my obituary and thinking 
 oh boy  
 i 'm on totally the wrong track here if i carry on living as i am now i 'm just not going to end up where i want to be in five years or ten years  or at the end of my life 
 i made a few changes
  let go of some loose trappings of my old life  and through a bit of a leap of logic decided to row across the atlantic ocean 
 the atlantic rowing race runs from the canaries to antigua it 's about three thousand miles 
 and it turned out to be the hardest thing i had ever done 
 sure i had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone  but what i 'd sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your
  and my timing was not great either two thousand and five when i did the atlantic was the year of hurricane katrina 
 there were more tropical storms in the north atlantic than ever before since records began  
 and pretty early on those storms started making their presence known 
 all four of my oars broke before i reached halfway across oars are not supposed to look like this
  but what can you do you 're in the middle of the ocean oars are your only means of propulsion  
 so i just had to look around the boat and figure out what i was going to use to fix up these oars so that i could carry on  
 so i found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape and splintered the the boat hook to the to the oars to reinforce it 
 then when that gave out i sawed the
 wheel axles off my spare rowing seat and used those
  then when those gave out i cannibalized one of the broken oars i
 'd never been very good at fixing stuff when i was living my old life  but it 's amazing how resourceful you can become when you 're in the middle of the ocean and there 's only one way to get to the other side 
 and the oars kind of became a symbol of
 just in how many ways i went beyond what
 i thought were my limits i suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders and saltwater sores on my bottom
  i really struggled psychologically totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge 
 realizing that if i carried on moving at two miles an hour three thousand miles was going to take me a very very long time 
 there were so many times when i thought i 'd hit that limit 
 but had no choice but to just carry on and try and figure out how i was going to get to the other side without driving myself crazy
 and eventually after one hundred and three days at sea i arrived in antigua  
 i don 't think i 've ever felt so happy in my entire life  it was a bit like finishing a marathon and getting out of solitary confinement and winning an oscar all rolled into one i was euphoric  
 and to see all the people coming out to greet me and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering 
 i just felt like
  movie star  it was absolutely wonderful  and i really learned then that the bigger the challenge  the bigger the sense of achievement when you get to the end of it 
 so this might be a good moment to take a quick time out to answer a few faqs about ocean rowing that might be going through your mind 
 number one that i get asked what do you eat 
 a few freeze dried meals but mostly i try and eat much
 much more unprocessed foods  so i grow my own beansprouts  i eat fruits and nut bars a lot of nuts  and
 generally arrive about thirty pounds lighter at the other end  question number two how do you sleep with my eyes shut ha ha 
 i suppose what you mean is what happens to the boat while i 'm
  i plan my route so that i 'm drifting with the winds and the currents while i 'm sleeping on a good night  i think my best ever was eleven miles in the right direction 
 worst ever thirteen miles
 in the wrong direction that 's a bad day at the office what do i wear  mostly a baseball cap rowing gloves and a smile
 or a frown  depending on whether i went backwards overnight
 and lots of sun lotion do i have a chase boat no i don 't i 'm totally
 self supporting out there i don 't see anybody for the the whole time that i 'm at sea  generally
  and finally  am i crazy  well  i leave that one up to you to judge 
 so how do you top rowing across the atlantic  well  naturally you decide to row across the pacific 
 well i thought the atlantic was big  but the pacific is really really
  i think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps i don 't know for sure that the the brits invented this particular view of the world but i suspect we might have done so we are right in the middle 
 and we 've cut the pacific in half and flung it to the far corners of the world  whereas if you look in google earth 
 this is how the pacific looks it pretty much covers
 half the planet
  you can just see a little bit of north america up here and a sliver of australia down there it is really big sixty five million square miles
 and to row in a straight line across it would be about eight thousand miles  unfortunately 
 ocean rowboats very rarely go in a straight line by the time i get to australia if i get
  i will have rowed probably nine or ten thousand miles in all 
 so because nobody in their straight mind would row straight past hawaii without dropping in i decided to cut this very big undertaking into three segments 
 the first attempt didn 't go so well in two thousand and seven i did a rather involuntary capsize drill
 three times in twenty four hours a bit like being in a washing machine boat got
  i blogged about it unfortunately somebody with a bit of a hero complex decided that this damsel was in distress and needed saving the
 first i knew about this was when the coast guard plane turned up overhead i tried to tell them to go away  we had a bit of a battle of wills  i lost and got airlifted 
 awful really awful  it was one of the worst feelings of my life as i was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter
 and looked down at my trusty little boat rolling around in the twenty foot
  waves and wondering if i would ever see her again  so i had to launch a very expensive salvage operation
 and then wait another nine months before i could get back out onto the ocean again  but
 what do you do  fall down nine times get up ten 
 so the following year  i set out and fortunately this time made it safely across to hawaii  but it was not without misadventure 
 my watermaker broke only the most
  important piece of kit that i have on the boat 
 powered by my solar panels it sucks in saltwater and turns it into freshwater  
 but it doesn 't react very well to being immersed in ocean  which is what happened to it  
 fortunately help was at hand 
 there was another unusual boat out there at the same time doing as i was doing bringing awareness to the north pacific garbage patch that area in the north pacific about twice
  the size of texas with an estimated three point five million tons of trash in it circulating at the center of that north pacific gyre 
 so to make the point these guys had actually built their boat out of plastic trash fifteen thousand empty water bottles latched together into two pontoons 
 they were going
  very slowly partly they 'd had a bit of a delay they 'd had to pull in at catalina island shortly after they left long beach because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone  
 and they were starting to sink
 so they 'd had to pull in and do all the lids up 
 but 
 as i was approaching the end of my water reserves  luckily our courses were converging they were running out of food i was running out of water so we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up 
 and it took about a week for us to actually
  gradually converge i was doing a pathetically slow speed of about one point three knots and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about one point four it was like two snails in a mating dance  
 but eventually we did manage to meet up and joel hopped overboard caught us a beautiful big  mahi mahi which was the best food i 'd had in ooh at least three
  the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier 
 when they opened this one up they found its stomach was full of plastic 
 and this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance  
 it leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it 
 and then we come along and eat that poor critter  and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well  
 so there are very real implications for human health
  made it to hawaii still alive  and the following year set out on the second stage of the pacific from hawaii
 down to tarawa  
 and you 'll notice something about tarawa  
 it is very low lying it 's that little green sliver on the horizon  which makes them very nervous about rising oceans  
 this is big trouble for these guys they 've got no points of land more
  than about six feet above sea level 
 and also as an increase in extreme weather events due to climate change they 're expecting more waves to come in over the fringing reef  
 which will contaminate their fresh water supply  
 i had a meeting with the president there who told me about his
 exit strategy for his country  he expects that within the next fifty years the one hundred thousand people that live there will have to
  relocate to new zealand or australia  
 and that made me think about how would i feel if britain was going to disappear under the waves if the places where i 'd been born and gone to school
 and got married if all those places were just going to disappear forever how literally  ungrounded that would make me feel
  be setting out to try and get to australia  and if i 'm successful i 'll be the first woman ever to row solo all the way across the pacific  
 and i try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues to bring a human face to the ocean 
 if the atlantic was about my inner journey  discovering my own capabilities maybe the pacific has been about my outer journey  figuring out how i can use my
 interesting career choice to be of service
  to the world  
 and to take some of those things that i 've learned out there and apply them to the situation that humankind now finds itself in 
 i think there are probably three key points here  
 the first one is about the stories that we tell ourselves 
 for so long i told myself that i couldn 't have an adventure because i wasn 't six foot tall and
 athletic and bearded
  and then
 that story changed  
 i found out that people had rowed across oceans  i even met one of them and she was just about my size so even though i didn 't grow any taller  i didn 't sprout a beard 
 something had changed my interior dialogue had changed 
 at the moment the story that we collectively tell ourselves is that we need all this stuff that we need oil  
 but what about if we just change that story
 we do have alternatives  and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives those sustainable ones 
 to create a greener future  
 the second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions  
 we might think that anything that we do as an individual
 is just a drop in the ocean that it can 't really make a difference  but it does
  haven 't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters yes there have been the exxon valdezes and
 the chernobyls  but mostly it 's been an accumulation of bad decisions
 by billions of individuals day after day and year after year and by the same token we can turn that tide  we can start making
  more sustainable decisions  
 and when we do that we 're not just one person anything that we do spreads ripples other people will see if you 're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag 
 maybe if we all start doing this we can make it socially unacceptable
 to say yes to plastic in the checkout line that 's just one example this is a world wide community 
 the other point it 's about taking responsibility
  for so much of my life  i wanted something else to make me happy 
 i thought if i had the right house or the right car or the right man in my life  then i could be happy 
 but when i wrote that obituary exercise  i actually grew up a little bit in that moment
 and realized that i needed to create my own future i couldn 't just wait passively for happiness to come and find me
  suppose i 'm a selfish environmentalist  
 i plan on being around for a long time  and when i 'm ninety years old i want to be happy and healthy  
 and it 's very difficult to be happy on a planet that 's racked with famine and drought it 's very difficult to be healthy on a planet
 where we 've poisoned the earth and the sea and the air so shortly i 'm going to be launching
 a new initiative called eco heroes and the idea here is that
 all our eco heroes will log at least one green deed every day it 's meant to be a bit of a game we 're going to make an iphone app out of it we just want to try and create that awareness because sure changing a light bulb isn 't going to change the world  
  that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug mug that is what could change the world  
 i really believe that we stand at a very important point
 in history  
 we have a choice we 've been blessed or cursed 
 with free will we can choose a greener future  and we can get there if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time
