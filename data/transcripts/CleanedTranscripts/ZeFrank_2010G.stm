  you see all the points all the lines it 's incredible it
  and in my case the network has been important in media because i get to connect to people isn 't it amazing through that 
 i connect to people and the way that i 've been doing it
 has been multifaceted for example i get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners 
 i put together projects like earth sandwich where i ask people to try and simultaneously place
  two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the earth
 and people started laying bread in tribute 
 and eventually a team was able to do it between new zealand and spain  it 's pretty incredible the video 's online 
 connecting to people in projects like youngmenowme for example 
  the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult 
 this is the same person top photo james bottom photo [ jennifer ] 
  my favorite of these photos which i couldn 't find is there 's a picture of a thirty year old woman or so with a little baby on her lap and the next photo is a 
 man with a tiny little old lady peaking over his shoulder  but this project changed the way that i thought about connecting to people this is project
 called ray and what happened was i was sent this piece of audio and had no idea
 who generated the audio somebody said you have to listen to this and this is what came to me recording hi
 my name is ray and on yesterday my daughter called me
 because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt
 quite unfair 
 being quite disturbed she called for comfort and i didn 't really know what to tell her because we have to deal with so much mess in our society  
 so i was led to write this song just for her
 just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job and
 i figured i 'd put it on the internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you 're going through on your job
  i 'm about to whip somebody 's
  might not be able to sing that out loud but you can hum it to yourself and you know what the words are and let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job 
 all right  stay strong  peace ze frank 
 so
 yeah no no no shush we 've got to go quickly  so i was so moved by this this is incredible this was connecting
  this was at a distance realizing that someone was feeling something wanting to to affect them in a particular way using media to do it putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact  this 
  was incredible this is what i wanted to do so the first thing i thought of is we have to thank him and i asked my audience i said listen to this piece of audio we have to remix it he 's got a great voice
 came back lots of different attempts one stood out in particular it was done by a guy named goose
  it was incredible that song
  song  somebody told me that it was at a baseball game
 in kansas city in the end it was one of the top
 downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services  
 and so i said  let 's put this together in an album and the audience came together and they designed an album cover and i said if you put it all on this i 'm going to deliver it to him  if you can figure out who this person is 
 because all i had was his name ray and
  this little piece of audio
 and the fact that his daughter was upset 
 in two weeks they found him  i received and email and it said hi  i 'm ray  
 i heard you were looking for me 
 and i was like yeah ray it 's been an interesting two weeks 
  so i flew to st louis and met ray and he 's a preacher 
 among other things 
 so but anyways here 's the thing is it reminds me of this which is a sign that you see in amsterdam on every street corner  and it 's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual 
  world  i look at this photo  and he seems really interested in what 's going on with that button  
 and it makes me think of this on street corners everywhere people are looking at their cell phones and it 's easy to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture  
 but the truth is is life is being lived there 
 when they smile right you 've seen people stop
 all of a sudden life is being lived there  somewhere up in that weird
  dense network  
 and this is it right 
 to feel and be felt it 's the fundamental fundamental force that we 're all after we can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier  but ultimately what we 're trying to do is really connect with one other person 
 and that 's not always going to happen in physical
  it 's also going to now happen in virtual spaces and we have to get better at figuring that out 
 i think of the people that build all this technology in the network a lot of them aren 't very good at connecting with people this is kind of like something i used to do in third grade 
 so here 's a series of projects over the last few years where i 've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection
 sometimes they 're very
  simple things a childhood walk which is a project where i ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that that was sort of meaningless like on the route to the bus stop to a neighbor 's house  and take it inside of google streetview 
 and i promise you if you take that walk inside google streetview you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face  
 and i collected
  those moments the photos inside google streetview and the memories specifically 
 our conversation started with me saying ' i 'm bored ' and her replying ' when i 'm bored i eat pretzels ' i remember this distinctly because it came up a lot 
 right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom  i remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry
  they used some of the morbidly artist footage a close up of chad 's shoes in the middle of the highway  i guess the shoes came off when he was hit 
 he slept over at my house once and he left his pillow it had ' chad ' written in magic marker on it he died long after he left the pillow at my house but we never got around to returning it 
 sometimes they 're a little bit more abstract this is pain pack right after september 11th last year  i was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it the way that we excise it from our bodies so what i did is i opened up a
  hotline a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain not necessarily related to that event and people called in and left messages like this
  so what i did was i took those voicemails and with their permission  converted them them to mp3s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just
 those voicemails and those were then distributed
 to djs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material
  't have time to play much of it you can look at it online 
 from fifty two to forty eight with love was a project around the time of the last election cycle where mccain and obama both in their speeches after the election talked about reconciliation  and i was like what the hell does that look like 
 so i thought well let 's just give it a try let 's have people hold up signs about reconciliation and so some really nice things came together
 blue i voted red together for our future these are very very cute little things right some came from the winning party dear forty eight i promise to listen to you to fight for you to respect 
  you always some came from the party who had just lost from a forty eight to a fifty two may your party 's leadership be as classy as you  but i doubt it 
  as this start becoming popular a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing which i could
 also see  and so i started getting amazing amounts of hate mail  
 death threats even and one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages and he was dressed as as batman  and he said i 'm dressed as batman to hide my identity 
 just in case i thought the real batman
 was coming after me  which actually made me feel a little better like
 so what i did unfortunately i was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of me and it started to eat away at my psyche
 and i was protecting the project from it i realized i was protecting it i didn 't want this special little group of photographs to get
  and i put them together into something called angrigami  which was an origami template
 made out of this sort of vile stuff and i asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the angrigami  
 but this was the emotional moment 
 one of my viewer 's uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate it 's amazing
  last thing i 'm going to tell you about is is a
 series of projects called songs you already know  where
 the idea was i was trying to figure out to address particular kinds of emotions
 with group projects so one of them was fairly straightforward a guy said that his daughter got scared at night and could i write a song for her his daughter and i
  'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself
 to help herself go to sleep and this was scared 
 this is a song that i sing when i 'm scared of something
  the song
  so i wrote that song right thank
 you so the nice thing was is he walked by his his daughter 's room at some point and she actually was singing that song to herself so i was like awesome this is great 
 and then i got this email and there 's a little bit of a back story to this and i don 't have much time but the idea was that at one point i did a project called facebook me equals you where i wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person so i asked for people 's usernames
  passwords to be sent to me  and i got a lot like thirty in a half an hour and i shut that part down  and i chose two people to be and i asked them to send me
 descriptions of how to act as them
 on facebook one person sent me a very detailed description the other person didn 't and the person who didn 't it turned out had just moved to a new city and taken on a new
  this same person laura  ended up emailing me a little bit after that project and i felt badly for not having done a good job and she said i 'm really anxious i just moved to a new town  i 
  have this new job and i 've just had this incredible amount of anxiety so she had seen the scared song and wondered if i could do something  so i asked her what does it feel like
  set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety  and so what i decided to do i said okay i 'll think about it and so quietly in the background  i started sending people this
  whether they had basic
 audio capabilities just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on so i could just get their voices back and this is the kind of thing that i got back
 but what 's awesome is as i started getting more and more and more of them all of a sudden i had thirty forty voices from around the world  and when you put them together something magical happens something absolutely incredible happens and all of a sudden i get a chorus from around the world
  and what was really great is i 'm putting all this work together in the background and laura sent me a follow up email because a good month had passed by and she said i know you 've forgotten about me
  want to say thanks for even considering it and then a few days later i sent her this
