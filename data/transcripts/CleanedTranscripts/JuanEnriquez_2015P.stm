  there 's an actor called dustin hoffman and
 years ago he made this movie which some of you may have heard of called the graduate 
 and there 's two key scenes in that movie the first one is the seduction scene i 'm not going to talk about that tonight
  the second scene is where he 's taken out by the old guy to the pool and as a young college graduate the old guy basically says one word  
 just one word  
 and of course all of you know what that word is it 's plastics 
 laughter and the only problem with that is it was completely the
  let me tell you why it was so wrong the word should have been silicon 
 and the reason it should have been silicon is because the basic patents for semiconductors
 had already been made had already been filed  and they were already building them 
 so silicon valley was just being built in one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven when this movie was released  and the year after the movie was released intel was founded  
 so had the graduate heard the right one word
  maybe he would have ended up onstage oh i don 't know maybe with these two 
 laughter so as you 're thinking of that 
 let 's see what bit of advice we might want to give so that your next graduate doesn 't become a tupperware salesman
  word of advice would you give people when you took a college graduate out by the pool
 and you said one word just one word i think the answer would be lifecode so what 
  the various ways we have of programming life so instead of programming computers we 're using things to program viruses or retroviruses or proteins or dna or
  series of creatures  
 and as you 're thinking about this incredible ability to make life do what you want it to do what it 's programmed to do what you end up doing
 is taking what we 've been doing for thousands of years  which is breeding changing mixing  matching
 all kinds of
  not something new  this humble mustard weed has been modified
 so that if you change it in one way  you get broccoli  
 and if you change it in a second way you get kale  and if you change it in a third way  you get cauliflower  
 so when you go to these all natural organic markets  you 're really going to a place where people have been changing the lifecode
  beginning to practice intelligent design 
 that means that instead of doing this at random and seeing what happens over generations 
 we 're inserting specific genes we 're inserting specific proteins and we 're changing  lifecode
 for very deliberate purposes  
 and that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens let me just give you one example
  some of you occasionally might think about sex  
 and we kind of take it for granted how we 've changed sex  so we think it 's perfectly normal and natural to change it
 what 's happened with sex over time is normally sex equals baby  eventually  
 but in today 's world sex plus pill
 equals no baby
  and again we think that 's perfectly normal and natural but that has not been the case for most of human history 
 and it 's not the case for animals  what it is does is it gives us control so sex becomes separate from conception  
 and as you 're thinking of the consequences of that then we 've been playing with stuff that 's a little bit more advanced  like art 
 not in the sense of painting and sculpture but in the sense of
 assisted reproductive
 technologies  
 so what are assisted reproductive technologies assisted reproductive technologies are things like in vitro fertilization  
 and when you do in vitro fertilization there 's very good reasons to do it sometimes
 you just can 't conceive otherwise  but when you do that what youre doing is separating sex 
  when you have a baby you 've separated when the baby and where the baby is fertilized  
 so you 've separated the baby from the body from the act  and as you 're thinking of other things we 've been doing 
 think about
 twins  so you can freeze sperm you can freeze eggs you can freeze fertilized eggs  and what
  's a good thing if you 're a cancer patient you 're about to go under chemotherapy or under radiation so you save these things you don 't irradiate them  
 but if you can save them and you can freeze them and you can have a surrogate mother it
 means that you 've decoupled sex from time it means you can have twins born
 oh in fifty years 
 in a hundred years two hundred years
  years
  and these are three really profound changes that are not like future stuff this is stuff we take for granted today  
 so this  lifecode stuff turns out to be a superpower  
 it turns out to be this incredibly powerful way of changing viruses of changing plants of changing animals  
 perhaps even of evolving ourselves it 's something that steve gullans and i have been thinking about for a while
 's have some risks 
 like every powerful technology like electricity  like an automobile  like computers this stuff potentially can be misused  
 and that scares a lot of people  
 and as you apply these technologies you can even turn human beings into chimeras  remember the greek myth where
  some of these treatments actually end up changing your blood type or they 'll put male cells in a female body
 or vice versa  
 which sounds absolutely horrible until you realize the reason you 're doing that is you 're substituting bone marrow during cancer treatments 
 so by taking somebody else 's bone marrow you may be changing some fundamental aspects of yourself but you 're also saving your life  
 and as you 're thinking about this stuff  here 's something that happened twenty years ago
 this is emma ott she 's a recent college admittee she 's studying accounting she played two varsity sports she graduated as a valedictorian  
 and that 's not particularly extraordinary except that she 's the first human being born to three parents 
 why because she had a deadly mitochondrial disease
  that she might have inherited  so when you swap out a third person 's dna and you put it in there you save the lives of people 
 but you also are doing germline engineering which means
 her kids if she has kids will be saved
 and won 't go through this and [ their ] kids will be saved and their grandchildren will be saved and this passes on that makes people nervous  so twenty years ago  the
  we study this for a while
 there are risks to doing stuff  and there are risks to not doing stuff because there were a couple dozen people saved by this technology  
 and then we 've been thinking about it for the next twenty years  
 so as we think about it as we take the time to say hey maybe we should have longer studies maybe we should do this maybe we should do that 
 there are consequences to acting and there are consequences to not acting 
 like curing deadly diseases
 which
  the way is completely unnatural it is normal and natural for humans to be felled
 by massive epidemics of polio of smallpox of tuberculosis when we put vaccines into people we are putting unnatural things into their body
 because we think the benefit 
 risk because we 've built unnatural plants unnatural animals  we can feed about seven
  billion people  we can do things
 like create new life forms 
 and as you create new life forms again that sounds terribly scary and terribly bothersome  until you realize that those life forms live on your dining room table 
 those flowers you 've got on your dining room table there 's not a lot that 's natural about them 
 because people have been breeding the flowers to make this color to be this size to last for a week you don 't usually give
  your loved one wildflowers because they don 't last a whole lot whole lot of time  
 what all this does
 is it flips darwin completely on his head  
 see for four billion years  what lived and died on this planet depended on two principles on natural selection and random mutation  
 and so what lived and died what was structured  has now been flipped on its head
 and what we 've done is created this completely parallel evolutionary system where we are practicing unnatural selection and 
  so let me explain these things this is natural selection  this is unnatural selection 
 laughter so what happens with this stuff is we started
 breeding wolves thousands of years ago in central asia
 to turn them into dogs and then we started turning them into big dogs and into little dogs  
 but if you take one of the chihuahuas you see in the herms bags on fifth avenue
 and you let it loose on the african plain  
 you can watch natural selection happen 
 few things on earth are less natural
  you will never under any scenario walk through a virgin forest and see the same plant growing in orderly rows at the same time  nothing else living there 
 when you do a cornfield you 're selecting what lives and what dies 
 and you 're doing that through unnatural selection it 's the same with a wheat field it 's the same with a rice field it
 's the same with a city it 's the same with a suburb in fact  half the surface of earth
 has been unnaturally engineered so that what lives and what dies there
  is what we want which is the reason why you don 't have grizzly bears walking through downtown manhattan  
 how about this random mutation stuff well this is random mutation this is antonio alfonseca he
 's otherwise known as the octopus his nickname he was the relief pitcher of the year in two thousand 
 and he had a random mutation that gave him six fingers on
 each hand  which turns out to be really useful if you 're a pitcher
 how about non random mutation
 a non random mutation is beer  it 's wine it 's yogurt  
 how many times have you walked through the forest and found all natural cheese or
 all natural yogurt so we 've been engineering this stuff now the interesting
  we get to know the stuff better  we found one of the single most powerful 
 instruments crispr inside yogurt
  and as we start engineering cells we 're producing eight out of the top ten pharmaceutical products 
 including the stuff that you use to treat arthritis which is the number one best selling drug humira  
 so this lifecode stuff  
  it really is a superpower  it really is a way of programming stuff and there 's nothing that 's going to change us
 more than this lifecode so as you 're thinking of lifecode let 's think of five principles
 as to how we start guiding and i 'd love you to give me more 
 so principle number one we have to take responsibility for this stuff  the reason we have to take responsibility
  is because we 're in charge these aren 't random mutations  this is what we are doing what we are choosing it 's not stuff happened it didn 't happen at random it didn 't come down by a verdict of somebody else we engineer this stuff 
 and it 's the pottery barn rule  you break it you own it 
 principle number two we have to recognize and celebrate diversity in this stuff  
 there have been at least thirty three versions of hominids that have walked around this earth 
 most all of them went extinct except us
 but the normal and natural state of this earth is we have various versions of humans walking around at the same time  which is why most of us have some neanderthal in us 
 some of us have some denisova in us and some in washington have a lot more of it 
 principle number three we have to respect other people
  some people will choose to never alter some people will choose to alter all some people will choose to alter plants but not animals some people will choose to alter themselves  some people will choose to evolve themselves  diversity is not a bad thing 
 because even though we think of humans as very diverse we came so close to extinction
 that all of us descend from a single african mother and the consequence of that is there 's more genetic diversity
  african chimpanzees than there are in seven billion humans  
 principle number four we should take about a quarter of the earth
 and only let darwin run the show there it doesn
 't have to be contiguous doesn 't have to all be tied together it should be part in the oceans part on land  
 but we should not run every evolutionary decision on this planet 
 we want to have our evolutionary system running  we want to have darwin 's evolutionary system running  and it 's just
  really important to have these two things running in parallel and not overwhelm evolution 
 last thing i 'll say 
 this is the single most exciting adventure human beings have been on this is the single greatest superpower humans have ever had 
 it would be a crime for you not to participate in this stuff because you 're scared of it
  because you 're hiding from it 
 you can participate in the ethics you can participate in the politics you can participate in the business you can participate in just thinking about where medicine is going where industry is going where we 're going to take the world  
 it would be a crime for all of us not to be aware
 when somebody shows up at a swimming pool
 and says one word  just one word if you don 't listen if that word is
