  baby diapers have interesting properties they can swell enormously when you add water to them an experiment done by millions of kids every day
 the reason why is that they 're designed in a very clever way they 're made out of a thing called a swellable material  
 it 's a special kind of material that when you add water  it will swell up enormously maybe a thousand times in volume  
 and this is a very useful industrial kind of polymer  
 but what we 're trying to do in my group at mit is to figure out if we can do something similar
  to the brain  
 can we make it bigger  big enough that you can peer inside and see all the tiny building blocks the biomolecules how they 're organized in three dimensions  
 the structure the ground truth structure of the brain  if you will 
 if we could get that maybe we could have a better understanding of how the brain is organized to yield thoughts and emotions and actions and sensations  maybe we could try to pinpoint 
  the exact changes in the brain that result in diseases diseases like alzheimer 's and epilepsy and parkinson 's 
  few treatments much less cures  and for which very often we don 't know the cause or the origins and what 's really causing them to occur 
 now our group at mit is trying to take a different
 point of view from the way neuroscience has been done
 over the last hundred years we 're designers we 're inventors we 're trying to figure out how to build technologies that let us look at and repair the brain and the reason is the brain is
  incredibly incredibly complicated  
 so what we 've learned over the first century of neuroscience is that the brain is a very complicated network made out of very specialized cells called neurons with very complex geometries  and electrical currents will flow through these complexly shaped neurons 
 furthermore neurons are connected in networks they 're connected by little junctions called synapses that exchange chemicals and allow the neurons to talk to each other
  the density of the brain is incredible in a cubic millimeter of your brain there are about one hundred thousand of these neurons
 and maybe a billion of those connections  
 but it 's worse  
 so 
 if you could zoom in to a neuron and of course this is just our artist 's rendition of it what you would see are thousands and thousands of kinds of biomolecules little nanoscale machines organized in complex
 and together they mediate those electrical pulses those chemical exchanges that allow neurons to work together to generate things like thoughts and feelings and so forth 
 now we don 't know how the neurons in the brain are organized to form networks and we don 't know how the biomolecules are organized within neurons to form these complex organized machines 
 if we really want to understand this we 're going to need
  new technologies  
 but if we could get such maps if we could look at the organization of molecules and neurons and neurons and networks  maybe we could really understand how the brain conducts information 
 from sensory regions mixes it with emotion and feeling and generates our decisions and actions maybe we could pinpoint the exact set of molecular changes that occur in a brain disorder  and once we know how those molecules have changed
 whether they 've increased in number or changed in pattern we could use those as targets for new drugs for new ways of delivering energy into the brain in order to repair the brain computations that are afflicted in patients who suffer from brain disorders  
 we 've all seen lots of different technologies over the last century to try to confront this i think we 've all seen brain scans
 taken using mri machines these of course have the great power
 that they are noninvasive they can be used on living human subjects
 but also they 're spatially crude each of these blobs that you see or voxels as they 're called can contain millions and millions of neurons  so it 's not at the level of resolution where it can 
  pinpoint the molecular changes that occur or the changes in the wiring of these networks that contributes to our ability to be conscious and powerful beings 
 you have microscopes microscopes of course will use light to look at little tiny things for centuries they 've been used to look at things like bacteria 
 for neuroscience  microscopes are actually how neurons were discovered in the first place about one hundred and thirty years ago  
 but light is fundamentally limited  you can 't see individual molecules with a regular old microscope you
  look at these tiny connections  so if we want to make our ability to see the brain more powerful to get down to the ground truth structure we 're
 going to need to have even better technologies
 my group a couple years ago started thinking why don 't we do the opposite if it 's so darn complicated to zoom in to the brain  why can 't we make the brain bigger it
 initially started with two grad students in my group fei chen and paul tillberg now many others in my group are helping with this process we decided to try to figure out if we could take
  like the stuff in the baby diaper  and install it physically within the brain  
 if we could do it just right  and you add water  you can potentially blow the brain up to where you could distinguish those tiny biomolecules from each other  you would see those connections and get maps of the brain  
 this could potentially be quite dramatic  we brought a little demo here 
 we got some purified baby diaper material it 's much easier just to buy it off the internet than to
  extract the few grains that actually occur in these diapers i 'm going to put just one teaspoon here
 of this purified polymer 
 and here we have some water  what we 're going to do is see if this teaspoon of the baby diaper material can increase in size  
 you 're going to see it increase in volume by about a thousandfold before your very eyes
 i could pour much more of this in there but i think 
  you 've got the idea that this is a very very interesting molecule  and if can use it in the right way we might be able to really zoom in on the brain in a way that you can 't do with past technologies  
  you could zoom in it might look something like what you see on the screen 
 polymers are chains of atoms arranged in long thin lines  the chains are very tiny  about the width of a biomolecule 
 and these polymers are really dense they 're separated by distances that are around the size of a 
 this is very good because we could potentially move everything apart in the brain if we add water what will happen is
  absorb the water  the polymer chains will move apart from each other  and the entire material is going to become bigger  
 and because these chains are so tiny and spaced by biomolecular biomolecular distances we could potentially blow up the brain and make it big enough to see
 here 's the mystery then how do we actually make these polymer chains inside the brain so we can move all the biomolecules apart  if we could do that maybe we could get ground truth maps of the
  brain  we could look at the wiring we can peer inside and see the molecules within
 to explain this  we made some animations where we actually look at in these artist renderings what biomolecules might look like and how we might separate them 
 step one what we 'd have to do first of all is attach every biomolecule shown in brown here
  we need to pull the molecules of the brain apart from each other  and to do that we need to have a little
 handle that allows those polymers to bind to them and to exert their force  
 now  if you just take baby diaper polymer and dump it on the brain obviously it 's going to sit there on top  
 so we need to find a way to make the polymers inside and this is where we 're really lucky  
 it turns out you can get the building blocks  
  as they 're called and if you let them go into the brain and then trigger the chemical reactions  you can get them to form those long chains right there inside the brain tissue  
 they 're going to wind their way around biomolecules and between biomolecules forming those complex webs that will allow you eventually to pull apart the molecules from each other  
 and every time one of those little handles is around the polymer will bind to the handle  and
  to pull the molecules apart from each other 
 all right the moment of truth 
 we have to treat this specimen with a chemical to kind of loosen up all the molecules from each other  
 and then when we add water that swellable material is going to start absorbing the water  the polymer chains will move apart  but now  the biomolecules will come along for the ride  
 and much like drawing a picture on a balloon  and then you blow up the balloon  the image is the same
  but the ink particles have moved away from each other  and that 's what we 've been able to do now  but in three dimensions there
 's one last trick 
 as you can see here we 've color coded all the biomolecules brown that 's because they all kind of look the same 
 biomolecules are made out of the same atoms but just in different orders  so we need one last thing in order to make them visible  
 we have to bring in little tags with glowing dyes that will distinguish them so one kind of biomolecule might get a blue color  another kind of
  might get a red color  and so forth  
 and that 's the final step 
 now we can look at something like a brain and look at the individual molecules because we 've moved them far apart enough from each other that we can tell them apart  
 so the hope here is that we can make the invisible visible we can turn things that might seem small and obscure and blow them up until they 're like constellations
  here 's an actual video of what it might look like we have here a little brain
 in a dish a little piece of a brain actually
 we 've infused the polymer in and now we 're adding water  what you 'll see is that right before your eyes this video is sped up about sixtyfold
 this little piece of brain tissue is going to grow
 it can increase by a hundredfold or even more in volume  
 and the cool part is because those polymers are so tiny we 're separating biomolecules evenly from each other  it 's a smooth expansion
  're not losing the configuration of the information we 're just making it easier to see  
 so now we can take actual brain circuitry here 's a piece of the brain involved with for example memory and we can zoom in we can start to actually look at how circuits are configured 
 maybe someday we could read out a memory  maybe we could actually look at how circuits are configured to process emotions how the actual
 wiring of our brain is organized in
  to make us who we are 
 and of course we can pinpoint hopefully the actual problems in the brain at a molecular level 
 what if we could actually look into cells in the brain and figure out wow here are the seventeen molecules that have altered in this brain tissue that has been
 undergoing epilepsy or changing in parkinson 's disease or otherwise being altered if we get that systematic list of things that are going wrong those become our therapeutic targets
 we can build drugs that bind those we can maybe aim energy at different parts of the brain in order to help people with parkinson 's or epilepsy or other conditions that affect over a billion people around the world 
 now  something interesting has been happening  
 it turns out that throughout biomedicine there are other problems that expansion might help with this is an actual biopsy from a human
 breast cancer patient it turns out that if you look at
  cancers  if you look at the immune system  if you look at aging  if you look at development
 all these processes are involving large scale biological systems  but of course  the problems begin with those little nanoscale molecules the machines that make the cells and the organs in our body tick  
 so what we 're trying to do now is to figure out if we can actually use this technology to map the building blocks of life in a wide variety of diseases
  we actually pinpoint the molecular changes in a tumor so that we can actually go after it in a smart way and deliver drugs that might wipe out exactly the cells that we want to you know
 a lot of medicine is very high risk  sometimes it 's even guesswork 
 my hope is we can actually turn what might be a high risk moon shot into something that 's more reliable  
 if you think about the original moon shot where they actually landed on the moon  it was based on solid science we
  understood gravity  we understood aerodynamics we knew how to build rockets  the science risk was under control  it was still a great great feat of engineering  
 but in medicine we don 't necessarily have all the laws do we have all the laws that are analogous to gravity that are analogous to aerodynamics i would argue that with technologies like the kinds i 'm
  talking about today maybe we can actually derive those we can map the patterns that occur in living systems  and figure out how to overcome the diseases that plague us
  you know my wife and i have two young kids and one of my hopes as a bioengineer is to make life better for them than it currently is for us and my hope is
  if we can turn biology and medicine from these high risk endeavors that are governed by
  make them things that we win by skill and hard work then that would be a great advance thank you very much
