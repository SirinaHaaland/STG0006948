  was a high school student a teenager and she came from a really poor family and she wanted to make something of her life
  life and she asked me a simple little question she said what leads to success
 and i felt really badly because i couldn 't give her a good answer
 so i get off the plane and i come to ted and i think jeez i 'm in the middle of a room of successful people so why don 't i ask them what helped them succeed and pass it on to kids
 so here we are seven years five hundred interviews later and i 'm gonna tell you what really leads to
  success and makes ted sters tick and the first thing is passion
 freeman thomas says i 'm driven by my passion
 ted sters do it for love they don 't do it for money carol coletta says i would pay someone to do what i do
 and the interesting thing is if you do it for love the money comes anyway
 work rupert murdoch said to me it 's all hard work nothing comes easily but i have a lot of fun did he say
 fun rupert yes
 ted sters do have fun working and they work hard i figured they 're not workaholics they 're workafrolics
 good
 alex garden says to be successful put your nose down in something and get damn good at it
 there 's no magic it 's practice practice practice and it 's focus norman jewison said to me i think it all has to do with
  yourself on one thing
 and push
 david gallo says push yourself physically mentally you 've gotta push push push
 you gotta push through shyness and self doubt goldie hawn says i always had self doubts i wasn 't good enough i wasn 't smart enough i didn 't think i 'd make it
 now it 's not always easy to push yourself and that 's why they invented mothers
 frank
  gehry frank gehry said to me my mother pushed me
 serve
 sherwin nuland says it was a privilege to serve as a doctor
 now a lot of kids tell me they want to be millionaires and the first thing i say to them is ok well you can 't serve yourself you gotta serve others something of value because that 's the way people really get rich
 ideas ted ster bill gates says i had an idea
 founding the first micro computer software company i 'd say it was a pretty good idea
 and there 's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas it 's just doing some very simple things and i give lots of evidence persist
 joe kraus says persistence is the number one reason for our success
 you gotta persist through failure you gotta persist through crap which of course means criticism rejection assholes and pressure
 so the big the answer to this question is simple pay four thousand bucks and come to ted
 or failing that do the eight things and trust me these are the big eight things that lead to success thank you ted sters for
