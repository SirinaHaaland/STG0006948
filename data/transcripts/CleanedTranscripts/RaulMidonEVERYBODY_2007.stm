  to be in the
  i think it 's difficult to be in the world and not be aware of what 's going on and the wars and so forth
 this song kind of came out of all of that and and
 i wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record
 which i still stand by but this has got something else in it it 's called peace
 on earth
  peace on earth
 this
  peace on earth
 this
