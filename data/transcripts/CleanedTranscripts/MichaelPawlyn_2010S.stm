  a couple of quick examples 
 these are spinneret glands on the abdomen of a spider they produce six different types of silk  which is spun together into a fiber  
 tougher than any fiber humans have ever made  
 the nearest we 've come is with aramid fiber  and to make that it involves
  extremes of temperature extremes of pressure and loads of pollution  
 and yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water it does suggest we 've still got a bit to learn 
 this beetle can detect a forest fire at eighty kilometers away that 's roughly ten thousand times the range of man made fire detectors  
 and what 's more this guy doesn 't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels  
 so these two examples
  give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver  if we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does 
 we could achieve factor ten factor one hundred maybe even factor one thousand savings in resource and energy use  
 and if we 're to make progress with the sustainability revolution i believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about  firstly  radical increases in resource efficiency  
 secondly  shifting from a linear
  polluting way of using resources to a closed loop model  
 and thirdly changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy  and for all three of these i believe biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we 're going to need 
 you could look at nature as being like a catalog of products and all of those have benefited from a 3 8 billion year research and development period 
 and given that level of investment it makes sense to use it so i 'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these
  ideas  and let 's start with radical increases in resource efficiency when we were working on the eden project 
 we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried  
 it was a hell of a challenge  and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues  so for instance 
  it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form that would work regardless of the final ground levels 
 studying pollen grains and radiolaria and carbon molecules helped us devise the most efficient structural solution using hexagons and pentagons 
 the next move was that we wanted to try and maximize the size of those hexagons and to do that we had to find an alternative to glass which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes  
 and in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on
  pressurized membranes  
 so we started exploring this material called etfe  it 's a  high strength polymer  and what you do is you put it together in three layers you weld it around the edge and then you inflate it 
 and the great thing about this stuff is you can make it in units of roughly seven times the size of glass  and it was only one percent of the weight of double glazing so that was a
  and what we found is that we got into a positive cycle in which one breakthrough facilitated another  so with such large lightweight pillows
 we had much less steel with less steel we were getting more sunlight in 
 which meant we didn 't have to put as much extra heat in winter  and with less overall weight in the superstructure there were big savings in the foundations  
 and at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure
 was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building  so i think the eden project is a fairly good
  example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency
 delivering the same function  but with a fraction of the resource input  and actually there are loads of examples in nature that you could turn to for similar
 solutions  so for instance  you could develop super efficient roof structures based on giant amazon water lilies  whole buildings inspired by abalone shells
 there 's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here using nature as a design tool  so now i want to go onto talking about the
 idea the way we tend to use resources is we extract them we turn them into short life products and then dispose of them nature works very differently in ecosystems the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system  
 and there are some examples of projects that have deliberately
  to mimic ecosystems and one of my favorites is called the cardboard to caviar project
 by graham wiles 
 and in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food cardboard and plastic waste it was ending up in landfills  
 now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste  and i 'm just going to talk through this
  so they were paid to collect it
 from the restaurants  they then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding 
 when that was soiled they were paid again to collect it 
 they put it into worm recomposting systems which produced a lot of worms which they fed to siberian sturgeon  which produced caviar  which they sold back to the restaurants
  so it transformed a linear process into a closed loop model  and it created more value in the process 
 graham wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this turning waste streams into schemes that create value and
  just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time there 's a real sense with this project that
 the number of possibilities just continue increasing  
 and i know it 's a quirky example but i think the the implications of this are quite radical because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem waste into a massive
  and particularly in cities we could look at the whole metabolism of cities  and look at those as as opportunities  and that 's what we 're doing on the next project i 'm going to talk about the mobius project  
 where we 're trying to bring together a number of activities all within one building so that the the waste from one can be the nutrient for another  
 and the kind of elements i 'm talking about are  firstly  we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse a bit like this one in amsterdam called de kas 
 then we would have an anaerobic digester which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area turn
  heat for the greenhouse and electricity to feed back into the grid we
 'd have a water treatment system treating wastewater turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro organisms we
 'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen and worms from the compost and supplying fish back to the restaurant 
 and we 'd also have a coffee shop  and the waste grains from that could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms  so you can see that we 're bringing together
  cycles of food energy and water and waste all within one building  and just for fun  we 've proposed this for a roundabout in central london which at the moment is a complete eyesore some of you may recognize this 
 and with just a little bit of planning  we could transform a space dominated by traffic
 into one that provides open space for people reconnects people with food
 and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities
  so the final project i want to talk about is the sahara forest project which we 're working on at the moment it may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago  
 so for instance when julius caesar arrived in north africa  huge areas of north africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests  
 and during the
  the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy  the converse is also true  
 the more vegetation we lose  the more that more that 's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification  
 and this animation  this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years  and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts
 shift quite a lot  and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at
 to to halt or maybe even reverse desertification 
 and if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity this is the namibian fog basking beetle and it 's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert 
 the way it does this is it comes out at night crawls to the top of a sand dune
  because it 's got a matte black shell is able to radiate heat out to the night sky
 and become slightly cooler than its surroundings  
 so when the moist breeze blows in off the sea you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle 's shell 
 just before sunrise he tips his shell up the water runs down into his mouth has a good drink  goes off and hides for the rest of the day  
 and the ingenuity if you could call it that goes even further  because if you look closely at the beetle 's shell there are lots of little bumps on that shell  and those bumps are hydrophilic they attract water
 between them there 's a waxy finish which repels water
 and the effect of this
 is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps they stay in tight spherical beads  which means they 're much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle 's shell  
 so even when there 's only a small amount of moisture in the air it 's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth so amazing example of an adaptation to a very
  and in that sense very relevant to the kind of challenges we 're going to be facing over the next few years next few decades we
 're working with the guy who invented the seawater greenhouse this is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions  and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills 
 and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process  so inside it 's cool and humid which means the plants need less water to grow 
 and then at the back of the greenhouse it condenses a lot of that
  humidity as freshwater in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle  
 and what they found with the first seawater greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside  
 so they just started spreading this on the land around 
 and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area 
 this photograph was taken on completion day  and just one year later  it looked like that so it was like a
  green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land and in that sense going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design  
 so we were keen to scale this up and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits 
 and when you think about nature often you think about it as being all about competition  but actually in mature ecosystems
  just as likely to find examples of symbiotic relationships 
 so an important biomimicry principle is to find ways of bringing technologies together in symbiotic clusters  
 and the technology that we settled on as an ideal partner for the seawater greenhouse is concentrated solar power  
 which uses solar tracking mirrors to focus the sun 's heat to create electricity 
 and just to give you some sense of the potential of csp 
 consider that we receive ten thousand times as much energy from the sun every year as we use in energy from all
  forms ten thousand times so our energy problems are not intractable it 's a challenge to our ingenuity  
 and the kind of synergies i 'm talking about are firstly both these
 technologies work very well in hot sunny deserts  
 csp needs a supply of demineralized freshwater that 's exactly what the seawater greenhouse produces  csp produces a lot of waste heat we 'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater and enhance the restorative benefits 
  in the shade under the mirrors it 's possible to grow all sorts of crops that would not grow in direct sunlight  
 so this is how this scheme would look the idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind we
 'd have concentrated solar power plants at intervals along the way some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts  and with biomimicry if you 've got an underutilized resource
  how am i going to dispose of this you think what can i add to the system to create more value 
 and it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages when you evaporate seawater the first thing to crystallize out is calcium carbonate  
 and that builds up on the evaporators and that 's what that image on the left is
 gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate  so after a while  we could take that out use it as a lightweight building block  
 and if you think about the carbon in that that would have come out of the atmosphere into the sea and then locked away in a building product
  the next thing is sodium chloride you can also compress that into a building block as they did here this is a hotel in bolivia 
 and then after that there are all sorts of compounds and elements that we can extract like phosphates that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them 
 and there 's just about every element of the periodic table in seawater so it should be possible to extract valuable
  in parts of the the arabian gulf 
 the seawater  the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants 
 and it 's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse  now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine
 we could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts  
 transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity
  project is a model for how we could create zero carbon food  abundant renewable energy in some of the most water stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas  
 so returning to those big challenges that i mentioned at the beginning 
 radical increases in resource efficiency closing loops and a solar economy they 're not just possible they 're critical
  i firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems will provide a lot of the solutions  
 but perhaps more than anything what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design
  far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language  but here it 's about synergies and abundance and optimizing  and this is an important point 
 antoine de saint exupery once said if you want to build a flotilla of ships you don 't sit around talking about carpentry  no  you need to set people 's souls ablaze with visions of
  exploring distant shores and that 's what we need to do so let 's be positive and let 's make progress with what could be the most exciting period of innovation we 've ever seen
