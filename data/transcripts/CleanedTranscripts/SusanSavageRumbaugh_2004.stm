  i work with a species called bonobo and i 'm happy most of the time because i think this is the happiest species on the planet 
 it 's kind of a  well kept secret this species lives only in the congo
  and they 're not in too many zoos  because of their sexual behavior 
 their sexual behavior is too human like for most of us to be comfortable with but 
 actually  we have a lot to learn from them because they 're
 a very egalitarian society and they 're a very empathetic society 
 and sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they
 sort of set aside it permeates their
  entire life and it 's used for communication and it 's used for conflict resolution  and
 i think perhaps somewhere in our history
 we sort of divided our lives up into lots of parts 
 we divided our world up with lots of categories  and so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit  
 but i don 't think that we were that way initially 
 there are many
  who think that the animal world is  hard wired
 and that there 's something very very special about man  maybe it 's his ability to have causal thought  
 maybe it 's something special in his brain that allows him to have language  
 maybe it 's something special in his brain
  i don 't know there were tasmanians
 who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire 
 they had no stone tools to our knowledge they had no music  
 so when you compare them to the bonobo
  the bonobo is a little hairier 
  doesn 't stand quite as upright  but there are a lot of similarities  and
 i think that as we look at culture  we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are 
 and i don 't really think it 's in our biology  i think we 've attributed it to our biology 
  but i don 't really think it 's there so what i want to do now is introduce you to a species called the bonobo  
 this is kanzi  
 he 's a bonobo right now he 's in a forest in georgia his mother originally came
 from a forest in africa and she came to us when she was just at puberty about six or seven
  years of age 
 now this shows a bonobo on your right and a chimpanzee on your left  clearly the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking 
 the bonobo  although shorter than us and their arms still longer is more upright  just as we are 
 this shows the bonobo compared to an australopithecine like lucy as you can see there 's not
  a lot of difference between the way a bonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked 
 as they turn toward us you 'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines
 is a little flatter
 and doesn 't have to rotate quite so much from side to side so the the bipedal gait is a little easier  and now we see all
 canopied trees as tall as forty meters one hundred and thirty feet  grow densely in the area 
 it was a japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the bonobo  almost three decades ago 
  by nature very gentle creatures long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them  
 one discovery was that wild bonobos often walk
  go say hello to austin first and then go to the a frame ss 
 this is kanzi and i in the forest none of the things you will see in this particular video are trained
  tricks they all happened to be captured on film spontaneously by nhk of japan
  we need more sticks too 
 i have a lighter in my pocket if you need one 
 that 's a wasps ' nest you can get it out i
 hope i have a lighter
  can use the lighter to start the fire ss so kanzi
 is very interested in fire  he doesn 't do it yet without a lighter  but i think
 if he saw someone do it he might be able to do make a fire without a lighter  he 's learning about how to keep a fire going he
  very happy about this part you 've got to put some water on the fire you see the water
  farther than we can hear  
  's got the pedals down but not the wheel
  she switches from reverse to forward and she holds onto the wheel
  knows that that individual in the mirror is her video narrator 
 by raising bonobos in a culture that is both bonobo and human 
 and documenting their development across two decades 
 scientists are exploring how cultural
  panbanisha is trying to give nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors in the wild
  parent bonobo is known to groom its offspring
 here panbanisha uses scissors instead of her hands to groom nyota 
 very impressive  
 subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this
  nyota tries to imitate panbanisha by using the scissors himself
  realizing that nyota might get hurt  panbanisha like any human mother  carefully tugs to get the scissors back
  kanzi 's learned to make stone tools video kanzi now makes his tools just as our ancestors may have made them two and a half million years ago
 by holding the rocks in both hands to strike one against the other
  he has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows  he can make much larger sharper flakes 
 kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough 
 the tough hide is difficult to cut  even with
  is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making  but difficult to handle  requiring great skill 
 kanzi 's rock is from gona ethiopia and is identical to that used by our african ancestors two and a half million years ago 
 these are the rocks kanzi used and these are the flakes he made  the flat sharp edges are like knife
  compare them to the tools our ancestors used 
 they bear a striking resemblance to kanzi 's 
 panbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods
  something we didn 't think they would do video for several days now panbanisha has not been outside ss 
 i normally talk about language video then panbanisha does something unexpected 
 ss but since i 'm advised not to do what i normally do i haven 't told you that these apes have language it 's a geometric language
  she writing ss 
 she 's also saying the name of that with
 her voice video now she comes up to dr sue and starts writing again ss these are her symbols on
 her keyboard they speak when she touches them video panbanisha is communicating to dr sue where she wants to go
 in the woods  compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard
 panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest
  first we didn 't really realize what she was doing until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it video this lexigram
 to a place in the woods  the curved line is very similar to the lexigram
 the next symbol panbanisha writes represents collar it indicates the collar that panbanisha must wear when she goes out
  requirement video this symbol is not as clear as the others
 but one can see panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines  
 researchers began to record what panbanisha said by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk 
 panbanisha watched  soon she began to write as well
 the bonobo 's abilities have stunned scientists around the world 
 how did they develop ss we found that the most important thing for permitting bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them  
 it 's simply to use language around them  
 because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others that are important to you are saying to you
 once you have that capacity  the ability to produce language
 comes rather naturally and rather freely 
 so we want to create an environment in which bonobos like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting we want to create an environment in which they have fun  
 and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them
  this environment brings out unexpected potential in kanzi and panbanisha 
 panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica  
 until nyota now one year old steals it  
 then he peers eagerly into his mother
  's mouth is he looking for where the sound came from 
 dr sue thinks it 's important to allow such curiosity to flourish
 this time panbanisha is playing the electric piano  she wasn 't forced to learn the piano
  saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest
  kanzi and panbanisha are stimulated by this fun filled environment which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities
  stay away from them now 
 now you can chase them again time to chase
 them now you have to stay away get away run away run 
  now we can chase them again
  we 're learning how to become like them we 're learning how to communicate with them  in really high pitched tones  
 we 're learning that they probably have a language in the wild  and they 're learning to become like us because we believe that it 's not
  it 's culture so we 're sharing tools and technology and language with another species
