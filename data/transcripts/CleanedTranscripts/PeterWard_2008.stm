  this beautiful picture from my childhood i love the science fiction movies here it is this island earth and leave it to hollywood to get it just right two and a half years in the making i mean
 even the creationists give us six thousand
  but hollywood goes to the chase and in this movie we see what we think is out there 
 flying saucers and aliens every world has an alien and every alien world has a flying saucer and they move about with great speed 
 aliens 
 well don brownlee my friend and i finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the tv and seeing the spaceships and seeing the
  aliens every night 
 and tried to write a counter argument to it 
 and put out what does it really take for an earth to be habitable  for a planet to be an earth to have a place where you could probably get not just life but complexity which requires a huge amount of evolution and therefore constancy of conditions 
 so in two thousand we wrote rare earth in two thousand and
  let 's not think about where earths are in space but how long has earth been earth 
 if you go back two billion years you 're not on an earth like planet any more what we call an earth like planet is actually a very short interval of time 
 well rare earth actually
 taught me an awful lot about meeting the public right after i got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention 
 and with all great earnestness walked in david brin was going to debate me on this and as i walked in the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily
 a girl who came up who said my dad says you 're the devil you cannot take people 's aliens away from them
 and expect to be anybody 's friends 
 well the second part of that soon after and i was talking to paul allen i saw him in the audience and i handed him a copy of rare earth and
  jill tarter was there 
 and she turned to me and she looked at me just like that girl in the exorcist it was it burns it burns because seti doesn 't want to hear this seti wants there to be stuff 
  out there i really applaud the seti efforts but we have not heard anything yet and i really do think we have to start thinking about
  major intelligences on earth a mac to a pc and it can 't even get the letters right
 and if they 're fifty light years away  and we call them up and you blah blah blah blah blah and then fifty years later it comes back and they say  please repeat 
 i mean there we are 
 our planet is a good planet because it can keep water mars is a bad
  planet but it 's still good enough for us to go there and to live on its surface if we 're protected  but venus is a very bad the worst planet 
 even though it 's earth like and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored earth like life 
 it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse that 's an eight hundred degrees [ fahrenheit ] surface because of rampant
  we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what 's going to happen to our particular planet 
 we are right now in the beautiful oreo of existence of at least life on planet earth
 following the first horrible microbial age 
 in the cambrian explosion life emerged from the swamps complexity arose  and from what we can tell we 're halfway through 
 we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet
 as they have been here now
  now  till we hit the second microbial age and that will happen paradoxically everything you hear about global warming
 when we hit co2 down to ten parts per million  we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis and there go animals 
 so after that we probably have seven billion years  the sun increases in its intensity in its brightness
  and finally at about twelve billion years after it first started the earth is consumed by a large sun  
 and this is what 's left 
 so a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age and we are in its golden summer age right now  
 but there 's two fates to everything isn 't there now a lot of you are going to die of old age  but some of you  horribly
  going to die in an accident  and that 's the fate of a planet too 
 earth if we 're lucky enough if it doesn 't get hit by a hale bopp 
 or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years we 'll find under your feet but what about accidental death  
 well paleontologists for the last two hundred years have been charting death it 's strange extinction as a concept wasn 't even thought about
 until baron cuvier in france found this first mastodon he couldn 't match it up to any bones on the planet and he said aha
 and very soon after the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been since complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record 
 in that complex record of fossils there were times when lots of stuff seemed to be dying out very quickly  and the father mother
  mother geologists called these mass extinctions 
 all along it was thought to be either an act of god or perhaps long slow climate change and that really changed in one thousand nine hundred and eighty in this rocky outcrop near gubbio 
 where walter alvarez  trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks which held creatures of the cretaceous period and the pink rocks above which held tertiary fossils how 
  long did it take to go from one system to the next and what they found was something unexpected they found in this gap in between
  a very thin clay layer and that clay layer this very thin red layer here
 is filled with iridium  and not just iridium it 's filled with glassy spherules  and it 's filled with quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure shock quartz 
 now in this slide the white is chalk and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean
  the chalk itself 's composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor 
 so that ninety percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff and then you have that  millimeter thick red layer  and then you have black rock  
 and the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom in the absence of plankton and that 's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe because that 's what this was of course this is the famous  k t a
  body hit the planet  
 the effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs the death of these beautiful ammonites 
  over here  and so much else  i mean it must be true because we 've had two hollywood blockbusters since that time  
 and this paradigm from one thousand nine hundred and eighty to about two thousand totally changed how we
  geologists thought about catastrophes  
 prior to that uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past there are present day processes that will explain it  
 but we haven 't witnessed a big asteroid impact so this is a type 
  and it took about twenty years for the scientific establishment to finally come to grips  yes we were hit and yes the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction 
 well there are five major mass
  the last five hundred million years called the big five 
 they range from four hundred and fifty million years ago to the last the k t number four but the biggest of all was the p or the permian extinction  sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions 
 and every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large body impact
  but is this true  
 the most recent the permian was thought to have been an impact because
  of this beautiful structure on the right this is a buckminsterfullerene 
 because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved ' 60s they 're called buckyballs 
 this evidence was used to suggest that at the end of the permian two hundred and fifty million years ago a comet hit us  and when the comet hits the pressure produces the
  and it captures bits of the comet helium 3 very rare on the surface of the earth very common in space  
 but is this true in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety working on the k t extinction for ten years i moved to south africa to begin work twice a year in the great karoo desert 
 i was so lucky to watch the change of that south africa into the new south africa as i went year by year and i worked on this permian extinction  camping by this boer graveyard for months at a time
  and the fossils are extraordinary you know you 're
 gazing upon your very distant ancestors these are mammal like reptiles they are culturally invisible we do not make movies about these  this is a gorgonopsian or a gorgon 
 long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet  sprawled like a lizard probably had a head like a lion this is the top carnivore the t rex of its time
  of stuff this is my poor son patrick 
 laughter this is called paleontological child abuse  
 hold still you 're the scale 
 laughter there was big stuff back then fifty five species of 
  the age of mammals had well and truly started two hundred and fifty million years ago 
 and then a catastrophe happened  and what happens next is the age of dinosaurs it was all a mistake it should have never happened  but it did 
 now luckily  this thrinaxodon the size of a robin egg here  this is a skull i 've discovered
 just before taking this picture there 's a pen for scale it 's really tiny
  this is in the lower triassic after the mass extinction has finished 
 you can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front if that does not survive i 'm not the thing giving this talk 
 something else is because if that doesn 't survive  we are not here there are no mammals it 's that close one species ekes through well
 can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn 't here 's sort of the end of that ten years of work the ranges of stuff the red line is the mass extinction  
 but we 've got survivors and things that
  get through and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods warm blooded animals take a huge hit at this time  
 the survivors that do get through produce this world of  crocodile like creatures there 's no dinosaurs yet just this slow saurian scaly nasty swampy 
 place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes and there they would hide for one
  hundred and sixty million years until liberated by that k t asteroid 
 so if not impact what  and the what i think is that we returned over and over again to the pre cambrian world that first microbial age and the microbes 
  are still out there they hate we animals they really want their world back and they 've tried over and over and over again
  mass extinctions because it did is inherently  anti gaian this whole gaia idea that life makes the world better for itself
 anybody been on a freeway on a friday afternoon in los angeles believing in the gaia theory no 
 so i really suspect there 's an alternative and that life does actually try to do itself in not consciously but just because it does and here 's the weapon it seems that it did so over the last
  five hundred million years 
 there are microbes which through their metabolism produce hydrogen sulfide 
 and they do so in large amounts hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans as small as two hundred parts per million will kill you 
 you only have to go to the black sea and a few other places some lakes and get down
  itself turns purple it turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide 
 and we can detect their presence today we can see them but we can also detect their presence in the past  and the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand new field 
 i am almost extinct i 'm a paleontologist who collects fossils  but the new wave of paleontologists my graduate
  students collect biomarkers  
 they take the sediment itself they extract the oil from it and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups it 's because lipids are so tough they can get preserved in sediment
 and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary and be extracted and tell
  us who was there and we know who was there at the end of the permian at many of these mass extinction boundaries this is what we find isorenieratene it
 's very specific it can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen  and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide enough for instance to come out of solution  
 this led lee kump and others from penn state and my group to propose what i call the kump hypothesis many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen
  by high co2 and the worst effect of global warming it turns out hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans 
 well what 's the source of this in this particular case the source over and over has been flood basalts  
 this is a view of the earth now if we extract a lot of it and each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb actually the effects are even worse 
  material comes to the surface spreads out over the surface of the planet well it 's not the lava that kills anything it 's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it this isn 't volvos  this is volcanoes  but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide 
 so these are new data rob berner and i from yale put together and what we try to do now is track
 the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record and we can do this
 from a variety of means
 and put all the red lines here when these what i call greenhouse mass extinctions took place 
 and there 's two things that are really evident here to me is that these extinctions take place when co2 is going up  but the second thing that 's not shown on here  
 the earth has never had any ice on it when we 've had one thousand parts per million co2 
 we are at three hundred and eighty and climbing we should be up to a thousand
 in three centuries at the most but my friend david battisti in seattle says he thinks
 a one hundred years 
 so there goes the ice caps  and there comes two hundred and forty feet of sea level rise  
 i live in a view house now  i 'm going to have waterfront all right
 what 's the consequence the oceans probably turn purple 
 and we think this is the reason that complexity took so long to take place on planet earth we had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period  they stop complex life
  life from existing  we know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet 
 and i throw this slide in this is me actually two months ago and
 i throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal chambered nautilus it 's been on this planet since the animals first started five hundred million years  
 this is a tracking experiment and any of you scuba divers if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever
  this is off the great barrier reef  and as we speak now these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us  but the thing about this is that every once in a while
 we divers can run into trouble so i 'm going to do a little thought experiment here  this is a great white shark that ate some of my traps  we pulled it up up it comes so it 's out there with me at night so i 'm swimming along and it takes off my leg  
 i 'm eighty miles from shore
  happen to me well now i die 
 five years from now this is what i hope happens to me i 'm taken back to the boat  i 'm given a gas mask eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide i
 'm then thrown in an ice pond  i 'm cooled fifteen degrees lower
 and i could be taken to a critical care hospital  and the reason i could do that
 because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events and our bodies have adapted  and we can now use this as what i think will be a major medical breakthrough  
 this is mark roth he was funded by darpa tried to figure out how to save americans after battlefield injuries he bleeds out pigs he puts in eighty parts per 
  million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal
  mammal into a reptile 
 i believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s i got this email from him two years ago he said 
 i think i 've got an answer to some of your questions 
 so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours 
 and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here on the top now  that is a temperature record of a mouse
 who has gone through the dotted line the temperatures so the temperature starts at
  and down it goes down it goes six hours later up goes the temperature 
 now the same mouse is given eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph 
 and look what happens to its temperature its temperature drops it goes down to fifteen degrees centigrade from 
 and comes out of this perfectly fine here is a way we can get people to critical care here 's how we
  can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care 
 now you 're all thinking  yeah what about the brain tissue  
 and so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen you 're in an accident you 've got two choices you 're going to die or you 're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and say seventy five percent of you is saved
  what are you going to do do we all have to have a little button saying let me die  
 this is coming towards us and i think this is going to be a revolution we 're going to save lives  but there 's going to be a cost to it 
 the new view of mass extinctions is yes we were hit and yes we have to think about the long term because we will get hit again  but there 's a far worse danger confronting us 
 we can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world give us a few millennia and we humans should last those few millennia will it happen again if we continue
 how many of us flew here 
 how many of us have gone through our entire kyoto quota just for flying this year how many of you have exceeded
 it yeah i 've certainly exceeded it we have a huge problem facing us as a species we have to beat this i want to be able to go back
  am i understanding you right that what you 're saying here is that we have
 in our own bodies a biochemical response
 to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind
 proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change peter ward yeah
 every single cell in us can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises  this is what roth has found out
  what we 're looking at now  does it leave a signal does it leave a signal in bone or in plant and we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past ca 
 it 's simultaneously
 an incredible medical technique but also a terrifying
