  one translation of which is the world is sound 
 and in a way that 's true because everything is vibrating in fact all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies 
 so you are in fact a chord each of you an individual
  chord one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony 
 your ears can 't hear that chord they can actually hear amazing things your ears can hear ten octaves  incidentally we see just one octave 
 your ears are always on you have no ear lids  they work even when you sleep 
 the smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just
  the loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that ears are made not for hearing but for listening 
 listening is an active skill whereas hearing is passive listening is something that we have to work at it 's a relationship with sound and yet it 's a skill that none of us are taught 
 for example have you ever considered that there are listening positions places you can listen from here are two of them  
 reductive listening is listening
  down to what 's relevant and it discards everything that 's not relevant men typically listen reductively  so he 's saying i 've got this problem he 's saying here 's your solution thanks very much next that 's the way we talk right guys  
 expansive listening on the other hand is listening with not listening for it 's got no destination in mind it 's just enjoying the journey women typically listen
  if you look at these two eye contact facing each other possibly both talking at the same time 
 men if you get nothing else out of this talk practice expansive listening and you can transform your relationships  
 the trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise surrounding us all the time 
 noise like this according to the european union is reducing the health and the quality
  of the population of europe 
 two percent of the population of europe that 's sixteen million people are having their sleep devastated by noise like that 
 noise kills two hundred thousand people a year in europe  
 it 's a really big problem now when you were little if you had noise and you didn 't want to hear it you 'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum these days you can do a similar thing it just looks a bit cooler it
  looks a bit like this  
 the trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues the first really big health issue is a word that murray schafer coined schizophonia it 's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear 
 so we 're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us i think there 's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia
  the second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression we squash music to fit it into our pocket
 and there is a cost attached to this listen to this this is an uncompressed piece of music 
 and now the same piece of music with ninety eight percent of the data removed 
 music i do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two there is a cost of compression it makes you
  tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data you 're having to imagine it it 's not good for you in the long run the third problem with headphones is this  deafness
 noise induced hearing disorder ten million americans already have this for one reason or another  but really worryingly sixteen
 percent roughly one in six of american teenagers
  as a result of headphone abuse
  one study at an american university found that sixty one percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result
 of headphone abuse we may be raising an entire generation of deaf people 
 now that 's a really serious problem i 'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children please professional hearing protectors are great i use some all the time  
 if you 're going to use headphones buy the best ones you can afford because
  quality means you don 't have to have it so loud  if you can 't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice it 's too loud  
 and thirdly if you 're in bad sound it 's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it protect your ears in that way 
 let 's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that i urge you to seek out wwb 
 wind water  birds
 stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events all
  of it very healthy all of it sound that we evolved to over the years  seek those sounds out they 're good for you and so it this 
 silence is beautiful the elizabethans described language as decorated silence 
 i urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art have a foreground a background all in beautiful
  it 's fun to get into designing with sound if you can 't do it yourself get a professional to do it for you 
 sound design is the future and i think it 's the way we 're going to change the way the way the world sounds i 'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities eight ways sound can improve health 
  first ultrasound we 're very familiar with it from physical therapy  it 's also now being used to treat cancer lithotripsy saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with
 high intensity sound 
 sound healing is a wonderful modality it 's been around for thousands of years  i do urge you to explore this there are great things being done there treating now autism  dementia and other conditions 
 and music of course just listening to music is good for you if it 's music that 's made with good intention made with love  generally devotional music good mozart good
  there are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy  
 and four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved 
 first of all listen consciously i hope that that after this talk you 'll be doing that it 's a whole new dimension to your life and it 's wonderful to have that dimension 
 secondly get in touch with making some sound create sound the voice is the instrument we all play  and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice get trained
  learn to sing learn to play an instrument musicians have bigger brains it 's true 
 you can do this in groups as well it 's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia to make music and sound in a group of people whichever style you enjoy particularly  
 and let 's take a stewarding role for the sound around us protect your ears yes absolutely design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work and let 's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that i played you early on 
 so i 'm going to leave you with seven things you can do
  right now to improve your health with sound 
 my vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things we will take a very big step in that direction so i urge you to take that path  i 'm leaving you with a little more birdsong which is very good for you 
 i wish you sound health
