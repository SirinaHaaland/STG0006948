  soprano singer who studied in rochester new york her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied
 in august two thousand and seven claron was awarded the amsterdam prize for the arts 
 winning praise for her brilliance her amazing and extensively wide repertoire
 and her vivid stage personality  please welcome claron mcfadden
  for me the human voice is the vessel
 on which all emotions travel except perhaps  jealousy 
 and the breath the breath is the captain of that vessel 
 a child is
  born  takes its first breath whah 
 and we behold the wondrous beauty
 of vocal expression mysterious 
  a few years ago i did a meditation retreat in thailand i wanted a place
 where i would have total silence and total solitude i spent two weeks
 at this retreat in my own little hut no music no nothing sounds of nature  
 trying to find the essence of concentration being in the moment
  last day the woman who looked after the place she came and we spoke for a minute and then she said to me 
 would you sing something for me and i thought but this is a place of total quiet and silence i can 't make noise  
 she said please sing for me 
 so i closed my eyes i took breath
 and the first thing that came up and out was
  and i opened my eyes 
 and i saw that she had her eyes closed and after a moment she opened her eyes and she looked at me and she said 
 it 's like meditation 
 and in that moment i understood that everything i had gone to thailand to look for to search for 
 i had it already in my singing
 the calm  
 but alertness the focus  but awareness and being totally in the moment 
 when you 're totally in the moment when i 'm totally in the moment the vessel of expression is open the emotions can flow from me
 to you
 and back
  profound experience 
 there 's a piece by a composer an american composer called john cage it 's called aria it
 was written for an amazing singer
 called cathy berberian and the thing about this piece that 's so special
 if you see it behind me
 it 's not notated in any way no notes
  no flats no sharps  but it 's a kind of structure  and the singer within this structure has total freedom
 to be creative spontaneous for example there are different colors and each color gets
 a different type of singing
  country and western  opera jazz
 and you just have to be consistent with that color 
 you see there are different lines you choose in your own tempo in your own way to follow the line but you must respect it 
 more or less and these little dots these represent
 a sort of sound
 that 's not a vocal not a lyrical way of expressing the voice
  using the body it could be sneezing it could be coughing animals exactly 
 laughter clapping whatever
 and there 's different text there 's armenian russian french english italian 
 so within this structure  one is free 
 to me this piece is an ode to the voice  
 because it 's mysterious
  as we can see 
 it 's quite spontaneous 
 and it 's primal  so i would like to share this piece with you
