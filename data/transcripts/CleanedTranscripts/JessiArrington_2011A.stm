  i 'm jessi  and this is my suitcase  but before i show you what i 've got inside 
 i 'm going to make a very public confession and that is 
  photographing and blogging a different colorful crazy outfit for every single occasion  
 but i don 't buy anything new  i get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores aww thank you
 secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment
 and on my wallet  i get to meet all
  kinds of great people my dollars usually go to a good cause  i look pretty unique  
 and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt i mean what am i going to find today is it going to be my size will i like the color 
 will it be under $ twenty if all the answers are yes  
  i feel as though i 've won i want to get back to my suitcase
 and tell you what
 i packed for this exciting week here at ted i mean what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her  so i 'm going to show you exactly what i brought  
 i brought seven pairs of underpants
 and that 's it exactly one week 's worth of undies is all i put in my suitcase  i was betting that i 'd be able to find
  everything else i could possible want to wear once i got here to palm springs  
 and since you don 't know me as the woman walking around ted in her underwear 
 that means i found a few things  
 and i 'd really love to show you my week 's worth of outfits right now does that sound good so as i do
  i 'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that believe it or not i have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new  so let 's start with sunday  
 i call this shiny tiger you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great you can almost always look phenomenal for under $ fifty this whole outfit including the jacket  cost me $
  and it was the most expensive thing that i wore the entire week 
 monday color is powerful it is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you 're wearing bright red pants if
 you are happy you are going to attract other happy people to you  tuesday  fitting in
  i 've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in 
 just be who you are if you are surrounding yourself with the right people  they will not only get it  they will appreciate it 
 wednesday  embrace your inner child  sometimes people tell me that i look like i 'm playing  dress up or
  you think you look good in something 
 you almost certainly do and if you don 't think you look good in something you 're also probably right 
 i grew up with a mom who taught me this  day in and day out but it wasn 't until i turned thirty that i really got what this meant  and i 'm going to break it down for you for just a second
  if you believe
 you 're a beautiful person inside and out  
 there is no look that you can 't pull off  so there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience we should be able to rock anything we want to rock
 everything and finally  saturday  
 developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word 
 it 's been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i 'm wearing and we 've had great conversations  
 so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase
  before i go home to brooklyn i 'm going to donate everything back because the lesson i 'm trying to learn myself this week
 is that it 's okay to let go 
 i don 't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner there is always going to be another crazy 
 colorful  shiny outfit just waiting
 for me if i put a little love in my heart and look thank you very much
