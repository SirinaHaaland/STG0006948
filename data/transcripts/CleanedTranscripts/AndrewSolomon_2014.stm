  as a student of adversity  
 i 've been struck over the years by how some people with major challenges seem to draw strength from them 
 and i 've heard the popular wisdom that that has to do with finding meaning and for a long time
  i thought the meaning was out there some great truth waiting to be found 
 but over time  i 've come to feel that the truth is irrelevant 
 we call it finding meaning but we might better call it forging meaning 
 my last book was about how families manage to deal with
  various kinds of challenging
 or unusual offspring 
 and one of the mothers i interviewed who had two children with multiple severe disabilities said to me 
 people always give us these little sayings like ' god doesn 't give you any more than you can handle '
 but children like ours are not preordained as a gift they
 're a gift because that 's what we have chosen
  choices
 all our lives  when i was in second grade  bobby finkel had a birthday party
 and invited everyone in our class but me 
 my mother assumed there had been some sort of error and she called mrs finkel who said that bobby didn 't like me
 and didn 't want me at his party and that day my mom took me to the zoo
 and out for a hot fudge sundae 
 when i was in seventh grade  one of the kids on my school bus nicknamed me percy as a shorthand for my demeanor  
 and sometimes he and his cohort would chant that provocation the entire school bus ride
  when i was in eighth grade  
 our science teacher told us that all male homosexuals develop fecal incontinence because of the trauma to their anal sphincter  
 and i graduated high school without ever going to the cafeteria where i would have sat with the girls and been laughed at for doing so 
 or sat with the boys
  and been laughed at for being a boy who should be sitting with the girls 
 i survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance what i didn 't know then
 and do know now is that avoidance and endurance can be the entryway to forging meaning 
  after you 've forged meaning  you need to incorporate that meaning into a new identity  
 you need to take the traumas and make them part of who you 've come to be 
 and you need to fold the worst events of your life into a narrative of triumph  
 evincing a better self in response to things that hurt 
 one of the other mothers i interviewed when i was working on my book
 had been raped as an adolescent
  and had a child following that rape  which had thrown away her career plans and damaged all of her emotional relationships 
 but when i met her she was fifty  
 and i said to her do you often think about the man who raped you and she said i used to think about him
  with anger but now only with pity 
 and i thought she meant pity because he was so unevolved as to have done this terrible thing  
 and i said pity and she said yes because he has a beautiful daughter
 and two beautiful grandchildren  and he doesn 't know that and i do 
 so as it turns out i 'm the lucky one some
 of our struggles are things we 're born to
 our gender our sexuality our race our disability  
 and some are things that happen to us being a political prisoner being a rape victim being a katrina survivor 
 identity involves entering a community to draw strength from that community 
  i am here but i have cancer but rather i have cancer
 and i am here when we 're ashamed  we can 't tell our stories and stories are the foundation
 of identity  
  that became my mantra forging meaning is about changing yourself building identity is about changing the world 
 all of us with stigmatized identities face this question daily how much to accommodate society by constraining
  and how much to break the limits of what constitutes a valid life 
 forging meaning and building identity does not make what was wrong right 
 it only makes what was wrong precious  
 in january of this year  i went to myanmar to interview political prisoners  
 and i was surprised to find them less bitter than i 'd anticipated 
 most of them had knowingly
  committed the offenses that landed them in prison  and they had walked in with their heads held high  and they walked out
 with their heads still held high many years later
 a leading human rights activist who had nearly died in prison and had spent many years in solitary confinement
  told me she was grateful to her jailers for the time she had had to think for the wisdom she had gained for the chance to hone her meditation skills 
 she had sought meaning and made her travail into a crucial identity  
 but if the people i met were less bitter than i 'd anticipated about being in prison  they were also less thrilled than i 'd expected about the reform process going on in their country
  ma thida said we burmese are noted for our tremendous grace under pressure  
 but we also have grievance under glamour 
 she said and the fact that there have been these shifts and changes doesn 't erase the continuing problems in our society
 that we learned to see so well while we were in prison i understood her to be saying
  saying that concessions confer only a little humanity where full humanity is due that crumbs
 are not the same as a place at the table 
 which is to say you can forge meaning and build identity and still be mad as hell
  i 've never
  and i 've never been in anything remotely approaching a burmese prison  but as a gay american  i 've experienced prejudice
 and even hatred  and i 've forged meaning
 and i 've built identity  which is a move i learned from people who had experienced far worse privation
 than i 've ever known in my own
  i went to extreme lengths to try to be straight  
 i enrolled myself in something called sexual surrogacy therapy 
 in which people i was encouraged to call doctors prescribed what i was encouraged to call exercises with women i was encouraged to call surrogates 
 who were not exactly prostitutes but who were also not exactly anything else
  favorite was a blonde woman from the deep south who eventually admitted to me that she was really a necrophiliac and had taken this job after she got in trouble down at the morgue 
 these experiences
  allowed me to have some happy physical relationships with women for which i 'm grateful but i was at war with myself 
 and i dug terrible wounds into my own psyche  
 we don 't seek the painful experiences that hew our identities  
 but we seek our identities in the wake of painful experiences we cannot
 cannot bear a pointless torment  but we can endure great pain
 if we believe that it 's purposeful 
 ease makes less of an impression on us than struggle we could have been ourselves without our delights  
 but not without the misfortunes that drive our search for meaning 
 therefore i take pleasure in infirmities st paul wrote in second corinthians
  i went to moscow to interview artists of the soviet underground i expected their work to be dissident and political 
 but the radicalism in their work actually lay in reinserting humanity into a society that was annihilating humanity itself 
 as in some senses
  russian society is now doing again one of the artists i met said to me we were in training to be not artists
 but angels in  one thousand nine hundred and ninety one i went back to see the artists i 'd been writing about  and i was with them during the putsch
 that ended the soviet union  and they were among the chief organizers of the resistance to that putsch and on the third day
 of the putsch one of them suggested we walk up to
 and we went there  and we arranged ourselves in front of one of the barricades and a little while later a column of tanks rolled up  
 and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this barricade if you get out of the way we don 't need to hurt you  but if you won 't move we 'll have no choice but to run you down 
 the artist i was with said give us just a minute
 give us just a minute to tell you why we 're here 
 and the soldier folded his arms  and the artist launched into a jeffersonian panegyric to democracy such as those of us who live in a jeffersonian democracy would be hard pressed to present  
 and they went on and on and
  and then he sat there for a full minute after they were finished
 and looked at us so bedraggled in the rain  and said 
 what you have said is true  and we must bow to the will of the people 
 if you 'll clear enough space for us to turn around we 'll go back the way we came 
 and that 's what they did sometimes  forging meaning can give you the vocabulary you need to fight for your ultimate freedom
  russia awakened me to the lemonade notion that oppression breeds the power to oppose it  and i gradually understood that as the cornerstone
 of identity  it took identity
 to rescue me from sadness the gay rights movement posits a world in which my  aberrances are a victory
  identity politics always works on two fronts to give pride to people who have a given condition or characteristic and to cause the outside world to treat such people more gently and more kindly 
 those are two totally separate enterprises  but progress in each sphere reverberates in the other 
 identity politics can be narcissistic people extol a difference only because it 's theirs people narrow the world
  and function in discrete groups without empathy for one another  but properly understood
 and wisely practiced identity politics should expand our idea of what it is to be human 
 identity itself should be not a smug label
 or a gold medal  but a revolution i would have had an easier life if i were straight
 but i would not be me 
 and i now like being myself better than the idea of being someone else  someone who to be honest i have neither the option of being nor the ability fully to imagine  
 but if you banish the dragons you banish the heroes  and we become attached to the heroic
 strain in our own lives  
 i 've sometimes wondered whether i could have ceased to hate that part of myself without gay pride 's technicolor fiesta of which this speech is one manifestation 
 laughter i used to think i would know myself to be mature when i could simply be gay without emphasis  
 but the self loathing of that period left a void  and celebration needs to fill and overflow it 
 and even if i repay my private debt of melancholy
 there 's still an outer world of homophobia that it will take decades to address  
 someday being gay will be a simple fact free of party hats and blame  but not yet 
 a friend of mine who thought gay pride was getting very carried away with itself once suggested that we
  it 's a great idea but its time has not yet come 
 and neutrality which seems to lie halfway between despair and celebration is actually the endgame
 in twenty nine states in the us i could legally be fired or denied housing
 for being gay
  gay 
 in russia the anti propaganda law has led to people being beaten in the streets
 twenty seven african countries have passed laws against sodomy  and in nigeria gay people can legally be stoned to death  and lynchings have become common 
 in saudi arabia recently
  two men who had been caught in carnal acts were sentenced to seven thousand lashes each 
 and are now permanently disabled as a result 
 so who can forge meaning
 and build identity  
 gay rights are not primarily marriage rights and for the millions who live in unaccepting places with no resources  dignity
  i am lucky to have forged meaning
 and built identity  
 but that 's still a rare privilege  and gay people deserve more collectively than the crumbs of justice  
 and yet  every step forward
 is so sweet 
 in two thousand and seven six years after we met my partner and i decided to get married  meeting john had been the discovery
 of great happiness
 and also the elimination of great unhappiness  and sometimes i was so occupied with the disappearance of all that pain 
 that i forgot about the joy  
 which was at first the less remarkable part of it to me  
 marrying was a way to declare our love as more a presence
 than an absence marriage soon led us to children
 and that meant new meanings
 and new identities
 ours and theirs  
 i want my children to be happy  and i love them most achingly when they are sad 
 as a gay father  i can teach them to own what is wrong in their lives  
 but i believe that if i succeed in sheltering them from adversity  i will have failed as a parent
 a buddhist scholar i know once explained to me that westerners mistakenly think that nirvana is what arrives when all your woe is behind you 
 and you have only bliss to look forward to 
 but he said that would not be nirvana because your bliss in the present would always be shadowed by the joy from the past 
 nirvana he said is what you arrive at when you have
  only bliss to look forward to and find in what looked like sorrows the seedlings of your joy  
 and i sometimes wonder whether i could have found such fulfillment in marriage and children if they 'd come more readily 
 if i 'd been straight in my youth or were young now in either of which cases
  this might be easier  
 perhaps i could  perhaps all the complex imagining i 've done could have been applied to other topics  
 but if seeking meaning matters more than finding meaning  the question is not whether i 'd be happier for having been bullied  but whether assigning meaning to those experiences has made me a better father  
 i tend to find the ecstasy hidden in ordinary joys because i did not expect those joys to be ordinary to me
 i know many heterosexuals who have equally happy marriages and families 
 but gay marriage is so breathtakingly fresh  and gay families so exhilaratingly new 
 and i found meaning
 in that surprise in october it was my 50th birthday  and my family
  a party for me and in the middle of it my son said to my husband that he wanted to make a speech  and john said george 
 you can 't make a speech 
 only grandpa and uncle david and i are going to make speeches tonight 
 but george insisted and insisted and finally john took him up to the microphone  
 and
 george said very loudly
  i have your attention please and everyone turned around  startled  and george said 
 i 'm glad it 's daddy 's birthday  i 'm glad we all get cake
  and daddy if you were little i 'd be your friend 
 i thought that i was indebted even to bobby finkel because all those earlier experiences were what had propelled me to this moment  and i was finally 
 unconditionally grateful for a life i 'd once have done anything to change 
  and harvey milk said go out and tell someone 
 there 's always somebody who wants to confiscate our humanity and there are always stories that restore it 
 if we live out loud  we can trounce the hatred  and expand everyone 's lives  
 forge meaning  build identity  forge meaning  build
 identity and then invite the world to share your joy
