  there was a star like everything else  she was born  grew to be around thirty times the mass of our sun
 and lived for a very long time 
  exactly how long people cannot really tell  just like everything in life  she reached the end of her regular star days
 when her heart  the core of her life  exhausted its fuel  
 but that was no end  she transformed into a supernova  and in the process releasing a tremendous amount of energy outshining the rest of the galaxy
 and emitting 
 one second the same amount of energy our sun will release in ten days  and she evolved into another role in our galaxy 
 supernova explosions are very extreme  but the ones that emit gamma rays are even more extreme 
 in the process of becoming a supernova  the interior of the star collapses under its own weight and it starts rotating ever faster 
 like an ice skater when pulling their arms in close to their body
 in that way it starts rotating very fast and it increases  powerfully its magnetic field 
 the matter around the star is dragged around  and some energy from that rotation is transferred to that matter and the magnetic field is increased even further 
 in that way our star had extra energy to outshine the rest of the galaxy in brightness and gamma ray emission
 my star the one in my story became what is known as a magnetar  and just for your information the magnetic field of a magnetar is one thousand trillion times the magnetic field of earth  
 the most energetic events ever measured by astronomers carry the name gamma ray bursts because we observe them as bursts most or explosions most strongly measured
 gamma ray light our star like the one in our story that became
 a magnetar is detected as a gamma ray burst during the most energetic portion of the explosion  yet  even though 
 strongest events ever measured by astronomers  we cannot see them with our naked eye  we depend we rely on other methods in order
  to study this gamma ray light  we cannot see them with our naked eye  we can only see an itty bitty tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we call visible light 
 and beyond that we rely on other methods  yet as astronomers we study a wider range of light and we depend on other methods
  to do that on the screen it may look like this 
 you 're seeing a plot 
 that is a light curve it 's a plot of intensity of light over time  it is a gamma ray light curve 
 sighted astronomers depend on this kind of plot
 in order to interpret how this light intensity changes over time 
 on the left you will be seeing the light intensity without a burst  and on the
  right  you will be seeing the light intensity with the burst  
 early during my career  i could also see this kind of plot  
 but then  i lost my sight i completely lost my sight because of extended illness 
 and with it  i lost the opportunity to see this plot
 and the opportunity to do my physics  it was a very strong transition
  for me in many ways  
 and professionally  
 it left me without a way to do my science  
 i longed to access and scrutinize this energetic light and figure out the astrophysical cause  
 i wanted to experience the spacious wonder the excitement the joy produced by the detection of such a titanic celestial event 
 i thought long
  and hard about it when i suddenly realized that all a light curve is is a table of numbers converted into a visual plot 
 so along with my collaborators  we worked really hard and we translated the numbers into sound  
 i achieved access to the data and today i 'm able to do physics at the level of the best astronomer using sound
  what people have been able to do mainly visually for hundreds of years now i do it using
 this is scientific data converted into sound 
 and it 's mapped in pitch the process is called
 so listening to this brought something to the ear besides the obvious burst when i examine the very
  characteristic of electrically charged gasses like the solar wind  
 and i want you to hear what i heard you will hear it as a very fast decrease in volume  and because you 're sighted i 'm giving you a red line
  i think you heard it right so what we found is that the bursts last long enough in order
  which are things
 caused by exchanges of energy between particles that may have been excited that depend on the volume  
 you may remember that i said that the matter around the star is dragged around  
 it transmits power with frequency and field distribution determined by the dimensions
 you may remember that we were talking about a 
 star that became a very strong magnetic field magnetar  
 if this is the case then outflows from the exploding star may be associated with this gamma ray burst what does that mean 
 that star formation may be a very important part of these supernova explosions  
 listening to this very gamma ray burst brought us to the notion that the use of sound as an adjunctive visual display may also support sighted astronomers in the search for more information in the data
 simultaneously  i worked on analyzing measurements from other telescopes and my experiments demonstrated
 that when you use sound as an adjunctive visual display 
 astronomers can find more information in this now more accessible data set
 this ability to transform data into sound gives astronomy a tremendous power of
  transformation 
 and the fact that a field that is so visual may be improved in order to include anyone with interest in understanding what lies in the heavens is a spirit lifter 
 when i lost my sight i noticed that i didn 't have access to the same amount and quality of information a sighted astronomer had 
 it was not until we innovated with
 regained the hope to be a productive member
 of the field that i had worked so hard to be part of  yet information access is not the only area in astronomy where
 where this is important the situation is systemic
 and scientific fields are not keeping up
  is something changeable
 anyone may develop a disability at any point
 let 's think about for example scientists that are already at the top of their careers what happens to them if they develop a disability 
 will they feel excommunicated as i did 
 information access empowers us to flourish  
 it gives us equal opportunities to display our talents and choose what we want to do with our lives  
 based on interest and not based on
  potential barriers 
 when we give people the opportunity to succeed without limits that will lead to personal fulfillment and prospering life  
 and i think that the use of sound in astronomy is helping us to achieve that and to contribute to science  
 while other countries told me
 that the study of perception techniques in order to study astronomy data is not
  relevant to astronomy because there are no blind astronomers in the field south africa said we want people with disabilities to contribute to the field 
 right now i 'm working at the south african astronomical observatory at the office of astronomy for development there 
 we are working on  sonification techniques and analysis methods to impact the students of the athlone school for the
 the blind these students will be learning radio astronomy and they will be learning the sonification methods
 in order to study astronomical events like huge ejections of energy from the sun known as coronal mass ejections 
 what we learn with these students these students have multiple disabilities and coping strategies that will be accommodated
 what we learn with these students will
  impact the way things are being done at the professional level i humbly call this development  and this is happening right now 
 i think
 that science is for everyone  it belongs to the people and it has to be available to everyone because we are all natural explorers
  from participating in science we 'll sever our links with history and with society  
 i dream of a level scientific playing field  
 where people encourage respect and respect each other where people exchange strategies and discover together 
 if people with disabilities are allowed into the scientific field an explosion a huge titanic burst
  of knowledge will take place  i am sure
