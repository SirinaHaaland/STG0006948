 i did what most little kids do i played a little baseball did a few other things like that  
 but i always had the sense of being an outsider and it wasn 't until i saw pictures in the magazines that a couple other guys skate 
 i thought wow that 's for me you know because there was no coach standing directly over you and these guys they were just being themselves there was no opponent directly across from you 
 and i loved that sense so
 i started skating when i was about ten years old
  i picked it up pretty quickly in fact here 's some footage from about
 it wasn 't until
  i won my first amateur championship  and then by
  i was fourteen and i won my first world championship  which was amazing to me and in a very real sense that was the
  this is a casper slide where the board 's upside down  mental note on that one and
 this one here an ollie 
 so as
 she mentioned that is overstated for sure  but that 's why they called me the godfather of modern street skating  
 here 's some images of that  
  i was about halfway through my pro career in i would say 
 freestyle itself we developed all these flat ground tricks as you saw  but there there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding where guys were taking it to the streets and they were using that ollie like i showed you 
 they were using it to get up onto stuff like bleachers and handrails and over stairwells and all kinds of cool stuff so it was
  evolving upwards in fact  when someone tells you they 're a skater today  they pretty much mean a street skater  because freestyle it took about five years for it to die  
 and at that stage i 'd been a champion champion for eleven years 
 which phew 
 and suddenly it was over for me  that 's it
 it it was gone they took my pro model off the shelf which was essentially pronouncing you dead
  publicly that 's how you make your money you know you have a signature board and wheels and
 shoes and clothes i had all that stuff and it 's gone  
 the crazy thing was there was a really liberating sense about it because i no longer had to protect
 my record as a champion
  restored where i could just create things  because that 's where the joy was for me  
 always was creating new stuff 
 the other thing that i had was a deep well of tricks to draw from that were rooted in these flat ground tricks stuff the normal guys were doing was very much different so as humbling and rotten as it was and believe me it was rotten i would go
  humbling as it was i began again  here are some tricks that i started to bring to that new terrain  
 and again there 's this undergirding layer of influence of freestyle
  your front foot  the way it grabs it i 'd seen someone slide on the back of the board like that
  get it over because that had not yet been done  and then it dawned on me and here 's part of what i 'm saying i had an infrastructure i had this deep layer 
  like oh my gosh it 's just your foot  it 's just the way you throw your board over just let the ledge do that and it 's easy and the next thing you
 know there 's twenty more tricks based out of the variations  so that 's the kind of thing here check this out here 's another way and i won 't overdo this a little indulgent i understand
 there 's something called a primo slide 
 it is the funnest trick ever to do  
 it 's like skimboarding and this one look how it
 slides sideways every which way  ok  so when you 're skating  and you take a fall the board slips that way or that way
 and that 's what i love the most about it it 's so much fun to do in fact when i started doing them i remember because i got hurt i had to get a knee surgery right so there 
  a couple of weeks where i couldn 't skate at all it would give out on me and i would watch the guys i 'd go to this warehouse where a lot of the guys were skating my friends
  going to do this so i ran up and i jumped on my board and i cavemanned and i flipped it down and i remember thinking  i landed so light footed thinking 
 if my knee gives they 'll just have more work to do in the morning 
 and so when it was the crazy thing i don 't know how many of you guys have had surgery  but 
 you are so helpless right you 're on this gurney and you 're watching the ceiling go by
  time it 's always that  and right when they 're putting the mask on you before you go to sleep all
 i was thinking is man when i wake up and i get better the first thing i 'm going to do is film that trick 
 and indeed i did it was the very first thing i filmed which was
 awesome
  i told you a little bit about the evolution of the tricks consider that content  in a sense what we do as street skaters is
  you have these tricks say i 'm working on darkslides or a primo that you guys know this stuff now 
 what you do is you cruise around the same streets that you 've seen a hundred times  
 but suddenly  because you already have something in this fixed domain
 of this target it 's like  what will match this trick how can i expand how can the context how can the environment change the very nature of what i do
  you drive and drive and drive and 
 actually i 've got to admit just because i was struggling with this because i 'm here  but i 'll just say it is  
 i cannot tell you  not only to be here in front of you but what a privilege it is to be at us campus because i have been escorted off of this campus so
 many times
  how context shapes content  
 this is a place not that far from here it 's a rotten neighborhood your first consideration is am i going to get beat up  you go out and see this wall  it 's
 fairly mellow  and it 's
 beckoning to do bank tricks  right  but there 's this other aspect of it for wheelies
  so check this out there
 's a few tricks again  
 how environment changes the nature of your tricks freestyle oriented  manual down wheelie down  
 watch this one oh i love this it 's like surfing this one the way you catch it 
 this one 
 a little sketchy going backwards  and watch the back foot
  that was called a three hundred and sixty flip  notice how the board flipped and spun this way  both axes  and
 another example of how the context changed  and the creative process
 for me and for most skaters is you go you get out of the car  you check for security you check for stuff
  you 've still got to deal with  so you hit this wall  and when i hit it the first thing you do is you fall forward and i 
 as you adjust you punch it up and then when i would do that it was throwing my shoulder this way  
  you load up for a three hundred and sixty flip  
 and so this is what i want to emphasize that as you can imagine  all of these tricks are made
 of submovements executive motor functions more granular to the degree to which i can 't quite tell you  but one thing i do know is every trick is made of combining two or three or four or five movements  
  and so as i 'm going up these things are floating around  and you have to sort of let the cognitive mind rest back pull it back a little bit and let your intuition go as you feel these things  
 and these these submovements are kind of floating around and as the wall hits you they connect themselves to an extent and that 's when the cognitive mind oh three hundred and sixty flip  i 'm going to make that 
 so that 's how that works to me the creative process the process itself of street skating  so  next oh mind you 
 those are the community these are some of the best skaters in the world
 are my friends
 oh my gosh they 're such good people  
 and the beauty of skateboarding is that  no one guy is the best in fact i know this is rotten to say they 're my friends  
 but a couple of them actually don 't look that that comfortable on their board what makes them great
 is the degree to which they use their skateboarding to individuate themselves  every single one of these guys you look at them you can see a silhouette of them
  realize oh that 's him that 's haslam  that 's koston there 's these guys these are the guys and
 skaters  i think they tend to be outsiders who seek a sense of
 belonging but belonging on their own terms 
 and real respect is given by how much we take what other guys do these basic tricks three hundred and sixty flips we take that we make
  our own  and then we contribute back to the community the inner way that edifies the community itself  
 the greater the contribution  the more we express and form our individuality  
 which is so important to a lot of us who feel like rejects to begin with  the summation of that
 gives us something we could never achieve as an individual
  say this there 's some sort of beautiful symmetry
 that the degree to which we connect to a community is in proportion to our individuality which we are expressing by what we do  
 next these guys very similar community that 's extremely conducive to innovation 
 notice a couple of these shots
 from the police department  
 but it is quite similar i mean what is it to hack right it 's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it and steer it to do things it was never intended to do 
 right and they 're not all bad you can be a linux kernel hacker make it more stable  
 right  more safe more secure  you can be an ios hacker make your iphone do stuff it wasn 't supposed to not authorized 
  you 've got some of these guys  right  what they do is very similar to our creative process they connect disparate information  
 and they bring it together in a way
 that a security analyst doesn 't expect it doesn 't make them good people  but it 's at the heart of engineering at the heart of
 a creative community an innovative community  and the open source community the basic ethos of it is take what other people do
  make it better  give it back so we all rise further very similar communities very similar we have our edgier sides too it
 's funny my dad was right  these are my peers  
 but i respect what they do and they respect what i do because they can do things it 's amazing what they can do in fact  one of them he was ernst & young 's
 entrepreneur of the year for san diego county
 you never know who you 're dealing with we 've all had some degree of fame in fact i 've had so much success that i
 strangely always feel unworthy of i 've had a patent and that was cool and we started a company and it grew and it became the biggest and then
 it went down and then it became the biggest again which is harder than the first time  and then we sold it and then we sold it again  
 so i 've had some success
  and in the end when you 've had all of these things what is it that continues to drive you as i mentioned the knee stuff and these things what is it that will punch you  because it 's not just the mind  what is it that will punch you and make you do something and
 bring it to another level  and when you 've had it all sometimes guys they die on the vine with all of that talent
  one of the things we 've had all of us is fame i think the best kind of fame because you can take it off i 've been all around the world 
 and there will be a thousand kids crying out your name and it 's such a weird visceral experience it 's like it 's disorienting and
 you get in a car and you drive away and 10 minute drive and you get out and no one gives a rat 's who you are 
 and it gives you that clarity of perspective of
  just me and popularity  what does that really mean again  not much 
 it 's peer respect that drives us that 's the one thing that makes us do what we do i 've had over a dozen bones this guy over eight ten concussions to the point where it 's comedy 
 right it is actually comedy they mess with him 
 next  and this is something deeper  
 i think i was on tour when i was reading one of the feynman biographies
  the red one or the blue one  and 
 he made this statement that was so profound to me 
 it was that the the nobel prize was the tombstone on all great work
  and it resonated because i had won thirty five out of thirty six contests that i 'd entered over eleven years  and it
  winning isn 't the word i won it once  the rest of the time you 're just defending  and you get into this turtle posture you know 
 where you 're not doing it it usurped the joy of what i loved to do because i was no longer doing it to create and have fun  
 and when it died out from under me  that was one of the most liberating things because i could create 
 and look i understand that i am
 on the very edge of preachy here i 'm not here to do that it 's just that i 'm in front of a very privileged audience  if you guys aren 't already leaders
  in your community  you probably will be and if there 's anything i can give you that will transcend what i 've gotten from skateboarding  
 the only things of of meaning  i think and of permanence  it 's not fame it 's not all these things what it is 
 is that there 's an intrinsic value in creating something for the sake of creating it and better than
  how pathetic is that i 'm still skateboarding  but there is there is this beauty in
 dropping it into a community of your own making  
 and seeing it dispersed  and seeing younger more talented just different talent  take it to levels you can never imagine  because that lives on so thank you for your time
  every time you think you 've chased something down it 's funny no matter how good you are and i know guys like this it feels like you 're polishing a turd you know 
 and i thought the only way i can extend this is is to change something infrastructural  
 and so that 's what i proceeded to do  through a long story one of desperation
  if i do it rather than talk about it if i do it
