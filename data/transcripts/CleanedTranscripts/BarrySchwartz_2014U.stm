  today i 'm going to talk about work and the question i want to ask and answer is this why do we work 
 why do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning instead of living our lives just filled
 with bouncing
  from one ted like adventure to another 
 you may be asking yourselves that very question  
 now i know of course we have to make a living but nobody in this room thinks that that 's the answer to the question why do we work for folks in this room 
 the work we do is challenging it 's engaging it 's stimulating it 's meaningful and if we 're lucky  it might even be important
 so we wouldn 't work if we didn 't get paid  but that 's not why we do what we do and in general i think we think that material rewards are a pretty bad reason for doing the work that we do when we
 say of somebody that he 's in it for the money we are not just being descriptive 
 now i think this is totally obvious  but the very obviousness of it raises what is for me an incredibly
 profound question 
 why if this is so obvious why is it that for the overwhelming majority of people on the planet 
 the work they do has none of the characteristics that get us up and out of bed and off to the office every morning how is it that we allow the majority of people on the planet to do work
 that is monotonous
  meaningless and  soul deadening 
 why is it that as capitalism developed it created a mode of production of goods and services in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions that might come from work were eliminated  
 workers who do this kind of work whether they do it in factories in call centers or in fulfillment warehouses do it for pay
  certainly no other earthly reason to do what they do except for pay  so the question is why and here 's the answer 
 the answer is technology  
 now i know i know yeah yeah yeah technology automation screws people blah blah that 's not what i mean i 'm
 not talking about the kind of technology that has enveloped our lives and that people
  come to ted to hear about i 'm not talking about the technology of things  profound though that is 
 i 'm talking about another technology i 'm talking about the technology of ideas  
 i call it idea technology how clever of me 
 in addition to creating things science creates ideas science creates ways of understanding and in
  social sciences the ways of understanding that get created are ways of understanding ourselves and they have an enormous influence on how we think what we aspire to and how we act 
 if you think your poverty is god 's will you pray 
 if you think your poverty is the result of your own inadequacy
  and if you think your poverty is the result of oppression and domination then you rise up in revolt 
 whether your response to poverty is resignation or revolution  depends on how you understand the sources of your poverty this is the role that ideas play in shaping
 us as as human beings and this is why idea technology may be the most profoundly important technology that science
 gives us and there 's something special about idea technology 
 that makes it different from the technology of things  with things  if the technology sucks 
 it just vanishes  right bad technology disappears with ideas
 false ideas about human beings will not go away if people believe
  that they 're true  
 because if people believe that they 're true they create ways of living and institutions that are consistent with these very false ideas  and that 
  's how the industrial revolution created a factory system in which there was really nothing you could possibly get out of your day 's work except for the pay at the end of the day  because the father one of the fathers of the industrial
  revolution adam smith was convinced that human beings were by their very natures lazy and wouldn 't do anything unless you made it worth their while and the way you made it worth their 
  while was by incentivizing by giving them rewards that was the only reason anyone ever did anything so we created a factory system consistent with that false
  of human nature but once that system of production was in place there was really no other way for people to operate except in a way that was consistent with adam smith 's vision  
 so the work example is merely an example of how false ideas can create a circumstance that ends up making them true  
 it is not true that you just can 't get good help anymore
 is true
 that you can 't get good help anymore when you give people work to do that is demeaning and soulless  and interestingly enough adam smith 
  the same guy who gave us this incredible invention of mass production and division of labor
  generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become now 
 notice the word here is become 
 he generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become whether he intended it or not what adam smith was telling us there is 
  that the very shape of the institution within which people work creates people who are fitted to the demands
 of that institution and deprives people of the opportunity to derive the kinds of satisfactions from their work that we take for granted 
 the thing about science natural science is that we can spin fantastic theories about the cosmos  
 and have complete confidence that the cosmos is completely indifferent to our theories it 's going to work the same damn way
 no matter what theories we have about the cosmos  
 but we do have to worry about the theories we have of human nature 
 because human nature will be changed by the theories we have that are designed to explain and help us understand human beings the distinguished
  years ago that human beings are the unfinished animals and what he meant by that was that it is only human nature
 to have a human nature that is very much the product of the society in which people live 
 that human nature that is to say our human nature is much more created
 than it is discovered
  we design human nature by designing the institutions within which people live and work  and so you people
 pretty much the closest i ever get to being with masters of the universe you people should be asking yourself
 a question as you go back home to run your organizations just what kind of human nature do you want to help design  thank you
