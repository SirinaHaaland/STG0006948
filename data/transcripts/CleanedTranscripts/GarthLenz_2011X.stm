  world 's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project is situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world  canada 's boreal forest 
 it stretches right across
  it 's home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world the george river caribou herd numbering approximately four hundred thousand animals unfortunately when i was there i couldn 't find one of them  
 but you have the antlers as proof 
 all across the boreal  we 're blessed with this incredible abundance of wetlands wetlands globally are one of the most endangered ecosystems they 're absolutely
 critical ecosystems they clean air they clean water
  sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases and they 're home to a huge diversity of species 
 in the boreal  they are also the home where almost fifty percent of the eight hundred bird species found in north america migrate north to breed and raise their young 
 in ontario the boreal marches down south to the north shore of lake superior  and these incredibly beautiful
  beautiful boreal forests were the inspiration for some of the most famous art in canadian history the group of seven were very inspired by this landscape and
 so the boreal is not just a really key part of our natural heritage  but also an important part of our cultural heritage  
 in manitoba this is an image from the east side of lake winnipeg  and this is the home of the newly designated
 unesco cultural heritage site
 in saskatchewan as across all of the boreal  home to some of our most famous rivers an incredible network of rivers and lakes that every 
 school age child learns about the peace the athabasca  the churchill here the mackenzie  
 non aboriginal explorers of northern canada that taking from the first nations people used canoes and paddled to explore for a
 trade route a northwest passage for the fur trade 
 in the north the boreal is bordered by the tundra  and just below that in yukon  we have this incredible
  the tombstone valley  and the tombstone valley is home to the porcupine caribou herd 
 now you 've probably heard about the porcupine caribou herd in the context of its breeding ground in arctic national wildlife refuge well the wintering ground is also critical and it also is not protected
 and is potentially could be potentially exploited for gas and mineral rights  
 the western border of the boreal in british columbia is marked by the coast mountains and on the other side of those
  mountains is the greatest remaining temperate rainforest in the world the great bear rainforest and we 'll discuss that in a few minutes in a bit more detail 
 all across the boreal it 's home for a huge incredible range of indigenous peoples and
 a rich and varied culture  and i think that one of the reasons why so many of these groups have retained a link to the past know their native languages
 the songs the dances the traditions i think part of that reason is because of the remoteness  the span and the wilderness of this almost ninety five percent intact ecosystem  
 and i think particularly now as we see ourselves in a time of environmental crisis 
 we can learn so much from these people who have lived so sustainably in this ecosystem for over ten thousand years 
  of this ecosystem is the very antithesis of all of these values that we 've been talking about and i think these are some of the core values that make us proud to be canadians 
 this is the alberta tar sands
 the largest oil reserves on the planet outside of saudi arabia trapped underneath the boreal forest and wetlands of northern alberta are these vast
  and the mining and the exploitation of that is creating devastation on a scale that the planet has never seen before
  i want to try to convey some sort of a sense of the size of this  if you look at that truck there it is the largest truck of its kind on the planet
  if i stand beside that truck  my head comes to around the bottom of the yellow part of that hubcap  within the dimensions of that truck you could build a 
  home quite easily i did the math  so instead of thinking of that as a truck think of that as a 
  home that 's not a bad size home and line those trucks homes back and forth
  across there from the bottom
 all the way to the top and then think of how large that very small section of one mine is 
 now you can apply that same kind of thinking
 here as well  now here you see of course as you go further on these trucks become like a pixel again
  imagine those all back and forth there  how large is that one portion of a mine
 that would be a huge vast metropolitan area  probably much larger than the city of victoria  and this is just one
 of a number of mines  ten mines so far right now this is one section of one mining complex and there are about another forty or fifty in the
  no tar sands mine has actually ever been denied approval so it is essentially a rubber stamp 
 the other method of extraction is what 's called the in situ and here massive amounts of water are superheated and pumped through the ground through these vasts networks of pipelines seismic lines  
 drill paths compressor stations and even though this looks maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines  
 it 's even more damaging in some ways it impacts and
  fragments a larger part of the wilderness  
 where there is ninety percent reduction of key species like woodland caribou and grizzly bears  
 and it consumes even more energy more water  and produces at least as much greenhouse gas so these in situ developments are at least as ecologically damaging damaging as the mines 
 the oil produced from either method
 produces
 more greenhouse gas emissions than any other oil  this is one of the reasons why it 's called the world 's dirtiest oil  
 it 's also one of the reasons why it is the largest and fastest growing single source of carbon in canada  
 and it is also a reason why canada is now number three in terms of producing
 carbon per person the tailings
  ponds are the largest toxic impoundments on the planet 
 oil sands or rather i should say tar sands oil sands is  a pr created term so that the oil companies wouldn 't be trying to promote something that sounds like a sticky tar like substance that 's the world  the world 's dirtiest oil  
 so they decided to call it oil sands the tar sands consume more water than any other oil process  three to five barrels of water are taken
  polluted and then returned into tailings ponds the largest toxic impoundments on the planet  
 semcrude just one of the licensees in just one of their tailings ponds dumps two hundred and fifty thousand tons of this toxic gunk every single day 
 that 's creating the largest toxic impoundments in the history of the planet  so far  this is enough toxin to cover the face of lake erie a foot deep
 and the tailings ponds range in size up to nine thousand acres 
 that 's two thirds the size of the entire island of manhattan that 's like from wall street at the southern edge of manhattan up to maybe 120th street 
  this is one of the larger tailings ponds this might be what i don 't know half the size of manhattan  and you can see in the context
  relatively small section of one of ten mining complexes and another forty to fifty on stream to be approved soon 
 and of course these tailings ponds  well you can 't see many ponds from outer space and you can see these so maybe we should stop calling them ponds
 these massive toxic wastelands are built unlined and on the banks of the athabasca river
 and the athabasca river drains downstream to a range of aboriginal communities 
 in fort chipewyan the eight hundred people there are finding toxins in the food chain this has been scientifically proven  
 the tar sands toxins are in the food chain and this is causing cancer rates up to ten times what they are in the rest of canada 
 in spite of that people have to live have to eat this food in order to survive
 the incredibly high price of flying food into these remote northern aboriginal communities and the high rate of unemployment makes this an absolute necessity for survival  
 and not that many years ago i was lent a boat by a first nations man and he said when you go out on the river do not under any circumstances
 eat the fish
  the front porch of that man 's cabin  i saw four fish  he had to feed his family to survive
 and as a parent  i just can 't imagine
 what that does to your soul  and that 's what we 're doing
 the boreal forest is also
 perhaps our best defense against global warming and climate change the boreal forest sequesters
  more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem  
 and this is absolutely key so what we 're doing is we 're taking the most concentrated
 greenhouse gas sink
 twice as much greenhouse gases are sequestered in in the boreal per acre than the than the tropical
  and what we 're doing is we 're destroying
 this carbon sink turning it into a carbon bomb  and we 're replacing that with the largest industrial project in the history of the world  which is producing the most
  emitting oil in the world  and we 're doing this on the second largest oil reserves on the planet
 this is one of the reasons why canada
  originally a climate change hero we were one of the first signatories of the kyoto accord 
 now we 're the country that has full time lobbyists in the european union and washington dc
  threatening trade wars when when these countries
 talk about wanting to bring in positive legislation to limit the import of high carbon fuels of greenhouse gas emissions anything like this 
 at international
  whether they 're in copenhagen or cancun international conferences on climate change we
 're the country that gets the dinosaur award every single day as being the biggest obstacle to progress on this issue 
 just seventy miles downstream is the world 's largest freshwater delta the peace athabasca delta 
 the only one at the juncture of all four migratory flyways  this is a globally significant wetland perhaps the greatest on the planet
  for half the bird species you find in north america migrating here  
 and also the last refuge for the largest herd of wild bison  and also of course critical habitat for another whole range of other species  
 but it too is being threatened by the massive amount of water being drawn from the
  the athabasca which feeds these wetlands and also the incredible toxic burden of the largest toxic unlined impoundments on the planet which are leaching in to the food chain for all the species downstream 
 so as bad as all that is things are going to get much worse much much worse this is the infrastructure as we see it about now  
 this is what 's planned for two thousand and fifteen  and you can see here the
 the keystone pipeline which would take tar sands raw down to the
  gulf coast punching a pipeline
 through the agricultural heart of north america of the united states  
 and securing the contract with the dirtiest fuel in the in the world
 by by consumption of the united states  and promoting a huge disincentive to a sustainable
  future for america here you see the
 the route down the mackenzie valley  
 this would put a pipeline to take natural gas from the beaufort sea through the heart of the third largest watershed basin in the world  and the only one which is ninety five percent intact  
 and building
 a pipeline with an industrial highway would change forever this incredible wilderness which is a true rarity on the planet today
 so the great bear rainforest is just over
 over the hill there  within a few miles we go from these dry boreal forests of 100 year old trees maybe ten inches across  and soon we 're in the coastal temperate rainforest
  trees  twenty feet across a completely different ecosystem and the great bear rainforest is generally considered to be
  the largest coastal temperate rainforest ecosystem in the world  some of the greatest densities of some of the most iconic and threatened species on the planet  
 and yet there 's a proposal of course to build a pipeline
 to take huge tankers ten times the size of the exxon valdez through some of the most
  waters in the world  where only just a few years ago a bc ferry ran aground  
 when one of these tar sands tankers  carrying the dirtiest oil ten times as much as the exxon valdez eventually hits a rock and goes down 
 we 're going to have one of the worst ecological disasters this planet has ever seen 
 and here we have the plan out to two thousand and thirty what they 're proposing is an almost four times increase in production 
 and that would industrialize an area the size of florida
 in doing so we 'll be removing a large part of our greatest carbon sink and replacing it with the most high
 emission oil in the future the world does not need any more tar mines the world does not need any more pipelines
 to wed our addiction to fossil fuels  and the world certainly does not
  need the largest toxic impoundments to grow and multiply and further threaten the downstream communities and let 's face it we all live downstream in an era of global global warming and climate change 
 what we need 
 is we all need to act to ensure that canada respects the massive amounts of freshwater that we hold in this country 
 we need to ensure that these wetlands and forests that are
  best and greatest and most critical defense against global warming are protected  and we are not releasing that carbon bomb into the atmosphere  
 and we need to all gather together
 and say no to the tar sands  and we can do that there is a huge network all over the world  fighting to stop this
  and i quite simply think that this is not something that should be decided just in canada  
 everyone in this room  everyone across canada everyone listening to this presentation has a role to play and i think a responsibility 
 because what we do here
 is going to change our history  it 's going to color our possibility to survive and for our children to survive and have a rich future 
 we have an incredible gift in the boreal
  opportunity to preserve our best defense against global warming  but we could let that slip away  
 the tar sands could threaten not just a large section of the boreal  it compromises the life and the health of some of
 our most underprivileged and vulnerable people the aboriginal communities that have so much to teach us 
 it could destroy the athabasca delta
  the largest and possibly greatest freshwater delta in the planet  it could destroy the
 the great bear rainforest the largest temperate rainforest in the world  and it could have huge impacts on the future of the agricultural heartland
 of north america  i hope that you will all if you 've been moved
  this presentation 
 join with the growing international community to get canada to step up to its responsibilities to convince canada to go back to being a climate change 
  champion instead of a climate change villain  and to say no to the tar sands and yes to a clean energy future for all thank you so much
