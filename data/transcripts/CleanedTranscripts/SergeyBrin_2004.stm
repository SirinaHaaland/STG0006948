  i want to discuss a question i know that 's been pressing on many of your minds  we spoke to you last several years ago  
 and before i get started today  since many of you
 are wondering
  i didn 't really realize what it was when i first saw it but this is what helped me see it
  this is what we run at the office that actually runs real time here it 's
 slightly logged but here you can see around the world how people are using google and every one of those rising dots
 represents probably about
 twenty thirty searches or something like that  and
 they 're labeled by color right now by language so you can see here we are in the u s and they 're all coming up red
  there we are in monterey hopefully i can get it right  you can see that japan is busy at night 
 right there we have tokyo coming in in japanese there 's a lot of activity in china there 's a lot of activity in india 
 there 's some in the middle east the little pockets  and europe which is right now in the middle of the day 
 is going really strong with a whole wide
  of languages
 now you can also see if i
 turn this around here
 hopefully i won 't shake the world too much
  but you can also see there are places where there 's not so much australia because there just aren 't very many people there
  and
 this is something that we should really work on which is africa  
 which is just a few trickles basically in south africa and a few other urban cities  but basically what we 've noticed is these queries  
 which come in at thousands per second 
 are available everywhere there is power  and pretty much everywhere there is power there is the internet and even in antarctica
 least this time of year we from time to time will see a query rising up  and if we had it plotted correctly i think the international space station would have
  is you can see that it 's actually kind of hard to get the
 there we go 
 this is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions you can see that
 there 's a lot of data running around it has to go all over the world through
  through satellites through all kinds of connections  and
 it 's pretty tricky for us to maintain
 the latencies as low as we try to hopefully your experience is good 
 but you can see also once again so some places are much more wired than others and you can see all the bandwidth across the u s going up
 over to asia europe in the other direction and so forth now what i would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity
 would look like
  and if we can switch to slides
 all right here we go  so this is slowed down  
 this is what one second looks like
 and this is what we spend a lot of our time doing is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load
 now 
 each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own i mean it could be somebody 's health it could be somebody 's career something important to them
  and
 it could potentially be
 something as important as tomato sauce  
  so this is a query that we had i guess it 's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others  you can see that it got started
 right here in the u s and spain it was popular at the same time but it didn 't have quite the same pickup in the u s as it did in spain  
 and then from spain it went to italy  and then germany got excited and maybe right now
 the u k is enjoying it  and
  you can all enjoy it for yourselves hopefully that search will work as a part of
 you know part of what we want to do to to grow our company is to have
  and what that means is we want to have
 more people who are healthy and educated more animals if they start
 doing searches as well  but
 partly we want to make the world a better place  and so one thing that we 're embarking upon is the google foundation 
 and we 're in the process of setting that up  we also have a program already called google grants that now serves over one hundred and fifty different charities around the world
 and these are some of the charities that are on there  and
 it 's something i 'm very excited to be a part of 
 in fact many of the organizations that are here the acumen fund i think approtec we have running i 'm not sure if that one 's up yet
 and many of the people who have presented here are running through google grants they run google ads  and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know
  earlier results that we got
 we have a singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of twenty five vietnamese girls for their education and
 that was one of the earliest results  and as i said now there have been many many stories that have come in 
 because we do have hundreds of charities in there and the google foundation will be an even broader endeavor 
  not very many people know about it i 'll explain it in a second this is one of our engineers  we find that they work better when they 're submerged and covered with leaves that
 's how we churn those products out
  orkut had a vision to create a social network i know all of you are thinking yet another social network but
 it was a dream of his and we basically when people really want to do something well we generally let them  so this is what he built 
 we just released it in a test phase last month  and it
 's been taking off this is our vp of engineering you can see the red hair and i don 't know if you can see the nose ring there
 and these are all of his friends  so
 this is
 this is how we we just deployed it we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service  and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out 
 and now we 've grown to over one hundred thousand members
  they spread  actually very quickly even outside the u s you can see  even though the u s is still the majority here though by the way search wise it 's only about thirty percent of our traffic
 but it 's already going to japan and the u k and europe and all the rest of the countries so it 's a fun little project 
 there are a variety of demographics i won 't bore you with these but it 's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes
  in suspense larry you can explain this one larry page thank you sergey so one of the things
 both sergey and i went to a montessori school  and i think for some reason 
 this has been incorporated in google and sergey mentioned orkut  which is something that you know orkut wanted to do
 in his
  and we call this at google we 've
 embodied this as the twenty percent time and the idea is for twenty percent of your time if you 're working at google you can do what you think is the best thing to do and
 many many things at google have come out of that such as orkut
 and also google news  and i think many other things in the world also have come out of this mendel who was supposed to be teaching
  the laws of genetics
 as a hobby basically so many many useful things come out of this  and news which i just mentioned 
 was
 started by a researcher  and he just he after nine eleven he got really interested in the news and he said why don 't i
 look at the news better and so he started clustering it by category
  and then he started using it and then his friends started using it  and then  besides just looking cute on a baby 's bottom  we
 made it a googlette  which
 is basically a small project at google so it 'd be like three people or something like that  and
 they would try to make a product  and we wouldn 't really be sure if it 's going to work or
  they had a couple of people working on it for a while and then more and more people started using it and then we put it out on the internet and more and more people started using it and now it 's a real full blown project with more people on it 
 and
 this is how we keep our innovation running i think usually as companies get bigger they find it really hard to have small innovative projects  
 and we had this problem too for a while and we said oh
  the googlettes
 that 's a small project that we 're not quite sure if it 's going to work or not  but we hope it will and if we do enough of them 
 some of them will really work and turn out such as news  but then we had a problem because then we had over one hundred projects 
 and i don 't know about all of you but i have trouble keeping one hundred things in my head at once  and we found that if we just wrote all of them down
 and ordered them and these are kind of made up don 't really pay attention to
  them for example the buy iceland was from a media article we would never do such a crazy thing but in
 any case  we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them that
 most people would actually agree what the ordering should be  
 and this was kind of a surprise to me but we found that as long as you keep the one hundred things in your head which you did by writing them down that you could do a pretty
  good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources  and so that 's basically what we 've done
 since we instituted that a few years ago and i think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well organized 
 the other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important and so naturally people sort of migrate to the things that
 that are high priorities 
 i just wanted to highlight a couple of
  things that that are
 new or you might not know about  and the top thing actually is the deskbar 
 so this is a new how many of you use the google toolbar  raise your hands 
 how many of you use the deskbar  
 all right see you guys should try it out
 but if you go to our site and search for deskbar you 'll get this  and the idea is instead of a toolbar it 's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom
 and you can do searches really easily  and it 's sort of like a better version of the toolbar  thank you sergey 
 this is another example of a project that somebody at google was really passionate about and they just they got going and it 's really really a great product and really taking off 
 google answers is something
 we started which is really cool which lets you for five to
  hundred dollars you can
 type a question in and then there 's a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you and it 's guaranteed and all that and you can get actually very good answers to things without 
  spending all that time yourself froogle lets you search shopping information  and blogger lets you publish things but
  we also like to innovate in our physical space and
 we we noticed in meetings you know you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off and they 're noisy so people shut them off  
 and we didn 't like that so we actually
 in maybe a couple of weeks we built these little enclosures
 that enclosed the projectors and so we can leave them on all the time and they 're completely silent  and as a result  we were able to build some software
  also lets us manage a meeting so when you walk into a
 meeting room now it lists all the meetings that are happening you can very easily take notes and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting
 and as we become more of a global company  we find these things really affect us you know can we work effectively with people who aren 't in the room and
 things like that and simple things like this can really make a big difference
  we also have a lot of engineers
 in those meetings and they don 't always do their laundry as much as they should  
 and so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines for our younger employees especially 
 and we also allow
 dogs and things like that  and we 've had i think a really fun culture at our company which helps people work and enjoy what they 're doing 
 this is actually our cult picture i just wanted to show quickly 
 we had this on our website for a while but we found that after we put it on our website we didn 't get any job applications anymore  
  every year we 've taken the whole company on a ski trip a
 lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other and informally  and i think we 've done a good job encouraging that it makes it a really fun place to work
  along with our logos too which i think really embody
 our culture when we when we change things in the early days we were actually advised we should never change our logo because
 we should
  you 'd never want to change your logo you want it to be consistent and we said well that doesn 't sound so much fun why don 't we try changing it every day 
 one of the things that really excites me about what we 're doing now is we have this thing called adsense  and
 this is a
 little bit foreshadowing this is from before dean dropped out but the idea is
  battle for new hampshire howard dean for president 
 articles on howard dean and these ads are generated automatically like in this case on the washington post from the content on the site 
 and so we use our over one hundred and fifty thousand advertisers and millions of advertisements so we pick the one
 that 's most relevant to what you 're actually looking at much as we do on search so the idea is we can make advertising useful not just annoying
  right  and
 the nice thing about this we have a self serve program and many thousands of websites have signed up  and this let 's them really make money and i you
 know there 's a number of people i met i met this guy who runs a
 conservation site at a party  and he said you know i wasn 't making any money  i just put this thing on my site and i 'm making ten thousand dollars a month
  you know thank you i don 't have to do my other job now 
 and i think this is really important for us because it makes the internet work better it makes content get better it makes searching work better when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content
 so this session is supposed to be about the future so i 'd thought i 'd talk at least briefly about it  and the idea
 behind this is to do the perfect job doing search you really have to be smart  because you can type you know any kind of thing into google 
 and you expect an answer back right  but finding things is tricky and so you really want intelligence  
 and
 in fact the ultimate search engine would be smart it would be artificial intelligence and so that 's something we work on 
 and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now and
  so we always hope that google will be smart but we 're always surprised when other people think that it is and so i
 just wanted to give a funny example of this this is a blog from iraq and it 's not really what i 'm going to talk about but i just wanted to show you an example
  you can 't see it that well but we decided we should put in this feature into our adsense ads  called related searches and so we 'd say you know did you mean ' search for ' what
 is this in this case saddam hussein because this blog is about iraq
 and
 you know in addition to the ads and we thought this would be a great idea  and so
 there is this blog of a young
  who was kind of depressed and he said you know i 'm sleeping a lot he was just kind of writing about his life and
 our algorithms not a person of course but our algorithms our computers
 read his blog and decided that the related search was i am bored and he read this and he thought a person had decided that he was boring  
 and
 it was very unfortunate and he said you know what are these you know bastards at
  google doing  why don 't they like my blog 
 and so then we read his blog which was getting you know  sort of going from from bad to worse  and we said the related search was retards 
 and then you know he got even more mad and he wrote like started swearing and so on and then we
  it ended with kiss my ass 
 and so basically he thought he was dealing with something smart and of course you know we just sort of wrote this program
 and we tried it out  and it
 didn 't quite work and we don 't have this feature anymore 
 so with that maybe i can switch back to the world  
 i wanted to end just by saying that there 's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with google and one of
  those is that we 're able to make money
 largely through advertising and one of the benefits that i didn 't expect from that was that we 're able to serve everyone in the world
 without worrying about you know places that don 't have as much money  so we don 't have to worry about our products
 being sold for example for less money in places that are poor and then they get 
 for example with the drug industry and i think
  really lucky to have that kind of business model
 because everyone in the world has access to our search and i think that 's a tremendous tremendous benefit the other thing i wanted to mention just briefly
 is that
 we have a tremendous
 ability and and responsibility to provide people the right information  and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine that we should provide very objective
