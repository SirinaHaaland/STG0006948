  one of the problems of writing  and working and looking at the internet is that it 's very hard to separate fashion from
 deep change and so to start helping that i want to take us back to
  founded the first 
 newspaper in new york city  and it cost about five hundred dollars
 to start it which was about about the equivalent of ten thousand dollars of today  by fifteen years later by
 fifteen years that 's the critical change that is being inverted
 by the net  and that 's what i want to talk about today  and how that relates to the emergence of social production  
 starting with newspapers  what we saw was
 high cost
 as an
 initial requirement for making information knowledge and
  culture  which led to a stark bifurcation between producers who had to be able to raise financial capital just like any other industrial
 organization and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could
 produce now the term
  for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial
 revolution  but in fact for purposes of understanding what 's happening today that 's wrong 
 because for one hundred and fifty years we 've had an information economy  it 's just been industrial 
 which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to
 pay those two and a half million dollars and later more for the telegraph and the radio transmitter  and the television and eventually the mainframe 
 and that meant they were market based 
 or they were government owned depending on what kind of system they were in and this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next one hundred and fifty years
 now  let me tell you a different story around june two thousand
  supercomputers had a bombshell  the japanese had for the first time created the fastest supercomputer the nec earth simulator taking the primary from the u s and about two years 
  later this by the way is measuring the trillion floating point operations per second that the computer 's capable of running
  earth simulator 
 all of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period there 's another supercomputer running in the world seti @ home four and a half million users 
 around the world  contributing their leftover computer cycles whenever their computer isn 't working  by running a screen saver 
 analyze the data coming from radio telescopes  what this
 picture suggests to us
 is that we 've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized  not that it 's become less capital intensive that there 's less money that 's required
  distributed each of us in these advanced economies has one of these 
 or something rather like it a computer they 're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network 
 and computation storage and communications capacity
 are in the hands of practically every connected person
 and these are the basic
  physical capital means necessary for producing information  knowledge and culture 
 in the hands of something like six hundred million to a billion people around the planet  
 what this means is that for the first time
 since the industrial revolution  the most important means
  are in the hands of the population at large this is completely different than what we 've seen since the industrial revolution so we 've got communications
 and computation capacity in the hands of the entire population  and we 've
  unlike simple labor stand here turning this lever all day long is not something that 's the same or fungible among people any one of you who has taken someone else 's job or tried to give yours to someone else no matter how detailed the manual  
 you cannot transmit
 what you know what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances  in that we 're unique
  and each of us holds this critical input into production as we hold this machine what 's the effect
 of this so the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software this is market share of apache web server in
  two groups of people said wow this is really important the web we need a much better web server 
 one was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided you know we really need this we should write one and
 what are we going to do with what well we 're gonna share it and other people will be able to develop it the other was microsoft
  if i told you that ten years later  the motley crew of people who didn 't control anything that they produced
  acquired twenty percent of the market and was the red line it would be amazing right 
 think of it in minivans a group of automobile engineers on their weekends are competing with toyota 
 right but in fact of course the story is it 's the seventy percent  including the major e commerce site seventy percent of a critical application on which
  communications and applications work
 is produced in this form in direct competition with microsoft not in a side issue in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component
 of the net software has done this in a way that 's been
 very visible because
 because it 's measurable but the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the web  
 so  nasa at some point did an experiment where they took images of mars
 that they were mapping and they said instead of having three or four fully trained ph d s doing this all the time  let 's break it up into small components 
 put it up on the web and see if people using a very simple interface will actually spend five minutes here ten minutes there clicking after six months
 eighty five thousand people used this to generate mapping
 at a faster rate than the images were coming in which was quote practically indistinguishable from the markings of a 
 once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average 
  and she 'll come to encarta one of the main online encyclopedias this is what you 'll find out about
 barbie  this is it there 's nothing more to the definition  including manufacturers plural now more commonly produce ethnically diverse dolls like this black barbie 
  roughly equivalent to what you would find in the britannica  differently written  including the controversies over body image and
  the claims about
 the way in which she 's a good role model etc 
 another portion is not only how content is produced but how relevance is produced the claim to fame of yahoo was we hire people to look originally not anymore
 if they 're in the index they 're good this on the other hand is what sixty thousand passionate volunteers produce in the open directory project
  each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about to say this is good  
 so this is the open directory project 
 with sixty thousand volunteers each one spending a little bit of time as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees  no one owns it  
 no one owns the output it 's free for anyone to use and it 's the output of people acting out of social and psychological
  motivations
 to do something interesting 
 this is not only outside of businesses  when you think of what is the critical innovation of google 
 the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing the decision about what 's relevant
 to the community of the web as
 as a
  doing whatever they want to do so  page rank  
 the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers or our people saying which is the most relevant we 're going to go out and count what you people out there on the web 
 for whatever reason vanity  pleasure produced links  
  every size a contested cultural object 
 which you won 't find anywhere soon on overture which is the classic market based mechanism whoever pays the most is highest on the list so all of that is in the creation of content of relevance basic human expression 
 but remember the computers were also physical just physical materials
  was one person owned the license 
 they transmitted in an area  and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property what we 're seeing now is that computers and and radios are becoming so sophisticated
 that we 're developing algorithms to let people own machines like
  overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this
 to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle  when i 'm listening when i 'm not using i can help you transfer your messages  
 and when you 're not using you 'll help me transfer yours 
 and this is not an idealized version these are working models that at least in some places in the united states are being implemented at least for
 public security 
 if in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine i told you  let 's build a data storage and retrieval system  it 's got to store terabytes  
 it 's got to be available twenty four hours a day seven days a week it 's got to be available from anywhere in the world it has to support over one hundred million users at any given moment  it 's got to be robust to
  including closing the main index injecting malicious files armed seizure of some major nodes you 'd
 say that would take years  it would take millions  but of course what i 'm describing is p2p file sharing right 
 we always think of it as stealing music but fundamentally it 's a distributed data storage and retrieval system  where people for very obvious reasons are willing to share their bandwidth and their storage to create something 
  essentially what we 're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional
 framework 
 it used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which you could divide things they could be market based or non market based they could be decentralized or centralized  the price 
  system was a market based and decentralized system if things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them you had firms if you wanted to be in the market
  had governments or sometimes larger 
 it was too expensive to have decentralized social production to have decentralized action
 in society that was not about society itself that was in fact  economic  
 but what we 're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange not that it 's the first time that we do nice things to
  each other or for each other as social beings we do it all the time  it 's that it 's the first time that it 's having major economic
 impact what characterizes them is decentralized authority  
 you don 't have to ask permission as you do in a property based system  may i do this 
 it 's open for anyone to create and innovate and share if they want
  to by themselves or with others because property is one mechanism of coordination but it 's not the only one instead what we see are social frameworks for all 
  of the critical things that we use property and contract in the market information flows to decide what are interesting problems who 's available and good for something 
  check after dinner with friends  you don 't increase the probability of being invited back 
 and if dinner isn 't entirely obvious think of sex 
 it also requires certain new organizational approaches  and in particular what we 've seen is task organization  you have to hire people who know what they 're doing you have to hire them to spend a lot of time 
 now
  take the same problem chunk it into little modules  and motivations become trivial five minutes instead of watching tv  five minutes i 'll spend just because it 's interesting 
 just because it 's fun 
 just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning or in places that are more involved like wikipedia  gives me a certain set of social relations 
 so a new social phenomenon is emerging
  it 's creating and it 's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition 
 peer to peer networks assaulting the recording industry free and open source software taking market share from microsoft  skype potentially 
 threatening traditional telecoms wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias  but it 's also a new source of opportunities for businesses  
  social relations and behaviors emerging  you have new opportunities some of them are toolmakers instead of building well behaved appliances
  you begin to build more open tools there 's a new set of values a new set of things people value  you build platforms for
  and collaboration like wikipedia  like
 the open directory project you 're beginning to build platforms and you see that as a model  and you see surfers people who see this happening and in some sense build it into a
 supply chain which is a very curious one  right  you have a belief stuff will flow out of connected human beings that 'll give me something i can use and i 'm going to contract with someone i will deliver
  that 's what ibm does in software services and they 've done reasonably well  so  social production is a real fact not a fad 
 it is the critical long term shift caused by the internet 
 social relations
 and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon in some contexts it 's even more efficient because of the quality of
  the information the ability to find the best person the lower transaction costs  it 's sustainable and growing fast
