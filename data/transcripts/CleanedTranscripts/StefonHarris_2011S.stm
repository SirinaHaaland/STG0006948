  to tell you what it is until it happens  i didn 't realize there was going to be a little music before so i think i 'm going to start with what i just heard

  first of all let 's welcome mr jamire williams on the drums 
  christian sands on the piano 
 so the bandstand as we call it this is an incredible space it is really a sacred space  and one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future 
 or the past you really are alive right here in this
  there are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand we had no idea what key we were going to play in in the middle we sort of
 made our way into a song called titi boom but that could have happened maybe maybe not everyone 's listening we 're responding you have no time for projected ideas  
 so the idea of a mistake  
 from the perspective of a jazz musician it 's easier to
 talk about someone else 's mistake
  perceive a mistake when i 'm on the bandstand first of all we don 't really see it as a mistake  the only mistake lies in that i 'm not able to perceive what it is that someone else did 
 every mistake 
 is an opportunity in jazz  so it 's hard to even describe what a funny note would be so for example if i played a color like we were playing on a palette that
  if christian played a note like play an f 
 see these are all right inside of the color palette if you played an
 these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette  that we were painting  if you played an f # though 
  to most people 's ears they would perceive that as a mistake so i 'm going to show you we 're going to play just for a second and we 're going to play on this palette and at some point christian will introduce this note and we won 't react to it he 'll introduce it for a second and then i 'll stop i 'll talk for a second
 we 'll see what happens when we play with this palette
  so someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake  the only way that i would say it was a mistake is in that we didn 't react to it 
 it was an opportunity that was missed  so it 's unpredictable we 'll paint this palette again
  it i don 't know how we 'll react to it but something will change we 'll all accept his ideas  or not
  all
  okay
 he played this note i ended up creating a melody out of it the texture changed in the drums this time it got a little bit more rhythmic a little bit more intense in response to how i responded to it 
  so there is no mistake the only mistake is if i 'm not aware if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his
  jazz this bandstand is absolutely amazing it 's a very purifying experience 
 and i know that i speak for all of us when i tell you that we don 't take it for granted we know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing  so how does this all relate to behavioral finance  well we 're jazz musicians so stereotypically we don 't have a great relationship to finance 
  i just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it and the other dynamic of it is is that we don 't micromanage in jazz 
 you have some people who do but what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities
 if i come up and i dictate to the band that i want to play like this and i want the music to go this way and i just jump right in ready just play some
  's kind of chaotic because i 'm bullying my ideas i 'm telling them you come with me over this way if i really want the music to go there the best way for me to do it is to listen this is a science of listening it has
 far more to do with what i can perceive than what it is that i can do  so if i want the music to get to a certain level of intensity the first step for me is to be patient to listen to what 's going 
  on and pull from something that 's going on around me when you do that you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more and gradually it builds watch
  totally different experience when i 'm pulling ideas it 's much more organic it 's much more nuanced it 's not about bullying my vision or anything like that it 's about being here in the moment  accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow
