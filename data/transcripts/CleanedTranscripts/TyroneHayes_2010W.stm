  ask if there 's a doctor in the house no i 'm just joking  it 's interesting because it was six years ago when i was pregnant with my first child
 that i discovered that the most commonly used preservative in baby care products
 mimics estrogen
 when it gets into the human body now it 's very easy actually to get a chemical compound from products
 into the human body through the skin and these preservatives had been found in breast cancer tumors 
 that was the start of my journey to make this film toxic baby and it doesn 't take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue one is that you and i all have
 between thirty to fifty thousand chemicals in our bodies
 that our grandparents didn 't have 
 and many of these chemicals are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents of chronic childhood disease that we 're seeing across industrialized nations i
 'll show you some statistics  
 so for example
  in the united kingdom the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by twenty percent just in a generation very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the u s 
 in canada we 're now looking at one in ten canadian children
 with asthma that 's a four fold increase  again similar story around the world 
 in the united states probably the most astonishing statistic is a six hundred percent increase in autism and autistic spectrum disorders and other learning disabilities  again we 're seeing that
  trend across europe across north america and in europe 
 there 's certain parts of europe where we 're seeing a  four fold increase in certain genital birth defects 
 interestingly one of those birth defects has seen a two hundred percent increase in the u s so a real skyrocketing
 of chronic childhood disease that includes other things like obesity and juvenile diabetes
  premature puberty  
 so it 's interesting for me when i 'm looking for someone who can really talk to me and talk to an audience about these things 
 that probably one of the most important people in the world who can discuss toxicity in babies is expert in frogs tyrone hayes
 it was a surprise to me as well that i would be talking about pesticides
  talking about public health  because in fact i never thought i would do anything useful 
 laughter frogs in fact my involvement in the whole pesticide issue was
 sort of a surprise as well when i was approached by the largest chemical company in the
  and they asked me if i would evaluate how atrazine affected amphibians or my frogs it
 turns out atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world it 's the number one contaminant of groundwater drinking water rain water  in two thousand and three after my studies it was banned in the european union but in that same year the united states 
 the compound  we were a bit surprised when we found out that when we exposed frogs to very low levels of atrazine zero point one
  parts per billion that it produced animals that look like this this these are the dissected gonads of an animal that has two testes two ovaries  
 another large testis more ovaries which is
 not normal 
 even for amphibians 
 in some cases another species like the north american leopard frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes and you can see these large  yolked up eggs
 bursting through the surface
 now my wife tells me and i 'm sure penelope can as well that there 's nothing more painful than childbirth which
 that i 'll never experience i can 't really argue that but i would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would
 probably be somewhere in the top five 
 in recent studies that we 've published we 've shown that some of these animals when they 're exposed to atrazine some of the males grow up and completely become females
  so these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship and not only do these genetic males mate with other males they actually have the capacity to lay eggs
 even though they 're genetic males 
 what we proposed and what we 've now generated support for is that what atrazine is doing is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance  normally the testes should make testosterone the male hormone  
 but what atrazine does is it
  turns on an enzyme the machinery if you will aromatase  that converts testosterone into estrogen 
 and as a result these exposed males lose their testosterone they 're chemically castrated and they 're subsequently feminized because now they 're making the female hormone 
 now this is what brought me to the human related issues because it turns out that the number one
  breast cancer is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase  so when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast aromatase converts androgens into estrogens and that estrogen 
  turns on or promotes the growth of that cancer so that it turns into a tumor and spreads  
  which blocks aromatase  blocks estrogen so that if you developed a mutated cell it doesn 't grow into a tumor 
 now what 's interesting is of course that we 're still using eighty million pounds of atrazine the number one contaminant in drinking water that does the opposite turns on aromatase  increases estrogen and promotes tumors in rats and is associated with
 tumors breast cancer in humans  
 what 's interesting is in fact the same company that sold us eighty million pounds of atrazine the breast cancer promoter now sells us the
  blocker the exact same company  and so i find it interesting that instead of
 treating this disease by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it  we simply respond by putting more chemicals into the environment pjc 
 so speaking of estrogen one of the other compounds that tyrone talks about in the film is something called bisphenol a
 plasticizer it 's a compound that 's found in polycarbonate plastic which is what baby bottles are made out of 
 and what 's interesting about bpa is that it 's such a potent estrogen that it was actually once considered for use as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy 
 and there have been many many many studies that have shown that bpa leaches from babies ' bottles
  and therefore into the babies so we 're dosing our babies our newborns our infants with a synthetic estrogen 
 now two weeks ago or so the european union passed a law banning the use of  bpa in babies ' bottles and sippy cups and for those of you who are not parents 
 sippy cups are those little plastic things that your child graduates to after using bottles 
  the u s senate refused to even debate
 the banning of  bpa in babies ' bottles and sippy cups so it really makes you realize the onus on parents to have to look 
  at this and regulate this and police this in their own lives and how astonishing that is pjc 
  how sometimes it is only a parent 's awareness
 that stands between chemicals and our children
  the baby bottle scenario proves that we can prevent unnecessary exposure  
 however if we parents are unaware  we are leaving our children to fend for themselves
  what penelope says here is even more true 
 for those of you who don 't know we 're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction scientists agree now 
 we are losing species from the earth faster than the dinosaurs disappeared 
 and leading that loss are amphibians  eighty percent of all amphibians are threatened and and in come decline  and i believe
  many scientists believe that pesticides are
 an important part of that decline  in part amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive because they don 't have protection from contaminants in the water no eggshells no membranes
 and no placenta  in fact our invention by our i mean we mammals
 one of our big inventions was the placenta  but we also start out as aquatic organisms  but it turns out that this ancient structure that separates us from other animals the
  cannot evolve or adapt fast enough
 because of the rate that we 're generating new chemicals that it 's never seen before 
 the evidence of that is that studies in rats again with atrazine show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion  
 because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones of those rats that don 't abort atrazine causes prostate disease in the pups so the sons are born with an old man 's disease of those that don
  atrazine causes impaired mammary or breast development in the exposed daughters in utero  so that their breast don 't develop properly  and as a result when those rats grow up their pups experience retarded growth and development because they can 't make enough milk to nourish their pups 
 so the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine that its grandmother
 was exposed to and given the life of many of these chemicals generations 
  dozens of years  that means that we right now are affecting the health of our grandchildren 's grandchildren by things that we 're putting into the environment today  
 and this is not just philosophical it 's already known that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen pcbs ddt cross the placenta and
 effectively determine the likelihood of developing breast cancer and obesity and diabetes already when the baby 's in the womb 
 in addition to that after the baby 's born our other unique invention as
  mammals is that we nourish our offspring after they 're born  we already know that chemicals like ddt and des and atrazine can also pass over into milk  again affecting our babies
 even after their born pjc 
 so when tyrone tells me that the placenta is an ancient organ i 'm
 thinking how do i demonstrate that how do you show that and it 's interesting when you make a film like this because you 're stuck
  trying to visualize science that there 's no visualization for and i have to take a little bit of artistic license
  and neither had i actually
 before i started making this film  and so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta and go into your unborn child it made
 me start to think what would my fetus say to me what would our unborn children say to us
 when
 they have an exposure that 's happening
  everyday day after day
  it 's a very profound notion to know that we as women are at the vanguard
  we collect these compounds our entire life and then we end up dumping it and dumping them into our unborn children
 we are in effect
 polluting our children  and this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago when i found out i was pregnant
 and the first scan revealed that my baby had a birth defect associated with exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb
 and the second scan revealed no heartbeat  
 so my child 's death my baby 's death really brought home the resonance of what i was trying to make in this film and it 's sometimes a weird place when the communicator becomes part of the story which is not what you originally intend and so when
 tyrone talks about
  the fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment this is my contaminated environment
 this is my toxic baby and that 's something that
 that 's just
 profound and sad  but astonishing because so many of us don 't actually know this th 
 one of this things that 's exciting and
  appropriate for me to be here at tedwomen is that 
 well i think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said turn to the man at your table and tell them ' when the revolution starts we 've got your back ' 
 the truth is women you 've had our back on this issue for a very long time starting with rachel carson 's silent spring 
 to theo colborn 's our stolen future to sandra steingraber 's books living downstream and having faith
  and perhaps it 's the connection to our next generation like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about thirteen years ago perhaps it 's that connection that makes women
 activists in this particular area  but for the men here i want to say it 's not just women and children that are at risk and the frogs that are exposed to atrazine 
 the testes are full of holes and spaces  because the hormone imbalance instead of allowing sperm to be generated such as in the testis here the testicular tubules end up empty and fertility goes
  down by as much as fifty percent it
 's not just my work in amphibians  
 but similar work has been shown in fish in europe  holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from south america and in rats an absence of sperm in the in the testicular tubules as well  
 and of course we don 't do these experiments in humans but just by coincidence 
 colleague has shown that men who have low sperm count low semen quality have significantly more atrazine in their urine these are just men who live in an agricultural community 
 men who actually work in agriculture have much higher levels of atrazine and the men who actually apply atrazine have even more atrazine 
  in their urine up to levels that are twenty four thousand times what we know to be active are present in the urine of these men 
  it 's not just atrazine they 're exposed to they 're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin  which was originally used as a nerve gas  and many of these workers have life expectancies of only fifty 
 it shouldn 't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife are also a warning to us just like rachel carson and others have warned 
 as evident in this slide from lake nabugabo in uganda the agricultural runoff from this crop  which goes into these buckets
  sole source of drinking cooking and bathing water for this village  
 now if i told the men in this village that the frogs have pour immune function and eggs developing in their testes the connection between environmental health and public health would be clear 
 you would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact on the wildlife that lived in it 
 the problem is in my village  oakland  in most of our villages  we don 't see that connection we turn on the faucet the water comes
  it 's safe and we assume that we are masters of our environment  rather than being part of it pjc so it
 doesn 't take much to realize that actually this is an environmental issue  and i kept thinking over and over again
 this question 
 we know so much about global warming and climate change  and yet we have no concept of what i 've been calling internal environmentalism we know what we
  out there we have a sense of those repercussions but we are so ignorant of this sense of what happens when we
 put things or things are put into our bodies  and it 's my feeling and it 's my urging
 being here to know that as we women move forward as the communicators of this but also as the ones
 who carry that burden of carrying the children bearing the children  we hold most of the buying power
  power in the household is that it 's going to be us moving forward to carry the work of tyrone and other scientists around the world and my urging is that when we think 
  about environmental issues that we remember that it 's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps  but it 's also about our children as well
