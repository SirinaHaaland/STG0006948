  all suffering from information overload or data glut  and
 the good news is there might be an easy solution to that and that 's using our eyes more  so visualizing information so that we can see the patterns and connections that
  and then designing that information so it makes more sense or it tells a story or allows us to focus only on the information that 's important  
 failing that visualized information can just look really cool so let 's see 
 this is the $ billion dollar o gram and this image arose out of frustration i had with the reporting of billion dollar amounts in the press
  they 're meaningless without context 
 five hundred billion for this pipeline twenty billion for this war it doesn 't make any sense  so the only way to understand it is visually and relatively  
 so i scraped a load of reported figures from various news outlets and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts and the colors here represent the motivation behind the money  so purple is 
 fighting and
 red is giving money
  and what you can see straight away is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers you can literally see them 
 but more importantly you start to see patterns and connections between numbers that would otherwise be scattered across multiple news reports let
 me point out some that i really like 
 this is opec 's revenue this green box here seven hundred and eighty billion a year  
 and this little pixel in the corner three billion that 's their climate change fund
 americans incredibly generous people
  over three hundred billion a year donated to charity every year  compared with the amount of foreign aid given by the top seventeen industrialized nations at one hundred and twenty billion 
 then of course the iraq war predicted to cost just sixty billion back in two thousand and three and
 it mushroomed slightly afghanistan and iraq mushroomed now to three thousand billion so
 now it 's great because now we have this texture
  can add numbers to it as well so we could say well a new figure comes out let 's see african debt how much of this diagram do you think might be taken up by the debt that africa owes to the west let 's take a look  
 so there it is two hundred and twenty seven billion
 is what africa owes and the recent financial crisis how much of this diagram might that figure take up what has that cost the world let 's
  i think is the appropriate sound effect for
 that much money  eleven thousand nine hundred
 billion  so  by visualizing this information we turned it into a landscape
 that you can explore with your eyes a kind of map really a sort of information map and when you 're lost in information an information map is kind of useful 
  show you another landscape now we need to imagine what a landscape of the world 's fears
 might look like let 's take a look  this is mountains out of molehills a timeline of global media panic 
 so i 'll label this for you in a second  but the height here i want to point out is the intensity of certain fears
 as reported in the media  let me point them out so this swine flu pink
 sars brownish here remember that one  the millennium bug  
 terrible disaster these little green peaks are asteroid collisions
  these are what our fears look like over time in our media  
 but what i love and i 'm a journalist and what i love is finding hidden patterns i love being a data detective and there 's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data that you can only see when you visualize it let
 me highlight it for you 
 see this line  this is a landscape for violent video games as you can see there 's a kind of
  regular pattern in the data twin peaks every year if we look closer we see those peaks occur at the same month every year  why 
 well  november  christmas video games come out and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content  
 but april isn 't a particularly
 massive month for
 video games why april well in april one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine was the columbine shooting and since then that fear has been remembered by the media
  and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year you have retrospectives  anniversaries court cases even  copy cat shootings 
 all pushing that fear into the agenda  
 and there 's another pattern here as well can you spot it see that gap there there 's a gap  and it affects all the other stories  
 why is there a gap there you see where it starts  september two thousand and one when we had something very real to be scared about
 so i 've been working as a data journalist for about a year and i keep hearing a phrase
 all the time which is this data is the new oil 
 data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights and it 's all around us and it can be mined very easily  
 it 's not a particularly great metaphor in these times especially if you live around the gulf
  mexico  but i would perhaps adapt this metaphor slightly and i would say that data is the new soil 
 because for me it feels like a fertile creative medium over the years  online we 've laid down
 a huge amount of information and data and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity and it 's been worked and tilled
  kind of milking the metaphor a little bit but it 's a really fertile medium  and it feels like visualizations infographics data visualizations they feel like flowers blooming from this medium  
 but if you look at it directly it 's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts  but if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way  
 interesting things can appear and and different patterns can be revealed  let me show you this 
 can you guess what this data set is what rises twice
  a year  once in easter and then two weeks before christmas has a mini peak every monday  and then flattens out over the summer
  information guru lee byron and myself we scraped ten thousand status facebook updates for the phrase
  we found people clearing out for spring break 
 coming out of very bad weekends on a monday 
 being single over the summer  and then the lowest day of the year of course  christmas day  who would do that 
 so there 's a titanic amount of data out there now unprecedented  but if you ask
  the right kind of question or you work it in the right kind of way  interesting things can emerge  
 so
 information is beautiful data is beautiful i wonder if i could make my life beautiful  
 and here 's my visual c v i 'm not quite sure i 've succeeded  pretty blocky the colors aren 't that great but i wanted to convey something
  i started as a programmer and then i worked as a writer for many years about twenty years in print online and then in advertising and only recently have i started designing and
 i 've never been to design school  i 've never studied art or anything  i just kind of learned through doing 
 and when i started designing i discovered an odd thing about myself  i already knew how to design
 but it wasn 't like i was amazingly
  amazingly brilliant at it but more like i was sensitive to the
 the ideas of grids and space and alignment and typography it
 's almost like being exposed to all this media over the years had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me
  and i don 't feel like i 'm unique  i feel that everyday all of us now are being blasted by information design 
 it 's being poured into our eyes through the web and we 're all visualizers now we 're all demanding a visual aspect to our
 information
 almost quite magical about visual information
 it 's effortless it literally pours in and if you 're navigating a dense information jungle  coming across a beautiful
 graphic or a lovely data visualization it 's a relief it 's like coming across a clearing in the jungle  i was curious about this so it led me to the work of a danish physicist called
  and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms  
 so here we go this is your senses pouring into your senses every second 
 your sense of sight is the fastest  it has the same bandwidth as a computer network 
 then you have touch which is about the speed of a usb key  and then you have hearing and smell which has the throughput of a hard disk and then you have poor old taste which is like
 barely the throughput of a pocket calculator  and that little square in the corner
 a naught 7 percent that 's the amount we 're actually aware of so a lot of your vision the bulk of it is visual and it 's pouring in it 's unconscious 
 the eye is exquisitely sensitive to patterns in variations in color shape and pattern 
 it loves them and it calls them beautiful it 's the language of the eye  if you combine the language of the eye
 with the language of the mind which is about words and numbers and
  concepts  you start speaking two languages simultaneously each enhancing the other 
 so you have the eye  and then you drop in the concepts and that whole thing it 's two languages both working at the same time  
 so we can use this new kind of language if you like to alter our perspective or change our views
 let me ask you a simple question with a really simple answer  who has the biggest military budget it 's got to be
 america right massive six hundred and nine billion in two thousand and eight six hundred and seven rather 
 so massive in fact that it can contain all the other military budgets in the world inside itself gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble 
 now you can see africa 's total debt there and the u k budget deficit for reference  
 so
 that might well chime with your view that america is a sort of warmongering military machine out to overpower the world with its huge
  complex 
 but is it true that america has the biggest military budget 
 because america is an incredibly rich country in fact it 's so massively rich that it can contain the four other top industrialized nations ' economies inside itself it 's
 so vastly rich so its military budget is bound to be enormous
  to be fair and to alter our perspective we have to bring in another data set and that data set is gdp or the country 's earnings  who has the biggest budget as a proportion of gdp let 's have a look that
 changes the picture considerably 
 other countries pop into view that you perhaps weren 't considering  and american drops into eighth now you can also do this with soldiers  who has the most soldiers it 's got to be
 china of course two point one million again chiming with your view that china has a militarized regime ready to you know mobilize its enormous forces
 but of course  china has an enormous population so if we do the same we see a radically different picture  china drops to 
 it actually has a tiny army
 when you take other data into consideration  
 so  absolute figures like the military budget in a connected world don 't give you the whole picture they 're not as true as they could be 
 we need relative figures that are connected to other data
  can see a fuller picture  and then that can lead to us changing our perspective as hans rosling the master my master  said 
 let the dataset change your mindset 
 and if it can do that maybe it can also change your behavior take a look at this one i 'm a bit of a health nut  i love
  taking supplements and being fit but i can never
 understand what 's going on in terms of evidence there 's always conflicting evidence should i take vitamin c should i be taking wheatgrass 
 this is a visualization of all the evidence for nutritional supplements
 this kind of diagram is called a balloon race  
 so the higher up the image  the more evidence there is for each supplement and the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to google hits
  so you can immediately apprehend the relationship between efficacy and popularity 
 but you can also if you grade the evidence do a worth it line so supplements above this line
 are worth investigating but only for the conditions
 listed below and then the supplements below the line
 are perhaps not worth investigating now this image constitutes a huge amount of work we scraped like one thousand studies from pubmed the biomedical database
  and we compiled them and graded them all and it was incredibly frustrating for me because i had a book of two hundred and fifty
 visualizations to do for my book and i spent a month doing this and i only filled two pages but what it points to is that
 visualizing information like this is a form of knowledge compression it 's a way of squeezing an enormous amount of information and understanding into a small space
  and once you 've curated that data and once you 've cleaned that data and once it 's there you can do cool stuff like this so i converted this into an interactive app  
 so i can now generate this application online this is the visualization online and i can say yeah brilliant 
 so it spawns itself  and then i can say well just show me the stuff that affects heart health so let
 's filter that out  so heart is filtered out so i can see if i 'm curious about that i think
  want to take any synthetics i just want to see plants and and
 just show me herbs and plants i 've got all the natural ingredients 
 now this app is spawning itself from the data the data is all stored in a google doc  and it 's literally generating itself from that data so the data is now alive this is a living image and i can update it in a second new evidence
  it can go beyond data and it can go beyond numbers i like to apply information visualization
 to ideas and concepts  this is a visualization of the
 political spectrum an attempt for me to try and understand how it works and how the ideas percolate down
  from government into society and culture into families into individuals into their beliefs and and back around again in a cycle 
 what i love about this image is
 it 's made up of concepts it explores our worldviews and it helps us it helps me anyway to see what others think to see where they 're coming from and it feels
 just incredibly cool to do that
 most exciting for me
 designing this was that when i was designing this image  
 i desperately wanted this side  the left side to be better than the right side being a journalist a left leaning person
 but i couldn 't because i would have created a lopsided  biased diagram 
 so in order to really create a full image i had to honor the perspectives on the right hand side and at the same time
  uncomfortably recognize how many of those qualities were actually in me which was very very annoying and uncomfortable 
 but not too uncomfortable because there 's something
 unthreatening about seeing a political perspective  versus being told or forced to
  you 're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints joyously when you can see them it 's even fun to engage with them because it 's visual so that 's what
 's exciting to me  seeing how data can change my perspective and change my mind midstream beautiful lovely data 
 so 
 just to wrap up i wanted to say that
 it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions  and information design
 is about solving information problems it feels like we have a lot of information problems in our society at the moment from the overload and the saturation to the breakdown of trust and reliability 
  and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency or even just interestingness i mean i find information just too interesting it has a magnetic quality that draws me in 
  visualizing information can give us a very quick solution
 to those kinds of problems even when the information is terrible the visual can be quite beautiful
 often we can get clarity or the answer to a simple question very quickly like this one 
 the recent icelandic volcano  
 which was emitting the most co2 was it the planes
 or the volcano  the grounded planes or the volcano  so we can have a look we look at the data and we see
 the volcano emitted one hundred and fifty thousand tons the grounded planes would have emitted three hundred and forty five thousand if they were in the sky  so essentially  we had our first
