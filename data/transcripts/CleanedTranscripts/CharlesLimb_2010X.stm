  so i am a surgeon who studies creativity  and i have never had a patient tell me i really want you to be creative during surgery 
 and so i guess there 's a little bit of irony to it  
 i will say though that
  after having done surgery a lot  
 it 's similar to playing a musical instrument and for me  this deep and enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and to study the science of sound particularly music
 i 'm going to talk over the next few minutes about about my career in terms of how i 'm able
 to study music and try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative 
 i 've done most of this work at johns hopkins university and at the national institute of health where i was previously i 'll go over some science experiments and cover three musical experiments
 i will start off by playing a video for you this video is of keith jarrett who 's a well known jazz improviser and probably the most well known 
 iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a higher level and he 'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head 
 and he 'll never play it exactly the same way again  so
 as a form of intense creativity i think this is a great example
 the
  i 've always as a listener as a fan i listen to that and i 'm astounded i think how can this possibly be 
 how can the brain generate that much information that much music  spontaneously  and so i set out with this concept scientifically that
  it 's magical but it 's not magic  meaning that it 's a product of the brain there 's not too many brain dead people creating art  
 with this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product  i took this thesis that we could study it
 just like we study any other complex neurologic process and 
 i put there is it possible to study creativity scientifically and i think that 's a good question and i 'll tell you that most
  they 're very dense and when you go through them it 's very hard to recognize the music in it in fact they seem to be unmusical entirely and to miss the point of the music
 this brings the second question why should scientists study creativity maybe we 're not the right people to do it well
 it may be  but i will say that from a scientific perspective we talked a lot about innovation today the science of innovation
  how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy 
 and truly we know very little about how we are able to be creative i think that we 're going to see over the next ten twenty thirty years a real science of creativity that 's burgeoning and is going to flourish because we now have new methods that can
 enable us to take this process like complex jazz improvisation and study it rigorously 
 so it gets down to the brain  all of us have this remarkable brain which is poorly understood to say the least i think that
 neuroscientists
  have more questions than answers and  i 'm not going to give you answers today just ask a lot of questions and that 's what i do in my lab i ask questions about what is the brain doing to enable us to do this 
 this is the main method that i use this is functional mri 
 if you 've been in an mri scanner it 's very much the same but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain 
 the way that 's done is by the following there 's something called bold
  imaging which is blood oxygen level dependent imaging 
 when you 're in an fmri scanner you 're in a big magnet that 's aligning your molecules in certain areas 
 when an area of the brain is active  meaning a neural area is active it gets blood flow shunted to that area that blood flow causes an increase
 in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by mri whereas
 oxyhemoglobin can 't 
 so through this method of inference and we 're measuring blood flow not neural activity we say that an area of the brain that 's getting more blood was active during a particular task and that 's the crux of how fmri works  and it 's been used since the ' 90s to study really complex processes
 i 'm going to review a study that i did which was jazz in an fmri scanner
  done with a colleague alan braun at the nih  this is a short video of how we did this project
  midi signal or a musical instrument digital interface through these wires into the box and
  and so through this piano keyboard we have the means to take a musical process and study it  so what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard you can 't just
  experiment really rests on the following 
 what happens in the brain during something that 's memorized and over learned and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated or improvised in a way that 's matched motorically and in terms of lower level sensory motor features 
 i have here what we call the paradigms there 's a scale paradigm which is playing a scale up and down memorized then there 's improvising on a scale quarter notes metronome right hand
 scientifically very safe  but musically really boring
 then there 's the bottom one which is called the jazz paradigm so we brought professional jazz players to the nih and we had them memorize this piece of music on the lower left which is what you heard me playing
 and we had them improvise to the same chord changes  and if you can hit that  lower right sound icon that 's an example of what was recorded in
  in the end it 's not the most natural environment  but they 're able to play real music and i 've listened to that solo two hundred times and i still like it  and
 the musicians were comfortable in the end  we first measured the number of notes were they playing more notes when they were improvising  that was not what was going on and then we looked at the brain activity i will try to condense this for you 
 these are contrast maps
  that are showing subtractions between what changes when you 're improvising vs when you 're doing something memorized in red is an area that 's active in the prefrontal cortex the frontal lobe of the brain  and in blue is this
  area that was deactivated so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity we had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity i 'll
 self reflection introspection working memory etc really consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe  
 but we have this combination of an area that 's thought to be involved in self monitoring turning off and this area that 's thought to be autobiographical or self expressive turning on we think at least in this preliminary
 it 's one study it 's probably wrong but it 's one study we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that to be creative
 should have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe  one area turns on and a big area shuts off so that you 're not inhibited you 're willing to make mistakes so that you 're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses 
 now
 a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity sometimes it 's done communicatively  the next question was what happens when
  musicians are trading back and forth something called trading fours which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment  so
 this is a 12 bar blues  and i 've broken it down into four bar groups so you would know how you would trade
 we brought a musician into the scanner same way had them memorize this melody then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively
  in the control room here playing back and forth
  a pretty good representation of of what it 's like and it 's good that it 's not too quick the fact that we do it over and over again
 lets you acclimate
 to your surroundings so
 the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing looking at my hands through two mirrors 
  take a few moments  so what you 're seeing here and i 'm doing a cardinal sin in science which is to show you preliminary data
  this is one subject 's data  this is in fact mike pope 's data  so what am i showing you here when he was trading fours with me improvising vs memorized  his language areas 
  lit up his broca 's area in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left he had it also homologous on the right this is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication 
 're getting all the data together hopefully we 'll have something to say about it meaningfully 
 now when i think about improvisation and the language what 's next rap of course rap freestyle  i 've always been fascinated by freestyle and let 's play this video
  so there 's a lot of analogy between what takes place in freestyle rap and jazz there are a lot of correlates between the two forms of music i think in different time periods in lot of ways  rap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve 
 so how do you study rap
  and my colleagues think i 'm crazy but i think it 's very viable 
 this is what you do you have a freestyle artist come and memorize a rap that you write for them that they 've never heard before and then you have them freestyle so
 i told my lab members that i would rap for ted and they said
 ok so what we had them do was memorize this  lower left sound icon please this is the control condition   this is what they memorized
  dressed psychopathic words in my head appear
 whisper these lyrics only i can hear computer art cl the art of discovering and that which is hovering inside the mind of those unconfined
 all of these words keep pouring out like rain i need a mad scientist to check my brain
  i guarantee you that will never happen again 
 laughter so now what 's great about these free stylers they will get cued different words they don 't know what 's coming but they 'll hear something off the cuff go hit that right sound icon
  a short video of how we
 four rappers ' brains and we do see language areas lighting up but then eyes closed when you are freestyling vs memorizing you 've got major visual areas lighting 
  up you 've got major cerebellar activity which is involved in motor coordination you have heightened brain activity when you 're doing a comparable task when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized  
  a lot of questions
