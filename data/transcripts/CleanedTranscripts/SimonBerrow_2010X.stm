  basking sharks are awesome creatures  they are just magnificent  they grow ten meters long some say bigger
  they might weigh up to two tons 
 some say up to five tons they 're the second largest fish in the world  they 're also harmless plankton feeding animals and they are thought to be able to
  filter a cubic kilometer of water every hour
 and can feed on thirty kilos of zoo plankton a day to survive  they 're fantastic creatures we 're very lucky in ireland we have plenty of basking sharks and plenty of opportunities to study them  
 they were very important to coastal communities going back hundreds of years
 especially around the claddaghduff connemara
  subsistence farmers used to sail out on their hookers and open boats sometimes way offshore to a place called the sunfish bank  about thirty miles west of achill island to kill the basking sharks this is a woodcut from about the 
  they were very important for the oil out of their liver a third of the basking shark 's size is their liver and it 's full of oil gallons of oil  that oil was used especially for lighting but also for dressing wounds and other things in fact the streetlights in one thousand seven
  of galway dublin and waterford were lit with sunfish oil sunfish is one of the words for basking sharks  so they were incredibly important animals  they 've been around a long time very important to coastal communities 
  basking shark fishery in the world is that from achill island  this is keem bay up in achill island  sharks used to come into the bay and the fishermen would tie a net off the headland string it out an
  and as the shark came round  it would hit the net the net would collapse on it it would often drown and suffocate or at times they would row out in their small  curraghs and kill it with a lance through the back 
  of the neck and then they 'd tow the sharks back to purteen harbour  boil them up use the oil  they also used
  maybe five or six people get killed by by sharks every year  there was someone recently wasn 't there just a couple weeks ago  we kill about one hundred million sharks a year so i don 't
 know what the balance is but i think sharks have more right to be fearful of us than we have of them  
 it was a well documented fishery as you can see here it peaked in the ' 50s where they were killing one thousand five hundred sharks a year  and it declined very fast a classic boom and bust fishery  which suggests that
 a stock has been depleted or there 's low reproductive rates  they killed about twelve thousand sharks within this period literally just by stringing
 a manila rope off the tip of of keem bay up in achill island 
 sharks were still killed up into the  mid 80s especially out of places like dunmore east in county waterford about two and a half three thousand sharks were killed up till ' eighty five
  but these are norwegian basking shark hunting vessels the black line in the crow 's nest signifies this is a shark vessel rather than a
 whaling vessel  the importance of basking sharks to to the coast communities is recognized through the language
 i don 't pretend to [ know many irish words ] but in kerry they were often known as
  the great fish of the sun that 's a lovely evocative name on tory island a strange place anyway they were known as muldoons no one seems to know why hope
 there 's no one from tory here lovely place 
 but more commonly all around the island they were known as the sunfish and this
  represents their habit of basking on the surface
 when the sun is out there 's great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout throughout the world
 some say it 's not population decline it might be a change in the distribution of plankton it 's been suggested that these sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change as they 're basically continuous plankton recorders  swimming around with their mouth open  
 they 're now listed as vulnerable under the 
  to try and stop catching them there 's now a ban on catching  and even landing them even landing ones caught accidentally  they 're not protected in ireland in fact they have no legislative status in ireland whatsoever 
 despite our importance for the species and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside 
 behavior on the surface i only found out
 last year at a conference on the isle of man just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly frequently and predictably come to the surface to 
 it 's a fantastic opportunity for a scientist to see and experience basking sharks they are awesome creatures
 it gives us a fantastic opportunity to study them to get access to them what we 've been doing for a couple years last year was a big year is we started tagging
 sharks  so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity
  and movement and things like that  so we concentrated mainly in north donegal and west kerry as the two areas where where i was mainly active  and
 we tagged them very simply not very high tech with a big long pole this is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end you go up in your boat
 and tag the shark
 and we were
  one hundred and five sharks last summer we got fifty in three days
 off inishowen peninsula  half the challenge to get access is to be in the right place at the right time  but it 's a very simple easy technique 
 i 'll show you what it looks like 
 we use a pole camera on the boat to actually film the shark one it 's to try and work out the gender of the shark  we also deployed some satellite tags so we did use high tech stuff as well  these are archival tags
  what they do is store the data a satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite and sharks and fish are underwater most of the time so this tag actually works out the locations of shark  depending on the
 timing and the setting of the sun plus water temperature and depth  and you have to kind of reconstruct the path 
 what happens is you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period in this case eight months and literally to the day the tag popped off drifted up said hello to the satellite and
 not all the data but enough data for us to use  this is the only way to really work out their behavior and movements when they 're underwater  
 and here 's a couple of maps that we 've done in that one 
 you can see that we tagged both off kerry basically it spent all its time the last eight months in irish waters on christmas it was out on the shelf edge  here 's one we haven 't
  and water depth  but again the second shark spent most of its time in and around the irish sea  colleagues from the isle of man last year actually tagged one shark that went from the isle of man to nova scotia 
 in about ninety days  nine and a half thousand kilometers we never thought that happened another colleague in the states tagged about twenty sharks off massachusetts his tags didn 't really work all he knows 
 is where he tagged them and where they popped off his tags popped off in the caribbean  and even in brazil
  basking sharks were temperate animals and lived in
 our latitudes but in actual fact  they 're obviously crossing the equator as well  so very simple things like that we 're trying to learn about basking sharks  
 one thing that i think is a very
 surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks is i 'm not a geneticist so i won
  to understand the genetics and that 's why it 's great to have collaboration whereas i 'm a field person i get panic attacks if i have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on 
 take me away
  so we can work with geneticists who understand that  so when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks  they found that the diversity was incredibly low if you look at the first line really you can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar
  come from a common ancestry 
 but if you look at nucleotide diversity  which is more genetics that are passed on through the parents you see that basking sharks if you look at the first study 
 was order of magnitude less diverse even than other shark species you can see this work was only done in two thousand and six before two thousand and six we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks we had no idea did they distinguish into different populations
  that 's very important if you want to know what the population size is and the status of the animals  so 
 les noble in aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable really  so
 he did another study using
 microsatellites which is much more expensive much more time consuming and to his surprise came up with almost identical results  
 so it does seem to be that basking sharks for some reason have incredibly low diversity and it 's thought maybe it was a genetic bottleneck
  thought to have been twelve thousand years ago  and this has caused a very low diversity and yet if you look at the whale shark which is the other plankton eating large
 shark  its diversity is much greater so it doesn 't really make sense at all 
 they found that there was no genetic differentiation between any of the world 's oceans of basking sharks even though they 're found throughout the world you couldn 't tell the difference genetically from one from the pacific atlantic new zealand
  africa  they all basically seem the same which again  is kind of surprising you wouldn 't expect that  
 i don 't understand or pretend to understand this i suspect most geneticists don 't either but they produce the numbers so you can actually estimate the population size based on the diversity of the genetics 
 and rus hoelzel came up with an effective population size eight thousand two hundred animals that 's it
 eight thousand animals in the world you 're thinking
 that 's ridiculous no way so les did a finer study  and he found out it came out about nine thousand
 using different microsatellites gave the different results but the mean of all these studies
  is about five thousand  which i personally don 't believe but then i am a skeptic  
 but even if you toss a few numbers around you 're probably talking an effective population of about twenty thousand animals do you remember how many they killed off achill
  in the 70s and the 50s so what it tells us actually is that
 there 's actually a risk of extinction of this species because its population is so small in fact of those twenty thousand eight thousand were thought to be females there
 's only eight thousand basking shark females in the world  i don 't know  i don 't believe it 
 the problem with this is they were
  didn 't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail so where do you get
 samples from for your genetic analysis 
 well one obvious source is dead sharks dead sharks washed up we might get two or three dead sharks washed up in ireland a year if we 're kind of lucky  
 another source would be fisheries ' bycatch we were getting quite a few caught in in surface drift nets that 's banned now
  and some are caught in nets in trawls this is a shark that was actually landed in howth
 just before christmas illegally  because you 're not allowed to do that under eu law and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak they even put a recipe up on the wall until they were told it was illegal they actually did get a fine for that  
 so
 if you look at all those studies i showed you the total number of
  it 's very important work and they can ask some really good questions and tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure  but they 're constrained by lack of samples
 when we were out tagging our sharks this is how we tagged them on on the front of a rib get in there fast
 occasionally the sharks do react on one occasion when we were up in malin head in
  the shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail more i think in startle to the fact that a boat came near it rather than
 the tag going in  and that that was fine we got wet  no problem  and then when myself and emmett got back to
 to malin head 
 to the pier  i noticed some black slime on the front of the boat i used to spend a lot of time on commercial fishing boats and i remember fishermen saying they can tell when a basking shark has been caught in a net because it leaves a black slime behind
 in getting tissue samples for genetics because we knew they were very valuable  we would use conventional methods i have a crossbow you see it in my hand there 
 which we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well  so i tried that i tried many techniques all it was doing was breaking my arrows  
 because the shark 's skin is just so strong there was no way we were going to get a sample from that
  that wasn 't going to work  so when i saw the black slime on the on the bow of the boat i thought if you take what you 're given in this world so i scraped it off i had a little tube
 with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists so i scraped the slime off and sent it to aberdeen and said 
 you might try that and they sat on it for months it was only because we had a conference on the isle of man  but i kept emailing les saying have you had a chance to look at my slime
 he might lose face if he hadn 't done the thing i sent him
 and he was amazed that they actually got dna from the slime they amplified it and they tested it and they found yes this was actually basking shark
 dna which was got from the slime  so he was very excited it became known as simon 's shark slime
  slime  so having spent three and a half thousand on satellite tags 
 i then thought i 'd invest seven point nine five the price is still on it in my local hardware store in kilrush for a mop handle 
 and even less money on some oven cleaners  and i wrapped the oven cleaner around the edge of the mop handle
  desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks and this was into august now and normally sharks peak in june july and you rarely see them or rarely can be in the right place to find sharks into august 
 we were desperate so we rushed out to the blaskets as soon as we heard there were sharks there 
 and managed to find some sharks so by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat
 you see a shark running under the boat here
  we managed to collect slime  and here it is look at that lovely black
 shark slime  
 and in about half an hour  we got five samples five individual sharks were sampled using simon 's shark slime sampling system 
  a bit more dramatic you probably saw the humpback whale footage we got a month or two ago off county wexford  and you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind and i was thinking of
 humpback whales breaching and dolphins  but hey
 sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come so this is possibly going to be my my legacy
  we got more money this year to carry on collecting more and more samples one thing that  that is very useful is that we use a pole camera this is my colleague joanne with a pole camera where you can look underneath 
  the shark what you 're trying to look at is the males have claspers  which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark  so you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark  if we can tell the gender of the shark before we
  we can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female  because in the moment they have no way  genetically of telling the difference between a male and a female  which i find staggering
 because they don 't know what primers to look for being able to tell the gender of a shark is very important for things like
 policing the trade in in basking shark and other species through the sightings because it is illegal to trade
  and they are caught and are on the market
  so as a field biologist you just want to get encounters with these animals and learn as much as you can they 're often quite brief they 're often very seasonally constrained you just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can
 but
 isn 't it fantastic that you can then offer these samples and opportunities to other disciplines such as the geneticists who can gain so much more from that
  as i said these things are sent to you in strange ways grab them while you can i 'll take that as my scientific legacy hopefully i might get something a bit more dramatic and romantic before i die  but
 for the time being thank you for that and keep an eye out for sharks  if you 're more interested we have a basking shark website now set up so thank you and thank you for listening
