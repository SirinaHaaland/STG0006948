  the most massive tsunami
 perfect storm is bearing down upon us 
 this perfect storm is
  mounting a grim reality increasingly grim reality  and
 we are facing
 that reality
 with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology and that 's very understandable 
 now this perfect storm that we are facing
 is the result of our rising population rising towards ten billion
  people land that is turning to desert and of course climate change  
 now there 's no question about it at all we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology  
 but fossil fuels carbon coal and gas
 are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change
  desertification
 is a fancy word
 for land that is turning to desert  and this happens only when
 we create too much bare ground there 's no other cause  and i intend to focus on most of the world 's land that is turning to desert  
 but i have for you a very simple message
  that offers more hope than you can imagine 
 we have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year on those it is almost impossible
 to create vast areas of bare ground no matter what you do nature covers it up so quickly  and we have environments
  where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness  and that is where desertification is occurring  
 fortunately with space technology now we can look at it from space and when we do 
 you can see the proportions fairly well  
 generally what you see in green is not desertifying  
 and what you see in brown is and these are by far the greatest areas of the earth about two thirds  i would guess of the world is desertifying
 i took this picture in the tihamah desert while twenty five millimeters that 's an inch of rain was falling think of it in terms of drums of water each containing two hundred liters 
 over one thousand drums of water fell on every hectare of that land that day
  the next day the land looked like this where had that water gone 
 some of it ran off as flooding  
 but most of the water that soaked into the soil simply evaporated out again  exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered 
 now because the fate of water and carbon
 are tied to soil organic matter
  when we damage soils you give off carbon carbon goes back to the atmosphere  now you 're told
 over and over repeatedly that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi arid areas of the world  
 and that tall grasslands like this one
 in high rainfall are of no consequence
  but if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you 've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae  
 leading to increased runoff and evaporation that is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form  
 now we know that desertification is caused by livestock
  cattle sheep and goats overgrazing the plants
  leaving the soil bare and giving off methane 
 almost everybody knows this from nobel laureates to golf caddies or was taught it as i was now 
 the environments like you see here dusty environments in africa where i grew up  and i loved
  wildlife  and so i grew up hating
 livestock because of the damage they were doing 
 and then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs  
 well  i have news for you  
 we were once just as certain that the world was flat  we were wrong then
  and we are wrong again  and i want to invite you now to come along on my journey
 of reeducation and discovery  
 when i was a young man a
 young biologist in africa i was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks 
 now no sooner
  no sooner did we remove the hunting drum beating people to protect the animals 
 than the land began to deteriorate as you see in this park
 that we formed  
 now no livestock were involved 
 but suspecting that we had too many elephants now i did the research and i proved we had too many
  and i recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain 
 now that was a terrible decision for me to have to make  
 and it was political dynamite frankly so our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research 
  they agreed with me and over the following years  we shot forty thousand elephants to try to stop the damage 
 and it got worse not better  
 loving elephants as i do that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life  and i will carry that to my grave 
 one good thing did come out of it it made me absolutely determined to devote my life
 to finding solutions  
 when i came to the united states  i got a shock 
 to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in africa 
 and there 'd been no livestock on this land for over seventy years  and i found that american scientists had
 no explanation for this except that it
  is arid and natural so i then began
 looking
 at all the research plots i could over the whole of the western united states where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification  but i found the opposite 
 as we see on this research
  by two thousand and two had changed to that situation 
 and the authors of the position paper on climate change from which i obtained these pictures
 attribute this change to unknown processes 
 clearly we have never understood what is causing desertification
  has destroyed
 many civilizations and now threatens us globally we have never understood it 
 take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here  and i promise you you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday
 than that
 same piece of ground if it 's just covered with litter plant litter 
 you have changed the microclimate  now by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly
 the percentage of bare ground on
 more than half the world 's land you are changing macroclimate  
 but we have just simply not understood why was it
 beginning to happen ten thousand years ago  why has it
  accelerated lately we had no understanding of that what we had failed to understand
 was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world the soil and the vegetation
 developed with very large numbers of grazing animals  and that
  is to get into herds and the larger the herd the safer the individuals  
 now  large herds dung and urinate all over their own food and they have to keep moving  
 and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants
  while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil as we see where a herd has passed 
 this picture
 is a typical seasonal grassland it has just come through four months of rain  
 and it 's now going into eight months of dry season  and watch the change as it goes into this long dry season
  all of that grass you see aboveground
 has to decay biologically before the next growing season  and if it doesn 't the grassland and the soil begin to die  
 now  if it does not decay biologically it shifts to oxidation which is a very slow process  and this smothers and kills grasses
  leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil  releasing carbon 
 to prevent that we have traditionally used fire but fire also
 leaves the soil bare  releasing carbon  and worse than that  
 burning one hectare of grassland gives off more and more damaging
  pollutants than six thousand cars  and we are burning
 in africa every single year 
 more than one billion hectares of grasslands  and almost nobody is talking about it 
 we justify the burning as
  because it does remove the dead material and it allows the plants to grow  
 now looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry what could we do to keep that healthy and bear in mind i 'm talking of most of the world 's land now  
 okay  we cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change  
 we cannot burn it without causing desertification and climate change what are
  we going to do 
 there is only one option 
 i 'll repeat to you  only one option left to climatologists and scientists  and that is to do the unthinkable  
 and to use livestock 
  and moving as a proxy for former herds and predators  and mimic nature there
 is no other alternative left to mankind 
 so let 's do that  
 so on this bit of grassland we 'll do it but just in the foreground  we 'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature 
 and we 've done so  and look at that 
 all of that grass is now covering the soil
 as dung urine and litter
  or mulch as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand 
 and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain to store carbon  and to break down methane  
 and we did that  without using fire to damage the soil and the plants are free to grow
  when i first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much vilified livestock to
 address climate change and desertification
  i was faced with a real dilemma how were we to do it we
 'd had ten thousand years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals  
 but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world  then we 'd had
 one hundred years of modern rain science  and that had accelerated desertification as we first discovered in africa and then confirmed in the united states  and as you see in this picture
 of land managed by the federal government  clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals 
  over thousands of years had never been able to deal with nature 's complexity  
 but we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this 
 so rather than reinvent the wheel  i began studying other professions to see if anybody had  
 and i found there were planning techniques that i could take and adapt to our biological need and from those i developed what we call holistic
  management and planned grazing a planning process  and that does address all of nature 's complexity and our social environmental  economic complexity 
 today we have young women like this one teaching villages in africa how to put their animals together into
  plan their grazing to mimic nature and where we have them hold their animals overnight we run them in a   predator friendly manner because we have a lot of lands and so on
 and where they do this and hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well  
 let 's look at some results this is land close to land that we manage
  in zimbabwe 
 it has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year  and it 's going into the long dry season  but as you can see all of that rain almost of all it has evaporated from the soil surface 
 their river is dry despite the rain just having ended  and we have one hundred and fifty thousand people on almost permanent food aid  
 now let 's go to our land nearby on the same day
 with the same rainfall and look at that our river is flowing and healthy and clean it 's
 fine 
 the production of grass shrubs  trees wildlife  everything is now more productive  and we have
 virtually no fear of dry years
  and we did that by increasing the cattle and goats four hundred percent 
 planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants buffalo giraffe and other
 animals that we have but before we began our land looked like that 
 this site was bare and eroding for over thirty years regardless of what rain we
  got  okay  watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature 
 this was another site where it had been bare and eroding and at the base of the marked small tree we had lost over thirty centimeters of soil  
 okay  and again  watch the
  change just using livestock to mimic nature and there are fallen trees in there now because the better land is now attracting elephants etc 
 this land in mexico was in terrible condition  and i 've had to mark the hill because the change is so profound 
 i began helping a family
  in the karoo desert in 
 turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland and thankfully now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future  
 and look at the amazing change in this one where that gully has completely healed
 using nothing
 but livestock mimicking nature and once more we have the
  third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying  
 the vast grasslands of patagonia are turning to desert as you see here  the man in the middle is an argentinian researcher  and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers
  thousand sheep in one flock 
 really mimicking nature now with planned grazing   and they have documented a 50 percent increase in the production of the land in the first year  
 we now have in the violent horn of africa
 pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture
 ninety five percent of that land can only feed people from animals  
 i remind you that i am talking about most of the world 's land here
 that controls our fate including the most violent region of the world  where only animals can feed people from about ninety five percent of the land 
 what we are doing globally
  causing climate change as much as i believe fossil fuels and maybe more
 than fossil fuels but worse than that it is causing hunger  poverty  violence social breakdown and war  and as i am 
 talking to you  millions of men women and children are suffering and dying  
 we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing  even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels  
 i believe i 've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this 
 we are
  are already doing so on about fifteen million hectares on five continents  
 and people who understand far more about carbon than i do calculate that for illustrative purposes if we do what i am showing you here  
 we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years  and if we just do that on about half
  the world 's grasslands that i 've shown you  we can take us back to pre industrial levels  while feeding people 
 i can think of almost nothing
 that offers more hope for our planet for your children  and their children  and all of humanity thank
  one quick question when you first start this and you bring in a flock of of animals it 's desert what do they eat how does that part work 
 we have done this for a long time and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation
 many years ago we took the worst land in zimbabwe  where i offered a five note
 in a hundred mile drive if somebody could find one grass
 in a hundred mile drive and on that we trebled the stocking rate the number of animals in the first year with no feeding just by the movement mimicking nature and using a sigmoid curve
 that principle it 's a little bit technical to explain here but just that ca well i would love to i mean this such an interesting and important idea  the best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and 
 i want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk as wonderful ca
