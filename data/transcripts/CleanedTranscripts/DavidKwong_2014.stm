  and magic i work in what most people think are two distinct fields  but i believe they are the same 
 i am both a magician and a new york times crossword puzzle constructor
 which basically means i 've taken the world 's two nerdiest hobbies and combined them into one career  and i believe that magic and puzzles are the same
 because they both key into one of the most important human drives  the urge to solve 
 human beings are wired to solve to make order out of chaos 
 it 's certainly true for me  i 've been solving my whole life
 high school consisted of epic scrabble matches in the cafeteria and not really talking to girls  
 and then at about that time i started learning magic tricks and definitely not talking to girls  
 there 's nothing like starting a conversation with hey did you know that ' prestidigitation ' is worth twenty points in scrabble 
 but back then i noticed an intersection between puzzles and illusion
 when you do the crossword puzzle
 or when you watch a magic show you become a solver 
 and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos the chaos of say a black and white puzzle grid 
 a mixed up bag of scrabble tiles or a shuffled pack of playing cards  
 and today
  an illusion designer  i create that chaos  i test your ability to solve  
 now it turns out research tells us that solving is as primal as eating and sleeping 
 from birth  we are wired to solve 
 in one  ucla study newborns still in the hospital were shown
  and then the pattern was changed 
 triangle square  
 and by tracking an infant 's gaze  
 we know that newborns as young as a day old can notice and respond to disruptions in order it 's remarkable 
 so from infancy through old age  the urge to solve unites us all 
 and i even found this photo on instagram of pop star katy perry
  a crossword puzzle with her morning coffee like 
 now solving exists across all cultures  
 the american invention is the crossword puzzle and this year we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the crossword
  first published in the new york world but many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well  china gives us tangrams which would test solvers ' abilities to form shapes from the jumbled pieces chaos 
 order order 
 and order  that one 's my favorite let 's hear it again 
 okay and how about this puzzle invented in
  jigsaw puzzle is this not making order out of chaos  
 so as you can see we are always solving 
 we are always trying to decode our world 
 it 's an eternal quest it 's just like the one cervantes wrote about in don quixote which by the way is the root of the word
  because i need somebody smart here
 because now i 'm going to demonstrate with the help of one of you just how deeply rooted your urge to solve is just how wired to solve all of you really are
