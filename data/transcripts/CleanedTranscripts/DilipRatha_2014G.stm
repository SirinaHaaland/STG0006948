  village in orissa in india  my father was a government worker
 could not read or write  but she would say to me 
 a king is worshipped only in his own kingdom a poet
 is respected everywhere 
 so i wanted to be a poet when i grew up but i almost didn 't go to college
 until an aunt offered financial help
 i went to study in sambalpur the largest
 town in the region where  already in college  i saw a television for the first time  
 i had dreams of going to the united states for higher studies 
  i crossed two oceans with borrowed money for airfare
 and only a $ twenty bill in my pocket 
 in the u s 
 i worked in a research center part time while taking graduate classes in economics and
 with the little i earned  i would finance myself and then i would send money home to my brother and my father
 my story is not unique there are millions of people who migrate each year 
 with the help of the family  they cross oceans  they cross deserts  they cross rivers  
 they cross mountains  they risk their lives
 to realize a dream and that
  dream is as simple as having a decent job somewhere so they can send money home
 and help the family  which has helped them before 
 there are two hundred and thirty two million international migrants in the world  these are people who live in a country other than their country of birth
  if there was a country made up of only international migrants that would be larger  in population than brazil  
 that would be larger  in its size of the economy than france  
 some one hundred and eighty million of them from poor countries 
 send money home regularly those sums of money are called remittances  
 here is a fact that might surprise you
  hundred and thirteen billion dollars 
 four hundred and thirteen billion dollars was the amount of remittances sent last year by migrants to developing countries  
 migrants from developing countries money sent to developing countries four hundred and thirteen billion dollars  
 that 's a remarkable number because that is three times the size of the total of development aid money 
 and yet
  you
 and i my colleagues in washington 
 we endlessly debate and discuss about development aid  while we ignore remittances as small change  
 true people send two hundred dollars per month on average  but repeated month after month  by millions of people 
 these sums of money add up to rivers of foreign currency
  currency  so india  last year received seventy two billion dollars larger than its it exports
 in egypt remittances are three times the size of revenues from the suez canal
  in tajikistan remittances are forty two percent of gdp  and in poorer countries smaller
  a lifeline as in somalia or in haiti  
 no wonder these flows have huge impacts on economies and on poor people 
 remittances  unlike private investment money they don 't
 flow back at the first sign of trouble in the country
  they actually act like an insurance 
 when the family is in trouble  facing hardship  facing hard times remittances increase  they act like an insurance  migrants send more money then 
 unlike development aid money that must go through official agencies through governments remittances
 directly reach the poor reach the family  and often with business
  the share of poor people in the population  by two thousand and five a decade later 
 at a time of political crisis  economic crisis  the share of poor people went down
 to thirty one percent  that decline in poverty 
 most of it about half of it is believed to be because of remittances from india  another poor country
  in el salvador  the school dropout rate among children
 is lower in families that receive remittances in mexico and sri lanka  the birth weight of children is higher
 among families that receive remittances 
 remittances are dollars wrapped with care
  send money home for food for buying necessities  for building houses for funding education for funding healthcare for the elderly for business investments for friends and family  
 migrants send even more money home for special occasions like a surgery
 or a wedding  and migrants
  too many times for unexpected funerals that they cannot attend  
 much as these flows do all that good 
 there are barriers to these flows of remittances these four hundred billion dollars of remittances  
 foremost among them
 is the exorbitant cost of sending money home money transfer companies structure their fees
 to milk the poor
 they will say up to five hundred dollars if you want to send we will charge you thirty dollars fixed 
 if you are poor and if you have only two hundred dollars to send you have to pay that 
 the global average cost of sending money is eight percent  that means you send one hundred dollars
  the family on the other side receives only ninety two dollars 
 to send money to africa the cost is even higher  twelve percent 
 to send money within africa  the cost is even higher over twenty percent for example sending money from benin to nigeria  
 and then there is the case of venezuela 
 where because of exchange controls you send one hundred dollars
 and you are lucky if the family on the other side receives
 even ten dollars
  of course  nobody sends money to venezuela through the official channel 
 it all goes in suitcases whereever costs are high money goes underground  
 and what is worse  many developing countries actually have a blanket ban on sending money out of the country 
 many rich nations also have a blanket ban on sending money to specific
  countries  so is it that there are no options  no better options cheaper options to send money  there are m pesa in kenya
 enables people to send money and receive money at a fixed cost of only sixty cents per transaction
 u s fed started a program with mexico to enable money service businesses to send money to mexico for a fixed cost of only
 sixty seven cents per transaction  and yet  these faster cheaper better options can 't be applied internationally
 because of the fear of money laundering 
 even though there is little data to support any connection any significant connection between money laundering and these small
  many international banks now are wary of hosting
 bank accounts of money service businesses especially
 those serving somalia somalia a country where the per capita income is only two hundred and fifty dollars
 per year
  lifeblood of somalia  
 and yet  this is an example of the right hand giving a lot of aid  while the left hand is cutting the
 lifeblood to that economy  through regulations 
 then there is the case of poor people from villages
  like me in the villages  the only place where you can get money is through the post office most of the governments in the world have
 allowed their post offices to have exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies so 
 if i have to send money to my father in the village  
 i must send money through that particular money transfer company even if the cost is high  i cannot go to a cheaper
  this has to go so what can international organizations and social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost of sending money home  first 
 relax regulations on small remittances under one thousand dollars governments should recognize that small remittances are not money laundering  
 second
  exclusive partnerships between their post office and the money transfer company for that matter between the post office and any national banking system that has a large network that serves the poor  
 in fact  they should promote competition  open up the partnership so that
 we will bring down costs like we did  like they did  
 in the telecommunications industry you have seen what has happened there third
  large
 nonprofit
 philanthropic organizations should create a remittance platform on a nonprofit basis  they should create a nonprofit remittance platform to serve the money transfer companies
 so that they can send money at a low cost while complying with all the complex regulations all over the world  
 the development community should set a goal of reducing remittance
  costs to one percent
 from the current eight percent  if we reduce costs to one percent  that would release a saving of thirty billion dollars per year  
 thirty billion dollars  
 that 's larger than the entire bilateral aid budget going to africa per year  that is larger than or almost
  the total aid budget of the united states government the largest donor on the planet 
 actually the savings would be larger than that thirty billion because remittance channels are also used for aid  trade and investment purposes  
 another major impediment to the flow of remittances reaching the family is the large and exorbitant and illegal cost of recruitment 
 fees that migrants pay migrant workers pay to
  who found them the job  
 i was in dubai a few years ago  
 i visited a camp for workers  it was eight in the evening  dark  hot  humid 
 workers were coming back
 from their grueling day of work and i struck a conversation with a
  he was preoccupied that he is sending money home  he has been sending money home for a few months now 
 and the money is mostly going to the recruitment agent to the labor agent who found him that job  and in my mind  
 i could picture the wife waiting for the monthly remittance the remittance arrives she takes the money
 and hands it over
 to the recruitment agent
  the children are looking on this has to stop 
 it is not only
 construction workers from bangladesh it is all the workers there are millions of migrant workers who suffer from this problem 
 a construction worker from bangladesh on an average  pays about four thousand dollars in recruitment fees for a job that gives him only two thousand dollars per year in
  income  
 that means that for the two years or three years of his life  he is basically sending money to pay for the recruitment fees the family doesn 't get to see any of it 
 it is not only dubai it is the dark underbelly of every major city in the world  
 it is not only bangladeshi construction workers it is workers from all over the world it is not only men
  women are especially vulnerable to recruitment malpractices 
 one of the most exciting
 and newest thing happening in the area of remittances is
 how to mobilize through innovation diaspora saving and diaspora giving 
 migrants send money home  but they also save a large amount of money where they live
  annually  migrant savings are estimated to be 
 five hundred billion dollars  most of that money is parked in
 bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate  
 if a country were to come and offer a three percent or four percent interest rate  and then say that the money would be used for building
  train systems in the country of origin a lot of migrants would be interested in parting with their money
 because it 's not only financial gains that give them an opportunity to stay engaged with their country 's development 
 remittance channels can be used to sell these bonds to
 to migrants because when they come on a monthly basis to send remittances that 's when you can actually sell it to them
 you can also do the same for mobilizing diaspora giving  i would love to invest in a bullet train system in india
 and i would love to contribute
 to efforts to fight malaria in my village remittances are
 a great way of sharing prosperity between places
 in a targeted
  way that benefits those who need them most remittances empower people 
 we must do all we can to make remittances and recruitment safer and cheaper and it can be done
  to be a poet
