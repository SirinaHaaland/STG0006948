  i 'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics 
 i 'm  among several other things  an electrical engineer  and that means that i spend a good
 amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology
 and more specifically designing and building electronics
  and what i 've found is that the process of designing and building
 electronics is
 problematic in all sorts of ways so it 's a really slow process 
 it 's really expensive and the outcome of that process namely electronic circuit boards are
 limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways so they 're really small generally  they 're square and flat and hard  and frankly 
  most of them just aren 't very attractive  and so my team and i have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics and so what if
 you could design and build electronics like this so what if you could do it extremely quickly
  extremely inexpensively  and maybe more interestingly really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally 
 wouldn 't that be so cool
  wouldn 't that open up all sorts of new possibilities i 'm going to share with you two projects that are investigations along
 these lines and we 'll start with this one
 the
 that
  we think so so now that we developed these tools and found these materials that let us do these things
  we started to realize that essentially
  anything that we can do with paper  anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen we can now do with electronics so the next project that i want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that
 possibility and i 'll kind of let it speak for itself
