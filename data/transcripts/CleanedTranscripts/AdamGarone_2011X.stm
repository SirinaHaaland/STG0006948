  i think the beautiful malin [ akerman ] put it perfectly every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury  
 ladies and gentlemen and more importantly mo bros and mo sistas for
 seventeen minutes i 'm going to share with you my movember journey  
 and how through that journey  we 've redefined charity  
 we 're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world 
 and i hope  through that process 
 that i inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place
  the most common question i get asked and i 'm going to answer it now so i don 't have to do it over drinks tonight  is how did this come about how did movember 
  normally a charity starts with the cause and someone that is directly affected by a cause  they then go on to create an event  and beyond that a foundation to support
  pretty much in every case that 's how a charity
 starts 
 not so with movember 
 movember started in a very traditional australian way it was on a sunday afternoon i was with my brother and a mate having a few beers  and i was watching the world go by had
 a few more beers and the conversation turned to ' 70s fashion 
 and how everything manages to come back into style  and a few more beers i said there has to be some stuff that hasn 't come back
  back 
 then one more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache  why hasn 't that made a comeback 
 so then there was a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back 
 so in australia mo
  is slang for mustache  so we renamed the month of november movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today  and they are start the month 
 rock a mustache not a beard not a goatee a mustache for the thirty days of november  and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache themed party 
 and award a prize for the best and of course the worst
  now trust me when you 're growing a mustache back in two thousand and three and there were thirty of us back then and this was before the ironic
 hipster mustache movement
 it created a lot of controversy 
 so my boss wouldn 't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who 's no longer my girlfriend 
 hated it parents would
  shuffle kids away from us 
 but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey  and
 we had a lot of fun and in two thousand and four i said to the guys that was so much fun  we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year
 we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer and
 we thought you know what there 's nothing for men 's health  
 why is that   why can 't we combine growing a mustache and doing something for men 's health and i started to research that topic  and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed
  but there was nothing for this cause  so we married growing a mustache
 with prostate cancer 
 and then we created our tagline  which is changing the face of men 's health and that eloquently describes the challenge changing your appearance for the thirty days and also the outcome that 
  we 're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health  having them have a better understanding about the health risks that they face 
  the ceo of the prostate cancer foundation i said to him i 've got the most amazing idea that 's going to transform your organization 
 laughter and i didn 't want to share with him the idea over the phone so i convinced him to meet with me for coffee in melbourne in two thousand and four  
 and we sat down and i shared with him my vision of getting men growing mustaches across australia raising awareness for this cause  
 and funds for his organization and i needed a partnership to legitimately do that
 i said we 're going to come together at the end we 're going to have a mustache themed party we 're going to have djs  we 're going to celebrate life  and we 're going to change the face of men 's health 
 and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he
 said adam that 's a really novel idea  
 but we 're an ultraconservative organization  we can 't have anything to do with you 
 so i paid for coffee that day
 and
 his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we 'll gladly take it 
 so my lesson that year was persistence  and we persisted  and we got four hundred and fifty
  and we donated every cent of that to the prostate cancer foundation of australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they 'd ever received  
 so from that day forward  my life has become about a mustache  every day this morning i wake up and go my life is about a mustache
  so in two thousand and five the campaign
 got more momentum was more successful in australia and then new zealand  
 and then in two thousand and six we came to a pivotal point it was
 consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends
 that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that i could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level 
 it 's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches 
 let me tell you that there 's not too many people interested in
  not even the prostate cancer foundation  who we 'd raised about one point two million dollars for at that stage 
 so again we persisted  and foster 's brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever
 sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job i did consulting on the side  and leading into movember
 two thousand and six we 'd run through all
  run through all the money i had and essentially we had no money left  and we 'd convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies  whatnot to delay their billing until december 
 so we 'd racked up at this stage about six hundred thousand dollars worth of
 debt  so if movember two thousand and six didn 't happen the four founders  well  we would 've been broke  we would 've been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches
  you know what if that 's the worst thing that happens  so what we 're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks 
 then in early two thousand and seven a really interesting thing happened 
 we had mo bros from from canada from the u s and from the u k emailing us and
 calling us and saying hey there 's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries  
 so we thought why not let 's do it  
 so i cold called the ceo of prostate cancer canada  and i said to him i have this most amazing concept it
 's going to transform your organization 
 i don 't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if i fly all the way to toronto so i flew here met down on front street east  and we sat in the boardroom  and i said
  vision
 of getting men growing mustaches all across canada raising awareness and funds for your organization 
 and he looked at me and laughed and said adam  sounds like a really novel idea but we 're an ultraconservative organization 
 i 've heard this before i know how it goes  
 but he said we will partner with you  but we 're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work
 so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country the u s and the u k and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely 
  more money globally than we could just in australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure and we 're not about finding an australian cure or a canadian
  about finding the cure  
 so in two thousand and seven  we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage
 for the campaign it wasn 't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung ho with our success in australia
 and new zealand at that stage  so that year really taught us the importance of being patient
 and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets
  but what i 'm really pleased to say is in two thousand and ten movember became a truly global movement canada was just pipped to the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world  
 last year we had four hundred and fifty thousand mo bros spread across the world and together we raised
  and that makes movember now the biggest funder of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world  
 and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches 
 laughter and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon 
 our ambassadors are the mo bros and
  the mo sistas and i think that 's been fundamental to our success  
 we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way  
 so now i live in in los angeles because the prostate cancer foundation of the u s is based there  and i always get asked by the media down there because
  single person every single mo bro and mo sista that participates in movember is our celebrity ambassador  and that is so so important and fundamental to our success 
 now what i want
  share with you is
 one of my most touching
 movember moments  and it happened here in toronto last year at the end of the campaign 
 i was out with a team it was the end of movember we 'd had a great campaign and to be honest we 'd had our fair share of beer that night  but i said you know what i think we 've got one more bar left in us 
 so we piled into a
  i know it 's about men 's health i know it 's about prostate cancer  but this is for breast cancer and i said 
  last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in sri lanka  because we couldn 't afford proper treatment for her and he said 
 this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi  
 and i didn 't tell him who i was because i didn 't think it was appropriate and i just shook his hand and i said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment i realized that movember is so much more than a mustache
  having a joke 
 it 's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way  and being significant in their own life 
 for us now at movember  
 we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact  
 awareness and education  
 survivor support programs and research
  now we always focus naturally on how much we raise because it 's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education
 is more important than the funds we raise because i know that is changing and saving lives today and it 's probably best exampled
 by a young guy that i met at south by southwest in austin texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember
  but i went home for thanksgiving dinner  and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on 
 and we talked i talked to them about movember  and then after that my dad
 came up to me and at the age of 
 for the first time ever i had a conversation with my dad one on one about men 's health  i had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer and i learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer
 and i was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn 't know that  and he hadn 't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate
  so those conversations getting men engaged in this at
 whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise 
 now to the funds we raise  and research and how we 're redefining research 
 we fund prostate cancer foundations now in thirteen countries  
 we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently
 we realized there 's a real lack of collaboration going on
 even within institutions let alone nationally let alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is cancer research the world over 
 and so we said right we 'd redefined charity we need to redefine the way these guys operate how do we do that  
  so what we did was we created a global action plan and we 're taking ten percent of what 's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund and
 we 've got the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world that look after that fund  
 and they come together each year and identify the number one priority  
 and that  last year was getting a better screening test  so they identified that as a priority and then they 've got and recruited now three hundred researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially
  same topic  so now we 're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate
 and bringing them together  and that 's a unique thing in the cancer world and we know through that collaboration it will accelerate outcomes  
 and that 's how we 're redefining
 the research world 
  what i know about my movember journey is that with a really creative idea 
 with passion with persistence  and a lot of patience 
 four mates four mustaches can inspire a room full of people  and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city  and that city is melbourne my
  and that city can go on and inspire a state  and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men 's health
