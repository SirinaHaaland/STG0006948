  the child 's symptoms begin with mild fever  headache  muscle pains  followed by vomiting and diarrhea then bleeding from the mouth  nose and gums
  death follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure 
 sounds familiar  
 if you 're thinking this is ebola actually in this case it 's not 
 it 's an extreme form of dengue fever a mosquito born disease
 which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine and kills twenty two thousand
  each year 
 that is actually twice the number of people that have been killed by ebola in the nearly four decades that we 've known about it 
 as for measles so much in the news recently the death toll is actually tenfold higher 
 yet for the last year  it has been ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear  
 clearly there is something deeply rooted about it
  something which scares us and fascinates us more than other diseases  but what is it exactly  
 well it 's hard to acquire ebola  but if you do the risk of a horrible death is high  
 why because right now  we don 't have any effective therapy or vaccine available and so that 's the clue  
 we may have it someday
  so
 we rightfully fear ebola because it it doesn 't kill as many people as other diseases in fact it 's much less transmissible than viruses 
  such as flu or measles we fear ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can 't treat it we fear the certain inevitability that comes with ebola
  inevitability that seems to defy modern medical science  but wait a second why is that we 've known about ebola since one thousand nine 
 we 've known what it 's capable of we 've had ample opportunity to study it in the twenty four outbreaks that have occurred  
 and in fact we 've actually had vaccine candidates available now for more than a decade 
 why is that those
  vaccines are just going into clinical trials now 
 this goes to the fundamental problem we have with vaccine development for infectious diseases  it goes something like this 
 the people most at risk for these diseases are also the ones least able to pay for vaccines 
 this leaves little in the way of market incentives for
  manufacturers to develop vaccines  unless there are large numbers of people who are at risk in wealthy countries  
 it 's simply too commercially risky 
 as for ebola there is absolutely no market at all 
 so the only reason we have two vaccines in late stage clinical trials now is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear 
 was relatively ignored until september eleven
 and the anthrax attacks when all of a sudden people perceived ebola as potentially a bioterrorism weapon 
 why is it that the ebola vaccine wasn 't fully developed at this point  
 well partially because it was really difficult or
  to be difficult to weaponize the virus but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it 
 and this is really the point 
 the sad reality is we develop vaccines not based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people 
 but on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines 
 vaccine development is expensive and complicated it can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well known antigen and turn it into a
  viable vaccine 
 fortunately for diseases like ebola  there are things we can do to remove some of these barriers 
 the first is to recognize when there 's a complete market failure 
 in that case if we want vaccines  we have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy
  we also need to do a better job at being able to figure out which are the diseases that most threaten us by creating capabilities within countries  
 we then create the ability for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks which are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens 
 the data from that then can be
  used to understand the geographic and genetic diversity which then can be used to help us understand how these are being changed
 and what type of reactions they promote  
 so these are the things that can be done but to do this if we want to deal with a complete market failure  we have to change the way we we view and prevent infectious diseases  
  we see evidence of a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one  
 so for ebola the paranoid fear of an infectious disease followed by
 a few cases transported to wealthy countries  led the global community to come together  and with the work of dedicated
  we now have these 
 two ebola vaccines in efficacy trials in the ebola countries 
 and a pipeline of vaccines that are following behind  
 every year  we spend billions of dollars keeping a fleet
  of nuclear submarines permanently patrolling the oceans to protect us from a threat that almost certainly will never happen  
 and yet  we spend virtually nothing
 to prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain as epidemic infectious diseases  
 and make no mistake about it it 's not a question of if but when these bugs are going to continue to evolve and they 're going to threaten the world 
 are our best defense  so if we want to be able to to prevent
 epidemics like ebola we need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development and in stockpile creation  
 and we need to view this then as the ultimate deterrent something we make sure is available  but at the same time praying we never have to use it
