  i had second thoughts really about whether i could talk about this to such a vital and alive audience as you guys  
 then i remembered the quote from gloria steinem  which goes the truth will set you
  so with that in mind i 'm going to set about trying to do those things here 
 and talk about dying in the 21st century now the first thing that will piss you off undoubtedly is that all of us are in fact going to die in the 21st century there will be no exceptions to that
  there are apparently about one in eight of you who think you 're immortal
  going to happen 
 while i give this talk in the next ten minutes a hundred million of my cells will die 
 and over the course of today two thousand of my brain cells will die and never come back so you could argue that the dying process starts pretty early in the piece anyway
 the second thing i want to say about dying in the 21st century apart from
  going to happen to everybody is it 's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck
 for most of us  unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it 's currently on 
 so there you go that 's the truth no doubt that will piss you off and now let 's see whether we can set you free i don 't promise anything 
 now as you heard in the intro i work in intensive care  
 and i think i 've kind of lived through the heyday
  of intensive care it 's been a ride man this has been fantastic we have machines that go ping there 's many of them up there
  and we have some wizard technology which i think has worked really well  
 and over the course of the time i 've worked in intensive care the death rate for males in australia has halved and intensive care has had something to do with that certainly a lot of the technologies that we use have got something to do with that  
 so we have had tremendous success and we we kind of got caught up in our own success quite a bit and we started using expressions like
 i really apologize to everybody for doing that because obviously we don 't what we do is prolong people 's lives and delay death  
 and redirect death but we can 't strictly speaking save lives on any sort of permanent basis  
 and what 's really happened over the period of time that i 've been working in intensive care
 is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the
  to die in the 21st century
 of diseases that we no longer have the answers to
 in quite the way we did then  
 so what 's happening now is there 's been a big shift in the way that people die 
 and most of what they 're dying of now isn 't as amenable to what we can do as what it used to be like when i was doing this in the ' 80s and '
  we kind of got a bit caught up with this and we haven 't really squared with you guys about what 's really happening now and it 's about time we did 
 i kind of woke up to this bit in the late ' 90s when i met this guy this guy
 is called jim jim smith  and he looked like this i was called down to the ward to see him his is the little hand
  i was called down to the ward to see him by a respiratory physician he said look there 's a guy down here he 's got pneumonia  
 and he looks like he needs intensive care  his daughter 's here and she wants everything possible to be done 
 which is a familiar phrase to to us  
 so i go down to the ward and see jim and his skin his translucent like this you can see his bones through the skin he 's very very thin  and he is indeed
  very sick with pneumonia  and he 's too sick to talk to me so i talk to his daughter kathleen and i say to her 
 did you and jim ever talk about
 what you would want done if he ended up in this kind of situation and she looked at me and said no of course not i
 thought okay take this steady 
 and i got talking to her and after a while she said to me you know we always thought there 'd be time
  jim was ninety four 
 and i realized that something wasn 't happening here  there wasn 't this dialogue going on that i imagined was happening so
 a group of us started doing survey work and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home residents in newcastle in the newcastle area 
 and discovered that only one in a hundred of them
 had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating
  in a hundred and only one in five hundred
 of them had plan about what to do if they became seriously ill and i realized of course this dialogue is
 definitely not occurring in the public at large now
 i work in acute care this is john hunter hospital and i thought surely we do better
 than that  so a colleague of mine from nursing called lisa shaw
  shaw and i went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes in the medical records department looking at whether there was any sign at all that anybody had had any conversation about what might happen to them if the treatment they were receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die 
 and we didn 't find a single record of any preference about goals treatments or outcomes
 from any of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient
 so we started to realize
 that we had a problem and the the problem
 is more serious because of this what we know is
 that obviously we are all going to die  but how we die is actually really important obviously not just to us  but also to how that
 features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards how we die lives
  in the minds of everybody who survives us  and
 the stress created in families by dying is enormous 
 and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else so dying in intensive care is not your top option
 if if you 've got a choice and if that wasn 't bad enough
  all of this
 is rapidly progressing towards the fact that many of you in fact about one in ten of you at this point will die in intensive care  in the u s it 's one in five in miami it 's three out of five people die in intensive care  so this is the sort of momentum
 that we 've got at the moment 
 the reason why this is all happening is due to this and i do have to take you through what this is about these are the four ways to go so one of these will happen to all of us 
 the ones you may know most about are the ones that are becoming increasingly of historical
  interest sudden death it
 's quite likely in an audience this size this won 't happen to anybody here  
 sudden death has become very rare the death of little nell and cordelia and all that sort of stuff just doesn 't happen anymore  the dying process of those with terminal illness that we 've just seen occurs 
  to younger people by the time you 've reached eighty this is unlikely to happen to you only one in ten people who are over eighty will die of cancer  
  are these 
 what you die of is increasing organ failure 
 with your respiratory cardiac  renal  whatever organs packing up each of these would be an admission to an acute care hospital 
 at the end of which or at some point during which somebody says enough is enough  and we stop  
 and this one 's the biggest growth industry of all and at least six out of ten of the people in this room will die in this form which is
 the dwindling
 of
 capacity
 with increasing frailty 
 and frailty 's an inevitable part of aging and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing that people die of now  
 and the last few years or the last year of your life is spent with a great deal of disability unfortunately
  enjoying it so far
  feel such a i feel such a cassandra here laughter
 what can i say that 's positive what 's positive is that this is happening at very great age  now we are all most of us living to to reach this point you know historically we didn 't do that this is what happens to you
 when you live to be a great age  and unfortunately increasing longevity does mean more old age not more youth i 'm sorry to say
 what we did anyway look what we did  we didn 't just take this lying down at john hunter hospital and elsewhere 
 we 've started a whole series of projects to try and look about whether we could in fact involve people much more in the way that things happen to them  
  you kind of get the whole issue that 's going on here  which is clearly the separation of death from the living and the fear like if you actually look there 's one woman there
 who has her eyes open she 's the one he 's looking at  and [ she 's ] the one he 's coming for can you see that  
 she looks terrified it 's an amazing picture  anyway  we had a major cultural issue clearly people didn 't want us to talk about death or we thought that
  loads of funding from the federal government and the local health service we introduced a thing at john hunter called respecting patient choices  we trained hundreds of people
 to go to the wards and talk to people about the fact that they would die and what would they prefer under those circumstances they loved it the families and the patients they loved it
 ninety eight percent of people really thought this just should have been normal practice and that this is how things should work
  and when they expressed wishes all of those wishes came true as it were we were able to make that happen for them
  but then when the funding ran out we went back to look six months later  and everybody had stopped again  
 and nobody was having these conversations anymore  so that was really kind of heartbreaking for us because we thought this was going to really take off  
 the cultural issue had reasserted itself  
 so here 's the pitch
  i think it 's important
 that we don 't just get on this freeway to icu without thinking hard about whether or not that 's where we all want to end up particularly as we become older and increasingly frail and icu has less and less and less to offer us  
 there has to be a little side road
 off there for people who don 't want to go on that track
  and i have one small idea  and
 one big idea about what could happen  and this is the small idea the small idea is let 's all of us
 engage more with this in the way that jason has illustrated why can 't we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders
 and people who might be approaching this 
 there are a couple of things you can do one of them is you can just ask this simple question this question never fails
  event that you became too sick to speak for yourself who would you like to speak for you 
 that 's a really important question to ask people because giving people the control over who that is
 produces an amazing outcome  the second thing you can say is have you spoken to that person about the things that are important to you so that we 've got a better idea of what it
  so that 's the little idea  
 the big idea i think is more political i think we have to get onto this i suggested we should have occupy death 
 my wife said yeah right sit ins in the mortuary yeah yeah sure 
 laughter so that one didn 't really run but i was very struck by this now  i 'm an aging hippie  i don 't know i don 't think i look like that anymore but
 i had two of my kids were born at home in
  was a big thing and we baby boomers are used to taking charge of the situation  so if you just replace all these
 all these words of birth i like peace love natural death as an option i do think we have to get political and start to reclaim this process from the medicalized model in which 
  it 's going now listen that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia i want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all i hate euthanasia i think it 's a sideshow  
  think euthanasia matters  i actually think that
 that in places like oregon where you can
 have physician assisted suicide you take a
 poisonous dose of stuff  only half a percent of people ever do that i 'm more interested in what happens to the  ninety nine point five percent of people who don 't want to do that i think most people don 't want to be dead  
 but i do think most people want to have some control over how their dying process proceeds
 so i 'm an opponent of euthanasia but i do think we have to give people back some control it deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply  
 i think we should be looking at stopping the want for euthanasia not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all
  the last year of your life
