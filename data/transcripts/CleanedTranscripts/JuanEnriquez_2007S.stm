  bioenergy is not ethanol bioenergy isn 't global warming 
 bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive bioenergy is oil it 's gas
 's coal  and part of building that bridge to the future to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way or put up these geo spatial orbits
 that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it 
 and to do that you really have to look first at agriculture  
 so we 've been planting stuff for eleven thousand years
  and in the measure that we plant stuff what we learn from agriculture is you 've got to deal with pests you 've got to deal with
 all types of awful things you 've got to cultivate stuff in the measure that you learn how to use water to cultivate  
 then you 're going to be able to spread beyond the nile you
 're going to be able to power stuff  so irrigation makes a
  irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant stuff where you want it as opposed to where the rivers flood  you start getting this organic agriculture  
 you start putting machinery onto this stuff  machinery with a whole bunch of water  
 leads to very large scale agriculture  you put together
 machines and and water  and you get landscapes that look like this  and then you get sales that look like this  it 's brute force
 so what you 've been doing in agriculture is you start out with something that 's a reasonably natural system you start taming that natural system you put a lot of force behind that natural system  
 you put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides 
 behind that natural system
  and you end up with systems that look like this
  and it 's all brute force  
 and that 's the way we 've been approaching energy  so the lesson in agriculture is that you can actually change the system that 's based on brute force
 as you start merging that system and learning that system and actually applying biology  
 and you move from a discipline of engineering you move from a discipline of chemistry into a discipline of biology  and probably one of the
  most important human beings on the planet is this guy behind me  
 this is a guy called norman borlaug he won the nobel prize he 's got the congressional medal of honor he deserves all of this stuff 
 and he deserves this stuff because he probably has fed more people than any other human being alive because he researched
 how to put biology behind
  he did this in mexico  the reason why india and china no longer have these massive famines
 is because norman borlaug taught them how to grow grains in a more efficient way and launched the green revolution  
 that is something that a lot of people have criticized but of course those are people who don 't realize that china and india instead of having huge amounts of starving people 
 are exporting grains 
 and the irony of this particular system is the place where he did the research which was mexico  didn 't
  this technology  ignored this technology  talked about
 why this technology should be thought about but not really applied and mexico remains one of the largest grain importers on the planet
 because it doesn 't apply technology that was discovered in mexico  
 and in fact hasn 't recognized this man to the point where there aren 't statues of this man all over mexico  there are in china and india 
 and the institute that this guy ran
  has now moved to india  
 that is the difference between adopting technologies and discussing technologies now  it 's not just that this guy fed
 a huge amount of people in the world 
 it 's that this is the net effect in terms of what technology does if you understand biology  
 what happened in agriculture well if you take agriculture over a century agriculture
  in about one thousand nine hundred would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier  yeah the plows look different the machines were tractors or
 stuff instead of mules but the farmer would have understood this is what the guy 's doing this is why he 's doing it this is where he 's going 
 what really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology and that 's where you get your
  productivity increases  
 and as you do that stuff  
 here 's what happens to productivity basically you go from two hundred and fifty hours to produce one hundred bushels to forty to fifteen to five 
 agricultural labor productivity increased seven times one thousand nine hundred and fifty to two thousand  
 whereas the rest of the economy increased about two point five times  this is an absolutely massive increase
  in how much is produced per person  the effect of this of course is it 's not just amber waves of grain  it is mountains of stuff 
 and fifty percent of the eu budget is going to subsidize agriculture
 from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced 
 this would be a good outcome for energy and of course by now  you 're probably saying to yourself
  i thought i came to a talk about energy
 and here 's this guy talking about biology 
 so where 's the link between these two things 
 one of the ironies of this whole system is we 're discussing what to do about a system that we don 't understand we don 't even know what oil is 
 we don 't know where oil comes from
  it 's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from 
 the best assumption and one of the best guesses in this stuff is that this stuff
 comes out of this stuff  
 that these things absorb sunlight  rot under pressure for millions of years  and you get these black rivers now
 the interesting thing about that thesis if that thesis turns out to be true
 is that oil and all
  hydrocarbons turned out to be concentrated sunlight  
 and if you think of bioenergy bioenergy isn 't ethanol bioenergy is taking the sun  concentrating it in amoebas  concentrating it in plants 
 and maybe that 's why you get these rainbows  
 and as you 're looking at this system  if hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight
  bioenergy works in a different way and we 've got to start thinking of oil
 and other hydrocarbons as part of these solar panels  
 maybe that 's one of the reasons why if you fly over west texas
  the types of wells that you 're beginning to see don 't look unlike
 those pictures of kansas and those irrigated plots
 this is how you farm oil and as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved we started with this brute force approach  
 and then what did we learn then we learned we had to go bigger  
 and then what 'd we learn then we have to go even bigger  
 and we are getting really destructive
 as we 're going out and farming this bioenergy these are the
  athabasca tar sands  and there 's an enormous amount first of mining the largest trucks in the world are working here 
 and then you 've got to pull out this black sludge which is basically oil that doesn 't flow  it 's tied to the sand and then you 've got to use a lot of steam to separate it 
 which only works at today 's oil prices 
 coal coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff
 it is probably plants  except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure so
 you take something like this you burn it  you put it under pressure and likely as not you get this  although again i stress we don 't know  
 which is curious as we debate all this stuff  but as you think of coal  this is what burned wheat kernels look like 
 not entirely unlike coal
  and of course coalmines
 are very dangerous places
 because in some of these coalmines you get gas  when that gas blows up people die  
 so you 're producing a biogas out of coal in some mines but not in others  any place you see a differential 
 there 're some interesting questions 
 there 's some questions as to what you should be doing with this stuff
 but again coal  maybe the same stuff  maybe the same system  maybe bioenergy  and you 're applying exactly the same technology  here 's your brute force approach  
 once you get through your brute force approach then you just rip off whole mountaintops  and you end up with the single largest source of carbon emissions  
 which are
  that is probably not the best use of bioenergy as you think of what are the alternatives to this system
 it 's important to find alternatives because it turns out that the u s is dwindling in its petroleum reserves but it is not dwindling in its coal reserves 
 nor is china 
 there are huge coal reserves that are sitting out there  and we 've got to start thinking of them as biological energy because if we keep treating them as chemical energy
 engineering energy we 're going to be in deep doo doo 
 gas is a similar issue gas is also a biological product  
 and as you think of gas
 well  you 're familiar with gas  and here 's a different way of mining coal  this is called coal
  bed methane 
 why is this picture interesting because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life  
 the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up
 may be because there 's stuff
  you eat certain things you produce a lot of gas  
 it may turn out that biological processes in coalmines have the same process 
 if that is true then one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal may not be to rip
  mountaintops off 
 and it may not be to burn coal  it may be to have stuff process that coal in a biological fashion as you did in agriculture 
 that is what bioenergy is 
 it is not ethanol it is not subsidies to a few companies  it is not importing corn into iowa because you 've built so many of these ethanol plants  
 it is beginning to understand the transition that occurred in agriculture from brute force into biological force
  and in the measure that you can do that you can clean some stuff and you can clean it pretty quickly  we already have some indicators of productivity on this stuff ok if you put steam
 into
 coal fields or
 petroleum fields that have been running for decades you can get a really substantial increase like an eight fold increase in your output  
 this is just the beginning stages of this stuff and
  you think of biomaterials this guy who did part of the sequencing of the human genome 
 who just doubled the databases of genes and proteins known on earth by sailing around the world
 has been thinking about how you structure this and there 's a series of smart people thinking about this  and they 've been putting together companies like synthetic genomics like a cambria
  what those companies are trying to do is to think of how do you apply biological principles to avoid brute force 
 think of it in the following terms think of it as beginning to program stuff for specific purposes think of the cell as a hardware 
 think of the genes as a software  
 and in the measure that you begin to think of life as
  that can become energy  that can become food that can become fiber that can become human beings that can become a whole series of things  
 then you 've got to shift your approach as to how you 're going to structure and deal and think about energy
 in a very different way 
 what are the first principles of this stuff and where are we heading  this is one of the gentle giants on the
  's one of the nicest human beings you 've ever met
 his name is hamilton smith he won the nobel for figuring out how to cut genes
 something called restriction enzymes  he was at hopkins when he did this  and he 's such a modest guy
 that the day he won his mother called him
 and said i didn 't realize there was another ham smith at hopkins do you know he just won the nobel
  this guy is just a class act you find him at the bench every single day working on a pipette
 and building stuff and
 one of the things this guy just built are these things 
 what is this this is the first transplant of naked dna 
 where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell  insert it into a different cell and have that cell boot up as a separate species
 that 's one month old 
 you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff
  and as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are we 're going to start not just
 converting
 ethanol from corn with very high subsidies we 're going to start thinking about biology entering energy it
  is very expensive to process this stuff  both in economic terms and in energy terms
  this is what accumulates in the tar sands of alberta these are sulfur blocks 
 because as you separate that petroleum from the sand and use an enormous amount of energy inside that
 vapor
 steam to separate this stuff you also have to separate out the sulfur the difference between light crude and heavy crude well it 's about fourteen bucks a barrel 
 that 's why you 're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks and by the way the scale on these things is pretty large  
 now if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this  you reduce the system 
 and you really do start applying biological principles to energy  this has to be a bridge
 to the point where you can get to wind to
  the point where you can get to solar to the point where you can get to nuclear
 and hopefully you won 't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault 
 just a thought
  but in the meantime for the next decade at least  the name of the game is hydrocarbons and
  that oil be that gas be that coal  this is what we 're dealing with 
 and before i make this talk too long here 's
 what 's happening in the current energy system
 eighty six percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons  that means eighty six percent of the stuff we 're consuming are probably processed plants
 and amoebas and the rest of the stuff
 and there 's a role in here for conservation there 's a role in here for alternative stuff but we 've also got to get that other portion right 
 how we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future  
 and as we think of this bridge to the future one of the things you should ponder is we are leaving about two thirds of the oil today inside those wells
  're spending an enormous amount of money
 and leaving most of the energy down there  
 which of course requires more energy to go out and get energy  
 the ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol it may even be a one to one ratio on the energy input and the energy output 
 that is a stupid way of managing this system  
 last point  last graph one of the things that we 've got to do is to stabilize oil prices  this is what oil
  prices look like 
 ok this is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low 
 people come up with really smart ideas for solar panels or for wind or for something else  and then guess what the oil price goes through the floor  that company goes out of business and then you can bring the oil price back up
