  i work for the red cross and
 i 'm a physical therapist my job is to make
 arms and legs well it 's not completely true  we do more than that we provide the
 patients the afghan disabled first with the physical rehabilitation
 then with the social reintegration  it 's a very logical plan  
 but it was not always like this for many years we were just providing them with
 artificial limbs  it took
 quite
  for the program to become what it is now  today i would like to
 to tell you a story the story of a big change  and the story of the people who made this change possible 
 i arrived in afghanistan in one thousand nine hundred and ninety
 to work in a hospital for
  not only for war victims but it was for any kind of patient  i was also working in
 the orthopedic center we call it this is the place where we make the legs at that time
 i found myself
 in a strange situation  i felt not quite ready for that job  there was so much to learn 
 there were so many things new to me but it was a terrific job
 but as soon as the fighting intensified the physical rehabilitation was suspended there were many other things to do 
 so the orthopedic center was closed
 because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority
 every time i i make this speech it 's not the first time but it 's an emotion it 's something that comes comes out from the past
 displaced people  but one day something happened  i was
 coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque
 where tens and tens of people were squatting in terrible conditions  i wanted to go home i was driving
  forget you don 't want to see things so you just want to to go to your room to lock yourself inside and say that 's enough 
 a bomb fell not far from my car well far enough but big noise and
 everybody disappeared from the street the cars disappeared as well i ducked and
  only one figure remained in the middle of the road it was a man in a wheelchair
 desperately trying to
 to move away well i 'm not a particularly brave person i have to confess it but
 i could not just ignore him  so i stopped the car
  i went to help  the man was
 without legs
 and only with one arm  behind him there was a child his son red in the face in an effort to
 to push the father  so i took him into a safe place and
 i ask what are you doing out in the
  and then i ask an
 even more stupid question why don 't you have the prostheses  why don 't you have the artificial legs and he said the red cross has closed 
 well without thinking  i told him come tomorrow  we will provide you with a
  my god what did i say  the center is closed no staff around  maybe the machinery
 is broken who is going to make the legs for him so i hoped that
  he would not come this is the streets of kabul
 in those days  so i
 said well i will give him some money and so the following day  i went to the orthopedic center  and i spoke with a
 gatekeeper  i was ready to tell him listen if someone such and such comes
  tell him that it was a mistake nothing can be done 
 give him some money but mahmoud and his son were already there  and they were not alone 
 there were fifteen  maybe twenty people like him
 waiting and there was some staff too among them there was my right hand man najmuddin
  we have to go away we cannot stay here they were bombing not very close but you could hear the noise of the bombs so we cannot stay here it 's dangerous  it 's not a priority 
 but najmuddin told me listen now we 're here at least we can start repairing the prostheses the broken prostheses of the people and maybe
 try to do something for people like
  mahmoud i 
 we cannot do that  it 's really dangerous  we have other things to do but they insisted  when you have
 twenty people
 in front of you looking at you and you are the the one who has to decide  
 so we started doing some repairs also one of the physical therapists reported that
 mahmoud
 could
 be provided with a leg but not immediately the legs were swollen and the knees were stiff so he needed a long preparation 
 believe me i was worried because i was breaking the rules i was doing something that
 i was not supposed to do in the evening i went to to speak with the bosses at the headquarters and i told them i lied
  i told them listen  we are going to start a couple of hours per day  just a few repairs maybe some of them
  on the patients he was telling me patients are coming we knew that
 many more patients could not come prevented by the fighting but people were coming  and mahmoud was coming every day  
 and slowly slowly week after week
 his legs were improving  
  he was starting the real physical rehabilitation  he was coming every day crossing the front line 
 a couple of times i crossed the front line in the very place where mahmoud and his son were crossing  
 i tell you it was something so sinister that
 i was astonished he could do it every day
 mahmoud was going to be discharged with his new legs  
 it was april i remember a very beautiful day  april in kabul is beautiful full of roses  full of flowers  
 we could not possibly stay indoors with all these sandbags at the windows very
  so we
 chose a small spot in the garden  and
 mahmoud put on his prostheses  the other patients did the same  and they started
 practicing for the last time before being discharged suddenly they started fighting  
 two groups of mujahideen started fighting we could hear in the air the
  the shelter 
 mahmoud grabbed his son i grabbed someone else everybody was grabbing something and
 we ran you know fifty meters can be a long distance if you are totally exposed  but
 we managed to reach the shelter  inside all of us panting i sat a
  of course i can i can run and now you can go to school  
 no need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair 
 later on we took them home  and i will never forget mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair
  and then i understood physical rehabilitation is a priority  
 dignity cannot wait for better times
 from that day on we never closed a single day 
 well sometimes we were suspended for a few hours but we never  we never
 closed it again  i met mahmoud one year later
  later he was in good shape
 a bit thinner he needed
 to change his prostheses a new pair of prostheses i asked about his son he told me he 's at school he 'd doing quite well but
 i understood he wanted to tell me
  and he was standing in front of me  his head down  
 he said 
 you have taught me to walk  thank you very much now help me
 not to be a beggar anymore that was the job
 my children are growing  i feel ashamed  i don 't want them to be teased at school
 by the other students 
 i said okay i thought  how much money do i have in my pocket just to give him some money it was the easiest way 
  i ask for a job 
 and then he added something
 i will never forget for the rest of my life he said 
 i am a scrap of a man  
 but if you help me i 'm ready to do anything even if i have to crawl on the ground
  and then he sat down  i sat down too with goosebumps everywhere  
 legless with only one arm
  we need to increase the production of feet  we need to employ someone to glue and to screw the
  we can modify the
 the workbench maybe to put a special stool a special anvil special vice and maybe an electric screwdriver i said listen
  it 's insane  and it 's even cruel to think of anything like this that 's a production line and a very fast one  it 's cruel to
 offer him a job knowing that he 's going to fail 
 but with najmuddin  we cannot discuss so
 the only things i could manage to to obtain was a kind of
  compromise only one week
 one week try and not a single day more one week later mahmoud was the fastest in the production line 
 i told najmuddin that 's a trick  
 i can 't believe it the production was up twenty percent it 's a trick it 's a trick i said  and then i asked for verification
 it was true  the comment of najmuddin was mahmoud has something to prove  i understood that
  i was wrong again  mahmoud had looked taller i remember him sitting behind the workbench
 smiling he was a new
  i understood that what made him stand tall
 yeah they were the legs thank you very much but as a first step  
 it was the dignity  he has regained his full dignity thanks to that job  
 so of course i understood and then
 we started a new policy a new policy completely different
 we decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job  it became
 a policy of positive discrimination we call it now  and
 you know what it 's good for everybody everybody benefits from that
 those employed of course  because
 they get a job
 and dignity
 but also for the newcomers  they are seven thousand every year people coming for the first time 
 and you should see the faces of these people when they realize that those assisting them are like them sometimes you see them they look
  and it 's easy for me as well to train someone who has already passed through the experience of disability  poof they learn much faster the motivation 
 the empathy they can establish with the patient is completely different completely 
 scraps of men do not exist people like
  you cannot stop so
 employing people yes but also we started programming projects of microfinance  education  and when you start you cannot stop so you do vocational training 
  home education for those who cannot go to school  physical therapies can be done not only in the orthopedic center but also in the houses of the people 
  's najmuddin the one with the white coat  terrible najmuddin is that one 
 i have learned a lot from people like najmuddin mahmoud rafi they are my teachers  
 i have a wish a big wish  that this way of working this way of thinking is going to be implemented in other countries
  are plenty of countries at war like afghanistan 
 it is possible and it is not difficult  
 all we have to do is to listen to the people that we are supposed assist 
 to make them part of the the decision making process
 and then of course to adapt 
  my big wish  well don 't think that the changes in afghanistan are over not at all we are going on  recently we have just
 started a program a sport program
 basketball for wheelchair users  we transport the wheelchairs everywhere we have several teams in the main part of afghanistan
 at the beginning when anajulina
  and then i asked the usual question is it a priority  is it
 really necessary 
 well now you should see me  i never miss a single training session  the night before a match i 'm very nervous  and
 you should see me
 during the match i shout
  a true italian 
 what 's next what is going to be the next change well
 i don 't know yet but i 'm sure najmuddin and his friends they have it already in mind 
 that was my story  thank you very much
