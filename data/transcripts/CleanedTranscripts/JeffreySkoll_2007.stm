  i 've actually been waiting by the phone for a call from ted for years  
 and in fact in two thousand i was ready to talk about ebay but no call 
  i was ready to do a talk about the skoll foundation and social entrepreneurship no call
  in two thousand and four i started participant productions and we had a really good first year and no call 
 and finally i get a call last year
  and then i have to go up after j j abrams 
 you 've got a cruel sense of humor ted when i first moved to hollywood from silicon valley
  i had some misgivings  but i found that there were some advantages to being in hollywood 
 and in fact some advantages to owning your own media company 
 and i also found that hollywood and silicon valley have a lot more in common than i would have dreamed  hollywood has its sex symbols  
 and the valley has its sex symbols 
 hollywood has its rivalries  and the valley
  its rivalries  
 hollywood gathers around power tables  and the valley gathers around power tables so it turned out there was a lot more in common than than i would have dreamed  
 but i 'm actually here today to tell a story and part of it is a personal story  
 when chris invited me to speak he said people think of you as a bit of an
  and they want to know what drives you a bit 
 and what really drives me is is a vision of the future that i think we all share it 's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability 
 and
 when we when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days  
 ed wilson and and the pictures of james nachtwey i think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that i like to
  it 's also something that
 resides in each of us to close what i think are the two big calamities in the world today one is
 the gap in opportunity
 this gap that president clinton last night called uneven unfair and unsustainable and out of that comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all
  evils that we see around us 
 but perhaps the other bigger gap is what we call the hope gap and someone at some point came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldn 't make a difference in the world and i think that 's just a horrible thing  
 and so chapter one really begins today with all of us because within each of us is the power to
 equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps and if the men and women of ted can 't make a difference in the
  world  i don 't know who can 
 and for me a lot of this started when i was younger and my family used to go camping in upstate new york and there really wasn 't much to do there for the summer except get beaten up by my sister or
 or read books  and so i used to read authors like james michener and james clavell and ayn rand and
 their stories made the world seem a very small and
 and it struck me that if i could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected that maybe i could get people interested in the issues that affected us all and maybe engage them to make a difference
  i didn 't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living 
 so i decided to to go on a path to become
 financially independent so i could write these stories as quickly as i
  could 
 i then had a bit of a wake up call when i was fourteen and my dad came home one day and announced that he had cancer  
 and it looked pretty bad  and what he said was he wasn 't so much afraid that he might die  but that he hadn 't done the things that he wanted to
 with his life 
  knock on wood he 's still alive today  many years later but for a young man that made a real impression on me that one never knows how much time one really has so i set out in a hurry
  i studied engineering i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ticket to financial freedom
  one of those businesses was a computer rental business called micros on the move which is very well named because people kept stealing the computers
  i needed to learn a little bit more about business so i went to stanford business school and studied there 
 and while i was there i made friends with a fellow named pierre omidyar who is here today  and pierre i apologize for this this is a photo from the old days  
 and just after i 'd graduated pierre came to me  with this idea to help people buy and sell things online with each other  and with the wisdom of my stanford degree i said pierre what a stupid idea
 needless to say i was right 
 but right after that pierre in ' ninety six pierre and i left our full time jobs to build ebay as a company and the rest of that story you know 
 the company went public two years later and is today one of the best known companies in the world
  i went from living in a house with five guys in palo alto and living off their leftovers to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources and i wanted to figure out how i could take the blessing of these resources and and share it with the world 
 and around that time  i met john gardner who is a remarkable man he was the architect of the great society programs under lyndon johnson
  in the 1960s 
 and i asked him what he felt was the best thing i could do or anyone could do to make a difference in the long term issues facing humanity and john said 
 bet on good people doing good things bet on good people doing good things and that really resonated with me  i started a foundation
 to bet on these good people doing good things these leading innovative
  folks who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems 
 people today we call social entrepreneurs 
 and to put a face on it people like muhammad yunus  who started the grameen bank 
 has lifted one hundred million people plus out of poverty around the world  
 won the nobel peace prize  but there 's also a lot of people that you don 't know folks like ann cotton who started a group called camfed in africa  
  felt girls ' education was lagging and she started it about ten years ago  and today she educates
 over a quarter million african girls  
 and somebody like dr victoria hale who started the world 's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company and whose first drug
 will will be fighting
  also known as black fever 
 and by two thousand and ten she hopes to eliminate this disease which is really a scourge in the developing world 
 and so this is this is one way to bet on on good people doing good things and a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that i find really
 is powerful it 's what we call invest connect and celebrate and invest if you see good people doing good
  invest in them invest in their organizations  or in business invest in these folks
  connecting them together through conferences like a ted brings so many powerful connections or through
 the world forum on
 social entrepreneurship that my foundation does at oxford every year
  and celebrate them tell their stories because not only are there good people doing good work  but their stories can help close these gaps of hope  
 and it was this last part of the mission the celebrate part that really got
  me back to thinking
 when i was a kid and wanted to tell stories to get people involved in the issues that affect us all 
 and a light bulb went off which was first that i didn 't actually have to do the writing myself i could find writers  and then the next light bulb was better than just writing what about film and tv to get out to people in a big way  
 and i thought about the films that inspired me films like
  's list and i wondered who was doing these kinds of films today  and there really wasn
 't a specific company that was focused on the on the public interest  so in two thousand and three i started to make my way around los angeles
 to talk about the idea of a pro social media company
 and i was met with a lot of
  one of the lines of encouragement that i heard over and over was the streets of hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you who think you 're going to come to this town and make movies 
 and then of course there was the other adage the surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business 
 undeterred in january of two thousand and four i started participant productions with the vision to be a global media company
  focused on the public interest and our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change  
 and we don 't just want people to see our movies and say that was fun  and forget about it we want them to actually get involved in the issues 
 in two thousand and five we launched our our first slate of films murder ball north country syriana
  good night and good luck and much to my surprise they were noticed  we ended up with eleven oscar nominations for these films 
 and it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy  
 perhaps more importantly  tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs and the activism programs
 that we created to go around the movies and we had an online component of that our community sect called 
  with our social sector partners like the aclu and pbs and the sierra club and the nrdc 
 once people saw the film there was actually something they could do to make a difference
  one of these films in particular called north country was actually kind of a
 box office disaster  but it was a film that starred charlize theron and it was about women 's rights women
  domestic violence and so on  and we released the film at the same time that the congress was debating the renewal of the violence against women act 
 and with screenings on the hill  and discussions and with our social sector partners like the national organization of women 
 the film was widely credited with influencing the successful renewal
  that to me spoke volumes because it 's the film started
 about a true life story about a woman who was harassed 
 sued her employer 
 led to a landmark case that led to the equal opportunity act and the violence against women act and others  and then the movie about this person doing these things then led to this greater
 renewal  and so again it goes back to betting on good people doing
  speaking of which our fellow tedster al i first saw al do his slide show presentation on global warming
 in may of two thousand and five 
 at that point i thought i knew something about global warming i thought it was a thirty to fifty year problem 
 and after we saw his slide show it became clear that it was much more urgent  
 and so right afterwards  i met backstage with with al and with lawrence bender who was there and laurie david and
 davis guggenheim
  who was running
 documentaries for participant at the time  
 and with al 's blessing we decided on the spot to turn it into a film because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly
 than having al go around the world  
 speaking to audiences of one hundred or two hundred at a time  and you know there 's another adage in hollywood that nobody knows nothing about anything
  and i really thought this was going to be a
 straight to pbs charitable initiative  and so it was it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest
  and today is mandatory viewing in schools in england and scotland and most of scandinavia  we 've sent fifty thousand dvds to
 high school teachers in the
  and it 's really changed the debate on global warming it
 was also a pretty good year for this guy  we now call al the george clooney of global warming 
 laughter and for participant this is just the start everything we do looks at the major issues in the world  and we have
 ten films in production right now and dozens others
 in development i 'll quickly talk about a few coming up one is charlie wilson 's war with tom hanks and julia roberts
 and it 's the true story of congressman charlie wilson and how he funded the taliban to fight the russians in afghanistan  
 and we 're also doing a movie called the kite runner based on the book the kite runner 
 also about afghanistan and we think once people see these films they 'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world and the middle east in general 
 we premiered a film called the chicago ten at sundance this year it 's based on
 the protesters at the democratic convention in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight abby hoffman and crew and again a story about a small group of individuals who who did make change in the world 
 and a documentary that we 're doing on jimmy carter and his mid east peace efforts over the years and in particular we 've been following him on his
  in closing i 'd like to say that
 everybody has the opportunity to make change in their their own way 
 and all the people in this room have have done so through their business lives or their philanthropic work  or their other interests 
 and one thing that i 've learned is that there 's never one right way to make change one can do it as a tech
  person or as a finance person or a nonprofit person or as an entertainment person  but every one of us is all of those things and more
