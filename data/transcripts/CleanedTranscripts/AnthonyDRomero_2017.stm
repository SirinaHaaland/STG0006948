  silicon valley is obsessed with disruption 
 but these days  the biggest disruptor didn 't come out of silicon valley  
 it came out of steel towns in ohio  rural communities in pennsylvania  
 the panhandle in florida
 and this last us presidential election
 was the mother of all disruptions 
 once again  politics is personal 
 millions of americans became activists overnight  
 pouring into the streets in record numbers in record time 
 the election has done to family holiday dinners what uber has done to new york city
  system  couples have broken up and marriages disrupted  
 and the election is doing to my private life what amazon is doing to shopping malls  
 these days the aclu is on the front lines twenty four seven  
 and even if i manage to sneak away for a couple of miles on the treadmill  
 any cardio benefit i get is
  instantly obliterated when i read another presidential tweet on the headline scroll even my secret pleasure
 of studying the italian painters have been infected by politics 
 now i study  even stalk the old masters this is my desk with a postcard exhibition
 of some famous and obscure paintings mostly from the italian
  renaissance  
 now art used to provide me with a necessary break from the hurly burly of politics in my daily work at the aclu but not anymore 
 i was at the women 's march in san francisco the day after inauguration  
 and the crowd was chanting this is what democracy looks like this is what democracy looks like 
 and there i was holding my sign and my umbrella in the rain and i
  flashed on an old painting
 that first captivated me many years ago i struggled to remember the different pieces
 of an actual painting
 of good and bad government it was almost like the old master was taunting me you want to know what democracy looks like
  go back and look at my frescoes  and so i did in 
 ambrogio lorenzetti finished a monumental commission
 in the governing council chamber of siena 's palazzo pubblico 
 it 's a painting that speaks to us even screams to us today 
 art is a lie that makes us
  pablo picasso once said and as we search for the truth about government we should keep ambrogio 's work not a lie
 but an allegory in our collective mind 's eye  during lorenzetti 's time the political legitimacy of italian 
 was often on very shaky ground siena was a republic  but there had been enormous unrest in the two decades leading up to the commission 
 siena 's political leaders who would literally govern
 under the eyes of these allegorical figures were lorenzetti 's intended audience 
 he was cataloging the obligations of the governing
 to the governed  now  you can spend years studying these frescoes some scholars have i 'm hardly an art historian
  and a work this massive can overwhelm me so first i focus on the big stuff  
 this is the allegory of good government  the majestic figure here in the middle
 is dressed in siena 's colors
 and he personifies the republic itself lorenzetti labels him 
  and he 's basically telling the sienese that they  and not a king or a tyrant must rule themselves  now surrounding commune
 are his advisors 
 justice is enthroned  she 's looking up at the figure of wisdom who actually supports her scales of justice
  holds a string that comes off the scales of justice that binds her to the citizens making them all compatriots in the republic 
 and finally we see peace she looks chilled out like she 's listening to bob marley  
 when good government rules peace doesn 't break a sweat now
 these are big images and big ideas  but i really love the small stuff
 along another wall lorenzetti illustrates the effects of good government
 on the real and everyday lives of ordinary people with a series of delicious little details 
 in the countryside the hills are landscaped and farmed  
 crops are being sown
  all in one picture  
 crops and livestock are being brought to market in the city builders raise a tower 
 people attend a law lecture a ted talk of the 14th century
  dancers larger than life dance with joy  
 and watching over the republic is the winged figure security  
 whose banner reads everyone shall go forth freely without fear 
 now what 's amazing about these images from eight hundred years ago is that they 're familiar to us today we see what democracy looks like we experience the
  effects of good government in our lives just as lorenzetti did in his life 
 but it is the allegory of bad government that has been haunting me since november nine  
 it 's badly damaged  but it reads like today 's newspapers  and ruling over bad government is not the commune
 but the tyrant  he has horns
  eyes braided hair  he obviously spends a lot of time on that hair justice
 now lies helpless at his feet  shackled her scales have been severed 
 justice is the key antagonist to the tyrant  and she 's been taken out  
 now surrounding the tyrant lorenzetti illustrates the vices that animate bad government
  avarice is the old woman clutching the 
 and a fisherman 's hook to pull in her fortune
 vainglory carries a mirror  
 and lorenzetti warns us against narcissistic leaders who are guided by their own ego and vanity 
 on the tyrant 's right is cruelty
 treason half lamb half scorpion  lulls us into a false sense of security and then poisons a republic 
 fraud with the flighty wings of a bat 
 on the tyrant 's left you see division
  she 's dressed in siena 's colors si and no are painted on her body 
 she uses a carpenter 's saw to chop her body in half and
 fury wields the weapons of the mob  the stone and knife in
 the remainder of the fresco lorenzetti
  shows us the inevitable effects of bad government  
 the civic ideals celebrated elsewhere in this room have failed us  and we see it 
 the once beautiful city has fallen to pieces the countryside barren  the farms abandoned many are in flames 
 and in the sky above is not the winged figure
  but that of fear  whose banner reads none shall pass along this road
 without fear of death 
 now the final image the most important one really is one that lorenzetti did not paint it is of the viewer  
 today the audience for lorenzetti 's frescoes is not the governing
 but the governed  the individual who stands in front of his allegories and walks away with insight who
  heeds a call to action lorenzetti warns us that we must recognize the shadows of avarice fraud division  even tyranny
 when they float across our political landscape  
 especially when those shadows are cast by political leaders loudly claiming to be the voice of good government and promising to make america great again  
 and we must act
 democracy must not be a spectator sport  the right to protest the right to assemble freely the right to petition one 's government 
 these are not just rights in the face of avarice fraud and division  these are obligations 
 we have to disrupt 
 we have to disrupt our lives so that we can
  disrupt the amoral accretion of power by those who would betray our values we and we the people
 must raise justice up
 and must bring peace to our nation and must come together in concord  and we have a choice 
 we could either paint ourselves into the worst nightmare of lorenzetti 's bad government 
 or we can stay
  in the streets disruptive messy  loud that is what democracy looks like
 you spoke to many people passionately here i 'm sure there are other people here who 'd say look 
 trump was elected by sixty three million people he 's far from perfect  but he 's trying to do what he was elected to do  shouldn 't you give him a chance anthony
 romero i think we have to recognize
 the legitimacy of him as president
 versus the legitimacy of his policies  and when so many of the policies
 are contrary to fundamental values  that we 're all equal under the law that we 're not judged by the color of our skin or the religion we worship
 we have to contest those values
 even as we recognize and honor the fact that our democracy rendered us a president who
 is championing those values
  you 're making other arguments as well
 very often we piss everyone off at one point that 's what we do  and we recently were
 taking stands for why ann coulter needs to be able to speak at berkeley  and why milo has free speech rights  and we even wrote a blog that
 almost burnt the house down among some of our members  unfortunately when we talked about the fact that
 even donald
  trump has free speech rights as president and an effort to hold him accountable for incitement of violence at his marches or his rallies
 is unconstitutional and un american and
 when you put that statement out there to a very frothy base that always is very excited for you to fight donald trump and then you have a new one
  these rights are for everybody  even the president that we don 't like and that 's our job ca anthony 
 you spoke to so many of us so powerfully thank you so much
