  and i feel like this whole evening has been very amazing
  's sort of like the vimalakirti sutra an ancient work from ancient india
 in which the buddha appears
 at the beginning and a whole bunch of people
 come to see him from the biggest city in the area vaishali 
 and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him all the young people actually from the city 
 the old fogeys don 't come because they 're mad at buddha
  because when he came to their city he accepted he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him from whoever it is and the local geisha a movie star sort of person
  raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first 
 so he was hanging out with the movie star  and of course they were grumbling he 's supposed to be religious and all this what 's he doing over there at
 amrapali 's house with all his five hundred monks
  all grumbling  
 and so they boycotted him they wouldn 't go listen to him  but the young people all came and they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol and they put it on the ground  
 and as soon as they had laid all these all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient india he performed a kind of special effect
  which made it into a giant planetarium the wonder of the universe everyone looked in that and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life
 in all universes  and of course in the buddhist cosmos
 there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it 
 and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets so they don 't when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky
 they don 't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases
  exploding  they actually see landscapes and human beings and
 gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that he made that special effect at the beginning
 to get everyone to think about interconnection
 and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected  and then leilei
  told us about interconnection and how we 're all totally interconnected here 
 and how we 've all known each other and of course in the buddhist universe we 've already done this already billions of times in many many lifetimes in the past  
 and i didn 't give the talk always
  become tedsters if that 's
 that 's a modern form of enlightenment  
 i guess so 
 because in a way if a tedster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything
 it 's the forging of a of a mass awareness of where everybody can really know everything that 's going on everywhere in the planet  
 and therefore it will become intolerable what compassion is is where it will become intolerable for us
 totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort
 and in pleasure
 and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have
 a bite of food and they have no place or they 're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth  it just becomes
  with all of us knowing everything we 're kind of forced by technology
 to become buddhas or something to become enlightened  and of course we all will be deeply disappointed
 when we do
 because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do a little bit tired
  we do suffer we do enjoy our misery in a certain way we distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere  
 but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins
 and everyone else is out there 
 and occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other 
 and each one tries to get out of their own  and ultimately it fails of course and then we 're back into this thing
 from the buddha 's point of view misperception
 is that all we are is what is inside our skin 
 and it 's inside and outside self and other 
 and other is all very different and everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception a little bit  right you know 
 someone sitting next to you in a seat that 's ok because you 're in a theater
  if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you you 'd freak out 
 what do they want from me  like who 's that  and so you wouldn 't sit that close to another person
 because of your notion that it 's you versus the universe that 's all buddha discovered  
 because that cosmic basic idea that it is us
 all alone each of us and everyone else is different then that puts us in an impossible situation doesn 't it who is it who 's going to get enough
  attention from the world who 's going to get enough out of the world who 's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings
 if you 're different from all the other beings so where compassion comes is where
 you surprisingly discover you you lose yourself in some way  through art  
  through knowledge actually knowing that you have no such boundary knowing your interconnectedness with other beings 
 you can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them
 when you do that you 're forced to feel what they feel 
 luckily  they say i still am not sure but luckily  they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the buddhist literature they say
  really want to be compassionate how awful  i 'm so miserable on my own  
 my head is aching my bones are aching  i go from birth to death i 'm never satisfied i never have enough even if i 'm a billionaire i don 't have enough i need a hundred billion
 so i 'm like that imagine if i had to feel
 even a hundred other people 's
  it would be terrible but apparently this is a strange paradox of life when you 're no longer locked in yourself 
 and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world that enables you
 to let your mind spread out and empathize and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing
  and realizing that you are the other being somehow by that opening  you can see the deeper nature of life 
 and you can you can you get away from this
 terrible iron circle of i me me  mine  like the beatles used to sing you know
 we really learned everything in the ' 60s too bad
 nobody ever woke up to it and
  trying to suppress it since then i me me mine  it 's like a perfect song that song a perfect teaching  
 but when we 're relieved from that we somehow then become interested in all the other beings and we feel ourselves differently it 's totally strange it
 's totally strange 
 the dalai lama always likes to say
 he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion
  because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence  
 it 's really too boring
 whether you feel like this or like that or what you know and the more you focus on how you feel by the way the worse it gets
  like even when you 're having a good time when is the good time over the good time is over when you think how good is it  
 and then it 's never good enough
  i love that leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes
 is having a good time doing it by having a good time  i think the dalai lama should have heard that i wish he 'd been there to hear that he once told me
 he looked kind of sad he worries very much about the haves and
  a hundred years ago  
 they went and took everything away from the haves  
 you know the big communist revolutions russia and china and so forth they took it all away by violence  saying they were going to give it to everyone and then they were even worse
 they didn 't help at all 
 so what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today  
 and so then
 he looks at me
  generosity 
 was all i could think of
 what is virtue  
 but of course what you said  i think the key to saving the world the key to compassion is that it is more fun
  it should be done by fun generosity is more fun that 's the key everybody has
  think buddha was so boring and they 're so surprised when they meet dalai lama and he 's fairly jolly  
 even though his people are being genocided and believe me he feels every blow on every old nun 's head 
 in every chinese prison he feels it he feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays i won 't even say what they do  
 but he feels it and yet he 's very
  because when you open up like that then you can 't just what good does it do to add being miserable with others ' misery 
 you have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is how it can be changed  
 look at that beautiful thing chiho showed us she scared us with the lava man 
 she scared us with the lava man is coming  then the
  but then finally there were flowers and trees and it was very beautiful  it 's really lovely  so 
  compassion means to feel the feelings of others  and the human being actually is compassion
 the human being is almost out of time the human being is compassion because what is our brain
  jim 's brain is memorizing the almanac  
 but he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is he will he did  he could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings 
 and he would have tremendous fun doing that
