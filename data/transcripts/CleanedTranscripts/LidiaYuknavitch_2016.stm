  so i know ted is about a lot of things that are big but i want to talk to you about something very small  so small it 's a single word 
 the word is misfit it
  's one of my favorite words because it 's so literal  
 i mean it 's a person who sort of missed fitting in or a person who fits in badly 
 or this a person who is poorly adapted to new situations and environments 
 i 'm a card carrying misfit  
 and i 'm here for the other misfits in the room because i 'm never the
  only one i 'm going to tell you a misfit story 
 somewhere in my early 30s the dream of becoming a writer came right to my doorstep  
 actually it came to my mailbox in the form of a letter that said i 'd won a giant literary prize for a short story i had written 
 the short story was about my life as a competitive swimmer
 and about my crappy home life  and a little bit about how grief and loss
 can make you insane  
 the prize was a trip to new york city to meet big time editors and agents and other authors  so kind of it was the wannabe writer 's dream right
  you know what i did the day the letter came to my house  
 because i 'm me i put the letter on my kitchen table i poured myself a giant glass of
  vodka
 with ice and lime  
 and i sat there in my underwear for an entire day just staring at the letter 
 i was thinking about all the ways i 'd already screwed my life up who the hell was i to go to new york city
 and pretend to be a writer who was i
 like legions of other children 
 i came from an abusive household that i narrowly escaped with my life  
 i already had two epically failed marriages underneath my belt 
 i 'd flunked out of college not once but twice and maybe even a third time that i 'm not going to tell you about
  i 'd done an episode of rehab for drug use  and i 'd had two lovely staycations in jail 
 so i 'm on the right stage 
 laughter but
 the real reason i think i was a misfit is that my daughter died the day she was born  
 and i hadn 't figured out how to live with that story yet
  after my daughter died i also spent a long time homeless 
 living under an overpass in a kind of profound state of zombie grief and loss that some of us encounter along the way 
 maybe all of us  if you live long enough  
 you know homeless people are some of our most
  heroic misfits because they start out
 as us so you
 see i 'd missed fitting in to just about every category out there 
 daughter wife mother  scholar  
 and the dream of being a writer
 was really kind of like a small sad stone in my throat
  it was pretty much in spite of myself that i got on that plane and flew to new york city  where the writers are 
 fellow misfits  i can almost see your heads glowing i
 can pick you out of a room 
 at first you would 've loved it you got to choose the three famous writers you wanted to meet and these guys went and found them for you you got set up at the gramercy
  where you got to drink scotch late in the night with cool smart swank people and you got to pretend you were cool and smart and swank too 
 and you got to meet a bunch of editors and authors and agents at very very fancy lunches and dinners 
 ask me how fancy audience how fancy lidia
 i 'm making a confession i stole three linen napkins
  from three different restaurants  and i shoved a menu down my pants 
 i just wanted some keepsakes so that when i got home i could believe it had really happened to me  you know 
 the three writers i wanted to meet were carole maso lynne tillman and peggy phelan 
 these were not famous best selling authors but to me they were
  women writer titans carole maso wrote the book that later became my art bible  
 lynne tillman gave me permission to believe that there was a chance my stories could be part of the world 
 and peggy phelan reminded me that maybe my brains
 could be more important than my
  mainstream women writers but they were cutting a path through the mainstream with their body stories 
 i like to think kind of the way water cut the grand canyon  
 it nearly killed me with joy to hang out with these three  over 50 year old women writers  and the reason it nearly killed me with joy
  never known a joy like that i 'd never been in a room like that 
 my mother never went to college 
 and my creative career to that point was a sort of small  sad stillborn thing 
 so kind of in those first nights in new york i wanted to die there i was just like kill me now i 'm good  this is beautiful 
 some of you in the room will understand
  happened next first they took me to the offices of farrar straus and giroux 
 farrar straus and giroux was like my mega dream press i mean t s eliot and flannery o 'connor were published there 
 the main editor guy sat me down and talked to me for a long time trying to convince me i had a book in me
 about my life as a swimmer  you know like a memoir  the whole time he was talking to me i sat there smiling and nodding like a
  numb idiot with my arms crossed over my chest while nothing nothing nothing
 came out of my throat  
 so in the end he patted me on the shoulder like a swim coach might and he wished me luck
 and he gave me some free books and he showed me out the door 
  they took me to the offices of w w norton  where i was pretty sure i 'd be escorted from the building just for wearing doc martens  but that didn 't happen 
 being at the norton offices felt like
 reaching up into the night sky and touching the moon while the stars stitched your name across
  i mean that 's how big a deal it was to me you get it their lead editor carol houck smith  leaned over right in my face with these
 beady  bright fierce eyes and said well send me something then immediately 
 see now most people especially ted people would have run to the mailbox right 
 it took me over a decade to even imagine putting something in an envelope and licking a stamp
  on the last night i gave a big reading at the national poetry club 
 and at the end of the reading katharine kidde of kidde hoyt  & picard literary agency walked straight up to me and shook my hand
 and offered me representation like on the spot 
 i stood there and i kind of went deaf  has this ever happened to you
 and i almost started crying because all the people in the room were dressed so beautifully 
 and all that came out of my mouth was i don 't know  i have to think about it 
 and she said ok then and walked away 
 all those open hands out to me that small
 in my throat  you see i 'm trying to tell you something about people like me 
 misfit people we don 't always know how to hope or say yes or choose the big thing even when it 's right in front of us  it 's a shame we carry  it 's the
  shame of wanting something good it 's the shame of feeling something good  it 's the shame of not really believing we deserve to be in the room
 if i could i 'd go back and i 'd coach myself i 'd
 be exactly like those over 50 year old women who helped me i 'd teach myself how to want things how to stand up how to ask for them i 'd say
 you  yeah you 
 you belong in the room too the radiance falls on all of us  and we
  i flew back to oregon and as i watched the evergreens and rain
 come back into view  i just drank many tiny bottles of airplane feel sorry for yourself 
 i thought about how if i was a writer  i was some kind of misfit writer 
 what i 'm saying is i flew back to oregon without a book deal without an agent and with only a
 and heart ful of memories of having sat
 so near the beautiful
 writers  memory was the only prize i allowed myself  and yet at home
 in the dark back in my underwear i could still hear their voices
  don 't listen to anyone who tries to get you to shut up or change your story 
 they said give voice to the story only you know how to tell they said sometimes telling the story is the thing that saves your life 
 now i am as you can see  the woman over fifty  
 and i 'm a writer  and i 'm a mother  and i became a teacher
  guess who my favorite students are 
 although it didn 't happen the day that dream letter came through my mailbox i did write a memoir  called the chronology of water 
 in it are the stories of how many times i 've had to reinvent a self from the ruins of my choices  
 the stories of how my seeming failures were really just
  to something beautiful  all i had to do was give voice to the story 
 there 's a myth in most cultures about following your dreams  it 's called the hero 's journey  
 but i prefer a different myth that 's slightly to the side of that or underneath
  it 's called the misfit 's myth  and it goes like this even at the moment of your failure right then you are beautiful  
 you don 't know it yet  but you have the ability to reinvent yourself endlessly that 's your beauty  
 you can be a drunk  you can be a survivor of abuse  you can be an ex con 
  you can be a homeless person  you can lose all your money or your job or your husband or your wife or the worst thing of all a child  
 you can even lose your marbles you can be standing dead center
 in the middle of your failure and still  i 'm only here to tell you you are so beautiful 
 your story deserves to be heard  because you you rare
  and phenomenal misfit you new species are the only one in the room
 who can tell the story the way only you would  and i 'd be listening
