  the homeland of my people is afghanistan  
 like hundreds of thousands of other hazara kids i was born in in exile  
 the ongoing persecution and operation against the hazaras
  forced my parents to leave afghanistan  this persecution has had a long history going back to the late
 and the rule of king abdur rahman  he killed 
  percent of the hazara population he built minarets with their heads many hazaras were sold into slavery  and many others
 neighboring iran and pakistan  
 my parents also fled to pakistan  and settled in quetta 
 where i was born  after the september eleven attack on the twin towers  i got a chance to go to afghanistan for the first time with foreign journalists  i was only eighteen and i got a job working as an interpreter  
  i felt it was safe enough to move to afghanistan permanently  and i was working there as a documentary photographer  and 
  i worked on many stories one of the most important stories that i did was the dancing boys of afghanistan  
 it is a tragic story
  it involves young kids dancing for warlords and powerful men in the society these boys are often abducted or bought from their poor parents  
 and they are put to work as sex slaves  
 he was kidnapped from kabul by a warlord  he was taken to another province  where he was forced to work as a sex slave for the warlord and his friends when this story was published in the washington
  post  i started receiving death threats  and
 i was forced to leave afghanistan as my parents
 were along with my family i returned back to quetta  the situation in quetta had changed dramatically since i left in two thousand and five  once a peaceful haven for the hazaras it had now turned
 into the most
 dangerous city in pakistan
 hazaras are confined into two small areas  and they are marginalized socially  educationally  and financially  
 this is nadir i had known him since my childhood  he was injured when his van was ambushed by terrorists in quetta  
 he later died of his injuries 
  hazara members had been killed in various attacks  and around three thousand of them
 were injured 
 and many of them permanently disabled the attacks on the hazara community would only get worse  so it was not surprising that many wanted to flee
  largest population of hazaras in the world 
 when it came time to leave pakistan  australia seemed the obvious choice  financially only one of us could leave and it was decided that i would go in the hope that if i arrived 
  at my destination safely  i could work to get the rest of my family
  i met many people who lost loved ones at sea
  it was a desperate decision to take to leave everything behind and no one makes this decision easily  if i had been able to simply fly to australia it would have taken me less than 
 but getting a visa was impossible my journey was much longer much more complicated
  and certainly more dangerous traveling to thailand by air and then by road and boat
 to malaysia and into indonesia  
 paying people and smugglers all the way and spending a lot of time hiding and a lot of time in fear of being caught in indonesia
  i joined a group of
 seven asylum seekers  we all shared a bedroom
 in a town outside of jakarta called bogor  after spending a week in bogor three of my roommates left for the perilous journey 
 and we got the news
 two days later that a distressed boat sank in the sea en route to christmas island  we found out
  were never seen again  it made me think am i doing the right thing i concluded i really had no other choice but to go on a
 few weeks later we got the call from the people smuggler
 to alert us that the boat is ready for us to commence our sea journey taken in the night towards
 the main vessel on a motorboat 
 we boarded an old fishing boat that was already overloaded  there were ninety three of us  
 and we were all below deck no one was allowed up on the top  we all paid six thousand dollars each for this part of the trip  
 the first night and day went smoothly  but by the second night the weather turned
  waves tossed the boat around  and the timbers groaned people below deck were crying  praying  
 recalling their loved ones they were screaming  it was a terrible moment it
 was like a scene from doomsday  or maybe like one of those scenes from
 those hollywood movies that shows that that everything is breaking apart
  and the world is just ending  it was happening to us for real 
 we didn 't have any hope our boat was floating like a matchbox on the water without any control  
 the waves were much higher than our boat and the water poured in faster than the motor pumps could take it out
  we all lost hope  we thought this is the end  we were watching our deaths  and i was documenting it 
 the captain told us that
 we are not going to make it we have to turn back the boat 
 we went on the deck and turned our torches on and off
 to attract
  boat we kept trying to attract their attention attention by waving our life jackets and whistling
 eventually  we made it to a small island our boat crashing onto the rocks  i slipped into the water
 and destroyed my camera  whatever i had documented  but luckily  the memory card survived
  survived  
 it was a thick forest  
 we all split up into many groups as we argued over what to do next  we were all scared and confused
 then after spending the night on on the beach  we found a jetty and coconuts  
 we hailed a boat from a nearby
  and then were quickly handed over to indonesian water police 
 at serang detention center an immigration officer came and furtively strip searched us 
 he took our mobile my $ three hundred cash our shoes that we should not be able to escape  but
 we kept watching the guards
  around a fire  we removed two glass layers from an outside facing window and slipped through  we climbed a tree
 next to an outer wall that was topped with the shards of glass  we put the pillow on that and wrapped our forearms with
 bedsheets and climbed the wall  and we ran away
  with an uncertain future no money  
 the only thing i had was the memory card with the pictures and footage 
 when my documentary was aired on sbs dateline 
 many of my friends came to know about my situation  and they tried to help me they did not allow me to take any other boat to risk my life 
 i also decided to stay in indonesia and process my
 but i was really afraid that i would end up in indonesia for many years doing nothing
 and unable to work like every other asylum seeker 
 but it had happened to be a little bit different with me 
 i was lucky my contacts worked to expedite my case through
 and i got resettled in australia in may two thousand and thirteen not every asylum seeker  is lucky like me
  it is really difficult to live a life with an uncertain fate in limbo  
 the issue of asylum seekers in australia has been so extremely politicized that it has lost its human
  face  the asylum seekers have been demonized and then presented to the people i hope
 my story and the story of other hazaras could shed some light
 to show the people how these people are suffering in their countries of origin  
 and how they suffer  why they risk their lives to seek asylum thank you
