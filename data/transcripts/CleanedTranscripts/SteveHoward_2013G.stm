  i 've spent my life working on sustainability 
 i set up a climate change ngo called the climate group  i worked on forestry issues in wwf  i worked on development and agriculture issues in the u n system
  in total and then three years ago i found myself talking to
 ikea 's ceo about joining his team 
 like many people here  well  i want to maximize my personal impact in the world so
 i 'm going to explain
 why i joined the team there but first let 's just take three numbers the first number is three three billion
  this is the number of people joining the global middle class by two thousand and thirty coming out of poverty it
 's fantastic for them and their families  but we 've got two billion people in the global middle class today  and this swells that number to five a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity  
 the second number is six this is six degrees centigrade what we 're heading towards in terms of global warming we 're not heading towards one degree or three
  or four degrees we 're heading toward six degrees  
 and if you think about it all of the weird weather we 've been having the last few years  much of that is due to just one degree warming  
 and we need co2 emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down it
 's not inevitable  but we need to act decisively  
 the third number is twelve 
 that 's the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born you can see my grandmother there that was in the beginning of the last century
 so just twelve cities she was born in manchester england the ninth largest city in the world now there are five hundred cities  nearly with a million people or more in them 
 and if you look at the century from one thousand nine hundred and fifty to two thousand and fifty that 's the century when we build all the world 's cities 
 the century that we 're in the middle of right now every other century was kind of practice  and this lays down a blueprint for how we live
 so think about it we 're building cities like never before  bringing people out of poverty like never before  
 and changing the climate like never before sustainability has gone from a nice to do to a must do 
 it 's about what we do right here right now  and for the rest of our working
  so i 'm going to talk a little bit about what business can do and what a business like ikea can do and
 we have a sustainability strategy called people and planet positive to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world 
 why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world
 as a business other companies have sustainability strategies i 'm going to refer to some of those as
  going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we 've got 
 but first let 's think of customers  we know from asking people from china to the u s that
 the vast majority of people care about sustainability after the day to day issues 
 the day to day issues of how do i get my kids to school can i pay the bills at the end of the month then they care about big issues like climate change  
 but they want it to
  and they expect business to help and they 're a little bit disappointed today  
 so take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products we had detergents that could wash your whites grayer  
 we had the the early energy efficient light bulbs that took five minutes to warm up and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color  and we had
  or switched the light on or went to the bathroom or sometimes all three together  you were reminded sustainability was about compromise  it wasn 't a great start 
 today we have choices  
 we can make products that are beautiful or ugly  sustainable or unsustainable  affordable or expensive
  the incandescent bulbs i 'm not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes  wasting energy every time you switch them on change them after this
 or whether we have them on the stage here at ted or not but those old incandescent
  light bulbs
 really should have been sold as heaters they were mis sold for more than a hundred years  they produced heat and a little bit of light on the side now we have lights that produce light and a little bit of heat on the side  
 you save eighty five percent of the electricity with an led that you would have done in an old incandescent and the best thing is they 'll also last for more than twenty years  
 so think about that you 'll change your smartphone seven or eight times
  probably more if you 're in this audience you 'll change your car if you have one three or four times your kids could go to school go to college go away and have kids of their own come back bring the grandkids you 'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy
  so leds are fantastic what we decided to do was not to sell
  on the side marked up high and continue to push all the old bulbs the halogens and the cfls 
 we decided over the next two years  we will ban the halogens and the cfls ourselves we will go all in and this is what business needs to do go all in go one hundred percent  because then you stop investing 
  in the old stuff you invest in the new stuff you lower costs  you use your supply chain and your creativity and you get the prices down so everybody can afford the best lights so they can save energy
 's not just about products in people 's homes we 've got to think about the raw materials that produce our products  
 obviously there 's fantastic opportunities with recycled materials  and we can and will go zero waste 
 and there 's opportunities in a circular economy  but we 're still dependent on natural raw
  let 's take cotton 
 cotton 's brilliant probably many people are wearing cotton right now it 's a brilliant textile in use  
 it 's really dirty in production it uses lots of pesticides lots of fertilizer lots of water  
 so we 've worked with others with other businesses and and ngos on the better cotton initiative working right back down to the farm  and there you can halve the amount of water and halve 
  the chemical inputs the yields increase  and sixty percent of the costs of running many of these farms with farmers with low incomes
 can be chemical imports yields increase and you halve the input costs  farmers are coming out of poverty  they love it already hundreds of thousands of farmers have been reached  
 and now we 've got sixty percent better cotton in our business  again we 're going all in by two thousand and fifteen we 'll be one hundred percent better cotton 
 take the topic of one hundred percent targets
  people sometimes think that one hundred percent 's going to be hard and we 've had the conversation in the business  actually we found one hundred percent is easier to do than ninety percent or fifty percent if you have a ninety percent target everyone in the business finds a reason to be in the ten percent
  when it 's one hundred percent it 's kind of clear
  and businesspeople like clarity because then you just get the job done  so wood we know with forestry 
  illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale or you can have fantastic responsible forestry that we can be proud of 
 it 's a simple choice so we 've worked for many years with the forest stewardship council with literally hundreds of other organizations and there 's a point here about collaboration  
 so hundreds of others of ngos of forest workers ' unions and of businesses have helped create the forest stewardship council which sets standards for forestry and then checks the forestry 's good on the ground
  now together  through our supply chain with partners we 've managed to certify thirty five million hectares of forestry 
 that 's about the size of germany  and we 've decided in the next three years we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business 
 so be decisive on these issues use your supply chain to drive good but then it comes to your operations  some things are certain  i think we know
 we 'll use electricity in twenty or thirty years ' time  
 we know the sun will be shining somewhere and the wind will still be blowing in twenty or thirty years ' time so why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind  
 and why not take control of it ourselves  so we 're going one hundred percent renewable by two thousand and twenty we 'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume
  for all of our stores our own factories our distribution centers we 've installed three hundred thousand solar panels so far  
 and we 've got fourteen wind farms we own and operate in six countries  and we 're not done yet  but
 think of a solar panel a solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years  
 the electricity is free  every time the sun comes out after that the electricity is free  so this is a good thing for the cfo not just the sustainability guy every business can do things like this  
 but then we 've got to look
  beyond our operations  and i think everybody would agree that now business has to take full responsibility for the impacts of your supply chain 
 many businesses now fortunately have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains  but not every business far from it 
 and this came in ikea actually in the ' 90s we found there was a risk of child labor in the supply chain and people in the business were shocked
  and it was clearly totally unacceptable
 so then you have to act so a code of conduct was developed  and now we have eighty auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor
  but it 's not just as simple as making sure there 's no child labor  
 you 've got to say that 's not enough
  all agree that children are the most important people in the world and the most vulnerable  so what can a business do today
 to actually use your total value chain to support a better quality of life and protect child rights we 've worked with unicef and save the children
 on developing some new business principles with children 's rights  increasing numbers of businesses
 are signing up to these but actually in a survey many business leaders said they thought their business had nothing to do with children
  so
 what we decided to do was we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children 
 we also have a foundation
 that 's committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the rights of one hundred million children by two thousand and fifteen  
 you know the phrase  you can
 manage what you measure
 well  you should
 measure what you care about if you 're not measuring things you don 't care and you don 't know 
 so let 's take an example measure the things that are important in your business  isn 't it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women
  seventeen thousand managers across ikea
 that forty seven percent are women today  
 but it 's not enough and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management  and we do not want to wait another hundred years  
 so we 've launched a women 's open network this week in ikea and we 'll do whatever it takes to lead the change  so the message here is measure what you care about and lead the change and don 't wait a hundred years
  years  
 so we 've gone from sustainability being a nice to do to a must do it 's a must do it 's
 still nice to do  but it 's a must do 
 and
 everybody can do something on this as an individual be a discerning consumer  vote
  the companies that are acting on this 
 but also there are other businesses already acting  
 i mentioned renewable energy you go to google or lego they 're going one hundred percent renewable too in the same way that we are 
 on having really good sustainability strategies 
 there are companies like nike  
 patagonia timberland marks & spencer but i don 't think any of those businesses would say they 're perfect we certainly wouldn
 'll make mistakes going forward  but it 's about setting a clear direction being transparent having a dialogue with the right partners and choosing to lead on the issues that really count  
 so if you 're a business leader if you 're not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model 
 i 'd urge you to do so 
 and together we can help create a sustainable world
 and if we get it right we can make sustainability affordable for the many people not a luxury for the few  thank you
