  when i wrote my memoir the publishers were really confused was it about me as a child refugee 
 or as a woman who set up a
  one that went public and eventually employed over eight thousand five hundred people 
 or was it as a mother of an autistic child  
 or as a philanthropist that 's now given away serious money well it turns out i 'm all of these so let me tell you my story 
  all that i am stems from when i got onto a train in vienna  
 part of the kindertransport that saved nearly ten thousand jewish children from nazi europe  
 i was five years old clutching the hand of my nine year old sister and had very little idea as to what was going on what is england
  i 'm only alive because so long ago  i was helped by generous strangers  
 i was lucky  and doubly lucky to be later reunited with my birth parents  but 
 sadly  i never bonded with them again  
 but i 've done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train
  would ever have dreamed possible  
 and i love england my adopted country with a passion that perhaps only someone who has lost their human rights can feel  
 i decided to make mine
 a life that was worth saving  and then  i just got on with it
  let me take you back to the early 
 to get past the gender issues of the time  i set up my own software house at one of the first
 such startups in britain but it was also a company of women a
  and people laughed at the very idea because software at that time was given away free with hardware  nobody would buy software certainly not from a woman 
 although women were then coming out of the universities with decent degrees
  there was a glass ceiling to our progress
  and i 'd hit that glass ceiling too often  and i wanted opportunities for women
  i recruited professionally qualified women who 'd left the industry on marriage or when their first child was expected
 and structured them into a 
  organization we pioneered the concept of women going back into the
  when i took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff at no cost to anyone but me 
 for years i was the first woman this  or the only woman that and in those days
  on the stock exchange i couldn 't drive a bus or fly an airplane
 indeed i couldn 't open a bank account without my husband 's permission 
 my generation of women fought the battles for the right to work and the right for equal pay  
 nobody really expected much from people at work or in society because all
  the expectations then were about home and family responsibilities  and i couldn 't
 really face that so i started to challenge the
 conventions of the time  
 even to the extent of changing my name from stephanie to steve in my business development letters  so as to get through the door before anyone realized that he was a
  she 
 my company called freelance programmers and that 's precisely what it was 
 couldn 't have started smaller on the dining room table  and financed by
 the equivalent of one hundred dollars in today 's terms  and financed by my labor and by
  borrowing against the house my interests were scientific the market was commercial
 things such as payroll which i found rather boring
 so i had to compromise with operational research work which had the intellectual
  lots of stock control  and eventually the work came in 
 we disguised the domestic and part time nature of the staff by
  offering fixed prices one of the very first to do so 
 and who would have guessed that the programming of the black box flight recorder of supersonic concord would have been done by a bunch of women working in their own homes
  used was a simple trust the staff approach
 and a simple telephone  we even used to ask job applicants do you have access to a telephone 
 an early project was to develop software standards on management control protocols
  and software was and still is a maddeningly
  activity so that was enormously valuable
 we used the standards ourselves  we were even paid to update them over the years  and eventually  they were adopted by nato 
 our programmers remember only women  including gay and transgender
 worked with pencil and paper to develop
  flowcharts defining each task to be done 
 and they then wrote code  
 usually machine code  sometimes binary code  which was then sent by mail to a data center
 to be punched onto paper tape or card
 and then
  in order to verify it all this before it ever got near a computer that was programming in the early 
 thirteen years from startup equal opportunity legislation came in in britain and that made it illegal to
  and as an example of unintended consequences my female company had to let the men in 
 when i started my company of women the men
 said how interesting because it only works because it 's small 
  and later as it became sizable they accepted yes it is sizable now  but of no strategic interest 
 and later when it was a
 company valued at over three billion dollars  and i 'd made seventy of the staff into millionaires  they sort of said
  you can always tell ambitious women by the shape of our heads they 're
 flat on top for being patted patronizingly 
 and we have larger feet to stand away from the kitchen sink 
 let me share with you two
  secrets of success  surround yourself with 
  people and people that you like  and choose your partner very very carefully
 because the other day when i said my husband 's an angel a woman complained
  if success were easy  we 'd all be millionaires  
 but in my case it came in the midst of family trauma and indeed  crisis 
 our late son giles was an only child
 beautiful contented baby  and then at two and a half 
 like a changeling in a fairy story  he lost the little speech that he had
 and turned into a wild  unmanageable toddler 
  not the terrible twos he was profoundly autistic and he never spoke again  
 giles was the first resident in the first house of the first charity that i set up to pioneer services for autism 
 and then there 's been a groundbreaking prior 's court school for pupils with autism
  medical research charity again all for autism because whenever i found a gap in services  i tried to help  
 i like doing new things and making new things happen  and i 've just started
 a three year think tank for autism 
 and so that some of my wealth does go back to the industry from which it stems  i 've also founded
 the oxford internet institute and other it ventures
 the oxford internet institute focuses not on the technology  but on the social economic  legal and ethical issues of the internet  
 giles died unexpectedly seventeen
  and i have learned to live without him  and i have learned to live without his need of me
 philanthropy is all that i do now i need never worry about getting lost because several charities would quickly come and find me
  it 's one thing to have an idea for an enterprise  but as many people in this room will know making it happen is a very difficult thing and it demands extraordinary energy
 and determination the courage to risk family and home and a
  seven commitment that borders on the obsessive  so it 's just as well that i 'm a workaholic 
 i believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in
 humility 
 work is not just something i do when i 'd rather be doing something else 
 we live our lives forward
  so what has all that taught me i learned
 that tomorrow 's never going to be like today and certainly nothing like yesterday  
 and that made me able to cope with change indeed eventually to welcome change  
 though i 'm told i 'm
