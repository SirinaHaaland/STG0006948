  mathematician named georg cantor 
 and cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line 
 and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process a recursive process  so he starts out with one line
  then two and then four and then sixteen and so on  
 and if he does this an infinite number of times which you can do in mathematics  he ends up with an infinite number of lines each of which has an infinite number of points in it 
 so he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity  and this blew his mind literally he checked into a sanitarium and when he came out of
  he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory because the largest set of infinity would be god himself he was a very religious man he
 was a mathematician on a mission  
 and other mathematicians did the same sort of thing a swedish mathematician von koch decided that instead of subtracting lines he would add them 
 and so he came up with this beautiful curve  and there 's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape we can use any
 any seed shape we like and
  rearrange this and i 'll stick this somewhere down there  ok
 and
 now upon iteration that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure  so these all have the property of self similarity the part looks like the whole it 's the same pattern at many different scales  
 now mathematicians thought this was very strange because as you shrink a ruler down you measure a longer and longer length and since they went
  through the iterations an infinite number of times as the ruler shrinks down to infinity  the length
 goes to infinity 
 this made no sense at all so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books they said these are pathological curves and we don 't have to discuss them 
 and that worked for a hundred years  and then in
  realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals  you get the shapes of nature  
 you get the human lungs you get acacia trees you get ferns you get these beautiful natural forms if you
 take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet go ahead and do that now and
  is covered with fractals the mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes they were breathing those words with fractal lungs it 's very ironic
 and i 'll show you a little natural recursion here again we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape 
  so here 's the second iteration and the third fourth
 and and so on so
  i happened to notice that if you look at an aerial photograph of an african village  you see fractals  
 and i thought this is fabulous i wonder why and of course i had to go to africa and ask folks why  so i got a fulbright
 scholarship to to just travel around africa for a year asking people why they were building fractals
 which is a great job if you can get it and so i finally got to
  city
  and i 'd done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold but when i got there 
 i got to the palace of the chief  
 and my french is not very good i said something like i am a mathematician and i would like to stand on your roof but he was really cool about it and he took me up there and we
  we knew about a rectangle within a rectangle 
  we know all about that and it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle  and the path through that palace is actually this this spiral here 
  and as you go through the path you have to get more and more polite so they 're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling it 's a conscious
  built this village about four hundred meters in diameter  you have a huge ring  the rings that
 represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back and then you have the chief 's ring here
 towards the back and then the chief 's immediate family
 in that ring  so here 's a little fractal model for it here 's one house with the sacred altar here 's the house of houses the family enclosure
 with the humans here where the sacred altar would be and then here 's the village as a whole a ring of ring of rings
 with the chief 's extended family here the chief 's immediate family here  and here there 's a tiny village only this big  
 now you might wonder how can people fit in a tiny village only this big that 's because they 're spirit people it 's the ancestors
  and of course the spirit people
 have a little miniature village in their village right  so it 's just like georg cantor said  the recursion continues forever this is in the mandara mountains near the nigerian border in cameroon mokoulek  i saw this diagram drawn by a french
 architect and i thought wow what a beautiful fractal so i tried to come up with a seed shape which upon iteration would unfold into this thing i came up with this structure
  after i did the simulation  i realized the whole village kind of spirals around just like this and here 's that replicating replicating line a self replicating line that that unfolds into the fractal well
 i noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at 
 so when i got to the village  i said can you take me to the square building i think
  we can take you there but you can 't go inside because that 's the sacred altar where we do sacrifices every year to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields and i started to realize that the cycles of fertility 
 were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this and the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales so here 's a nankani village in mali 
 and you can see you go inside the family enclosure you go inside and here 's pots in the fireplace stacked recursively here 's
  calabashes that that
 issa was just showing us and they 're stacked recursively  now the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman 's soul and when she dies they have a ceremony where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to to eternity  
 once again  infinity is important
  now you might ask yourself three questions at this point aren 't these scaling patterns just universal to all
 indigenous architecture  and that was actually my original hypothesis when i first saw those african fractals i thought wow  so any indigenous group that doesn 't have a state society that sort of hierarchy  must 
  have a kind of bottom up architecture but that turns out not to be true i started collecting aerial photographs of
  that they use  so native americans
 use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry
 you can see on the pottery and the baskets here 's an aerial photograph of one of the anasazi ruins you can see it 's circular at the largest scale  but it 's rectangular at the smaller scale right it is not the same pattern at two different scales 
  you ignoring the diversity of african cultures 
 and three times  the answer is no  
 first of all i agree with mudimbe 's wonderful book the invention of africa that africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism and then oppositional movements
  no because a widely shared design practice doesn 't necessarily give you a unity of culture and it definitely is not in the dna
  so they 're similar to themselves but they 're not necessarily similar to each other you see very different uses for fractals it 's a shared technology in africa 
 and finally  well isn 't this just intuition it 's not really mathematical knowledge africans can 't possibly really be using fractal geometry right it wasn 't invented until the 1970s 
 well it 's true that some african fractals
  as far as i 'm concerned just pure intuition  so some of these things i 'd wander around the streets of dakar asking people 
 what 's the algorithm what 's the rule for making this and they 'd say well we just make it that way because it looks pretty stupid 
 but sometimes
 that 's not the case in some cases 
 there would actually be algorithms  and very sophisticated algorithms so in manghetu sculpture you 'd see this recursive geometry in
 ethiopian crosses you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape
  people draw lines in the sand and it 's what the german mathematician euler called
 a graph we now call it an eulerian path you can never lift your stylus from the surface and you can never go over the same line twice  
 but they do it recursively  and they do it with an age grade system so the little kids learn this one and then the older kids learn this one then the next age grade initiation you learn this one and with with each iteration of that algorithm  you learn the
  iterations of the myth  you learn the next level of knowledge  and finally all over africa you see this board game
 it 's called owari in ghana where i studied it it 's called mancala here on the east coast  bao in
 kenya sogo elsewhere well you see self organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game  and the folks
  patterns and would use them strategically  so this is very conscious knowledge here 's a wonderful fractal  anywhere you go in the sahel  you 'll see this
 this windscreen  and of course fences around the world are all cartesian all strictly linear  but here in africa  you 've got these nonlinear scaling fences  so i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things this guy in in mali just outside of bamako
  you 're making fractal fences because nobody else is and his answer was very interesting  he said well if i lived in the jungle i would only use the long rows of straw
 because they 're very quick and they 're very cheap it doesn 't take much time doesn 't take much straw 
 he said but wind and dust goes through pretty easily  
 now the tight rows up at the very top they really hold out the wind and dust but it takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of straw because they 're really
  we know from experience
 that the farther up from the ground you go the stronger the wind blows right it 's just like a  cost benefit analysis  and i
 measured out the lengths of straw put it on a log log plot got the scaling exponent and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height in the wind engineering handbook  
 so these guys are right on target for for a practical use of of
 scaling technology the most complex example of an algorithmic approach
 to fractals that i found was actually not in geometry it was in a symbolic code and this was bamana sand divination and the same divination system is found all over africa
 you can find it on the east coast as well as well as the west coast and often the the symbols are very well preserved so
 each of these symbols has four
  binary word you draw these lines in the sand randomly
 and then you count off  and if it 's an odd number you put down one stroke and if it 's an even number you put down two strokes  
 and they did this very rapidly  
 and i couldn 't understand where they were getting they only did the randomness four times i couldn 't understand where they were getting the other twelve symbols
  and they wouldn 't tell me they said
 matter and finally out of desperation i said well  let me explain georg cantor in one thousand eight hundred and seventy seven 
 and i started explaining why i was there in in africa and they got very excited when they saw the cantor set 
 and one of them said come here i think i can help you out here and so he took me through the initiation ritual for for a bamana priest
  and of course i was only interested in the math so the whole time he kept shaking his head going you know i didn 't learn it this way but i had to sleep with
 a kola nut next to my bed buried in sand and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on  and finally he revealed the
 the truth of the matter
  and it turns out it 's a pseudo random number generator using deterministic chaos when you have
 a four bit symbol  you then put it together with another one sideways  so even plus odd gives you odd odd plus even
 gives you odd even plus even gives you even odd plus odd gives you even it 's addition modulo two just like in the parity bit check on your computer
  and then you you take this symbol  and you put it back in so it 's a self generating diversity of symbols they 're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this 
 now because it 's a
  you can actually implement this in hardware what a fantastic teaching tool that should be
 in african engineering schools  and the the most interesting thing i found out about it was historical in the 12th century hugo of santalla brought it from islamic mystics into spain
 and there it entered into the the alchemy community as geomancy divination through the earth this is a
  the german mathematician talked about geomancy in his dissertation called de combinatoria 
 and he said well instead of using one stroke and two strokes  let 's use a one and a zero  and we can count by powers of two 
 right  ones and zeros the binary code george boole took leibniz 's binary code and created boolean algebra and john von neumann took boolean algebra and created the digital computer  so all these these little
  every digital circuit in the world started in africa and i know
 brian eno says there 's there 's not enough africa in computers but
 you know i don 't think there 's enough african history in brian eno 
 so let me end with just a few words about
 applications that we 've found for this and you can go to our website  the applets are all free they just run in the browser
  anybody in the world can use them  the national science foundation 's broadening participation in computing program recently awarded us a grant to make
 a programmable version of these design tools so
 hopefully in three years anybody 'll be able to go on the web and create their own simulations and their own artifacts we 've focused in the u s on
  students as well as native american and latino  we 've found statistically significant improvement
 with children using this software in a mathematics class in comparison with with a control group that did not have the software  so it 's really very successful
 teaching children that they have a heritage that 's about mathematics that it 's not just about singing and dancing  we 've started a pilot program in
 ghana  we got
  see if folks would be willing to work with us on this we 're very excited about the future possibilities for that we 've also been working in design i didn 't put his his name up here my colleague  kerry in 
 kenya has come up with this great idea for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure because if you try to impose a a grid structure postal system on a fractal village  
  bernard tschumi at columbia university has finished using this in a design for a museum of african art david hughes at
 ohio state university has written a primer on afrocentric architecture in which  he 's used some of these fractal structures
