  age two 
 you can tell by the power squat i was a very confident boy and not without reason i had a very charming routine at the time  which was to wait until late in the evening when my parents were decompressing from a hard day 's work
  doing their crossword puzzles watching television i would run into the living room  jump up on the couch rip the cushions off throw them on the floor scream at the top of my lungs and run out
 because i was the incredible hulk 
 obviously you see the resemblance  and this routine went on for some time 
 when i was seven i went to summer camp my parents found it necessary for peace of mind and
 at noon each day the campers would go to a pond where they had
 floating docks you could jump off the end into the deep end i was born premature i was always very small my left lung had collapsed when i was born and i 've always had buoyancy problems so water was something that scared me to begin with but i would go in on occasion 
 and on one particular day the
 campers were jumping through inner tubes they were diving through inner tubes and i thought this would be great fun
  dove through the inner tube  and the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles  
 and i tried to come up for air and my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube  
 and i went wild eyed and thought i was going to die  a camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us
 from that point onward i was terrified
  that is something that i did not get over my inability to swim has been one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments 
 that is when i realized that i was not the incredible hulk  
 but there is a happy ending to this story at age thirty one that 's my age now
 in august i took two weeks to re examine swimming  
  of the obvious aspects of swimming and went from swimming one lap so twenty yards like a drowning monkey at about two hundred beats per minute heart rate i measured it
 to
 going
 to montauk on long island close to where i grew up and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water  getting out and feeling better than when i went in and i came out in
 my speedos  
  feeling like the incredible hulk and that 's what i want everyone in here to feel like the incredible hulk at the end of this presentation more specifically i want you to feel like you 're capable of
 becoming an excellent long distance swimmer a world class language learner and a tango champion  and
 i would like to share my art if i have an art it 's deconstructing things that really scare the living hell out of me so moving onward swimming
  principles first principles this is very important  i find that the best results in life are often held back by false constructs and untested assumptions  
 and the turnaround in swimming came when a friend of mine said i will go a year without any stimulants this is a 
  type of guy if you can complete a one kilometer open
  the clock started ticking i started seeking out triathletes because i found that
 lifelong swimmers often couldn 't teach what they did 
 i tried kickboards my feet would slice through the water like razors i wouldn 't even move i would leave demoralized staring at my feet 
 hand paddles everything  even did lessons with olympians nothing helped  
 and then chris sacca who is now a dear friend mine had completed an iron man with one hundred and three degree temperature said i have the answer to your prayers and he introduced me
  to
 the work of a man named terry laughlin who is the founder of total immersion swimming 
 that set me on the road to examining biomechanics so here are the new rules of swimming  if any of you are afraid of swimming  
 or not good at it the first is forget about kicking very counterintuitive so it turns out that propulsion
 isn 't really the problem
 kicking harder doesn 't solve the problem because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent of their energy expenditure into forward motion 
 the problem is hydrodynamics  so what you want to focus on instead is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body much like a small car behind a big car on the highway 
 and you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position 
 the only way you can do that is to not swim on top of the water the body is
  percent of it would be at least  submerged naturally  so you end up number three not swimming in the case of freestyle 
 on your stomach as many people think reaching on top of the water  but actually rotating from streamlined right
 to streamlined left maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible 
 so let 's look at some examples  this is terry and you can see that he 's extending his right arm
 below his head and far in front and so his entire body really is underwater
 the arm is extended below the head the head is held in line with the spine so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up
 very important especially for people with lower body fat 
 here is an example of the stroke  so you don 't kick but you do use a small flick  you can see this is the left extension 
 then you see his left leg small flick  and the only purpose of that is to rotate his hips so he can get to the
 opposite side  
 and the entry point for his right hand notice this he 's not reaching in front and catching the water  rather  he is entering the water at a  45 degree angle with his forearm  
 and then propelling himself
 by streamlining very important  incorrect above which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you not their
  'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment
 below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what i did which is going from twenty one strokes per 20 yard length
 to eleven strokes
 in two workouts with no coach no video monitoring  and now i love swimming  i can 't wait to go swimming i 'll be doing a swimming lesson later for myself
  easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll and just to look at your recovery hand
 as it enters the water  and that will get you very far
 that 's it that 's really all you need to know languages  material versus method i like many people came to the conclusion that i was terrible at languages
  i suffered through spanish for junior high first year of high school  and the sum total of my knowledge was pretty much donde esta el bano and i wouldn 't even catch
 the response a
 sad state of affairs 
 then i transferred to a different school sophomore year and i had a choice of other languages  most of my friends were taking japanese so i thought why not punish myself i 'll do japanese 
 six months later i had the chance to go to japan
  have japanese language classes every day
 to help you cope it will be an amazing experience my first overseas experience in fact
  so my parents encouraged me to do it  i left i arrived in tokyo amazing i couldn 't believe i was on the other side of the world i
 met my host family things went quite well i think all things considered my first evening  
 before my first day of
  you 've never seen a more confused japanese woman laughter
 i walked in to school  and a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper  i couldn 't read any of it hieroglyphics  it could have
  been because it was kanji   chinese characters adapted into the japanese language asked him what this said  and he goes
  per se they were the normal high school curriculum for japanese students the other four thousand nine hundred and ninety nine students in the school who were japanese besides the american  and
 that 's that 's pretty much my response 
 and that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method i tried everything i went to kinokuniya i tried every
 possible book every possible cd  nothing worked until i found this 
 this is the joyo kanji  this is a tablet rather  or a poster of the one thousand nine hundred and forty five common use characters as determined by the ministry of education in one thousand nine hundred and eighty one 
 many of the publications in japan limit themselves to these characters to facilitate literacy some are required to and this became my holy grail my rosetta stone
 as soon as i focused on this material 
 i took off
 i ended up being able to read asahi shinbu  asahi newspaper
  about six months later so a total of eleven months later and went from japanese i to japanese vi ended up doing translation work at age sixteen when i returned to the u s 
 and
 have continued to apply this material over method approach to close to a dozen languages now someone who was terrible at languages  
 and at any given time  speak read and write five
  or six
 this brings us to the point which is it 's oftentimes what you do not how you do it that is the determining factor 
 this is the difference between being effective
 doing the right things and being efficient doing things well whether or not they 're important 
 you can also do this with grammar i came up with these six sentences after much experimentation having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar
  translating these sentences into past present future will show you subject object verb placement of indirect direct objects  gender and so forth from that point  you can then if you want to acquire 
  multiple languages  alternate them so there is no interference we can talk about that if anyone in interested and now i love languages  
  you 'd be wrong
 because my body is very poorly designed for most things pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps 
 i used to be much bigger much more muscular and so i ended up walking like this i looked a lot like an like an
 orangutan our close cousins  or the incredible hulk not very good for ballroom dancing
  i found myself in argentina in two thousand and five decided to watch a tango class had no intention of participating 
 went in paid my ten pesos walked up ten women two guys  usually a good ratio 
 the instructor says you are participating 
 immediately  death sweat 
 fight or flight fear sweat because i tried ballroom dancing in college
 stepped on the girl 's foot with my heel she screamed i was so concerned with her perception of what i was doing that it exploded in my face never to return to the
  ballroom dancing club  she comes up and this was her approach the teacher 
 okay come on grab me gorgeous assistant instructor 
 she was very pissed off that i had pulled her from her advanced practice  so i did my best i didn 't know where to put my hands  
 and she pulled back threw down her arms put them on her hips turned around and yelled across the room this guy is built like 
  mountain of muscle and he 's grabbing me like a fucking frenchman
 which i found encouraging 
 everyone burst into laughter i was humiliated she came back she goes come on i don 't have all day 
 as someone who wrestled since age eight i proceeded to crush her 
 of mice and men style  
 and she looked up and said now that 's better 
 so i bought a month 's worth of classes
  to look at i wanted to set competition so i 'd have a deadline parkinson 's law the perceived complexity complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it so i had a very short deadline for a competition
  i got a female instructor first 
 to teach me the female role the follow because i wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities that the follow needed to develop  so i wouldn 't have a repeat of college 
 and then i took an inventory
 of the characteristics  along with her of
 the of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who 'd won championships  i interviewed these people because they all taught 
 i compared the two lists and what you find is that there is explicitly  expertise they recommended certain training methods 
 then there were implicit commonalities that none of them seemed to be practicing 
  protectionism of argentine dance teachers aside i found this very interesting  so i decided to focus on three of those commonalities 
 long steps so a lot of milongueros the tango dancers will use very short steps 
 i found that longer steps were much more elegant so you can have
 and you can do it in a very small space in fact  secondly different types of pivots
  tempo these seemed to be the three areas that i could exploit to compete
 if i wanted to comptete against people who 'd been practicing for twenty to thirty years that photo
 is of the  semi finals of the buenos aires championships four months later then one month later went to the world championships made it to the semi final and then set a world record following that two weeks later
  i want you to see
 part of what i practiced
 i 'm going to jump forward here this is the
 instructor that alicia and i chose for the male lead 
 his name is gabriel misse one of the most elegant dancers of his generation  known for his long steps  and his tempo changes
 and his pivots
  alicia in her
  so i think you 'll agree they look quite good together now what i like about this video
 is it 's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together because of his lead he had a strong lead  he didn 't lead with his chest which requires you lean forward i couldn 't develop the attributes in my toes  the strength in my feet to do that 
 so he uses a lead
 that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm so he can lift the woman to break her for example that 's just one benefit
  of that so then we broke it down this would
 be an example of one pivot this is a back
 back step pivot  there are many different types i have hundreds of hours of footage
 all categorized much like george carlin categorized his comedy
  tango so fear is your friend fear is an indicator  sometimes it shows you what you shouldn 't do more often than not it shows you exactly what you should do  
 and the best results that i 've had in life the most enjoyable times have all been from asking a simple question what 's the worst that can happen  especially with fears you gained when you were a child  
 take the analytical
