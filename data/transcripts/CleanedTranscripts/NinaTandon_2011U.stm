  i work with really amazing little itty bitty creatures
 called cells 
 and let me tell you what it 's like to grow these cells in the lab i work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment we plate them into dishes that we
  sometimes call petri dishes  and we feed them sterilely of course with what we call cell culture media which is like their food
 and we grow them in incubators  why do i do this we observe the cells in a plate and they 're
 just on the surface  but what we 're really trying to do in my lab
 is to engineer tissues out of them what does that even mean well
  it means growing an actual heart  let 's say
 or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body not only that but they can also be used for disease models
 and for this purpose traditional cell culture techniques just really aren 't enough the cells are kind of homesick the dish doesn 't feel like their home  and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive 
 we call this the biomimetic paradigm
  copying nature in the lab  let 's take the example of the heart the topic of a lot of my research what makes the heart unique  
 well the heart beats  rhythmically tirelessly  faithfully 
 we copy this in the lab by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes these electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab  
 what else do we know about the heart
 well heart cells are pretty greedy nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very very dense blood supply 
 in the lab we micro pattern channels in the biomaterials on which we grow the cells and this allows us to flow the cell culture media the cells ' food through the scaffolds where we 're growing the cells
 a lot like what you might expect from a capillary capillary bed in the heart so this brings me to lesson number one
  life can do a lot with very little  let 's take the example of electrical stimulation  let 's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be 
 on the left  we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue that i engineered from rat cells in the lab it 's about the size of a mini marshmallow  
 and after one week it 's beating you can see it in the upper 
  but don 't worry if you can 't see it so well it 's amazing that these cells beat
 at all  but what 's really amazing is that the cells  when we electrically stimulate them like with a pacemaker that they beat so much more  
 but that brings me to lesson number two 
 cells do all the work in a sense tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here because structural engineers
 build bridges and big things 
  but what we are doing is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves  what does this mean for us  
 let 's do something really simple  let 's remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept  
 let 's remember that our cells sustain our lives in a very real way 
 we are what we eat could easily be described as we are what
  and in the case of the flora in our gut these cells may not even be human  
 but it 's also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life 
 behind every sound sight touch  taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us 
 it begs the question  shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship to include the ecosystem of our own bodies  i invite you to talk
  about this with me further  and in the meantime i wish you luck may none of your non cancer cells become endangered species thank you
