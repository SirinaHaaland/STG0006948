  earlier this year  i was informed that i would be doing a ted talk  so i was excited then i panicked  then i was excited then i panicked  
 and in between the excitement and the panicking i started to do my research  and my research primarily consisted of googling
  how to give a great ted talk 
 and interspersed with that i was googling chimamanda ngozi adichie how many of you know who that is 
 so i was googling her because i always google her because i 'm just a fan  
 but also because she always has important and interesting things to say  and the combination of those searches
 kept leading me to her talk
 on the dangers of a single story on
 what happens when we have a solitary lens through which to understand certain groups of people and it is the perfect talk
  it 's the talk that i would have given if i had been
 famous first 
 you know and you
  she 's african and i 'm african and she 's a feminist and i 'm a feminist and she 's a storyteller and i 'm a storyteller so i really felt like it 's my talk 
 so i decided that i was going to learn how to code  and then i was going to hack the internet
 and i would take down all the copies of that talk that existed and then i would memorize it and then i would come here and deliver it as if it was my own speech so that plan was going really well except the coding part  
 and then one morning
 one morning a few months ago  i woke up to the news that the wife of a certain presidential candidate
 had given a speech
 that 
 that sounded eerily like a speech given by one of my other faves
  obama 
 and so i decided that i should probably write my own ted talk  and so
 that is what i am here to do i 'm here to talk about my own observations about storytelling 
 i want to talk to you about the power of stories of course  but i also want to talk about their limitations  particularly for those of us who are interested in social
  justice  so since adichie gave that talk seven years ago there has been a boom in storytelling stories are everywhere  
 and if there was a danger in the telling of one tired old tale then i think there has got to be lots to celebrate about the flourishing of so many stories and so many voices
  stories are the antidote
 to bias 
 in fact today if you are middle class and connected via the internet  
 you can download stories at the touch of a button or the swipe of a screen  you can listen to a podcast about what it 's like to grow up dalit in kolkata  
 you can hear an indigenous man in australia talk about the trials and triumphs of raising his children in dignity and in pride 
 stories make us fall in love
  rifts and they bridge divides 
 stories can even make it easier for us to talk about the deaths of people in our societies who don 't matter because they make us care right
  i 'm not so sure  and i actually work for a place called the centre for stories and my job is to help to tell stories
  challenge mainstream narratives about what it means to be black or a muslim or a refugee or any of those other categories that we talk about
 all the time but i come to this work after a long history as a social justice activist  
 and so i 'm really interested in the ways that people talk about nonfiction storytelling as though it 's about more than entertainment as though it 's about being a catalyst for
  particularly the stories about people who no one seems to care about can often get in the way of action towards social justice now this is not because
 storytellers mean any harm quite the contrary storytellers
  like me and i suspect yourselves 
 and the audiences of storytellers are often deeply compassionate and empathetic people still good intentions can have
 unintended consequences  and so i want to propose that stories are not as magical as they seem so three because it 's always got to be three
 three reasons why i think that stories don 't necessarily make the world a better
  place 
 firstly stories can create an illusion of solidarity 
 there is nothing like that feel good factor you get from listening to a fantastic story where you feel like you climbed that mountain  right  
 or that you befriended that death row inmate  
 but you didn 't you haven 't done anything listening is an important
 but insufficient step towards social action
 secondly i think often we are drawn towards
 characters and protagonists who are likable and human 
 and this makes sense of course right because if you like someone then you care about them  
 but the inverse is also true  if you don 't like someone then you don 't care about them  and if you don 't care about them you don 't have to see yourself as having a
  moral obligation to think about the circumstances that shaped their lives  i learned this
 lesson when i was fourteen years old i learned that actually you don 't have to like someone to recognize their wisdom  and you certainly don 't have to like someone to take a stand by their side  
 so my bike was stolen
 while i was riding it which is possible if you 're riding slowly
  enough  which i was so one minute i 'm cutting across this field in the nairobi neighborhood where i grew up and it 's like
 a very bumpy path  and so when you 're riding a bike you don 't want to be like 
 and so i 'm going like this slowly pedaling and all of a sudden i 'm on the floor
  i 'm on the ground and i look up and there 's this kid peddling away in the getaway vehicle which is my bike  
 and he 's about eleven or twelve years old and i 'm on the floor and i 'm crying because i saved a lot of money for that bike and i 'm crying and i stand up and i start screaming instinct
 steps in and i start screaming
  come out and they start to give chase this is africa so mob justice in action right  
 and i round the corner  and they 've captured him they 've caught him the suspect has been apprehended and they
 make him give me my bike back and they also make him apologize again you
  you know typical african justice right  and so they make him say sorry and so we stand there facing each other  
 and he looks at me and he says sorry  but he looks at me with this
 unbridled fury he is very very
 angry  
 and it is the first time that i have been confronted with someone who doesn 't like me simply because of what i represent he looks at me with this look as if to say you with your shiny skin and your bike you 're angry at me
 so it was a hard lesson that he didn 't like me but you know what he was right  
 i was a middle class kid living in a poor country i had a bike and he barely had food  
 sometimes it 's the messages that we don 't want to hear the ones that make us want to crawl out of ourselves that we need to hear the most for every lovable storyteller who steals your heart
  there are hundreds more whose voices are slurred and ragged who don 't get to stand up on a stage dressed in fine clothes like this 
 there are
 a million
  stories and we can 't afford to ignore them simply because we don 't like their protagonists or because that 's not the kid that we would bring home with us from the orphanage 
 the third
  i think that stories don 't necessarily make the world a better place is that too often we are so invested in the personal narrative that we forget to look at the bigger picture  
 and so we applaud someone when they tell us about their feelings of shame  but we don 't necessarily link that to oppression we
  when someone says they felt small but we don 't link that to discrimination 
 the most important stories especially for social justice are those that do both that are both personal and allow us to explore and understand the political  
 but it 's not just about the stories we like versus the stories we choose to ignore  
 increasingly we are living in a society where there are larger forces at play where stories are actually for many people beginning to replace the news 
 yeah we live in a
  time where we are witnessing the decline of facts when emotions rule and analysis it 's kind of boring 
 right where we value what we feel more than what we actually know 
 a recent
 report by the pew center on trends in america indicates that only ten percent of young adults under the age of thirty
  a lot of trust in the media now this is significant 
 it means that storytellers are gaining trust at precisely the same moment that many in the media are losing the confidence in the public 
 this is not a good thing because while stories are important and they help us to have insights in many ways we need the media 
 from my years as a social justice activist i know very
  well that we need credible facts from media institutions combined with the powerful voices of storytellers that 's what pushes the needle forward in terms of social justice 
 in the final analysis of course  
 it is justice
 that makes the world a better place not stories
  and so if it is justice that we are after then i think we mustn 't focus on the media or on storytellers we must focus on audiences 
 on anyone who has ever turned on a radio or listened to a podcast and that means all of us 
 so a few concluding thoughts on what audiences can do to make the world a better place  
 so firstly the world would be
  a better place  i think if audiences were more curious and more skeptical and asked more questions about the social context that created those stories that they love so much  
 secondly the world would be a better place if audiences recognized that storytelling is intellectual work 
  for audiences to
 demand more buttons on their favorite websites 
 buttons for example that say if you liked this story  click here to support a cause your storyteller believes in 
 or click here to contribute to your storyteller 's next big idea 
 often we are committed to the platforms
  but not necessarily to the storytellers themselves  and then lastly i think that audiences can make the world a better place
 by switching off their phones 
 by stepping away from their screens and stepping out into the real world beyond what feels safe  
 alice walker has said 
 look closely at the present you are constructing it should look like the future you are dreaming 
 storytellers can help us to dream
  it 's up to all of us to have a plan for justice  thank you
