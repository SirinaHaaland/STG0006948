  i love coming to doha  it 's such an international place it feels like the united nations
  you land at the airport and you 're welcomed by an indian lady
 who takes you to al maha services where you meet a filipino lady who hands you off to a south african lady who then takes you to a korean who takes you to
 a pakistani guy with the luggage who takes you to the car with a sri lankan you go to the hotel and you check in there 's a lebanese  yeah  and then
 then a swedish guy showed me my room i said where are the qataris
  's growing so fast sometimes there 's growing pains you know like sometimes you run into people that you think know the city well  but they don 't know it that well 
 my indian cab driver showed up at the w  and i asked him to take me to the
  i was on my way home from the airport i got a job i 'm working already
  the middle east has been an adventure the past couple of years it is going crazy with with the arab spring and revolution and all this are there any lebanese here tonight by applause lebanese yeah 
 the middle east is going crazy you know the middle east is going crazy when lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region
 would have thought oh
 my gosh no there 's serious issues in the region some people don 't want to talk about them i 'm here to talk about them tonight  
 ladies and gentlemen of the middle east here 's a serious issue when we see each other when we say hello  how many kisses are we going to do 
 every country is different and it 's confusing okay in lebanon they do three
  three in egypt they do two  i was in lebanon  i got used to three  
 i went to egypt i went to say hello to this one egyptian guy  i went one two  i went for three he wasn 't into it
  next time you see a saudi look closely they 're just a little bit tilted
  you guys do the nose to nose  why is that are you too tired to go all the way around 
 habibi it 's so hot just come here for a second say hello  hello habibi just don 't move just stay there  please  i need to rest 
 iranians sometimes we do two sometimes we do three a friend of mine explained to me before the ' seventy nine revolution it was two
  after the revolution three  so with iranians you can tell whose side the person is on based on the number of kisses they give you yeah if you
 go one two three i can 't believe you support this regime with your
 three kisses 
 laughter but no guys really it is exciting to be here and like i said you guys are doing a lot
  you know and it 's amazing and it helps change the image of the middle east in the west a lot of americans don 't know a lot about us about the middle east i 'm iranian and american i 'm there i know i
 've traveled here there 's so much we laugh  right people don 't know we laugh when i did the axis of evil comedy tour  it came out on comedy central i went online to see what people were saying i ended up on a conservative website one guy wrote another guy he said i never knew these people
  we like to laugh we like to celebrate life  and i wish more americans would travel here i always encourage my friends travel see the middle east there 's so much to
  and it helps
 stop problems of of misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening for example i don 't know if you heard about this 
 a little while ago in the us there was a muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane talking about the safest place to sit on the plane 
 some passengers overheard them somehow misconstrued that as terrorist talk 
 got them kicked off the plane  it was a family
  apparently we can 't even talk about the safest place to sit on an airplane so my advice to all my middle eastern friends and
  muslim friends and anyone who looks middle eastern or muslim so to you know indians and latinos everyone if you 're brown 
 here 's my advice to my brown friends 
 the next time you 're on an airplane in the us  just speak your mother tongue that way no one knows what you 're saying life goes on 
 granted some mother tongues might sound a little threatening to the average american if you 're walking down the aisle speaking
  arabic you might freak them out 
  what 's he talking about the key to my arab brothers and sisters is to throw in random good words to put people at ease as you 're walking down the aisle just as you 're walking down
  going to hijack the plane with some ice cream thank you very much have a good night thank you
