  but the doctor who delivered me was he cut my mom six different times in six different directions  
 suffocating poor little me in the process  
 as a result i have cerebral palsy  which means i shake all the time look  
 it 's exhausting  i 'm like shakira shakira meets muhammad ali
  is not genetic  it 's not a birth defect you can 't catch it no one put a curse on my mother 's uterus  and i didn 't get it because my parents are first cousins  which they are 
 it only happens from accidents like what happened to me
  i don 't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me because at some point in your life you have dreamt of being disabled  
 come on a journey with me  it 's christmas eve you 're at the mall you 're driving around in circles looking for parking  and what
  got to tell you i 've got ninety nine problems and palsy is just one if there was an oppression olympics i would win
  cliffside park new jersey is my hometown  i have always loved the fact that my hood and my
  share the same initials i also love the fact that if i wanted to walk from my house to new york city i could a
 lot of people with cp don 't walk  
 but my parents didn 't believe in can 't my father 's mantra was you can do it  yes you can can 
 so if my three older sisters were mopping
  i was mopping  if my three older sisters went to public school  my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that i went too and if we didn 't all get a 's we all got my mother 's slipper 
 my father taught me how to walk when i was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking 
 another tactic that he used is he would dangle
  by the first day of kindergarten i was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times 
 growing up there were only six arabs in my town  and they were all my family 
 now there are twenty arabs in town and they are still all my family
  think anyone even noticed we weren 't italian 
 this was before nine eleven and before politicians thought it 
  was appropriate to use i hate muslims as a campaign slogan 
  i would starve to death during ramadan 
 i would explain to them that i have enough fat to live off of for three whole months so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake 
 i have tap danced on broadway  yeah on broadway it 's crazy 
 my parents couldn 't afford physical therapy so they sent me to dancing school i learned how to dance in heels which means i can
  walk in heels  and i 'm from jersey  and we are really concerned with being chic so if my friends wore heels  so did  i 
 and when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the jersey shore i did not 
 i spent my summers in a war zone because my parents were afraid that if we didn 't go back to palestine every single summer we 'd grow up to be madonna
 summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to 
  heal me  so i drank deer 's milk  i had hot cups on my back  i was dunked in the dead sea  and i remember the water burning my eyes and thinking it 's working
  miracle cure we did find was yoga  
 i have to tell you it 's very boring  but before i did yoga i was a stand up comedian who can 't stand up  
 and now i can stand on
 my parents reinforced this notion that i could do
  that no dream was impossible and my dream was to be on the daytime soap opera general hospital 
 i went to college during affirmative action and got a sweet scholarship to asu arizona state university because i fit every single quota 
 i was like
 the pet lemur of the theater department everybody loved me 
  every time i did a scene from the glass menagerie my professors would weep  but i never got cast 
 finally my senior year asu decided to do a show called they dance real slow in jackson it 's a play about a girl with cp  i was a girl with cp  
 so i start shouting from the rooftops
  'm finally going to get a part i have cerebral palsy  free at last  free at last  thank god almighty i 'm free at last 
 i didn 't get the part 
 sherry brown got the part  
 i went racing to the head of the theater department crying hysterically like someone shot my cat to ask her why and she said it was because they didn 't think i could do the stunts
  i said excuse me  if i can 't do the stunts neither can the character 
 this was a part that i was literally born to play
 they gave it
 hollywood has a sordid history of casting able bodied actors to play disabled onscreen  
 upon graduating  i moved back home 
 and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera  my dream was coming true  and i knew that i would be promoted from diner diner
  but instead i remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head 
 and it became clear to me that casting directors didn 't hire fluffy ethnic disabled actors they only hired perfect people but there were exceptions to the rule 
 i grew up watching whoopi goldberg roseanne barr ellen and all of these women had one thing in common they were comedians  so i became a comic
 applause my first gig was driving famous 
  comics from new york city to shows in new jersey and i 'll never forget the face of the first comic i ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the new jersey turnpike with a chick with cp driving
  all over america  and i 've also performed in arabic in the middle east  uncensored and uncovered 
 some people say i 'm the first stand up comic in the arab world i never like to claim first  but i do know that they never heard that nasty little rumor that women aren 't funny  and they find us hysterical
  in two thousand and three  my brother from another mother and father dean obeidallah and i started the new york  arab american comedy festival now in its 10th year  
 our goal was to change the negative image of arab americans in media while also reminding casting directors that south asian and arab are not synonymous
 mainstreaming arabs was much much easier than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability 
 my big break came in two thousand and ten  i was invited to be a guest on the cable news show countdown with keith olbermann 
 i walked in looking like i was going to the prom  and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me
  on a spinning  rolling chair 
 so i looked at the stage manager and i 'm like excuse me  can i have another chair and she looked at me and she went five four three two and we were live 
 so i had to grip onto the anchor 's desk so that i wouldn 't roll off the screen
 during the segment 
 and when the interview was over i was livid  i had finally gotten my chance and i blew it  and i knew i would never get invited back 
 but not only did mr olbermann invite me back he made me a full time contributor and he taped down my chair 
 one fun fact i learned while on the air with keith olbermann was that humans on the internet are
  scumbags 
 people say children are cruel but i was never made fun of as a child or an adult  
 suddenly my disability on the world wide web is fair game i would look at clips online and see comments like
  should really pray for her 
 one commenter even suggested that i add my disability to my credits screenwriter  comedian palsy
 disability is as visual as race if a wheelchair user can 't play 
  people with disabilities are the largest minority in the world and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment 
 the doctors said that i wouldn 't walk  but i am here in front of you  
 however if i grew up with social media  i don 't think i would be i hope that together we
  can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life  
 perhaps if there were more positive images it would foster less hate on the internet 
 or maybe not maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well  
 my crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places i got to walk the red
  carpet flanked by soap diva susan lucci and the iconic 
  loreen arbus i got to act in a movie with adam sandler and work with my idol the amazing dave matthews i toured the world as a headliner on arabs gone wild 
 i was a delegate representing the great state of new jersey at the two thousand and eight dnc  and i founded
  maysoon 's kids a charity that hopes to give palestinian refugee children a sliver of the chance my parents gave me  
 but the one moment that stands out the most was when i got before this moment 
 but the one moment that stands out the most was when i got
  to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a
 bee has parkinson 's and shakes just like me  muhammad ali 
 it was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live  and i dedicate this talk
  to his memory
