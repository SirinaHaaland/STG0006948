  the very word for many of you conjures unhappy memories of boredom in high school biology or physics class 
 but let me assure that what you did there had very little to do with science that was really the what of science  it was the history of what
 other people had discovered 
 what i 'm most interested in as a scientist is the how of science 
 because science is knowledge in process  we make an observation  guess an explanation for that observation  and then make a prediction that we can test with an experiment or other observation a
 couple of examples
  first of all people noticed that the earth was below the sky above and both the sun and the moon seemed to go around them  
 their guessed explanation was that the earth must be the center of the universe  the prediction everything should circle around the earth  
 this was first really tested when galileo got his hands on one of the first telescopes and as he gazed into the night sky 
 what he found there was a planet jupiter 
 with
  moons circling around it  
 he then used those moons to follow the path of jupiter and found that jupiter also was not going around the earth but around the sun 
 so the prediction test failed  
 and this led to the discarding of the theory that the earth was the center of the universe  another example  sir isaac newton noticed
  that things fall to the earth  the guessed explanation was gravity  
 the prediction that everything should fall to the earth but of course not everything does fall to the earth  
 so did we discard gravity
 no we revised the theory and said  gravity pulls things to the earth unless there is an equal and opposite force in the other direction
  this led us to learn something new  
 we began to pay more attention to the bird and the bird 's wings and just think of all the discoveries that have flown from that line of thinking  
 so the test failures the exceptions  the outliers teach us what we don 't know and lead us
  this is how science moves forward this is how science learns  
 sometimes in the media and even more rarely but sometimes even scientists will say that something or other has been scientifically proven  
 but i hope that you understand that science never proves anything definitively forever  
 hopefully science remains curious enough to look for
 and humble enough to recognize when we have found
 the next outlier  the next exception  which  like jupiter 's moons  teaches us what we don 't actually know we
 're going to change gears here for a second 
 the caduceus or the symbol of medicine means a lot of different things to different people but most of our public discourse on medicine really turns it into an engineering problem we have the hallways of congress and the boardrooms of insurance
  companies that try to figure out how to pay for it  
 the ethicists and epidemiologists try to figure out how best to distribute medicine 
 and the hospitals and physicians are absolutely obsessed with their protocols and checklists trying to figure out how best to safely apply medicine 
 these are all good things 
 however they also all
  all assume at some level that the textbook of medicine is closed  
 we start to measure the quality of our health care by how quickly we can access it it
 doesn 't surprise me that in this climate many of our institutions for the provision of health care start to look a heck of a lot like jiffy lube 
 the only problem is that when i graduated from medical school  
 i didn 't get one of those little doohickeys that your mechanic has to plug into your car and
  find out exactly what 's wrong with it because the textbook of medicine is not closed 
 medicine is science medicine is knowledge in process  
 we make an observation  we guess an explanation of that observation  and then we make a prediction that we can test now
 the testing ground of most predictions in medicine is populations and you may remember from
  those boring days in biology class that populations tend to distribute around a mean as a gaussian or a normal curve  therefore in medicine after we make a prediction from a guessed explanation we test it in a population 
 that means that what we know in medicine our knowledge and our
  from populations
 but extends only as far as the next outlier  
 the next exception  which  like jupiter 's moons will teach us what we don 't actually know  
 now i am a surgeon who looks after patients with sarcoma  sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer it
 's the cancer of flesh and bones  
 and i would tell you that every one of my patients is an outlier is an exception
  there is no surgery i have ever performed for a sarcoma patient that has ever been guided by a randomized controlled clinical trial what we consider the best kind of  population based evidence in medicine  
 people talk about thinking outside the box but we don 't even have a box in sarcoma  what we do have as we take a bath in the uncertainty and unknowns and exceptions and outliers that surround us in sarcoma
  is easy access to what i think are those two most important values for any science  humility and curiosity 
 because if i am humble and curious when a patient asks me a question  and i don 't know the answer i
 'll ask a colleague who may have a similar albeit distinct patient with sarcoma we
  even establish international collaborations those patients will start to talk to each other through chat rooms and support groups  
 it 's through this kind of humbly curious communication
 that we begin to try and learn new things 
 as an example this is a patient of mine who had a cancer near his knee 
 because of humbly curious communication in international collaborations we have learned that we can repurpose the ankle to serve as the knee when we have
  to remove the knee with the cancer  he can then wear a prosthetic and run and jump and play 
 this opportunity was available to him because of international collaborations  it was desirable to him because he had contacted other patients who had experienced it  
 and so exceptions and outliers in
  teach us what we don 't know but also lead us to new thinking  
 now very importantly all the new thinking that outliers and exceptions lead us to in medicine does not only apply to the outliers and exceptions  
 it is not that we only learn from sarcoma patients ways to manage sarcoma patients  
 sometimes the outliers and the exceptions
 teach us things that matter quite a lot to the general population
  like a tree standing outside a forest the outliers and the exceptions draw our attention
 and lead us into a much greater sense of perhaps what a tree is we often talk about losing the forests for the trees but one also loses a tree within a forest  
 but the tree that stands out by itself makes those relationships that define a tree the relationships between trunk and
  roots and branches  much more apparent 
 even if that tree is crooked or even if that tree has very unusual relationships between trunk and roots and branches  it nonetheless draws our attention
 and allows us to make observations that we can then test in the general population  i told you that sarcomas are rare 
  they make up about one percent of all cancers you also probably know that cancer is considered a genetic disease 
 by genetic disease we mean that cancer is caused by oncogenes that are turned on in cancer and tumor suppressor genes that are turned off to cause cancer 
 you might think that we learned about oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes from common cancers like breast cancer and prostate cancer and lung cancer  but you 'd be
  and tumor suppressor genes for the first time in that itty bitty little one percent of cancers called sarcoma 
 in one thousand nine hundred and sixty six peyton rous got the nobel prize for realizing that chickens had a transmissible form of sarcoma  
 thirty years later  harold varmus and mike bishop discovered what that transmissible element was it was a virus
  i will not tell you that src is the most important oncogene i will not tell you that src is the most frequently turned on oncogene in all of cancer  
 but it was the first oncogene  
 the exception  the outlier drew our attention and led us to something
 that taught us very important things about the rest of
  is the most important tumor suppressor gene  it is the most frequently turned off tumor suppressor gene in almost every kind of cancer  
 but we didn 't learn about it from common cancers we learned about it when doctors li and fraumeni were looking at families and they realized that these families had way too many sarcomas  
 i told you that sarcoma is rare remember that a one in a million diagnosis if it happens twice in one family
 is way too common in that family  the very fact that these are rare draws our attention
 and leads us to new kinds of thinking  
 now many of you may say  and may rightly say that yeah kevin that 's great  but you 're not talking about a bird 's wing you 're not talking about moons floating around some planet jupiter  
 this is a person
  this outlier this exception may lead to the advancement of science but this is a person 
 and all i can say is that i know that all too well  
 i have conversations with these patients with rare and deadly diseases 
 i write about these conversations these conversations are terribly fraught they 're fraught with horrible phrases like i have bad news or there 's nothing more we can do
 sometimes these conversations turn on a single word terminal 
 silence can also be rather uncomfortable 
 where the blanks are in medicine
 can be just as important as the words that we use in these conversations what are the unknowns what are the experiments that
  being done 
 do this little exercise with me up there on the screen you see this phrase no where notice where the blank is 
 if we move that blank one space over no where 
 becomes now here the exact opposite meaning  just by shifting the blank
  never forget the night that i walked into one of my patients ' rooms 
 i had been operating long that day but i still wanted to come and see him  
 he was a boy i had diagnosed with a bone cancer a few days before 
 he and his mother had been meeting with the chemotherapy doctors earlier that day and he had been admitted to the hospital to begin chemotherapy  it was almost midnight when i got to his room  
  but i found his mother reading by flashlight next to his bed she came out in the hall to chat with me for a few minutes it
 turned out that what she had been reading was the protocol that the chemotherapy doctors had given her that day  she had memorized it 
 she said dr jones you told me that we don 't always win
 with this type of cancer
  but i 've been studying this protocol and i think i can do it 
 i think i can comply with these very difficult treatments  
 i 'm going to quit my job i 'm going to move in with my parents i 'm going to keep my baby safe 
 i didn 't tell her  i didn 't stop to correct her thinking  she was trusting in
  if complied with wouldn 't necessarily save her son  
 i didn 't tell her  i didn 't fill in that blank but a year and a half later
 her boy nonetheless died of his cancer  should i have told her now many of you may say so what i don 't
  no one in my family has sarcoma  and this is all fine and well but
 it probably doesn 't matter in my life and you 're probably right sarcoma may not matter a whole lot in your life  
 but where the blanks are in medicine
 does matter in your life  
 i didn 't tell you one dirty little secret  i told you that in medicine we test predictions in populations 
 but i didn 't tell you and so often medicine never tells you that every time
 an individual encounters medicine even if that individual is firmly embedded in the general population  
 neither the individual nor the physician knows where in that population the individual will land  
 therefore every encounter with medicine is an experiment you will be a subject in an experiment  
  outcome will be either a better or a worse result for you as long as medicine works well  we 're fine with
 fast service  bravado brimmingly confident conversations  
 but when things don 't work well  sometimes we want something different 
 a colleague of mine removed a tumor from a patient 's limb  he was concerned about this
  tumor in our physician conferences he talked about his concern that this was a type of tumor that had a high risk for coming back in the same limb  
 but his conversations with the patient were exactly what a patient might want  brimming with confidence he said i got it all and you 're good to go she and her husband were thrilled they went out 
  opened a bottle of champagne the
 only problem was a few weeks later she started to notice another nodule in the same area it
 turned out he hadn 't gotten it all and she wasn 't good to go  but what happened at this juncture absolutely fascinates me 
 my colleague came to me and said kevin  would you mind looking after this patient for me 
 i said why you know the right thing to do as well as i do you haven 't done anything wrong
 look after this patient for me 
 he was embarrassed not by what he had done  
 but by the conversation that he had had by the overconfidence  
 so i performed a much more invasive surgery and had a very different conversation with the patient afterwards i said most likely
 i 've gotten it all and you 're most likely good to go  but this is the experiment that we 're doing  
 this is what you 're going to watch for  this is what i 'm going to watch for and we 're going to work together to find out if this surgery will work
 to get rid of your cancer i can guarantee you she and her husband did not crack another bottle of champagne after talking to me  
 but she was now a scientist not only a subject in her experiment
 and so i encourage you to seek humility and curiosity in your physicians 
 almost twenty billion times each year a person walks into a doctor 's office 
 and that person becomes a patient 
 you or someone you love will be that patient sometime very soon how will you talk to your
  doctors what will you tell them  what will they tell you 
 they cannot tell you
 what they do not know  but they can tell you when they don 't know
 if only you 'll ask so please  join the conversation thank you
