  so i 'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills and why this is an incredibly important  long  oily hot summer and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted 
 but before i talk about the political chemistry
  actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil  this is a photograph from when i visited
 prudhoe bay in alaska in two thousand and two to watch the minerals management service testing
 their ability to burn oil spills in ice  and what you see here is you see a little bit of crude oil you see some ice cubes and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm the 
 napalm is burning there quite nicely  and the thing is is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the american consumer we 're four percent of the world
  population we use twenty five percent of the world 's oil production and we don 't really understand what oil is  until you check out its molecules and you don 't really understand that until you see this stuff 
  burn so this is what happens as that burn gets going it takes off it 's a big woosh  i highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday because you will never need to hear another
  retinas so there it is the retinas are baking let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil  oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules it starts of with the very 
  small ones which are one carbon four hydrogen that 's methane it just floats off then there 's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon you 've probably heard of benzene rings they 're very
  and it goes all the way over to these big thick galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons and they have thousands of hydrogens and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them  those are called the asphaltenes they 're an ingredient in asphalt they 're very important in oil spills 
 let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water it is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous oil doesn 't sink
  if it sank it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill  and the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water it spreads out to be really thin so you have a hard time corralling it the next thing that happens is
 the light ends evaporate and some of the toxic things float into the water column and and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that and shrimp 
  and then the asphaltenes and this is the crucial thing the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion
  something like mayonnaise it triples the amount of of oily messy goo that you have in the water  and it makes it very hard to handle it also makes it very viscous 
  when the prestige sank off the coast of spain there were big floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil with the consistency or the viscosity of chewing gum it 's incredibly hard to clean up and every single oil is different when it hits water
  when the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics it 's absolutely explosive for the first time  american consumers will kind of see the oil 
 supply chain in front of themselves  they have a eureka moment when we suddenly understand oil in a different context 
  nobody gets up in the morning and thinks wow i 'm going to go buy some
 molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work no they think ugh i
 have to go buy gas i 'm so angry about it the oil companies are ripping me off they set the prices and i don 't even know i am helpless over this and this is what happens to us at the gas pump and actually gas 
  pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger  you might notice that many gas pumps including this one are designed to look like
 atms i 've talked to engineers that 's specifically to diffuse our anger because supposedly we feel good about atms that
 shows you how bad it is but actually i mean this feeling of helplessness comes in because most americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy not of of the
 vicissitudes of the world
  is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume which is somewhat reasonable because in fact  we have designed this system where  
 if you want to get a job  
 it 's much more important to have a car that runs to have a job and keep a job than to have a ged and that 's actually very perverse now there 's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas which is that we 'd rather be doing anything
  this is bp 's gas station in downtown los angeles 
 it is green it is a shrine to greenishness now you think why would something so lame work on people so smart well the reason is is because when we 're buying 
  gas we 're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance i mean we 're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else we don 't want to be buying oil we want to be doing something green  and we get kind of in on our own con
  funny it looks funny here but in fact that 's why the slogan beyond petroleum worked but 
  it 's an inherent part of our energy policy  which is we don 't talk about reducing the amount of oil that we use we talk about energy independence we talk about hydrogen cars we talk about biofuels that haven 't been invented yet  
 and so cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil and it 's really important to dealing with this oil spill
 okay so the politics of of oil are very moral in the united states  the oil industry is like a huge gigantic octopus of of engineering 
  and finance and everything else  but we actually see it in very moral terms this is an early on photograph you can see we had these gushers
  but they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing  they weren 't farmers they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground it 's the beverly hillbillies basically  but in the beginning this was seen as a very morally problematic thing  long before it became funny
  and then of course there was john d rockefeller and the thing about john d is that he went into this chaotic wild east of oil industry and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company a multinational it was terrifying you think
  walmart is a terrifying business model now imagine what this looked like in the 
 and it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy but what 's really amazing is that
 ida tarbell the journalist went in and did a big expos of rockefeller and actually got the whole antitrust laws put in place
  but in many ways
  image of the conspiracy still sticks with us and here 's one of the things that
 that ida tarbell said she said 
 he has a thin nose like a thorn there were no lips there were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them 
 laughter okay so that guy is actually still with us 
  i mean this is a very pervasive this is part of our dna  and then then there 's this guy  okay  so you might be wondering why it is that every time we have high oil prices or an oil 
  spill we call these ceos down to washington  and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them 
  we look at it on a moral level  rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level  and so i 'm not saying these guys aren 't liable to answer questions i 'm just saying that when you focus on whether 
  they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards you don 't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate or you 're going to get around to
  this is kind of a distraction  but it makes for good theater and it 's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week
  so the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing  i mean these pictures this is from the santa barbara spill you have these pictures of birds they really influence people when the santa barbara spill happened
  it formed the environmental movement in its modern form it started earth day  it also
 put in place the national environmental policy act  the clean air act the clean water act everything that we are really stemmed from this period 
 i think it 's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us here we are normally we 're standing at the gas pump and we 're feeling kind of helpless we look at these pictures and we understand for the first time our role in this supply chain we connect the
  dots in the supply chain and we have this
 kind of as as voters we have kind of a eureka moment  
 this is why these moments of these oil spills are so important  
 but it 's also really important that we don 't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it we actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem 
 one of the things that
  happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms we were very reactive as opposed to being proactive about what happened and so what we did 
  was actually we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling we stopped drilling in anwr but we didn 't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed 
 in fact it 's continued to increase the only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices as you can see our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten
  old and expensive to drill out we only have two percent of the world 's oil reserves
 sixty five percent of them are in the persian gulf one of the things that 's happened because of this is that  since one thousand nine 
 the country of nigeria or the part of nigeria that pumps oil which is the delta which is two times the size of maryland has had thousands of oil spills a year i mean we 've
  essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations 
 that has been the equivalent of an exxon valdez spill every year since one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine and we can wrap our heads around the spills because that 's what we see here  but in fact 
 these guys actually live in a war zone there 's a thousand battle related deaths a year in this area twice the size of of maryland and it 's all related to the oil and these
  if they were in the u s they might be actually here in this room they have degrees in political science degrees in business they 're entrepreneurs they don 't actually want to be doing what they 're doing and
 it 's sort of one of the other
 the other groups of people who pay a price for us 
 the other thing that we 've done as we 've continued to increase demand is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs one of the places
 we put in a big oil
 project in chad with exxon so the u s taxpayer paid for it the world bank exxon paid for it we put it in there was a tremendous banditry problem i was there in two thousand and three we were driving along this dark 
 dark road  
 and the guy in the green stepped out and i was just like ahhh this is it
  and then the guy in the in the exxon
 uniform stepped out and we realized it was okay they have their own private sort of army around them at the oil
  but at the same time 
 chad has become much more unstable and we are not paying for that price at the pump we pay for it in our taxes on april 15th 
 we do the same thing with the price of of policing the persian gulf and keeping the shipping lanes open this is one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight we actually bombed two iranian oil platforms that year that was the beginning of an escalating u s involvement there that we do not pay for at
  we pay for it on april 15th and we can 't even calculate the cost of this involvement 
 the other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the gulf of mexico which was not part of the moratoriums now 
  what 's happened in the gulf of mexico as you can see this is the minerals management diagram of of wells for gas and oil it 's become this intense industrialized zone  it doesn 't have the same resonance for us that the arctic national wildlife refuge has but it should i mean it 's a bird sanctuary also
  every time you buy gasoline in the united states half of it is actually being refined along the coast because the gulf actually has about fifty percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals 
  as well  so the people of the gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less clean environment  
  now on the one hand the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil  but on the other hand  the fact that people have no other transit options means that 
  they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work generally in a fairly crummy car if you look at people who make $ fifty thousand a year they have two kids 
  happens at the at the  50th percentile around eighty thousand  gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the american economy
  but they 're also a drain on individual families and it 's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher so what i 'm going to talk to you about
 now is what do we have to do this time what are the laws what do we have to do to keep ourselves focused one thing is we need to stay away from the theater we need to stay
  away from the moratoriums we need to focus really back again on the molecules the moratoriums are fine  but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil  
 one of the things that we also need to do is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world before you reduce the amount of oil that we use we 
  need to focus on reducing the oil  what you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in
  the u s economy it comes in on the side the useful stuff is the dark gray  and the un useful stuff which is called the rejected energy
 the waste goes up to the top now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount 
 and one of the things that we need to do is not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient but we also need to fix the economy in general we need to remove the perverse incentives to
  use more fuel for example we have an insurance system where the person who drives twenty thousand miles a year pays the same insurance as somebody who drives three thousand  we actually encourage 
  people to drive more we have policies that reward sprawl we have all kinds of policies we need to have more mobility choices 
  year into something that allows middle class people to find better ways to commute  whether that 's getting a much more efficient car and and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road this is where we need to be 
 we need to kind of rationalize this whole thing  and you can find more about this policy it 's called strong which is secure transportation
  the idea is instead of being helpless we need to be more strong  they 're up  at newamerica net what 's important about these is that we try to move
 from feeling helpless at the pump to actually being active
 and to really sort of thinking about who we are having kind of that that special moment where we connect the dots actually at the pump  
 now supposedly oil taxes are the third rail of american politics the no fly zone  i actually i agree that a dollar
 a gallon on oil is probably too much but i think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline and upped it to six cents next year  nine cents the following year 
 all the way up to thirty cents by two thousand and twenty that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption and at the same time we would give people time to prepare time to
  and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time  let me give you a little sense of how this would work  
 this is a gas receipt  hypothetically for a year from now the first thing that you have on the tax is you have a tax for a stronger america thirty three cents so you 're not helpless at the 
  pump and the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack and what it says is the national academy of sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates
 twenty nine cents in health care costs that 's a lot  
 and so this you can see that you 're paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax and also  the hope is that you
 you start to be connected to the whole greater system and at the same time you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting or
  a different kind of car or whatever it is you 're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence 
 with this whole sort of suite of policies we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption or our oil consumption by twenty percent by two thousand and twenty so three million barrels a day  
 but in order to do this one of the things we really need to do is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon we need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get
  distracted by the theater  not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there we need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules  thank you
