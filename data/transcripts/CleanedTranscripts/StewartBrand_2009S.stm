  i really should establish my green credentials 
 when i was a small boy i took my pledge as an american to save and faithfully defend from waste the natural resources of my country its air soil
  for a while and then worked for the jerry brown administration  
 the brown administration and a bunch of my friends basically leveled the energy efficiency of california so it 's the same now thirty years later even though
 our economy has gone up eighty percent per capita and we are putting out less greenhouse gasses
  than any other state california is basically the equivalent of europe in this this year whole earth catalog
 has a supplement that i 'll preview today called whole earth discipline 
 the dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on
  be about eighty percent urban and that 's mostly
 in the developing world where that 's happening 
 it 's interesting because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities the developing world now has all of the biggest cities  and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries  and nine times bigger it 's
 qualitatively different they
 are the drivers of history as we see by looking at history one thousand years ago this is what the world looked like
  well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had one thousand years ago in other words the rise of the west
 dramatic as it was is over 
 the aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming 
 one point three million people a week coming to town decade after decade 
 what 's really going on well what 's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out
  subsistence farming is drying up basically people are
 following opportunity into town  and this is why i used to have a very romantic idea about villages and it 's because i never lived in one 
 because in town
 this is the bustling squatter city of kibera  near nairobi they see action they see opportunity they see a cash economy that
  were not able to participate in back in the subsistence farm 
 as you go around these places there 's plenty of aesthetics there is plenty going on they are poor but they are intensely urban 
 and they are intensely creative  the aggregate numbers now
 are that basically squatters all one billion of them are building the urban world
 which means they 're building the world
 personally one by one family by family clan by clan neighborhood by neighborhood  
 they start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by they even build their own infrastructure  well  steal
 their own infrastructure  at first  cable tv water  the whole gamut all gets stolen  and then gradually gentrifies  
 it is not the case that slums undermine prosperity not the working slums  they help create prosperity
  so in a town like mumbai which is half slums it 's one 6th of the gdp of india 
 social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense 
 these people are valuable as a group and that 's how they work there
 is a lot of people who think about all these poor people oh there 's terrible things we 've got to fix their housing it used to be oh we 've got to get them phone service
  us how they do their phone service  famine mostly is a rural event now there are things they care about 
 and this is where we can help  
 and the nations they 're in can help  and they are helping each other solve these issues and
 you go to a nice dense place like this slum in mumbai  you look at that lane on the right  and you can ask okay what 's going on there the answer is
  is better than a mall  it 's much denser  it 's much more interactive  and the scale is terrific 
 the main event is these are not people crushed by poverty these are people busy getting out of poverty just as fast as they can they 're helping each other do it 
 they 're doing it through an outlaw thing the informal
  the informal economy it 's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics it 's not supposed to be there but it 's huge we don 't understand how it works yet  
 but we have to furthermore people in the informal economy the gray economy as time goes by  
 crime is happening around them and they can join the criminal world  
 or they can join
 the legitimate world we should be able to make that choice easier for them to get toward the legitimate world because if we don 't
  will go toward the criminal world  
 there 's all kinds of activity 
 in dharavi the slum performs not only a lot of services for itself but it performs services for the city at large and one of the main events
 are these ad hoc schools parents
 pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private  tiny
  education is more possible in the cities and that changes the world so
 you see some interesting  typical urban things so one thing slammed up against another  such as in sao paulo here  that 's what cities do that 's how they create value is by slamming things together in this case supply right next to demand
 so the maids and the gardeners and the guards that live in this lively part of town on the left walk to work in the boring rich neighborhood
  is amazing 
 we are learning about how dense proximity can be 
 connectivity between the city and the country
  this is what makes cities so green in the developing world  because people leave the poverty trap an ecological disaster of subsistence farms and head to town
  they 're gone the natural environment starts to come back very rapidly and those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops to send food to the new growing markets in town  
 so if you want to save a village you do it with a good road or with a good cell phone connection and ideally some grid electrical power  
 so the event is we 're a city
  that just happened more than half the numbers are considerable a billion live in the squatter cities now another billion is expected
 that 's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way  and that will determine a lot of how we function 
 now for us environmentalists  maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb people get into town  the immediately have
  even have to get rich yet just the opportunity of
 coming up in the world means they will have fewer higher quality kids  and the birthrate goes down radically 
 very interesting side effect here here 's a slide from phillip longman 
 shows what is happening as we have more and more old people like me and fewer and fewer babies  
 and they are regionally separated what you 're getting is a world which is
  old cities 
 going around doing things the old way in the north and young people in brand new cities they 're inventing doing new things in the south 
 where do you think the action is going to be  
 shift of subject  quickly drop by climate 
 the climate news i 'm sorry to say is going to keep getting worse than we think  faster than we think climate is a profoundly complex nonlinear
 runaway positive feedbacks hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points here 's just a few samples 
 we 're going to keep being surprised  and almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones from your standpoint this means a great increase in climate refugees
 over the coming decades and what goes along with that which is resource wars and chaos wars as we 're seeing
  that 's what drought does it brings carrying capacity down and there 's not enough
 carrying capacity to support the people and then you 're in trouble  shift to the power situation
  baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city or a city planet  so far there is only three sources of baseload
 electricity coal some gas
  nuclear and hydro 
 of those only nuclear and hydro are green 
 coal is what is causing the climate problems  and everyone will keep burning it because it 's so cheap until governments make it expensive 
 wind and solar can 't help because so far we don 't have a way to store that energy 
 so with hydro maxed out coal and lose the climate or nuclear
 which is the current operating low carbon source  and maybe save the climate  and if we can eventually get good solar
 in space that also could help because remember  this is what drives
 the prosperity in the developing world in the villages and in the cities so between coal and nuclear compare their waste
  all of the electricity you used in your lifetime
 was nuclear the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a coke can 
 whereas a coal burning plant a normal one gigawatt coal plant burns eighty rail cars of coal a day each car having one hundred tons  
 and it puts eighteen thousand tons of
 carbon dioxide in the air  so and then when you compare the lifetime emissions of these various energy forms nuclear is about even with
  solar and wind and
 ahead of solar oh i 'm
 sorry with hydro and wind and ahead of solar 
 and does nuclear really compete with coal just ask the coal miners in australia  
 that 's where you see some of the source not from my fellow environmentalists  but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power  
 well the good news is that the developing world but frankly the whole world is busy building and starting to build nuclear reactors
 this is good for the atmosphere it 's good for their prosperity  
 i want to point out one interesting thing which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower it 's supposed to be i don 't
 know local solar and wind and cogeneration and good things like that but frankly 
  which are just now coming on might serve even better the russians who started this are building floating
  to the standard big iron of an ordinary westinghouse or ariva  
 which is one point two one point six billion watts  these things are way smaller
  they 're much more adaptable here 's an american design from lawrence livermore lab 
 here 's another american design that came out of los alamos and is now commercial almost all of these are not only small 
 typically buried in the ground  and the innovation is moving very rapidly so i think microreactors is going to be important for the future 
 in terms of proliferation nuclear energy has done more to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other
  activity  and that 's why ten percent of the electricity
 in this room twenty percent of electricity in this room is probably nuclear half of that is coming from dismantled
 warheads from russia soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads 
 and so i would like to see the gnep program that was developed in the bush administration go forward aggressively  and i was glad to see that president obama
  supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy when he spoke in prague the other week 
 one more subject  genetically engineered food crops 
 in my view as a biologist have no reason to be controversial my fellow environmentalists on this subject have been irrational anti scientific and very harmful  
 despite their best efforts  genetically engineered crops are the most rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history
 they 're good for the environment because they enable no till farming which leaves the soil in place getting healthier from year to year slso keeps less
 carbon dioxide going from the soil into the atmosphere
 they reduce pesticide use  and they increase yield which allows you to have your agricultural area be smaller  and therefore more wild area is freed
  this map from two thousand and six is out of date because it shows africa
 still under the thumb of greenpeace and friends of the earth from
 europe  and they 're finally getting out from under that and biotech is moving rapidly in africa at last 
 this is a moral issue the nuffield council on bioethics met on this issue twice in great detail and said it is a moral imperative
 to make genetically engineered crops readily available speaking of imperatives geoengineering is taboo now especially in
  government circles though i think there was a darpa meeting on it a couple of weeks ago  but it will be on your plate not this year but
 pretty soon 
 because some harsh realizations are coming along this is a list of them basically the news is going to keep getting more scary  there will be events 
 like thirty five thousand people dying of a heat
  which happened a while back like cyclones coming up toward bangladesh 
 like wars over water  such as in the indus  
 and as those events keep happening we 're going to say okay what can we do about that really but there 's this little problem with geoengineering 
 what body is going to decide
 who gets to engineer how much they do where they do it because everybody is downstream downwind of whatever is done
  and if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization  but if
 we just say ok china  you 're worried you go ahead you geoengineer your way we 'll geoengineer our way 
 that would be considered an act of war by both nations 
 so this is very interesting diplomacy coming along  i
  it is more practical than people think here is an example that climatologists like a lot one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas this one came from the sulfur dioxide from mount pinatubo 
 cooled the earth by half a degree 
 there was so much ice in one thousand nine hundred and ninety two the following year that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs who were known as the pinatubo cubs to put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year  
 that 's nothing
 compared to all of the other things we may be trying to do about energy just to run by another one this is a plan to brighten
 the reflectance of ocean clouds by atomizing seawater  that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet a nice one because it can happen lots of little ways in lots of little places is by copying the ancient amazon
