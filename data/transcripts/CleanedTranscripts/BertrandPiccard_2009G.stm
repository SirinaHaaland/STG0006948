  i learned a lot of things about ballooning especially at the end of these balloon flights around the world i did with brian jones when i took this picture 
 the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night  and on the other side there was a rising sun
 so you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown you have the 
 for the people who don 't dare to go through the ice there are so many people who prefer to suffer in the ice they know
 instead of taking the risk of going through the ice to see what there is on the other side
 and i think that 's one of the main problems of our society  
 we learn  maybe not the famous ted audience but so many other people learn  
 that the unknown  the doubts the question marks are dangerous  
 and we have to resist to the changes  we have to keep everything under control 
 well the unknown is part of life
  in that sense ballooning is a beautiful metaphor 
 because in the balloon like in life 
 we go very well in unforeseen directions we want to go in a direction but the winds push us in another direction like in life  
 and as long as we fight horizontally  
 against life  
  against what 's happening to us life is a nightmare 
 how do we steer a balloon by understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind
 which all have different direction 
 so then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory in life  or in the balloon we have to change altitude  
  in life that means
 raising to another psychological philosophical spiritual level  
 but how do we do that 
 in ballooning  or in life how do we change altitude  how do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day 
 well in a balloon it 's easy we have ballast  and when we drop the ballast overboard
 we
  all the equipment we don 't need anymore  and i think in life it should be exactly like this you know when people speak about pioneering spirit 
 very often they believe that pioneers are the ones who have new ideas  
 it 's not true  the pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas because new ideas are so easy to have we just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas  
 no  the pioneer is the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast
 habits certainties convictions  exclamation marks 
 paradigms dogmas  and when we are able to do that what happens 
 life is not anymore just one line
 going in one direction
  life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions
 in three dimensions  
 and pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis 
 of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon but in life itself 
 explore this vertical axis that means
 explore all the different ways to do all the different ways to behave all the different ways to think
  before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish  
 this is very practical  this can be in politics  
 this can be in spirituality  this can be in environment in finance in education of children  i deeply believe
 that life is a much greater adventure
 if we manage to do politics
 without the trench
 between the left and the right wing because we will throw away these political dogmas  
 i deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid if we throw overboard
 this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past  and that we can aim for much higher spirituality if we get rid of the religious dogmas  
 throwing overboard as ballast to
  change our direction  well these basically are things i believed in such a long time but actually i had to go around the world in a balloon to be invited to talk about it it
 's clear that it 's not easy to know which ballast to drop
 and which altitude to take sometime we need friends family members
  or a psychiatrist well in balloons we need weather men 
 the one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind at which altitude  in order to help the balloonist but sometimes it 's very paradoxical 
 when brian jones and i were flying around the world  
 the weather man asked us one day to fly quite
  and very slow  and when we calculated we thought we 're never going to make it around the world at that speed 
 so we disobeyed we flew much higher  and double the speed  
 and i was so proud to have found that jetstream that i called the weather man and i told him hey guy don 't you think we 're good pilots up there 
 we fly twice the speed you predicted 
 and he told me don 't do that go down immediately in order to slow
  going to do that we don 't have enough gas to fly so slow 
 and he told me yes but with the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the north pole 
 and then he asked me
 and this is something i will never forget in my life
 he just asked me you 're the good pilot up there what do you really want  you want to go very fast in the wrong direction  or slowly in the good direction
 and this is why you need weathermen  
 this is why you need people with long term vision  
 and this is precisely what fails
 in the political visions we have now in the political governments we are burning as you heard  so
  not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life cannot last for long 
 so we went down actually we slowed down  and we went through moments of fears
 because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel forty five thousand kilometers 
 but we were expected to have doubts we 're
  to have fears and actually this is where the adventure really started 
 when we were flying over the sahara and india it was nice holidays we could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane 
 in the middle of the pacific when you don 't have the good winds  you cannot land  you cannot go back that 's a
 crisis  that 's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking that 's the moment when you have to motivate
  that 's when you throw out all the ballast all the certainties  in order to adapt to the new situation  
 and actually we changed completely our flight plan we changed completely our strategy  and after twenty days we landed successfully in egypt  
 but if i show you this picture it 's not to tell you how happy we were it 's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles  
 we took off with three point seven tons of
  liquid propane  we landed with forty kilos 
 when i saw that i made a promise to myself  
 i made a promise that the next time i would fly around the world  it would be with no fuel 
 independent from fossil energies  in order to be
  not to be threatened by the fuel gauge  i had no idea how it was possible i just thought it 's a dream and i want to do it  
 and when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the air and space museum in washington together with the airplane of charles lindbergh with apollo eleven with the wright brothers ' flyer with chuck yeager 's sixty one 
 i had really a thought then i thought well the 20th century that was brilliant  it allowed to do all those things there
  it will not be possible in the future any more 
 it takes too much energy 
 it will cost too much it will be prohibited because we 'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now  so how can we perpetuate
 this pioneering spirit
 with something that will be independent from fossil energy  and this is when the project solar impulse really started to
  turn in my head  
 and i think it 's a nice metaphor also for the 21st century 
 pioneering spirit should continue  but on another level not to conquer the planet or space 
 not anymore it has been done  but rather to improve the quality of life how can we go through the ice of certainty
 in order to make the most incredible a possible thing
  what is today completely impossible
 get rid of our dependency on fossil energy 
 if you tell to people we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world people will laugh at you except here  where crazy people are invited to speak 
 so the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar powered airplane
  no fuel nobody ever could say in the future that it 's impossible to do it
 for cars for heating systems for computers and so on and so on 
 well solar power airplanes are not new they have flown in the past but without saving capabilities without batteries which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it
 if we want to show the potential we have to fly day and night  
 that means to load the batteries during the flight  in order to spend the night on the batteries 
 and fly the next day again  it has been made already on remote controlled
 little airplane models without pilots but it stays an anecdote because the public couldn 't identify to it
  i think you need a pilot in the plane
 that can talk to the universities that can talk to students talk to politicians during the flight and really make it a human adventure 
 for that unfortunately  four meters wingspan is not enough you need sixty four meter wingspan sixty four meter wingspan to carry one
  the batteries flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency 
 why that because fuel is not easy to replace  that 's for sure  
 and with two hundred square meters of solar power
 on our plane we can produce the same energy than two hundred little lightbulbs  that means a christmas tree a big
  so the question is how can you carry a pilot around the world
 with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big christmas tree 
 people will tell you it 's impossible and that 's exactly why we try to do it  
 we launched the project with my colleague andre borschberg six years ago 
 we have now seventy people in the team working on it  we have gone through the stages
  the construction of the first prototype that has been achieved after two years of work  
 cockpit  propeller  engine just the fuselage here it 's so light it 's not designed by an artist but it could be fifty kilos for the entire fuselage couple of kilos more for the wing spars  
 this is the complete structure of the airplane and one month ago we have unveiled it you
  imagine how it is for a team who has been working six years on it to show that it 's not only a dream and a vision  it 's a real airplane 
 a real airplane that we could finally present  and what 's the goal now the goal is to take off 
 end of this year for the first test  but mainly
  take off on our own power without additional help without being towed climb to nine thousand meters altitude 
 the same time we load the batteries  we run the engines  and when we get at the maximum height  
 we arrive at the beginning of the night  
 and there there will be just one goal just one reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty
  and this is exactly the symbol of our world 
 if our airplane is too heavy if the pilot wastes energy we
 'll never make it through the night  
 and in our world if we keep on spoiling wasting our energy resources if we keep on building things that consume so much energy that most of the companies now go bankrupt 
 it 's clear that we 'll never give the planet to the next
  generation without a major problem 
 so you see that this airplane is more a symbol i don 't think it will transport two hundred people in the next years 
 but when lindbergh crossed the atlantic  the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel  
 and twenty years later there were two hundred people in every airplane crossing the atlantic so we have to start  and show the example
  bit like on this picture here this is a painting from magritte in the museum in holland that i love so much 
 it 's a pipe  and it 's written this is not a pipe 
 this is not an airplane  
 this is a symbol of what we can achieve
 when we believe in the impossible when we have a team  when we have pioneering spirit  and especially when we understand
 that all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard what pleases me very much
 is that in the beginning i thought that we would have to fly around the world
 with no fuel in order to have our message been understood 
 and more and more we 're invited around the world with andre to talk about that project to talk about the symbol of it invited by politicians invited in energy forums
  to show that it 's not anymore completely stupid to think about getting rid of the dependency on fossil energies 
 so through speeches like this one today through interviews through meetings 
 our goal is to get as many people possible on the team  
 the success will not
  fly around the world in a solar powered airplane no  the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life 
 save energy 
 go to renewables  and this is possible you know with the technologies we have today 
 we can save between thirty and fifty percent of the energy of a country in europe  
 and we can solve half of the rest with renewables  it leaves
  or thirty percent for
 oil gas coal  nuclear or whatever  this is acceptable  this is why
 all the people who believe
 in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team you can just go on 
 subscribe to just
 be informed of what we 're doing but much more to get advices to give your comments to spread the word that if it 's possible in the air 
 of course it 's possible in the ground  
 and each time we have
 some ice in the future we have to know that life will be great  and the success will be brilliant
 if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice to go through the obstacle to go through the problem  in order to see what there is on the other side
  so you see this is what we 're doing on our side  everyone has his goal has his dreams has his visions
