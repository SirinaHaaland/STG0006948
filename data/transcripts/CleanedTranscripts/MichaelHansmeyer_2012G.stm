  as an architect  i often ask myself  what is the origin of the forms that we design what kind of forms
 could we design if we wouldn 't work with references anymore  if we had no bias
  if we had no preconceptions 
 what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from from our experience  
 if we could free ourselves from our our education  
 what would these unseen forms look like
 would they surprise us would they intrigue us would they delight us 
 if so then how can we go about creating something that is truly
  i propose we look to nature nature has been called the greatest architect of forms  
 and i 'm not saying that we should copy nature i 'm not saying we should mimic biology 
 instead i propose that we can borrow nature 's processes  we can abstract them and to create something that is new 
 nature 's main process of creation morphogenesis is the splitting of one cell into two cells and these cells can
  be identical  or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division 
 if we abstract this process and simplify it as much as possible  then we could start with a single sheet of paper 
 one surface and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces we
 're free to choose where we make the fold and by doing so we can differentiate the surfaces 
 through this very simple
  process  we can create an astounding variety of forms 
 now we can take this form and use the same process to generate three dimensional structures  
 but rather than than folding things by hand we 'll bring the structure into the computer   and code it as an algorithm  
 and in doing so we can suddenly fold anything
  we can fold a million times faster
 we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations and as we 're seeking to make something three dimensional 
 we start not with a single surface but with a volume a simple volume the cube  
 if we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again 
 then after sixteen iterations sixteen steps  we end up with four hundred thousand surfaces and a shape that looks for instance like this 
 and if we change where we make the folds if we change the folding ratio
  then this cube turns into this one  we can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape  
 or this shape  
 so we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we 're making the fold but essentially you 're looking at a folded cube  
 and we can play with this  we can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions
 we can begin to sculpt the form 
 and because we 're doing the folding on the computer  we are completely free of any physical constraints  
 so that means that surfaces can intersect themselves they can become impossibly small  we can make folds that we otherwise could not make 
 surfaces can become porous they can stretch they can tear  and all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can
  produce but in each case  i didn 't design the form i designed the process that generated the form 
 in general  if we make a small change to the folding ratio  which is what you 're seeing here then the form changes correspondingly  
 but that 's only half of the story ninety nine point nine percent of the folding ratios produce not this
 but this the geometric equivalent of noise 
 the forms that i showed before were made actually through very long trial and error a far more effective way to create forms i have found 
 is to use information that is already contained in forms a very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye so for instance we can plot the length of the edges
  white surfaces have long edges black ones have short ones we can plot the planarity of the surfaces  their curvature  how radial they are
 all information that may not be instantly visible to you  but that we can bring out that we can articulate 
 and that we can use to control the folding so now i 'm not specifying a
  but instead i 'm establishing a rule i 'm establishing a link between a property of a surface
 and how that surface is folded  
 and because i 've designed the process and not the form i can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms
  but the process is a very minimal one there is a simple input it 's always a cube that i start with and it 's a very simple operation it 's making a fold 
 and doing this over and over again  
 so let 's bring this process to architecture  how and at what scale  i chose to design a column columns are architectural archetypes
  they 've been used throughout history to express ideals
 about about beauty about technology 
 a challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column  
 i started using four cylinders through a lot of experimentation these cylinders eventually evolved
 into this  and these columns
 they have information at very many scales  we can begin to zoom into them 
 the closer one gets the more new features one discovers some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility  
 and unlike traditional architecture  it 's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail  
 these forms are undrawable
 an architect who 's
 drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months or it would take even a year to draw all the sections all of the elevations you can only create something like this through an algorithm 
 the more interesting question perhaps is are these forms imaginable usually an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he
  in this case the process is deterministic there 's no randomness involved at all  
 but it 's not entirely predictable  there 's too many surfaces there 's too much detail one can 't see the end state 
 so this leads to a new role for the architect
 one needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there 
 for one thing one can design many variants of
  in parallel and one can cultivate them and to go back to the analogy with nature one can begin to think in terms of populations one can talk about permutations about generations  
 about crossing and breeding to come up with a design 
 and the architect is really he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes  
 but enough of the theory at one point i simply wanted to jump inside this image so to say i bought these
  and blue 3d glasses got up
 very close to the screen but still that wasn 't the same as being able to to walk around and touch things so there was only one possibility to to bring the column out of the computer  
 there 's been a lot of talk now about about 3d printing
 for me or for my purpose at this moment there 's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale
 and resolution and speed  on the other  
 so instead we decided to take the column  and we decided to build it as a layered model made out of very many slices  thinly stacked over each other 
 what you 're looking at here is an x ray of the column that you just saw  viewed from the top unbeknownst to me at the time because we had
  only seen the outside the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves to grow on the inside of the column
 which was quite a surprising discovery from this shape we calculated a cutting line and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter
 to produce and you 're seeing a segment of it here
 very many thin slices individually cut on top of each other 
  and this is a photo now it 's not a rendering  and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer  
 almost all of the details almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved  
 but it was very labor intensive there 's a huge disconnect at the moment still
  the virtual
 and the physical it took me several months to design the column but ultimately it takes the computer about thirty seconds to calculate all of the sixteen million faces 
 the physical model on the other hand
  seven hundred layers one millimeter thick it weighs seven hundred kilos it 's made of sheet that that can cover this entire auditorium  
 and the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here
 to the airport and back again
  but it is increasingly possible machines are getting faster it 's getting less expensive and there 's some promising technological developments just on the horizon 
 these are images from the gwangju biennale  and in this case i used abs plastic to produce the columns  
 we used the bigger faster machine and they have a steel core inside so they they 're
  they can bear loads for once 
 each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns 
 you can see a different column in the mirror if there 's a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion  
 so where does this leave us  i think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects
 begin to think about designing not the object but a process to generate objects i 've shown one simple process that was inspired by
  nature  there 's countless other ones in short  we have no constraints
 instead we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create
 structures at at all scales that we couldn 't even have dreamt up and if i may add at one point we will build them
