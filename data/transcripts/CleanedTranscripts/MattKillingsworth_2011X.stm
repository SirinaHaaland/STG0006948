  people want a lot of things out of life  but i think more than anything else they want happiness  
 aristotle called happiness the chief good the end towards which all other things aim
  according to this view the reason we want a big house
 or a nice car
 or a good job
 isn 't that these things are intrinsically valuable it 's that we expect them to bring us
 happiness  
 now in the last fifty years we americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want we 're richer  we live longer we have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago
  paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically we haven 't actually gotten any happier 
 maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven 't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness  there 's been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself 
 people have been debating the
 causes of happiness for a really long time in fact for thousands of years but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved well
 as with many other domains in life i think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question in fact in the last few years there 's been an explosion in research on happiness 
 for example we 've learned a lot about its demographics how things like income and education gender and marriage relate to it 
 but one of the puzzles this has revealed is that factors like these don 't seem to have a particularly strong effect 
  to make more money rather than less or to graduate from college instead of dropping out  but the differences in happiness tend to be small 
 which leaves the question what are the big causes of happiness  
 i think that 's a question we haven 't really answered yet but i think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents
  it certainly seems that we 're going about our lives that what we 're doing  who we 're with what we 're thinking about have a big influence on our happiness and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult in fact almost impossible for scientists to study 
 a few years ago i came up with a way to study people 's happiness moment to moment as they 're going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world something we 'd never been able to do before called
  it uses the iphone to monitor people 's happiness in real time 
 how does this work basically i send people signals at random points throughout the day  and then i ask them a bunch of questions about their moment to moment experience at the instant just before the signal 
 the idea is that  if we can watch how people 's happiness goes up and down over the course of the day  minute to minute in some cases and try to understand how what people are doing who they 're
  what they 're thinking about and all the other factors that describe our day  how those might relate to those changes in happiness  we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness  
 we 've been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data 
 a lot more data of this kind than i think has ever been collected before over six hundred and fifty thousand real time reports
 from over fifteen thousand people and it 's not just a lot of people it 's a really diverse group people from a wide range of ages from eighteen to late
 80s a wide range of incomes education levels people who are married divorced widowed etc 
 they collectively represent every one of eighty six occupational categories and hail from over eighty countries 
 what i 'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we 've been investigating and that
  as human beings we have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present this guy is sitting here working on his computer  and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month 
 wondering what he 's going to have for dinner  maybe he 's worried that he 's going bald 
 this ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing  it allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can  
  not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness  
 you 've probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present be here now you 've probably heard a hundred times 
 maybe to really be happy we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment maybe these people are right maybe mind wandering is a bad thing 
 on the other hand when our minds wander they 're unconstrained
  can 't change the physical reality in front of us but we can go anywhere in our minds since we know people want to be happy  maybe when our minds wander they 're going to someplace happier than the place that they 're leaving it would make a lot of sense 
 in other words  maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind wandering 
 well since i 'm a scientist i 'd like to try to
 resolve this debate with some data and in particular i 'd like to present some data to you from three questions that i
  ask with track your happiness remember this is from sort of moment to moment experience in people 's real lives 
 there are three questions the first one is a happiness question  how do you feel on a scale ranging from very bad to very good 
 second an activity question what are you doing on a list of twenty two different activities including things like eating and working and watching tv
  are you thinking about something other than what you 're currently doing  
 people could say no in other words i 'm focused only on my task or yes i am thinking about something else and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant neutral or unpleasant 
 any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering 
 so what did we find
  this graph shows happiness on the vertical axis and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they 're focused on the present when they 're not mind wandering 
 as it turns out people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they 're not 
 now you might look at this result and say  okay  sure on average people are less happy when they 're mind wandering but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn 't very enjoyable to begin with at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us
 nope  as it turns out people are less happy when they 're mind wandering no matter what they 're doing  
 for example  people don 't really like commuting to work very much it 's one of their least enjoyable activities and yet they are substantially happier when they 're focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else
  how could this be happening 
 i think part of the reason a big part of the reason is that when our minds wander  we often think about unpleasant things and they are enormously less happy when they do that 
 our worries our anxieties our regrets  
 and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral they 're still considerably less happy than when they 're not
  at all even when they 're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant they 're actually just slightly less happy than when they aren 't mind wandering 
 if mind wandering were a slot machine it would be like having the chance to lose fifty dollars twenty dollars or one dollar  right you 'd never want to play 
 so i 've been talking about this suggesting perhaps 
  but all i 've really shown you is that these two things are correlated 
 it 's possible that 's the case  but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy then they mind wander maybe that 's what 's really going on how could we ever disentangle these two possibilites well 
 one fact that we can take advantage of i think a fact you 'll all agree is true is that time goes forward not backward  right the cause has to come before the effect  
 we 're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person and so we can look and see does
 mind wandering tend to precede unhappiness or does unhappiness tend to precede mind wandering to get some insight into the causal direction 
 as it turns out  there is a strong relationship between mind wandering now and being unhappy a short time later  consistent with the idea that mind wandering is causing people to be unhappy 
 in contrast there 's no relationship between being unhappy now and mind wandering a short time later 
 in other words
  very likely seems to be an actual cause and not merely a consequence of unhappiness 
 a few minutes ago i likened mind wandering to a slot machine you 'd never want to play  well how often do people 's minds wander 
 turns out they wander a lot in fact really a lot forty seven percent of the time
  people are thinking about something other than what they 're currently doing  how does that depend on what people are doing  this shows the rate of mind wandering across twenty two activities
 ranging from a high of 
 when people are taking a shower brushing their teeth to fifty percent when they 're working to forty percent
 when they 're exercising all the way down to this one short bar on the right that i think some of you are probably laughing at ten percent of the time people 's minds are wandering when they 're having sex
 but there 's something i think that 's quite interesting in this graph  and that is 
 basically with one exception no matter what people are doing they 're mind wandering at least thirty percent of the time 
 which suggests i think that mind wandering isn 't just frequent it 's ubiquitous  it pervades basically everything that
