  i 'd like to ask you what do these three people have in common well
 you probably recognize the first person i 'm sure you 're all avid american idol watchers 
 but you might not recognize aydah al jahani  who is a contestant indeed a finalist
  in the poet of the millions competition which is broadcast out of abu dhabi and seen throughout the arab world in this contest
 people have to write and recite original poetry  in the nabati form of poetry which is the traditional bedouin form
  and lima sahar was a finalist in the afghan star singing competition
  now  before i go any further yes i know it all began with britain 's got talent 
 but my point in discussing this is to show you i hope i 'll be able to show you how these  merit based competitions 
 with equal access to everyone with the winner selected
  are changing tribal societies and i 'm going to focus on afghanistan
 and the arab world with the uae how they 're changing tribal societies not by introducing western ideas 
 but by being integrated into the language in those places it all begins with enjoyment
  these programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society in afghanistan people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program and you 
  don 't necessarily have to have your own tv set people watch it all over the country also in public
  places  
 but it goes beyond watching  
 because also part of this is campaigning people become so engaged that they have volunteers just like political volunteers anyway  who fan out over the countryside 
 campaigning for their
  contestants also put themselves forward now of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance but not entirely because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group 
 this has opened up the door particularly for women and in the last season there were two women in the finalists one of them lima sahar is a pashtun from kandahar a very conservative
  and here she relates in the documentary film afghan star how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy  but 
  she also confides that she knows that members of the taliban are actually  sms ing
  her husband backed her from the start but her tribe and family urged her not to compete
 and were very much against it but once she started to win then they got behind her again it turns out that
 competition and winning is a universal human value 
 and she 's out there her poetry is about women and the life of
  women in society so just by presenting herself and being in competition with men this shows the voting on the program it sets a very important 
  example for young women these are young women in the audience of the program in abu dhabi but also people in the viewing audience 
 would introduce a measure of americanization 
 but actually just the opposite is happening by using this engaging popular format for traditional local culture it actually 
 in the gulf is precipitating a revival of interest in nabati poetry also in traditional dress and dance and music  and for afghanistan 
 where the taliban banned music for many years it is reintroducing their traditional music they don 't sing
  pop songs they sing afghan music and they also have learned how to lose gracefully without avenging the winner
  she 's out there
