  the world makes you something that you 're not 
 but you know inside what you are  and that question burns in your heart how will you become
  i may be somewhat unique in this  but i am not alone not alone at all 
 so when i became a fashion model  i felt that i 'd finally achieved the dream that i 'd always wanted since i was a young child 
 my outside self finally matched my inner truth 
 my inner self 
 for complicated reasons which i 'll get to later 
 when i look at this picture
  at that time i felt like geena you 've done it you 've made it you have arrived  
 but this past october  i realized that i 'm only just beginning 
 all of us
 are put in boxes by our family by our religion by our society our moment in history even
  our own bodies some people have the courage to break free not to accept the limitations imposed by the color of their skin
 or by the beliefs of those that surround them  those people are always the threat to the status quo to what is considered
 acceptable 
 in my case for the last nine years
 some of my neighbors some of my friends  colleagues even my agent did not know about my history  
 i think in mystery this is called the reveal here is mine 
 i was assigned boy at birth based on the appearance of my
  i remember when i was five years old in the philippines walking around our house  i would always wear this t shirt on my head  
 and my mom asked me how come you always wear that
  know it 's actually more fluid complex
 and mysterious because of my success  i never had the courage to share my story 
 not because i thought what i am is wrong but because of how the world treats those of us who wish to break free 
  every day i am so grateful because i am a woman i have a mom and dad
 and family who accepted me for who i am  many
 are not so fortunate 
 there 's a long tradition in asian culture that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender there is a buddhist goddess of
  when i was eight years old  i was at a fiesta in the philippines celebrating these mysteries  i was in front of the stage  
 and i remember out comes this beautiful woman
 right in front of me and i remember that moment something hit me that is the kind of woman i would like to be 
  so when i was fifteen years old still dressing as a boy i met this woman named  t l she is a transgender beauty pageant manager 
 that night she asked me how come you are not joining the beauty pageant 
 she convinced me that if i joined that she would take care of the registration fee
 and the garments  and that night i won best in swimsuit and best in long gown and placed second runner up among
 40 plus candidates that moment changed my life all of a sudden i was introduced to the world of beauty 
 people could say that your first job is a pageant queen for transgender women but i 'll take it  
 so from fifteen to seventeen years old i joined the most prestigious pageant
 to the pageant where it 's at the
  back of the truck literally or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field  and when it rains it rains a lot in the philippines
 the organizers would have to move it inside someone 's house  
 i also experienced the goodness of strangers especially when we would travel in remote provinces in the philippines 
 but most importantly  i met some of my best friends in that
  community in two thousand and one my mom who had moved to san francisco called me and told me that
 my green card petition came through that i could now move to the united states  
 i resisted it  i told my mom mom i 'm having fun i 'm here with my friends i love traveling being a beauty pageant
  but then two weeks later she called me she said did you know that if you move to the united states you could change your name and gender marker 
 that was all i needed to hear 
 my mom also told me to put two e 's in the spelling of my name she also came with me when i had my surgery in thailand at nineteen years old it
 's interesting in some of the most rural cities
 in thailand they perform some of the most prestigious
 and sophisticated surgery 
 at that time in the united states you needed to have surgery before you could change your name and gender marker  
 so in two thousand and one  i moved to san francisco  and i remember looking at my california driver 's license
 with the name geena and gender marker f that was a powerful moment
 for some people their i d is their license to drive or even to get a drink  
 but for me that was my license to live to feel dignified 
 all of a sudden my fears were minimized  i felt that i could conquer my dream and move to new york and be a model  
 many are not so fortunate
  i think of this woman named islan nettles  she 's from new york  she 's a young woman who was
 courageously living her truth but hatred ended her life 
 for most of my community 
 this is the reality in which we live our suicide rate is nine times higher than that of the general
  we have a global vigil for transgender day of remembrance 
 i 'm here at this stage because it 's a long history of people who fought and stood up for injustice this is marsha  p johnson and sylvia rivera
 today this very moment is my real coming out i could no longer live my truth
  for and by myself  i want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame
 and terror i am here exposed  so that one day
 there will never be a need for a november twenty vigil 
  one quick question for you  i 'm wondering what you would say especially to parents
  in a more broad way to friends to family to anyone who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with a gender that 's being assigned them what 
 might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them geena rocero sure 
  i remember every time i would coach young trans women i would mentor them  and
 sometimes when they would call me and tell me that their parents can 't accept it i would pick up that phone call and tell my mom mom can you call this woman and
 sometimes it works sometimes it doesn 't so
 but it 's it 's just gender identity is in the core of our being right i
  we 're all assigned gender at birth so what i 'm trying to do is to have this conversation that
 sometimes that gender assignment doesn 't match  and there should be a space that would allow people to 
 and that 's a conversation that we should have with with parents with colleagues 
 the transgender movement it 's at the very beginning to compare to how the gay movement started there 's still a lot of work that needs to be done
  should be an understanding there should be a space of curiosity and asking questions and i hope all of you guys will be my allies
