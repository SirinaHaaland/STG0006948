  i know a man who soars above the city every night 
 in his dreams he twirls and swirls with his toes kissing the earth  
 everything has motion he claims  even a body as paralyzed
 as his own this man
 is my father  
 three years ago when i found out that my father had suffered a severe stroke in his brain stem  
 i walked into his room in the icu at the montreal neurological institute
 and found him lying deathly still tethered to a breathing machine
 paralysis had closed over his body slowly beginning in his toes then legs torso fingers and arms  
 it made its way up his neck cutting off his ability to breathe  and stopped
 just beneath the eyes  he never lost consciousness
  he watched from within
 as his body shut down limb by limb muscle by muscle 
 in that icu room  i walked up to my father 's body  
 and with a quivering voice and through tears  i began reciting the alphabet 
 a
  he blinked again at the letter i  then at t
  don 't cry this
 is a blessing 
 there was no audible voice but my father called out my name powerfully 
 just seventy two hours after his stroke  he had already embraced the totality of his condition  
 despite his extreme physical state he was completely present with me
 guiding  nurturing  and being my father as much if not more than ever before
 locked in syndrome is many people 's worst nightmare 
 in french it 's sometimes called
  most paralysis is an unspeakable horror  
 but my father 's experience losing every system of his body was not an experience of feeling trapped  
 but rather of turning the psyche inwards  dimming down the external chatter  
 facing the recesses of his own mind and in that place  falling in love with
  life and body anew 
 as a rabbi and spiritual man dangling between mind and body life and death 
 the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him 
 he realized he no longer needed to look beyond the corporeal world
 in order to find the divine
  is in this body it 's in this world he said  
 i slept by my father 's side for the first four months tending as much as i could to his every discomfort  
 understanding the deep human psychological fear of not being able to call out for help 
 my mother  sisters brother and i
 we surrounded him in a cocoon of healing  
 we became his mouthpiece  spending hours each day reciting the alphabet
 as he whispered back sermons and poetry with blinks of his eye his room  it became our temple
  his bedside became a site for those seeking advice and spiritual counsel and through us my father was able to speak
 and uplift letter by letter  blink by blink 
 everything in our world became slow and tender
 as the din drama and death of the hospital
  faded into the background  
 i want to read to you one of the first things that we transcribed in the week following the stroke  
 he composed a letter  addressing his synagogue congregation  and ended it with the following lines 
 when my nape exploded i entered another dimension
  opened and closed continually there are many when low who stop growing  
 last week  i was brought so low but i felt the hand of my father around me and my father brought me back 
 when we weren 't his voice we were his
  i moved them like i know i would have wanted my own arms and legs to be moved were they still for all the hours of the day  
 i remember i 'd hold his fingers near my face bending each joint to keep it soft and limber 
 i 'd ask him again and again to visualize the motion 
 to watch from within as the finger curled
 and extended  and to
 to move along with it in his mind  
 then one day from the corner of my eye i saw his body slither like a snake 
 an involuntary spasm passing through the course of his limbs 
 at first i thought it was my own hallucination having spent so much time tending to this one body so desperate
 to see anything react on its
  own 
 but he told me he felt tingles  sparks of electricity flickering on and off just beneath the surface of the skin 
 the following week he began ever so slightly to show muscle resistance connections were being made 
 body was slowly and gently reawakening
  limb by limb muscle by muscle twitch by twitch 
 as a documentary photographer i felt the need to photograph each of his first movements like a mother with her newborn  
 i photographed him taking his first unaided breath
  the celebratory moment after he showed muscle resistance for the very first time 
 the new adapted technologies that allowed him to gain more and more independence  
 i photographed the care and the love that surrounded him  
 but my photographs only told the outside story
 of a man lying in a hospital bed attached to a breathing machine  
 i wasn 't able to portray his story from within and so i began to search for a new visual language 
 one which strived to express the ephemeral quality of his spiritual experience
  i want to share with you a video from a series that i 've been working on that tries to express
  existence that my father has experienced as he began to regain his ability to breathe  
 i started recording his thoughts and so the voice that you hear in this video is his voice
  for most of us our muscles begin to twitch and move long before we are conscious
 but my father tells me his privilege is living on the far periphery
 of the human experience 
 like an astronaut who sees a perspective that very few of us will ever get to share  
 he wonders and watches as he takes his first breaths
 and dreams about crawling back home so begins life at
 fifty seven he says  a toddler has no attitude in its being 
 but a man insists on his world every day  
 few of us will ever have to face physical limitations to the degree that my father has 
 but we will all have moments of paralysis in our lives  
 i know i
  frequently confront walls that feel completely
 but my father insists that there are no dead ends  
 instead  he invites me into his space of co healing
 to give the very best of myself and for him to give the very best of himself to me 
 paralysis was an opening for him
 it was an opportunity to emerge to rekindle life force 
 to sit still long enough with himself so as to fall in love with the full continuum of creation 
 today my father is no longer locked in 
 he moves his neck with ease has had his feeding peg removed  breathes with his own lungs
  speaks slowly with his own quiet voice 
 and works every day to gain more movement in his paralyzed body  
 but the work will never be finished as he says i 'm living in a broken world and there is holy work to do
