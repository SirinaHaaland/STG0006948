  in our society 's life is touched by cancer if not personally then through a loved one a family member  colleague friend  
 and once our lives are touched by cancer
  we quickly learn that there are basically
 three weapons or three tools that are available to fight the disease  surgery radiation and chemotherapy 
 and once we get involved in
 the therapeutic decisions again either personally or or with our
 loved ones and family members  we also very quickly learn
 the benefits the
  limitations of of these tools i 'm very thankful to jay and to mark and the tedmed team
 for inviting me today
 to describe a fourth tool a new tool that we call tumor treating fields  
 tumor treating fields were invented by dr yoram palti  professor emeritus at the technion in israel  and they use
  electric fields to fight cancer 
 to understand how tumor treating fields work  we first need to understand what are electric fields let me first
 address a few
 popular misconceptions first of all electric fields are not an electric current that is
 coursing through the tissue electric fields
 are not ionizing radiation like x rays or proton beams that bombard tissue to disrupt dna  
 and electric fields are not magnetism  
 what electric fields are are a field of forces and these forces
 act on attract  bodies that have an electrical charge
  the best way to visualize an electric field is to think of gravity  
 gravity is also a field of forces that act on masses we can all picture astronauts in space 
 they float freely in three dimensions without any forces acting on them  
 but as that
 space shuttle returns
  and as the astronauts enter the earth 's gravitational field they begin to see the effects of gravity they begin to be attracted towards earth  and as they land they 're fully aligned in the gravitational field we 're
 of course all stuck in the earth 's gravitational field right now that 's why you 're all
 in your chairs  and that 's why we have to use our muscle energy to stand up to walk around and to lift
  in cancer cells rapidly divide and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth 
 we can think of a cell from an electrical perspective as if it 's a mini space station  
 and in that space station we have the genetic material the chromosomes within a nucleus  
 and out in the cytoplasmic soup we have special proteins
 that are required for cell division
  that float freely in this soup in three dimensions 
 importantly those special proteins are among the most highly charged objects in our body  
 as cell division begins
 the nucleus disintegrates  the chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell and those special
  whereby they attach and they literally click into place
 to form chains these chains
 then progress and attach to the genetic material and pull the genetic material from one cell into two cells 
 and this is exactly how one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells two cancer cells become four cancer cells and we
  have ultimately uncontrolled tumor growth tumor treating fields
 use externally placed transducers attached to a field generator to create
 an artificial electric field on that space station  
  and when that cellular space station is within the electric field it acts on those highly charged proteins
 and aligns them 
 and it prevents them from forming those chains  those mitotic spindles that are necessary to pull the genetic material into the daughter cells 
 what we see is that the cells will attempt to divide for several hours and they will either
  into this so called cellular suicide programmed cell death or they will form unhealthy daughter cells and enter into
 apoptosis once they have divided  and we can observe this what i 'm going to show you next are two
 in vitro experiments this is
  identical cultures of cervical cancer cells and we 've stained these cultures with a green florescent dye so that we can look at these proteins that form these chains  
 the first clip
 shows a normal cell division without the
 tumor treating fields  what we see are first of all a very active
  a lot of divisions  and then very clear nuclei once the cells have separated and we can see them dividing
 throughout 
 when we apply the fields again in the identical time scale to the identical culture you 're going to see something different 
 the cells round up for division but they 're very static in that position we
 'll see two cells in the upper part of the
  attempting to divide 
 the one within the circle manages but see how much of the protein is still throughout the nucleus  even in the dividing cell the one up there can 't divide at all 
 and then this bubbling  this
 membrane bubbling is the hallmark of apoptosis in this cell formation of healthy
 mitotic spindles is necessary for division in
  all cell types we 've applied tumor treating fields to over twenty different
 cancers in the lab  and we see this effect in all of them now
 importantly  these tumor treating fields have no effect on normal undividing cells ten
  palti founded a company called novocure to develop
 his discovery into a practical therapy for patients in that time novocure 's developed
 two systems one system for cancers in the head and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body  
 the first cancer that we have focused on is the deadly brain cancer
  affects about ten thousand people
 in the u s each year
  it 's a death sentence  the expected five year survival is less than five percent 
 and the typical patient with optimal therapy survives just a little over a year  
 and only about seven months from the time that the cancer is first treated and then comes back and starts growing again
  conducted its first phase three randomized trial in patients with recurrent gbm  so these are patients who had received
 surgery  
 high dose radiation to the head and first line chemotherapy and that had failed and their tumors had grown back  we divided the patients
  which is expected to double the life expectancy versus no treatment at all and then the second group received only tumor treating field therapy 
 what we saw in that trial is that that the life expectancies of both groups so the chemotherapy treated group and the tumor treating field group was the
  the tumor treating field group suffered none of the side effects
 typical of
 chemotherapy patients they had no pain 
 suffered none of the infections  they had no nausea  diarrhea
  constipation fatigue that would be expected 
 based on this trial in april of this year the
  approved tumor treating fields for the treatment of patients with recurrent gbm 
 importantly it was the first time ever that the fda included in their approval of an oncology treatment a quality of life claim  
 so i 'm going to show you now one of the patients from this trial
 robert dill bundi is a famous swiss cycling champion 
 he won the gold medal in moscow in the four thousand meter
 pursuit  
 and five years ago  robert was diagnosed with gbm  he received the standard treatments he received
  he received high dose radiation to the head and he received first line chemotherapy a year after this treatment in fact this is his
 baseline mri  you can see that the black regions in the upper
 right quadrant are the areas where he had surgery  
 and a year after that treatment 
 his tumor grew back with a vengeance that cloudy white mass that you see is the recurrence
  of the tumor at this point  he was told by his doctors that he had about three months to live  
 he entered our trial  
 and here we can see him getting the therapy first of all these electrodes are noninvasive they 're attached to the
 the skin in the area of the tumor here you can see
  technician is placing them on there much like bandages the patients learn to do this themselves
 and then the patients can
 undergo all the all the activities of their daily life there 's none of the of the tiredness there 's none of what is called the chemo head there 's no sensation 
 it doesn 't interfere with
 computers or electrical equipment and the
  therapy is delivered continuously at home without having to go into the hospital either periodically or continually these are
 robert 's mris  again  under only ttfield treatment this is a therapy that takes time to work
 it 's a medical device it works when it 's on but what we can see is by month six the tumor has
  and it 's begun to melt away it 's still there by month twelve we could argue whether there 's a little bit of
 material around the edges  but it 's essentially completely gone it
 's now five years since robert 's diagnosis  and he 's alive  but importantly he 's healthy
 and he 's at work  i 'm going to let him in this very short clip describe his
  impressions of the therapy in his own words
  novocure 's also working on lung cancer as the second target  we 've run a phase two trial in switzerland
 on again  recurrent patients patients who have received standard therapy and whose cancer has come back
  another clip of a woman named lydia lydia 's a 
  year old farmer in switzerland she was diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago  
 she underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy over two years none of which had an effect her cancer continued to grow 
 three years ago  she entered the novocure
  lung cancer trial you can see in her case 
 she 's wearing her transducer arrays one of the front of her chest one on the back and then the second pair side to side over the liver 
 you can see the tumor treating field field generator but importantly you can also see that she is living her life she is managing her farm  she 's interacting with her kids and her grand kids 
 and when we talked
 she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions her whole family suffered as her side effect profile came and went 
 now she can run all of the activities
 of her farm  it 's only the beginning
  observed tremendous synergies between chemotherapy and tumor treating fields  there 's research underway now at harvard medical school to pick the optimum pairs to maximize that benefit  
 we also believe that tumor treating fields will work with radiation and interrupt the self repair mechanisms that we have there 's now a new research project underway at the karolinska in sweden to prove that hypothesis
 we have more trials planned for lung cancer pancreatic cancer  ovarian cancer and breast cancer and i firmly believe 
 that in the next ten years tumor treating fields will be a weapon available to doctors and patients for all of these
  that in the next decades  we will make
 big strides on reducing that death rate that has been so challenging in this disease
