  is a very powerful word  
 it conjures up sex  abandon  loss of control  and you can see it 's very important as a word  but it 's
  if you put that word into the web as you may have done you
 'll come up with millions of hits  and almost all of those sites are trying to sell you something to make you irresistible
 for ten dollars or more now this is a very attractive idea  and the molecules they mention sound really
  it gets better and better and when you combine that with white lab coats  you must imagine that there is fantastic science behind this 
 but sadly these are fraudulent claims
 supported by dodgy science the problem
  although there are many good scientists working on what they think are human pheromones  and they 're publishing in respectable journals 
 at the basis of this despite very sophisticated experiments 
 there really is no good science behind it because it 's based on a problem which is
 nobody has systematically gone through all the odors that humans produce
  and there are thousands of molecules that we give off we 're mammals  we produce a lot of smell  
 nobody has gone through systematically to work out which molecules really are pheromones  they 've just plucked a few and all these experiments are based on those  but there 's no good evidence at all  
 now that 's not to say
 that smell is not important to people it is and some people are real enthusiasts
  and one of these
 was napoleon  
 and famously you may remember that out on the campaign trail for war he wrote to his lover  empress josephine saying 
 don 't wash i 'm coming home 
 so he didn 't want to lose any of her richness in the days before he 'd get home  
 and it is still you 'll find websites that offer this as a major
  at the same time though  we spend about as much money taking the smells off us as putting them back on in perfumes  and perfumes are 
 business  so what i want to do in the rest of this talk is
 tell you about what pheromones really are tell you why i think we would expect
 humans to have pheromones  tell you about some of the confusions
 in pheromones  and then finally i want to end with a promising avenue which shows us the way we ought to be going  
 so
 the ancient greeks knew that dogs sent invisible signals between each other a female dog in heat
 sent an invisible signal to male dogs for miles around
  and it wasn 't a sound it was a smell  you could take the smell from the female dog and the dogs would chase the cloth  
 but the problem for everybody who could see this effect was that you couldn 't identify the molecules you couldn 't demonstrate it was chemical 
 the reason for that of course is that each of these animals produces tiny quantities  and in the case of the dog males dogs can smell it but we can 't smell it  
 and it was only in one
  nine hundred and fifty nine that a german team after spending twenty years in search of these molecules  
 discovered identified  the first pheromone  and this was the sex pheromone of a silk moth 
 now this was an inspired choice by adolf butenandt and his team because he needed half a million moths to get enough material to do the chemical analysis  
 but he created the model for how you should go
  about pheromone analysis  
 he basically went through systematically showing that only the molecule in question was the one that stimulated the males not all the others 
 he analyzed it very carefully he synthesized the molecule  
 and then tried the synthesized molecule on the males and got them to respond and showed it was indeed that molecule 
 that 's closing the circle
  that 's the thing which has never been done with humans nothing systematic  no real demonstration 
 with that new concept  we needed a new word  
 and that was the word pheromone 
 and it 's basically transferred excitement  transferred between individuals  and since one thousand nine
  pheromones have been found right the way across the animal kingdom in male animals in female animals  it works just as well underwater for goldfish and lobsters  
 and almost every mammal you can think of has had a pheromone identified  and of course  an enormous number of insects  
 so we know that pheromones exist right the way across the animal kingdom 
 what about humans well the first thing of course is that
  and mammals are smelly as any dog owner can tell you we smell  they smell  but the real reason we might think that humans have pheromones
 is the change that occurs as we grow up the smell of a room of teenagers is quite different from the smell of a room of small children 
 what 's changed and of course it 's puberty along with the pubic hair and the hair in the armpits new glands start to secrete in those places
 and that 's what 's making the change in smell  
 if we were any other kind of mammal  or any other kind of animal we would say that must be something to do with pheromones and we 'd start looking properly  
 but there are some problems and this is why i think people have not
 looked for pheromones so effectively in humans  there are
  and the first of these is perhaps surprising it 's all about culture 
 now moths don 't learn a lot about what is good to smell  but humans do 
 and up to the age of about four any smell no matter how rancid is simply interesting  
 and i understand that the major role of parents is to stop kids putting their fingers in poo because it 's always something nice to smell  
 but gradually we learn what 's not good
 and one of the things we learn at the same time as what is not good
 is what is good  
 now  the cheese behind me is a british  if not an english delicacy  it 's ripe blue stilton  
 liking it is incomprehensible to people from other countries 
 every culture has its own special food and national delicacy
  if you were to come from iceland your national dish is deep rotted shark  
 now  all of these things are acquired tastes  but they form almost a badge of identity you 're part of the in group 
 the second thing is
 the sense of smell  each of us has a unique odor world in the sense that what
  we smell  we each smell a completely different world  
 now smell was the hardest of the senses to crack  and the nobel prize awarded to richard axel and linda buck
 was only awarded in two thousand and four
 for their discovery of how smell works it 's really hard  but in essence nerves from the brain go up into the nose
 and on these nerves exposed in the nose
  the outside air are receptors 
 and odor molecules coming in on a sniff interact with these receptors 
 and if they bond  they send the nerve a signal which goes back into the brain 
 we don 't just have one kind of receptor  if you 're a human you have about four hundred different kinds of
  and the brain knows what you 're smelling because of the combination of receptors and nerve cells that they trigger  
 sending messages up to the brain in a combinatorial fashion 
 but it 's a bit more complicated because each of those four hundred comes in various variants  
 and depending which variant you have you might smell coriander or cilantro that herb  
 either as something delicious and savory or something like soap  
 so we each have an individual world
  world of smell  and that complicates anything when we 're studying smell  
 well we really ought to talk about armpits  and i have to say that i do have particularly good ones 
 now i 'm not going to share them with you 
 but this is the place that most people have looked for pheromones  
 there is one good reason which is the great apes have armpits as their unique characteristic
  primates have scent glands in other parts of the body  the great apes have these armpits full of secretory glands producing smells
 all the time enormous numbers of molecules 
 when they 're secreted from the glands the molecules are odorless they have no smell at all  and it
  the wonderful bacteria growing on the rainforest of hair that actually produces the smells that we know and love 
 and so incidentally if you want to reduce the amount of smell
 clear cutting your armpits is a very effective way of reducing the habitat for bacteria and you 'll
 find they remain less smelly for much longer  
 but although we 've focused on armpits  i think it 's partly because they 're the least embarrassing place to go and ask people for samples  there is actually
  another reason why we might not be looking for a universal sex pheromone there and that 's because twenty percent of the world 's population
 doesn 't have smelly armpits like me  
 and these are people from china  
 japan  korea  and other parts of northeast asia  they simply don 't secrete those odorless precursors that the bacteria love
 to use to produce
  the smells that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of as characteristic of armpits  so
 it doesn 't apply to twenty percent of the world  so what should we be doing
 in our search for human pheromones i 'm fairly convinced that we do have them  we 're mammals  like everybody
  probably do have them  but what i think we should do is go right back to the beginning  
 and basically look all over the body no matter how embarrassing  we need to search and go for the first time where no one else has dared tread
  it 's going to be difficult  it 's going to be embarrassing but we need to look we also need to go back to the ideas that
  when he was studying the silk moth  
 we need to go back and look systematically at all the molecules that are being produced  
 and work out which ones are really involved  it isn 't good enough simply to pluck a couple and say they 'll do we have to actually demonstrate that they really have the effects we claim 
 there is one team that i 'm actually very impressed by they 're in france  and their previous success was identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone
  they 've turned their attention now to human babies and mothers  
 so this is a baby having a drink of milk from its mother 's breast  
 her nipple is completely hidden by the baby 's head  
 but what you 'll notice
 is a white droplet with an arrow pointing to it  
  and that 's the secretion from the areolar glands now we all have them
 men and women  and these are the little bumps around the nipple  
 and if you 're a lactating woman these start to secrete it 's a very interesting secretion 
 what benoist schaal and his team developed was a simple test to investigate what the effect of this secretion might be in effect
  so this is a sleeping baby and under its nose  we 've put a clean glass rod 
 the baby remains sleeping  showing no interest at all  
 but if we go to any mother who is secreting from the areolar glands  so it 's not about recognition  it can be from any mother 
 if we take the secretion and now put it under the baby 's nose  
 we get a very different reaction
  's reaction of delight  and it opens its mouth and sticks out its tongue
 and starts to suck now
 since this is from any mother  it could really be a pheromone  it 's not about individual recognition any mother will do  
 now why is this important apart from being simply very interesting  
 it 's because women vary in the number of areolar glands that they have and there is a
  correlation between the ease with which babies start to suckle
 and the number of areolar glands she has it appears that the more secretions she 's got the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly  
 if you 're a mammal  the most dangerous time in life is the first few hours after birth  you have to get that first
 drink of milk  and if you don 't get it
  won 't survive you 'll be dead  
 since many babies actually find it difficult to take that first meal  because they 're not getting the right stimulus  if we could identify what that molecule was 
 and the french team are being very cautious  but if we could identify the molecule  
 synthesize it it would then mean premature babies would be more likely to
  would have a better chance of survival  
 so what i want to argue is this is one example of where a systematic really scientific approach can actually bring you a real understanding of pheromones  
 there could be all sorts of medical interventions there could be all sorts of things that humans are doing with pheromones that we simply don 't know at the moment 
 what we need to remember is pheromones are not just about sex they 're about all sorts of things to do with a mammal 's life 
 so do go forward and do search for more there 's lots to find thank you very much
