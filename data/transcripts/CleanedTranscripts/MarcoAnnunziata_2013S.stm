  i never think about the future it comes soon enough 
 and he was right of course  so today  i 'm here to ask you to think of how the future is happening now 
 over the past two hundred years the world has experienced two major waves of innovation
  first  the industrial revolution brought us machines and factories  railways electricity air travel and our lives have never been the same  
 then the internet revolution brought us computing power data networks 
 unprecedented access to information and communication  
 and our lives have never been the same 
 now we are experiencing another
  metamorphic change  the industrial internet  
 it brings together intelligent machines  advanced analytics and the creativity of people at work  
 it 's the marriage of minds and machines 
 and our lives will never be the same 
 in my current role i see up close how technology is beginning to transform industrial sectors that play a huge role in our
  economy and in our lives energy  aviation  transportation health care 
 for an economist this is highly unusual 
 and it 's extremely exciting because this is a transformation as powerful as the industrial revolution and more 
 and before the industrial revolution there was no economic growth to speak of 
 so what is this industrial internet 
 industrial machines
  are being equipped with a growing number of electronic sensors that allow them to see hear feel a lot more than ever before generating prodigious amounts of data 
 increasingly sophisticated analytics then sift through the data  
 providing insights that allow us to operate the machines in entirely new ways a lot more efficiently  
 and not just individual machines
  fleets of locomotives  airplanes entire systems like power grids  hospitals it is asset optimization and system optimization 
 of course  electronic sensors have been around for some time  
 but something has changed  
 a sharp decline in the cost of sensors and thanks to advances in cloud computing a rapid decrease in the cost of storing and processing data
  so we are moving to a world where the machines we work with are not just intelligent they are brilliant  they are 
 they are predictive  reactive and social it 's jet engines  locomotives  gas turbines medical devices
  communicating seamlessly with each other and with us 
 it 's a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automatically when we need it without having to look for it 
 we are beginning to deploy throughout the industrial system
 embedded virtualization multi core processor technology
 to become virtualized in software  decoupling machine software from hardware  
 and allowing us to remotely and automatically monitor manage
 and upgrade industrial assets
  why does any of this matter at all well first of all it 's already allowing us to shift towards preventive
  which means fixing machines just before they break  without wasting time
 servicing them on a fixed schedule 
 and this in turn is pushing us towards zero unplanned downtime which means there will be no more power outages 
 no more flight delays 
 so let me give you a few examples of how these brilliant machines work and some of the examples may seem trivial
  some are clearly more profound  but all of them are going to have a very powerful impact  
 let 's start with aviation today ten percent of all flights cancellations and delays
 are due to unscheduled maintenance events something goes wrong unexpectedly this results in eight billion dollars in costs
  for the airline industry globally every year not to mention the impact on all of us  stress inconvenience  missed meetings as we sit helplessly in an airport terminal 
 so how can the industrial internet help here 
 we 've developed a preventive maintenance system which can be installed on any aircraft
 and able to predict issues that a human operator would miss
  while in flight will communicate with technicians on the ground by the time it lands they will already know if anything needs to be serviced  
 just in the u s a system like this can prevent over sixty thousand delays and cancellations every year  helping seven million passengers get to their destinations on time  
 or take healthcare today nurses spend
  minutes per shift looking for medical equipment that seems trivial  but
 it 's less time spent caring for patients
 st luke 's medical center in houston texas which has deployed industrial internet technology to electronically monitor and connect patients  staff and medical equipment 
 has reduced bed turnaround times by nearly one hour 
 if you need surgery one hour matters
 it means more patients can be treated more lives can be saved  
 another medical center in washington state is piloting an application that allows medical images from city scanners and mris to be analyzed in the cloud  
 developing better analytics
 at a lower cost  imagine
  who has suffered a severe trauma and needs the attention of several specialists  a neurologist a cardiologist an orthopedic surgeon 
 if all of them can have instantaneous and simultaneous access to scans and images as they are taken  
 they will be able to deliver better healthcare faster 
 so all of this translates into better health outcomes but it can also deliver substantial economic benefits
  reduction in existing inefficiencies could yield savings of over sixty billion dollars to the healthcare industry worldwide and that is just
 a drop in the sea compared to what we need to do to make healthcare affordable on a sustainable basis  
 similar advances are happening in energy  including renewable energy 
 wind farms equipped with
  and diagnostics
 that allow wind turbines to talk to each other and adjust the pitch of their blades in a coordinated way depending on how the wind is blowing 
 can now produce electricity at a cost of less than five cents per kilowatt hour  
 ten years ago that cost was thirty cents six times as much  the list goes on and it will grow fast  because industrial data are now growing
  they will account for over fifty percent of all digital information but
 this is not just about data so let me switch gears and tell you how this is impacting already the the jobs we do every day because this new wave of innovation 
 is bringing about new tools and applications that will allow us to collaborate in a smarter and faster way  making our jobs not just more efficient but more rewarding  
  farm with a handheld device telling her which turbines need servicing she already has all the spare parts because the problems were diagnosed in advanced  
 and if she faces an unexpected issue the same handheld device will allow her to communicate with colleagues at the service center  
 let them see what she sees  transmit data that they can run through
  can stream videos that will guide her step by step through whatever complex procedure is needed to get the machines back up and running  
 and their interaction gets documented and stored in a searchable database  
 let 's stop and think about this for a minute because this is a very important point this new wave of innovation is fundamentally changing the way we work and
 i know that many of you will be concerned about the impact that innovation might have on jobs  unemployment is already high and there is always
  fear that innovation will destroy jobs and innovation is disruptive  
 but let me stress two things here  first  we 've already lived through mechanization of agriculture  automation of industry and employment has gone up 
 because innovation is fundamentally about growth it makes products more affordable it creates new demand new jobs 
  is a concern that in the future there will only be room for engineers data scientists  and other  highly specialized workers and believe me as an economist i am also scared  
 but think about it just as a child
 can easily figure out how to operate an ipad  so a new generation of mobile and intuitive industrial applications will make life easier for workers of all skill levels 
 the worker of the future will be more like iron man than the charlie chaplin of
  times 
 and to be sure new high skilled jobs will be created mechanical digital engineers who understand both the machines and the data  
 managers who understand their industry
 and the analytics and can reorganize the business to take full advantage of the technology  but now let 's take a step back let 's look at the big
  are people who argue that today 's innovation is all about social media and silly games with nowhere near the transformational power of the industrial revolution 
 they say that all the growth enhancing innovations are behind us and every time i hear this i can 't help thinking that
 even back in the stone age
 there must have been a group of cavemen sitting around a fire one day looking very grumpy  
 and looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill
 and saying to each other yeah this wheel thing  cool toy sure but compared to fire it will have no impact 
 the big discoveries are all behind us 
 this technological revolution is as inspiring and transformational as anything we have ever seen human
  innovation have always propelled us forward  they 've created jobs  they 've raised living standards  they 've made our lives
 healthier and more rewarding 
 and the new wave of innovation which is beginning to sweep through industry is no different in the u s alone the industrial internet could raise average income by twenty five to forty percent
 over the next fifteen years  boosting growth to rates we haven 't seen in a long time and adding between ten and fifteen trillion dollars to global gdp that is the size
  of the entire u s economy today  
 but this is not a foregone conclusion 
 we are just at the beginning of this transformation and there will be barriers to break  obstacles to overcome we will need to invest in the new technologies 
 we will need to adapt organizations and managerial practices 
 we will need a robust cybersecurity
  approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual property and safeguards critical infrastructure from cyberattacks 
 and the education system will need to evolve to ensure students are equipped with the right skills it
 's not going to be easy  but it is going to be worth it  
 the economic challenges facing us are hard  
 but when i walk the factory floor and i see how humans and brilliant machines are becoming interconnected  and i see the difference this makes in a hospital
 in an airport in a power generation plant i 'm not just optimistic i 'm enthusiastic this new technological revolution is upon us  
 so think about the future it will be here soon enough
