  in the spring of two thousand and sixteen a legal battle between apple and the federal bureau of investigation captured the world 's attention 
 apple has built security features into its mobile products which protect data on its devices from everyone but the owner that means that criminals
  hackers
 and yes even governments are all locked out for apple 's customers this is a great thing  but governments are not so happy 
 you see apple has made a conscious decision to get out of the surveillance business 
 apple has tried to make surveillance as difficult as possible for governments and any other actors
 there are really two smartphone
  operating systems in the global smartphone market  ios and android ios is made by apple android is made by google
 apple has spent a lot of time and money
 to make sure that its products are as secure as possible 
 apple encrypts all data stored on iphones by default  and text messages sent from one apple customer to another apple customer are encrypted by default without
  the user having to take any actions 
 what this means is that if the police seize an iphone and it has a password they 'll have a difficult
 time getting any data off of it if they can do it at all 
 in contrast the security of android just really isn 't as good 
 android phones or at least most of the android phones that have been sold to consumers do not encrypt data stored on the device
  by default and the built in text messaging app
 in android does not use encryption 
 so if the police seize an android phone  chances are they 'll be able to get all the data they want off of that device 
 two smartphones
 from two from two of the biggest companies in the world one that protects data by default  and one that doesn
  a seller of luxury goods it dominates the high end of the market
 and we would expect
 a manufacturer of luxury goods to have products that
 include more features  but not everyone can afford an iphone 
 that 's where android really really dominates at the middle and low end of the market 
 smartphones for the billion and a half people who cannot or will not spend
  six hundred dollars on a phone  
 but
 the dominance of android
 has led to what i call the digital security divide 
 that is there is now increasingly a gap between the privacy and security of the rich who can afford devices that secure their data by default
  and of the poor  whose devices do very little to protect them
 by default  so think of the average apple customer 
 a banker a lawyer a doctor a politician 
 these individuals now increasingly have smartphones in their pockets
 that encrypt their calls
  text messages all the data on the device without them doing really anything to secure their information 
 in contrast the poor and the most vulnerable in our societies are using devices that leave them completely vulnerable
 to surveillance in the united states where i live 
  are more likely to be seen as suspicious
 or more likely to be profiled  and are more likely to be targeted by the state with surveillance
 but african americans are also disproportionately likely to use android devices that do nothing at all to protect them from that surveillance 
 this is a problem  we must remember that surveillance is a tool
  it 's a tool used by those in power against those who have no power and
 while i think it 's absolutely great
 that companies like apple are making it easy for people to encrypt  if the only people who can
 protect themselves from the gaze of the government are the rich and powerful that 's a problem  
 and it 's not just a privacy or a cybersecurity problem  it 's a
  civil rights problem  
 so the lack of default security in android is not just a problem for the poor and vulnerable users who are depending on these devices 
 this is actually a problem for our democracy  
 i 'll explain what i mean  
 modern social movements rely on technology
 from black lives matter to the arab spring
 to occupy wall street the organizers of these movements and the members of these movements
 increasingly communicate and coordinate with smartphones  
 and so naturally governments that feel threatened by these movements will also target the organizers and their smartphones 
  it 's quite possible that a future martin luther king or a mandela or a gandhi will have an iphone
 and be protected from government surveillance  but chances are they 'll probably have a cheap $ twenty android phone in their pocket  
 and so if we do nothing to address the digital security divide  if we do nothing to ensure that everyone in our society
 gets the same benefits of encryption and is equally able to protect
  themselves from surveillance by the state 
 not only will the poor and vulnerable be exposed to surveillance  
 but future civil rights movements may be crushed before they ever reach their full potential
  saw recently in the press that
 mark zuckerberg from facebook covers over his camera and does something with his headphone mic jack so i wanted to ask you a personal question which is 
 do you do that and on behalf of everyone here particularly myself  should we be doing that should we be covering these things
  back on whenever you want to make a call or a skype call  
 putting a sticker over your web cam is probably the best thing you can do for your privacy in terms of bang for buck
 there really is malware  malicious software out there that can take over your web cam even without the light turning on this is used by criminals  this is used by stalkers
  and then of course  it 's used by governments and
 there 's obviously a sexual violence component to this which is that this kind of surveillance can be used most effectively against against women and other people who
 who can be shamed in our society  even if you think you have nothing to hide at the very least if you have
 children  teenagers in your in your lives make sure you put a sticker on on their camera and protect them
