  am sorry i cannot show you my face because if i do the bad guys will come for me 
 my journey started fourteen years ago 
  i was a young reporter i had just come out of college then i got a scoop the scoop was
 quite a very simple story  police officers were taking bribes
 from hawkers who were hawking on the streets 
 as a young reporter i thought that i should do it in a different way  so that it has a maximum impact  since everybody knew that it was happening  and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system
 so i decided to go there
 and
 act
 as a seller as part of selling  i was able to document the hard core evidence  
 the impact was great  
 it was fantastic 
 this was what
 many call immersion
  i am an undercover journalist 
 my journalism is hinged on three basic principles  naming  shaming
 and jailing journalism is about results it 's about affecting your community or your society in the most progressive
  i have worked on this for over fourteen years and i can tell you the results are very good one story that comes to mind
 in my undercover pieces
 is spirit child it was about children
 who were born with deformities  and their parents felt that once they were born with those deformities  they were not good enough
  live in the society so they were given some concoction to take
 and as a result they died  so i built a prosthetic baby  and i went into the village  pretended as though
 this baby
 had been born with a deformity  and here was the guys who do the killing they got themselves ready 
 in their bids to kill i got the police on standby
  they came that fateful morning
 to come and kill the child  
 i recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction they
 put it on fire it was boiling hot  getting ready to give to the kids  
 whilst this was going on the police i had alerted they were on standby  
 and just as the concoction was ready  and they were about to give it
  i phoned the police and fortunately
 they came and busted them  
 as i speak now they are before the courts don 't forget the key principles  naming  shaming and jailing  
 the court process is taking place  and i 'm very sure at the end of the day we will find them and we will
 put them where they belong too 
 another key story that comes to mind which relates to
 this spirit
  child phenomenon is the spell of the albinos i
 'm sure most of you may have heard in tanzania children who are born with albinism
 are sometimes considered as being unfit to live in society their bodies are chopped
  to be used for some concoctions or some potions
 for people to get money or so many many stories people would tell about it it was time to go undercover again  so i went undercover
 as a man who was interested in this particular business of course  again a prosthetic arm was built for the first time  
 i filmed on hidden camera the guys who do this
 and they were ready to buy the arm
 and they were ready to use it to prepare those
 potions for people 
 i am glad today the tanzanian government has taken action but the key issue is that the tanzanian government could only take action
 because the evidence was available 
  to do what is the essence of journalism if it doesn 't benefit society  
 my kind of journalism is a product of my society 
 i know
  he brought out some money from his pockets and
  utter a word but my colleagues didn 't know so after
 after collecting the money when he left we were waiting for him to bring the goods 
  left i told my colleagues that since i was the leader of the group  i told my colleagues that if they come we will arrest them second official i don 't even
  i 've never stepped there before so i 'm surprised  you see
 a hand
 counting money just in front of me the next moment  you see the money
 in my hands counting whereas i have not come into contact with anybody i have not done any business with anybody reporter when metro news contacted investigative reporter anas aremeyaw anas for his
  he just smiled and gave this video extract he did not use in the documentary recently shown onscreen  
 the officer who earlier denied involvement pecks a calculator to compute the amount of money they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled anas aremeyaw
 anas this was another story on anticorruption  and here was him denying but you see when you have the hard core evidence you
  able to affect society  sometimes these are some of the headlines that come
  leading the customs officers into temptation i 'm telling you ghana is not going to say
 any good things to you about this aaa that was my president  
 i thought that i couldn 't come here without giving you something special  i have a piece
 i 'm excited that i 'm sharing it for the first time with you here  i have been undercover
 in the prisons  i have been there
 for a long time  and i can tell you 
 what i saw is not nice  but again  i can only affect society and affect government if i bring out the hard core evidence
 many times  the prison authorities have denied
 ever having issues of drug abuse issues of sodomy so many issues they would deny that it ever happens 
 how can you obtain the hard core evidence  
 so i was in the prison [ nsawan prison ]
 now  what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies now i happen to have followed
 one of my inmates one of my friends from his sick bed till death  and i can tell you it was not a nice thing at all 
 there were issues of
 bad food being served as
 i recall that some of the food i ate is just not good for a human being 
 toilet facilities very bad
 i mean you had to queue to get proper toilets to attend and that 's what i call proper when four of us are on a 
 it is something that if you narrate it to somebody the person wouldn 't believe it 
 the only way that you can let the person believe is when you show hard core evidence of course drugs
  to get cannabis heroin and cocaine  faster even in the prison than outside the prison  evil in the society
 is an extreme disease 
 if you have extreme diseases  you need to get extreme remedies 
 my kind of journalism might not fit in other continents or other countries  but i can tell you it works in my part of the continent of africa  because usually
  when people talk about corruption they ask where is the evidence show me the evidence i say this is the evidence 
 and that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars  
 you see we on the continent are able to tell the story better because we face the conditions and we see the conditions 
 that is why i was particularly excited when we launched our africa investigates series where we investigated a
  of african countries  
 as a result of the success of the africa investigates series we are moving on to world investigates  
 by the end of it a lot more bad guys on our continent will be put behind bars 
 this will not stop i 'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism  because i know
  i have some questions for you how did you end up in jail this was just a few weeks ago i believe yeah aaa 
 sure you know undercover is all about setting the priorities right so we got people to take me to
  so i went through the very legal process because at the end of the day the prison authorities want to check whether indeed you have been there or not 
 and that 's how i got in there ca so someone someone sued you in court and they took you there and you were in remand custody for part of it
  your life at risk
 how do you do that aaa you see undercover is always a last resort 
 before we go undercover we follow the rules  and i 'm only comfortable and i 'm purged of fear whenever i am sure that all the steps
 have been taken  i don 't do it alone i have a backup team who help ensure that the safety and all the systems
  are put in place but you 've got to take very intelligent decisions whenever they are happening  if you don 't you will end up losing your life so yes when the backup systems are put in place i 'm okay i go in risky yes but
 it 's a hazard of a profession i mean everybody has their hazard  and
 once you say that is yours you 've got to take it as and when it comes ca 
 well you 're an amazing human and you 've done amazing work and you 've taught us a story like no story i think any of us have heard before and
 we 're appreciative we salute you thank you so much
