  spoke to you about a book that i was just in the process of completing that has come out in the interim  and i would like to talk to you today about some of the controversies that that
  the book is called the blank slate 
 based on the popular idea that the human mind is a blank slate  and that all of its structure comes from socialization culture parenting experience
  the blank slate was an influential idea in the  20th century here are a few quotes indicating that man has no nature from the historian jose ortega y gasset 
  the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none from the late scientist stephen jay gould
 there are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate  and some of them just come from common sense as many people have
 told me over the years anyone who 's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperaments and talents it doesn 't all come from the outside
 oh and anyone who
 has both a child and a house pet has surely noticed that the child exposed to speech will acquire a human language  whereas the house pet won 't presumably because of some innate different between them  
 and
 anyone who 's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable  there are also
  think increasing
 results from the scientific study of humans that indeed we 're not born blank slates 
 one of them from anthropology is the study of human universals if you 've ever taken anthropology you know that it 's a
 kind of an occupational
 pleasure of anthropologists to show how exotic other
 cultures can be and that there are places out there where supposedly  everything is the opposite to the way it is here  but if you
 instead look at what
 is common to the world 's cultures you find that there is an enormously rich set of
 behaviors and emotions and ways of construing the world that can be found in all of the world 's 6 000 odd cultures 
 the anthropologist donald brown has tried to list them all and they range from aesthetics
  statuses all the way down to weaning  weapons  weather  attempts to control the color white and a worldview  
 also  genetics and neuroscience are increasingly showing that the brain is intricately
 structured this is a recent study by the neurobiologist paul thompson and his colleagues in which they using
 mri measured the distribution of gray matter that is the
 the outer layer of the cortex in a large sample of pairs of people they coded correlations in the thickness of gray matter in different parts of the brain using a false color scheme in which
 no difference is coded as purple  and any color other than purple indicates a statistically
  this is what happens when you pair people up at random by definition
 two people picked at random can 't have correlations in the distribution of gray matter in the cortex this is what happens in
 people who share half of their dna fraternal twins  and as you can see large amounts of the brain are not purple showing that if one person has
 a thicker
 bit of cortex in that region so does his fraternal twin  and here 's
  what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their dna namely clones or identical twins
 and you can see huge areas of cortex where there are massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter now
 these aren 't just
 differences in anatomy like the shape of your ear lobes but they have consequences in thought and behavior
  that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by charles addams separated at birth the mallifert twins meet accidentally as you can see there are
 two inventors with identical contraptions in their lap meeting in the waiting room of a patent attorney  now the cartoon is not
 such an exaggeration because studies of identical twins who were separated at birth and then tested in adulthood show that they have astonishing
  similarities
 and this happens in every pair of identical twins separated at birth ever studied but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth my favorite example is a pair of twins one of whom was brought up
 as a catholic in a nazi family in germany the other brought up in a jewish family in trinidad when they walked into the lab in minnesota they were wearing
  identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes 
 both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists 
 both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after  and both of them liked to
 surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump  now
 the story might seem to good to be true  but when you administer
 batteries of psychological tests  you get the same results namely identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities  now  given 
 both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question why should it have been such an appealing notion well there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial the foremost is that if we 're blank slates then by
  definition we are equal because zero equals zero equals zero  
 but if something is written on the slate then some people could have more of it than others  and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality  
 another political fear of human nature is that
 if we are blank slates  we can perfect mankind the age old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering
  whereas if we 're born with certain instincts  then perhaps some of them might condemn us to selfishness prejudice and violence 
 well in the book i argue that these are in fact non sequiturs
 and just to make a long story short first of all the concept of fairness is not the same as the concept of sameness and so when thomas jefferson wrote in the
 declaration of independence we hold these truths to be
 self evident that all men are created equal 
 he did not mean we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are clones 
 rather that all men are equal in terms of their rights  and that every person ought to be treated as an individual  and not prejudged by the statistics of particular groups that they may belong to
  even if we were born with certain ignoble motives they don 't automatically lead to ignoble behavior 
 that is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts and some of them can inhibit others 
 for example there 's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense 
 and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history so even if people did have impulses towards
  selfishness or greed that 's not the only thing in the skull  and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them in the book i
 go over controversies such as this one  and a number of other hot buttons hot zones chernobyls third rails and so on
 including the arts cloning crime free will education
  resource depletion social engineering technological risk and war  and needless to say  there were certain risks in taking on
 these subjects when i wrote a first draft of the book i circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments  and
 here are some of the
 reactions that i got better get a security camera
  for your house 
 don 't expect to get any more awards  job offers or positions in scholarly societies 
 tell your publisher not to list your hometown in your author bio
  there was indeed reason to to be nervous and there were moments in which i did feel nervous knowing the history of
 what has happened to people who 've taken controversial
 stands or discovered disquieting findings in the behavioral sciences  there are many cases some of which i talk about in the book of
 people who have been
 slandered  called nazis physically assaulted  threatened with criminal prosecution for
 stumbling across or arguing
 about controversial findings
 and you never know when you 're going to come across one of these booby traps my favorite example is a pair of psychologists who did research on  left handers and published some data showing that  left handers are
  on average more susceptible to disease more prone to accidents and have a shorter lifespan it 's not clear by the way since then whether that is an accurate
 generalization but the data at the time seemed to support that well  pretty soon they were barraged with
 enraged letters  death threats  ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals  coming from irate
  were literally afraid to open their mail because of the
 the venom and vituperation that they had inadvertently inspired  well  the night is young but the book has been out for
 half a year and
 nothing terrible has happened  none of the dire professional consequences has taken place i
  exiled from the city of cambridge but what i wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have
 aroused the strongest response in the 80 odd reviews that the blank slate
 has received i 'll just put that list up for
 a few seconds and see if you can guess which
  reaction in
 the various reviews and radio interviews it 's not violence and war it 's not race  it 's not gender it 's not marxism it 's not nazism 
 they are the arts
 and parenting so let me tell you what
 aroused such irate
  let you decide if whether they the claims are really that outrageous  let me start with the arts
  i note that among the long list of human universals that i presented a few slides ago
 are art there is no society ever discovered in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something that we
 would consider the arts  visual arts decoration of surfaces and bodies appears to be a human universal the telling of stories
  stories  music  dance poetry found in all cultures and many of the
 motifs and themes that
 give us pleasure in the arts can be found in all human societies a preference for symmetrical forms the use of repetition
  and variation even things as specific as the fact that in poetry all over the world you have lines that are very close to three seconds long separated by pauses  
 now 
 on the other hand in the second half of the 20th century  the arts are frequently said to be in decline  and i have a collection probably ten or fifteen headlines from
 highbrow magazines deploring the fact
  that the arts are in decline
 in our time i 'll give you a couple of representative quotes we can assert with some confidence that our own period is one of decline that the standards of culture are lower than they were 
  fifty years ago  and that the evidences of this decline are visible in every department of human activity that 's a quote from t s eliot a little more than fifty years ago  and a more recent one 
  theaters are surviving primarily by commercializing their repertory symphony orchestras are diluting their programs public television is increasing its dependence on reruns of british sitcoms  
  classical radio stations are dwindling museums are resorting to blockbuster shows  dance is dying that 's from robert brustein the famous drama critic and and director in the
  as a surprise to anyone in this room  but by any standard
 they have never been flourishing to a greater extent  there are 
 of course  entirely new art forms and new media many of which you 've heard over these few days by any
 economic standard the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing as you can tell from the
  of opera tickets by the number of books sold by the number of books published the number of
 musical titles released the number of new albums and so on the only grain of truth to this
 complaint that the arts are in decline come from three
 spheres one of them is in
  the kinds of works performed by major symphony orchestras where most of the repertory
 is before one thousand nine hundred and thirty 
 or the works shown in major galleries and prestigious museums 
 in literary criticism and analysis probably forty or fifty years ago  literary critics were a kind of cultural hero  now they 're kind of a national
  humanities and arts programs in the universities which by many measures  indeed are in decline 
 students are staying away in droves  universities are disinvesting in the arts and humanities  
 well here 's a
 diagnosis they didn 't ask me but by their own admission they need all the help that they can get 
 and i would like to suggest that it 's not a coincidence that this supposed decline in the elite arts and criticism
 occurred in the same point in history
  in which there was a widespread denial of human nature 
 a famous quotation can be found if you look on the web you can find it in literally scores of
 english core syllabuses in or about december one thousand nine hundred and ten human nature changed a
 paraphrase of a quote by virginia woolf and there 's
 some debate as to what she actually meant by that but it 's very clear looking
  at these syllabuses 
 that it
 's used now as a way of saying that all
 forms of appreciation of art that were in place for centuries or millennia 
 in the  20th century were discarded the beauty and pleasure in art probably a human universal
 were began to be considered saccharine or kitsch  or commercial
  barnett newman had a famous quote that the impulse of modern art is the desire to destroy beauty which was considered bourgeois or tacky and here 's just
 one example i mean this is perhaps a representative example of
 the visual depiction of the female form in the 15th century  here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the
  you can see  there something has changed in the way the elite arts appeal to the senses  
 indeed in movements of modernism and post modernism 
 there was visual art without beauty  literature without narrative and plot poetry without meter and rhyme  architecture and planning without ornament human scale green space
  music without melody and rhythm and criticism without clarity  attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition 
 laughter let me give just you an example to back up that last statement but here there one of the most famous literary
 english scholars of our time is the berkeley professor judith butler  and here is an example of
 one of her analyses the move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in
  relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure  and marked 
  a shift from the form of althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects well 
  argument in the blank slate was that
 elite art and criticism in the 20th century although not the arts in general have disdained beauty pleasure clarity insight and style 
 people are staying away from elite art and criticism 
 what a puzzle i wonder why  well this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book someone asked me whether i stuck it
  in in order to deflect
 ire from discussions of gender and nazism and race and so on  i won 't
 comment on that  but it certainly
 inspired an energetic reaction from many
 university professors  well the other hot button is parenting and the starting point is the for that discussion
  was the fact that we have all
 been subject to the advice of the parenting industrial complex now here is
 here is a representative quote from a besieged mother i 'm overwhelmed with parenting advice i 'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids so i can instill in them a physical fitness habit so they 'll grow up to be
  and i 'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play so they 'll grow up smart  and there are all kinds of play clay for finger dexterity  word games for reading success  large motor play small 
  motor play i feel like i could devote my life to figuring out what to play with my kids i think anyone who 's recently been a parent can sympathize with this this mother 
  they don 't control for heritability they measure some correlation between what the parents do 
 how the children turn out and assume a causal relation that the parenting shaped the child 
 parents who talk a lot to their kids have kids who grow up to be articulate parents who spank their kids have kids who grow up to be violent and so on and
 very few of them control for the possibility that parents pass on genes for
 increase the chances a child will be articulate or violent and so on 
 until the studies are redone with adoptive children who provide an environment but not genes to their kids we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid  
 the genetically controlled studies have some sobering results 
 remember the mallifert twins separated at birth then they meet in the patent office remarkably similar
  what would have happened if the mallifert twins had grown up together you might think well  then they 'd be even more similar because not only would they share their genes  but they would also share their environment that would make them super similar right  
 wrong identical twins or any siblings who are separated at birth
 are no less similar than if they had grown up together  everything that happens to you in a given home over
  all of those years appears to leave no permanent stamp on your personality or intellect 
 a complementary finding from a completely different methodology is that adopted siblings reared together the mirror image of identical twins reared apart they share their parents their home their neighborhood 
 don 't share their genes end up not similar at all ok two different
 bodies of research with a similar
 what it suggests is that children are shaped not by their parents over the long run  but in part only in part by their genes in part by their culture
  the culture of the country at large and the children 's own culture namely their peer group as we heard from jill sobule earlier today that 's what kids care about
  larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge by chance chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero  chance events as you live your life
