  one in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness  so if it was
 one two three four it 's you sir you yeah with the weird teeth  and you next to him 
 you know who you are actually that whole row isn 't right that 's not good
 hi  yeah  real bad don 't even look at me i am
 one of the one in four  thank you 
 i think i inherit it from my mother who used to crawl around the house on all fours 
 she had two sponges in her hand and then she had two tied to her knees
  she would crawl around behind me going who brings footprints into a building so that was kind of a clue that things weren 't right so
 before i start i would like to thank the makers of lamotrigine sertraline and reboxetine
 because without those few simple chemicals i would not be vertical today
  how did it start 
 my mental illness  well i 'm not even going to talk about my mental illness what am i going to talk about okay
  i always dreamt that when i had my final breakdown it would be because i had a deep kafkaesque existentialist revelation 
 or that maybe cate blanchett would play me and she would win an oscar for
  that 's not what happened i had my breakdown during my daughter 's sports day  there were all the parents
 sitting in a parking lot eating food out of the back of their car only the english
 eating their sausages  they loved their sausages 
 lord and lady rigor mortis were nibbling on the tarmac  and then the gun went
  and all the girlies girlies running running running everybody except for my daughter who was just standing at the starting line just waving
  because she didn 't know she was supposed to run  so
 i i took to my bed for about a month and when i woke up i found i was institutionalized  and when i saw the other
  inmates  i realized that i had found my people my tribe because they became my only friends  they became my friends
 because very few people that i knew well i wasn 't
 sent a lot of cards or flowers i mean if i had had a broken leg or i was with child i would have been inundated but all i got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up
  you know the one thing one thing that you get with this disease this one comes with a package is you get a real sense of shame  
 because your friends go oh come on show me the lump show me the x rays and of course you 've got nothing to show so you 're like really disgusted with yourself
 because you 're thinking i 'm not being carpet bombed i don 't live in a township so you start to hear these abusive voices but you don 't hear one
 abusive voice you hear about a thousand one hundred thousand abusive voices like if the devil had tourette 's that 's what it would sound like but
 we all know in here you know there is no devil there are no voices in your head  
 you know that when you have those abusive voices all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic i want to
  kind of chemical and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape you might have yourself depression 
 oh and that 's not even the tip of the iceberg 
 if you get a little baby and you abuse it verbally its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive
 that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn 't grow  so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic 
 if a soldier sees his friend blown up  his brain goes into such high alarm that he can 't actually put the experience
  into words so he just feels the horror over and over again so here 's my question my question is how come when people have mental damage it 's always an active imagination  
 how come every other organ in your body can get sick and you get sympathy except the brain 
 i 'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain because i know you like that here at ted so if you just give me a minute here  okay  okay let me just say there 's
  good news  there is some good news  first of all let me say we 've come a long long way  
 we started off as a teeny teeny little one celled amoeba tiny just sticking onto a rock  and now
 voila the brain here we go 
 laughter this little baby has a lot of horsepower it
  got the occipital lobe so we can actually
 see the world we got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world here we 've got a little bit of long term memory so you know that night you want to forget when you got really drunk bye bye gone 
 so actually it 's filled with one hundred billion neurons just zizzing away  electrically transmitting information  zizzing zizzing i 'm going to give you
  and for every one i know i drew this myself thank you 
 for every one one single neuron you can actually have from ten thousand to one hundred thousand different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it and every time you learn something or you have an
  that bush grows you know that bush of information can you imagine every human being is carrying that equipment even paris hilton 
 go figure  
 but i got a little bad news for you folks i got some bad news  this isn 't for the one in four this is for the four in four
  we are not equipped for the 21st century evolution did not prepare us for this
  have the bandwidth and for people who say oh they 're having a nice day they 're perfectly fine  they 're more insane than the rest of us 
 because i 'll show you where there might be a few glitches in evolution okay let me just explain this to you when we were ancient man 
 laughter millions of years ago
 and we suddenly felt threatened by a predator  okay we would thank
  we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol and then we 'd kill or be killed we 'd eat or we 'd be eaten and then suddenly we 'd de fuel and we 'd go back to normal 
 okay so the problem is nowadays with modern man 
 when we feel in danger we still fill up with our own chemical but because we can 't kill traffic wardens
 or eat estate agents 
 the fuel just stays in our body over and over so we 're in a constant state of alarm a constant state and here 's another thing that happened about one hundred and fifty thousand years ago when language came online  we started to put 
  words to this constant emergency so it wasn 't just oh my god there 's a saber toothed tiger which could be it was suddenly oh my god i didn 't send the email oh my god my thighs are too fat oh my god everybody can see i 'm stupid
  invited to the christmas party so you 've got this nagging loop tape that goes
 over and over again that drives you insane  so you see what the problem is what once made you safe now drives you insane  
 i 'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but somebody has to be 
 your pets are happier than you are
  happy happy happy human beings screwed
