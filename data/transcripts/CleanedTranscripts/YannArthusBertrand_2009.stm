  big impact on the planet
 to travel here by plane  i emitted in the atmosphere  nine tons of co2 
  the weight of two elephants  i came here to speak about ecology  and i emitted
 as much co2 as a frenchman
 in one year  so what do i have to do i have to kill a frenchman when i come back at home i have
 to do my carbon offset in another way like i do every time 
 in fact my work
  is to show
 our impact
 on our planet  
 i 'm going to show you some examples of the last pictures i 've done in the last year  
 alberta sand oil a lot of pollution you know the
  we don 't want to believe what we know 
 in alberta people work nonstop
 by seven to extract as much oil as they can we know about the end of oil oil sand
 is not a long term solution but we use three times more oil
 than we find every year
  we don 't want to believe what we know  deny coral reef in new caledonia one hundred percent
 of the coral
 may be wiped out before two thousand and fifty because of global warming 
 and you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea
  north pole i 've done this picture last summer it was impossible to do this picture fifteen years ago now there is a new way open
 between atlantic and pacific  the thickness
 of the arctic decreased
  a new face of kilimanjaro without ice  
 sad picture it lost eighty percent of its ice  according to scientists in one hundred years
 all the mountain glacier will be gone glaciers
  are very important for the life on earth like al gore told you two billion people
 live on the water from the glacier of himalaya  
 return of fish men one fifth of human kind
 depend on fish to live 
 today now seventy percent of the fish stock
  if we don 't change our system of fishing
 the main sea resources will be gone in two thousand and fifty  we don 't want to believe what we know 
 the beautiful picture
 in africa  one human of six have not enough to eat in the world  one billion people have not enough to eat
  in africa  corn is one of the main foods in many places here in america 
 ninety percent of the corn
 cultivated is used to feed animals or to do oil  
 palm tree plantation in borneo every year
 we lose fifty thousand square miles in
  deforestation  
 refugee camp in darfur 
 today we have twenty million refugees in the world  according to the u n 
 we speak about two hundred and fifty 
 in two thousand and fifty 
 i always
  show my pictures in the street  we have done already one hundred exhibitions in the cities  but how to understand the world
 without the voice of people  landscape was not enough 
 it was obvious to me to do another work  i launched a
  i sent around the world six cameramen asking the same question the
 same crucial question about life  we have done five thousand interviews  
 i 'm going to show you this
  i had a big laugh today
  i was to go back to iraq and speak to the people i 'd have to bow down and kiss their feet just as that woman tried to kiss my feet
 when we were taking her sons i feel ashamed and i feel humbled
 by their strength  and i will forever feel a need to make
  reparations to iraq
  seven years now of being in a wheelchair i 've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair i still surf i sail
  the world i freedive  after many people said i couldn 't do that 
 and i think that comes from connecting with nature connecting with the energy of life 
 because we 're all disabled in some way on the planet spiritually mentally or physically  
 i got the easy part
  now i am going to speak to you about my movie  for the last three years i was shooting
 the earth for the movie  the name of the movie is home maison it
 is about the state of the planet it 's a fantastic story of life on the
  proud to show you the teaser video this earth
 is four and a half billion years old  
 these plants  several hundred million years old 
  and we humans have been walking upright for only two hundred thousand years 
 we 've managed to adapt and have conquered the whole planet 
 for generations  we 've been raising our children not unlike millions of other species living beside us  
 for the past thirty years i 've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from high up in the
  sky our life is tied to the well being of our planet  we depend on water 
 forests deserts  
 oceans  
 fishing breeding
  are still the world 's foremost human occupations  
 and what binds us together
 is far greater than what divides us  we all share the same need for the earth 's gifts
 the same wish to rise above ourselves  and become better and yet
 we carry on raising walls to keep us apart
 today our greatest battle is to protect the natural offerings of our planet  in less than fifty years we 've altered it more thoroughly than in the entire history of mankind  
 half of the world 's forests have vanished  water resources are running low  intensive farming is depleting
  our energy sources are not sustainable the climate is changing we are endangering ourselves we
 're only trying to improve our lives but
 the wealth gaps are growing wider we haven 't yet understood
 that we 're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain
  we know that solutions are available today 
 we all have the power to change this trend for the better
 so what are we waiting for
  not a normal movie  
 the film is going to be distributed free
 this film has no copyright on the five of june
 the environment day  everybody can download the movie on internet  the film is given
 for free to the distributor for tv and theater to show it the fifth of june
 is no business on this movie it is also available for school
  i would like to
