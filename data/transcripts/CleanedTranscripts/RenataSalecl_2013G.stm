  when i was preparing for this talk i went to search for a couple of quotes that i can share with you 
 good news  i found three that i particularly liked 
 the first by samuel
  when making your choice in life  do not forget to live 
 the second by aeschylus who reminded us that happiness is a choice that requires effort 
 and the third is one by groucho marx who said i wouldn 't want to choose to belong to any club that would have me
 as a member
  i didn 't know which one of these quotes to choose and share with you the sweet anxiety of choice in today 's times of
  endless progress  
 but the underside of this ideology has been an increase of anxiety feelings of guilt
  it appears that this ideology
 was actually very efficient in pacifying us as political and social thinkers instead of making social critiques we are more and more engaging in 
 sometimes to the point of
  is still so powerful even among people who have not many things to choose among how come that even
 people who are poor
 very much still identify with the idea
 of choice the kind of rational idea of choice which we embrace 
 now the ideology of choice is very successful in
 us a space to think about some imagined future  
 let me give you an example  my friend manya when she was a student at university in california was earning money
 by working for a car dealer now manya when she encountered the
  would debate with him about his lifestyle how much
 he wants to spend  how many children he has what does he need the car for they would usually come to a good conclusion what would be a
 perfect car 
 now before  manya 's customer would go home and think things through 
 she would say to him the car that you are buying now is perfect 
 but in a few year 's time
  your kids will be already out of the house when you will have a little bit more money 
 that other car will be ideal  but what you are buying now is great 
 now  the majority of manya 's customers who came back the next day bought that other car 
 the car they did not need the car that cost far too much money
  successful in selling cars that soon she moved on to selling airplanes 
 laughter and
 knowing so much about the psychology of people prepared her well for her current job which is that of a psychoanalyst  
 now  why were
  's success was
 that she was able to open in their heads an image of an idealized future 
 an image of themselves when they
 are already more successful freer  and for them choosing that other car was as if they are coming closer to this ideal in which it was
  we rarely make really totally rational choices choices are influenced by our unconscious 
 by our community  we 're often choosing
 by guessing what would other people think about our choice  also we are choosing by looking at what others are choosing we
 're also guessing
  we actually even after we have already chosen like bought a car  
 endlessly read reviews about cars as if we still want to convince ourselves that we made the right choice  
 now  choices are
  they are linked to risks  losses they are highly unpredictable  now because of this
 have now more and more problems that they are not choosing anything  
 not long ago i was at a wedding reception  
 and i met a young beautiful woman who immediately started telling me about her anxiety over choice  
 she said to me i needed one month to decide which dress to wear
  for weeks i was researching which hotel to stay for this one night
  and now  i need to choose a sperm donor 
 i looked at this woman in shock sperm donor what 's the rush 
 she said i 'm turning forty at the end of this year  and i 've been so bad in choosing men in my life
 choice  because it 's linked to risk is 
 and it was already the famous
 danish philosopher sren kierkegaard who pointed out that
 anxiety is linked to the possibility of possibility 
 now we think today that we can prevent these risks we have endless market analysis
 projections of the future earnings even with market which is about chance
 randomness  we think we can predict rationally where it 's going  
 now chance is actually becoming very traumatic  
 last year  my friend bernard harcourt
 at the university of chicago organized an event a conference on
  of chance he and i were together on the panel and just before delivering our papers we didn 't know each other 's papers
 we decided to take chance seriously so we informed our audience
 that what they will just now hear will be a random paper  a mixture of the two papers which
  i read my second paragraph in this way towards the end of our papers now you will be surprised that a majority of our audience
 did not think that what they 'd just listened to was a completely random paper
  couldn 't believe that speaking from the position of authority like two professors we were we would take
 chance seriously they thought we prepared the papers together and were just joking that it 's random  
 now  we live in times with a lot of information  big data
  a lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies we decoded our genome we know about our brains more than before 
 but surprisingly people are more and more turning a blind eye in front of this knowledge 
 ignorance and denial are on the rise 
 now in regard to the current economic crisis  we think
 that we will just wake up again and everything will be the same as before and no political or
 changes are needed in regard to ecological crisis we think
 nothing needs to be done just now  or others need to act before us 
 or even when ecological crisis already happens like a catastrophe in fukushima often we have people living in the same environment with the same amount of
  half of them will be anxious
 about radiation and half of them will ignore it  now  psychoanalysts know very well
 that people surprisingly don 't have passion for knowledge
 but passion for ignorance  
 now what does that mean  let 's say when we are facing a life threatening illness 
 a lot of people don 't want to know that they 'd rather prefer denying
  illness which is why it 's not so wise to inform them if they don 't ask 
 surprisingly research shows that sometimes people who deny their illness live longer
 than those who are rationally choosing the best treatment  now  this ignorance however is not
  on the level of the social when we are ignorant about where we are heading  a lot of social damage can be caused 
 now on top of facing ignorance we are also facing today
 some kind of an obviousness  
 now  it was french philosopher louis althusser who pointed out that ideology functions in such a way
  necessary really to lift that veil of obviousness and to think through a little bit differently  
 if we go back to this ideology of individual rational choice
 we often embrace it 's necessary precisely here to lift this obviousness
 and to think a little bit differently  now for me
 a question often is why we still embrace this 
  man on which capitalism relied from its beginning  
 why do we think that we are really such masters of our lives that we can rationally make the best ideal choices that we don 't accept losses
  shocking to see sometimes very poor people for example not supporting the idea of
 the rich being taxed more 
 quite often here they still identify with a certain kind of a lottery mentality okay maybe they don 't think that they will make it
 in the future but maybe they think my son might become the next bill gates  and who would want to tax
  a question for me is also why would people who have no health insurance not embrace universal healthcare 
 sometimes they don 't embrace it again identifying with the idea of choice  but they have nothing to choose from 
 now  margaret thatcher famously said
 that there is nothing like a society society doesn 't exist it is only individuals and their families
 sadly  this ideology still
 functions very well 
 which is why people who are poor might feel ashamed for their poverty we might endlessly feel guilty that we are not making the right choices and that 's why we didn 't succeed 
 we are anxious that we are not good enough that 's why we work very hard  long hours at the workplace and equally long hours
  on remaking ourselves 
 now when we are anxious over choices  sometimes we easily give our power of choice away  we identify with the guru who tells us what to do self help
 therapist or we embrace a totalitarian leader who appears to have no doubts about choices who sort of knows  
 now  often people ask me
  me what did you learn by studying choice and there is an important message that i did learn 
 when thinking about choices  i stopped taking choices too seriously  personally 
 first i realized a lot of choice i make is not rational it
 's linked to my unconscious my guesses of what others are choosing or what is a socially
 embraced choice
 i also
 embrace the idea that we should go beyond thinking about individual choices that it 's very important to rethink social choices  
 since this ideology of individual choice has pacified us it really prevented us to think about social change  we spend so much time choosing things for ourselves
 and barely reflect on communal choices we can make now we should
  not forget that choice is always linked to change we can make individual changes but we can make social changes  
 we can choose to have
 more wolves  we can choose to change our environment to have more bees we can choose to have different rating
  we can choose to control corporations instead of allowing corporations to control us 
 we have a possibility to make changes  
 now i started with a quote from samuel johnson  who said that when we make choice in life we shouldn 't forget to live
  finally  you can see i did have a choice to choose one of the three quotes with which
 i wanted to start my lecture i did have a choice
  such as nations as people we have choices too to rethink in what kind of society we want to live in the future  thank you
