  you had to register it with the government 
 you had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter  and this was done so the government
 could track where the text was coming from if they found a paper
 which had the wrong kind of thought  they could track down who created that thought  
 and we in the west
 couldn 't understand
 how anybody would do this how much this would restrict freedom of speech we would never do that in our own countries  
 but today  in two thousand and eleven if you go
 and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page that page will end up having
  slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you
 and to your printer 
 this is happening to us
 today  
 and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it and this is an example of the ways
  our own governments are using technology
 against us the citizens  
 and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today  if we look at what 's really happening in the online world we can group the attacks based on the attackers  
 we have three main groups 
 we have online criminals like here we have
 from the city of kiev in ukraine  and the motives of online criminals
 are very easy to understand these guys make money they use online attacks to make lots of money and lots and lots of it 
 we actually have several cases of millionaires online 
  and so on and so on these guys make their fortunes
 online but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking
 with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer 
 the us secret service two months ago froze the swiss bank account of mr sam jain right here  
 and that bank account had fourteen point nine million us dollars in it when it was frozen 
 mr jain himself is on the loose nobody knows where he is
  and i claim it 's already today
 that it 's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than
 here in the real world and it 's very obvious  that this is only going to get worse in the future the majority of crime
 will be happening
  the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money they 're motivated by something else
 motivated by protests motivated by an opinion 
 motivated by the laughs  groups like anonymous have risen up over the last
 twelve months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks so those are the three main attackers
  criminals who do it for the money  hacktivists like anonymous doing it for the protest  
 but then the last group are nation states governments doing the attacks
  and then we look at cases like what happened in diginotar  this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens
 is a certificate authority from the netherlands or actually it was it was running into bankruptcy last
 fall because they were hacked into  somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly  
 and i asked
 last week in a meeting with
 dutch government representatives i asked
 one of the leaders of the team
 whether he found plausible that people died because of the diginotar hack 
 and his answer was yes so how do people die
 as the result of a hack like this well diginotar is a ca they sell
  sell certificates  what do you do with certificates  well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https  ssl encrypted services 
 services like
 gmail  now we all or a big part of us use gmail or one of their competitors but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states
 like iran where dissidents
 use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over ssl connections so the local government can 't snoop
 on their discussions  except they can if they hack into a foreign ca and issue rogue certificates  and this is exactly
 what happened with the case of diginotar
  what about arab arab spring and things that have been happening for example in egypt well
 in egypt the rioters looted the headquarters of the egyptian secret police in april two thousand and eleven  and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers among those papers was this binder
  and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold to the
 egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting
 at a very large scale all the communication of the citizens of the country 
 they had sold this tool for two hundred and eighty thousand euros to the egyptian government the company headquarters are right
  so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens  
 but western governments are doing it to themselves as well  for example in germany  just a couple of weeks ago the 
  was found which was a trojan used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens  if you are
 a suspect in a criminal case well it 's pretty obvious your phone will
  be tapped but today it goes beyond that they will tap your internet connection they will even use tools like state trojan to infect your computer with a trojan which enables them
 to watch all your communication to listen to your online discussions to collect your passwords
  and this is an
  in two thousand and eleven
