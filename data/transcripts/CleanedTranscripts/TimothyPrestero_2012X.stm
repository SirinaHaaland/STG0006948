  i 've got a great idea that 's going to change the world  it 's fantastic it 's going to blow your mind  
 it 's my beautiful baby here 's the thing  everybody loves a beautiful baby i mean i was a beautiful baby  
 here 's me and my dad a couple days after i was born  so in the world of product design the beautiful baby 's like the concept car
  it 's the knockout  you see it and you go oh my god i 'd buy that in a second 
 so why is it that this year 's new cars look pretty much exactly like last year 's new cars 
 what went wrong between the design studio and the factory today  i don 't want to talk about beautiful babies i want to talk about the awkward adolescence of design
  those sort of
 dorky teenage years where you 're trying to figure out how the world works i 'm
 going to start with an example from some work that we did on newborn health  so here 's a problem  four million babies
 around the world mostly in developing countries 
 die every year before their first birthday even before their first month of life  it turns out half of those kids or about one point eight million newborns around the world would make it
 if you could just keep them warm for the first three days
 maybe the first week  so this is a newborn intensive care unit in kathmandu nepal all of these kids in blankets belong in incubators something like this
 this is a donated japanese atom incubator that we found in a nicu in kathmandu  
 this is what we want probably what happened is a hospital in japan upgraded their equipment and donated their old stuff to
 to nepal the problem is
  technicians  without spare parts donations like this very quickly turn into junk  
 so this seemed like a problem that we could do something about  keeping a baby warm for a week that
 's not rocket science  so
 we got started we partnered with a leading medical research institution here in boston  
 we conducted months of user research overseas trying to think like designers human centered design let 's figure
  out what people want 
 we killed thousands of post it notes  we made dozens of prototypes to get to this  
 so this is the neonurture infant incubator and this has a lot of smarts built into it and we felt great so the idea here is unlike the concept car we want to marry something beautiful with something that
  and our idea is that this design would inspire manufacturers and other people of influence to take this model and run with it 
 here 's the bad news 
 the only baby ever actually put inside the neonurture incubator
 was this kid during a time magazine photo shoot  
 so recognition is fantastic  we want design to get out for people to see it it won lots of awards  
 but it felt like a booby prize
 we wanted to make beautiful things that are going to make the world a better place
  and i don 't think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm so it turns out that design for inspiration
 doesn doesn 't really  i guess what i would say is for us for what i want to do  it 's either too slow
  or it just doesn 't work it 's ineffective so really 
 i want to design for outcomes i don 't want to make beautiful stuff i want to make the world a better place  
 so when we were designing neonurture we paid a lot of attention to the people who are going to use this thing for example poor families  rural doctors overloaded nurses
  even repair technicians  we thought we had all our bases covered we 'd done everything right well it turns out there 's this whole constellation of people who have to be involved in a product for it to be successful manufacturing
  distribution regulation 
 michael free at path says you have to figure out who will choose use and pay the dues for a product like this and i have to ask the question that
 vcs always ask sir what is your business and who is your customer who is our customer  
 well here 's an example this is a bangladeshi hospital director
 outside his facility it turns out he doesn 't buy any of his equipment those decisions are made by the ministry of health
 or by foreign donors and it just kind of shows up  similarly here 's a multinational 
 turns out they 've got to fish where the fish are 
 so it turns out that in emerging markets where the fish are are the emerging middle class of these countries diseases of affluence heart disease infertility 
  turns out that design for outcomes
 in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution  ok that was an important lesson second  
 we took that lesson and tried to push it into our next project so we started by finding a manufacturer an organization called mtts in vietnam 
 that manufactures newborn care technologies for southeast asia  our other partner is east meets west an american foundation that distributes that technology to poor hospitals
 around that region
 we started with them saying well what do you want what 's a problem you want to solve and they said let 's work on newborn jaundice 
 so this is another one of these  mind boggling global problems jaundice affects two thirds of newborns
 around the world 
 of those newborns one in ten roughly  if it 's not treated the jaundice gets so severe that it leads to either
  even die there
 's one way to treat jaundice  and that 's what 's called an exchange transfusion so as you can imagine that 's expensive and a little bit dangerous 
 there is another cure  it 's very
 technological it 's very complex a little daunting you 've got to shine blue light on the kid 
 bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover
  how is this a hard problem 
 i went to mit  ok we 'll figure that out 
 laughter so here 's an example this is an overhead phototherapy device that 's designed for american hospitals  and here 's how it 's supposed to be used it 's
 over the baby  illuminating a single patient take it out of an american hospital send it overseas to a crowded facility in asia here 's how
  actually used the effectiveness of phototherapy is a function of light intensity these dark blue squares show you where it 's effective phototherapy 
 here 's what it looks like under actual use  so those kids on the edges aren 't actually receiving effective phototherapy but without training  
 without some kind of light meter how would you know  
 we see other examples of problems like this here 's a neonatal intensive care unit where moms come in to visit their babies
 keep in mind that mom maybe just had a c section so that 's already kind of a bummer 
 mom 's visiting her kid she sees her baby naked lying under some blue lights looking kind of vulnerable 
 it 's not uncommon for mom to put a blanket over the baby  
 from a phototherapy standpoint  maybe not the best behavior in fact that sounds
  what we 've learned is that there 's no such thing as a dumb user
 there are only dumb products  we have to think like existentialists it 's not the painting we would have painted  it 's the painting that we actually painted  it 's the use
 designed for actual use how are people actually going to use this  
 so  similarly  when we think about our partner mtts they 've made some amazing technologies for treating newborn illnesses so here 's an overhead warmer and a cpap
 really rugged they 've treated fifty thousand kids in vietnam with this technology but here 's the problem 
 every doctor in the world every hospital administrator has seen tv curse those er reruns 
 turns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like they want buck rogers they don 't want
  it sounds crazy it sounds dumb but there are actually hospitals who would rather have no equipment than something that looks cheap and crummy  
 so again  if we want people to trust a device it has to look trustworthy so thinking about outcomes it turns out appearances matter 
 we took all that information together we tried this time to get it right  and here 's what we developed this is the firefly phototherapy device
  except this time  we didn 't stop at the concept car 
 from the very beginning we started by talking to manufacturers  our goal is to make a state of the art product that our partner mtts can actually manufacture our goal is 
  to study how they work the resources they have access to so that they can make this product so
 single bassinet it only fits a single baby  and the idea here is it 's obvious how you ought to use this device if you try to put more than one kid in you 're stacking them on top of each other 
 so
 the idea here is you want to make it hard to use wrong in other words you want to make the right way to use it the easiest way to use it another example
 again  silly mom  silly mom thinks her baby looks cold wants to put a blanket over the baby that 's why we have lights above and below the baby in firefly so if mom
  does put a blanket over the baby it 's still receiving effective phototherapy from below 
 last story here 
 i 've got a friend in india who told me that you haven 't really tested a piece of electronic technology for distribution in in asia  until you 've trained a cockroach to climb in and pee on every single little component on the inside you think
 it 's funny  i had a laptop in the peace corps and
  had all these dead pixels on it and one day i looked in they were all dead ants that had gotten into my laptop and perished those poor ants 
 so with firefly what we did is the problem is electronics get hot 
 and you have to put in vents or fans to keep them cool in most products  
 we decided we can 't put a do not enter sign next to the vent we actually got rid of all that stuff so firefly 's totally sealed
  these are the kinds of lessons as awkward as it was to be a pretty goofy teenager 
 much worse to be a frustrated designer so i was thinking what i really want to do is change the world  i have to pay attention to manufacturing and distribution  i have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use a device  
 i actually have to pay attention there 's no excuse for failure i have to think like an existentialist i have to accept that there are no dumb users only dumb products
  to ask ourselves hard questions are we designing for the world that we want 
 are we designing for the world that we have are we designing for the world that 's coming whether we 're ready or not i got into this business
 designing products  i 've since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world you have to design outcomes  and that 's design that matters  thank you
