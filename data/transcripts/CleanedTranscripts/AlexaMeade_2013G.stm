  take a closer look there 's more to this painting than meets the eye  
 and yes it 's an acrylic painting of a man  but i didn 't paint it on canvas  i painted it directly on top of the man
  altogether  and if i want to paint your portrait  i 'm painting it on you  physically on you that also means you 're probably going to end up with an earful of paint
 because i need to paint your ear on your ear  
 everything in this scene the person the clothes  chairs  wall  gets covered in a mask of paint
 that mimics what 's directly below it and in this way i 'm able to take a
 three dimensional scene
 and make it look like a two dimensional painting  i can photograph it from any angle  and it will still look 2d 
 there 's no photoshop here this is just a photo of one of my three dimensional paintings you
 might be wondering how i came up with this idea of turning people into paintings  but originally this had nothing
  do with either people or paint it was about shadows
  i was fascinated with the absence of light  and i wanted to find a way that i could give it materiality and pin it down before it changed  
 i came up with the idea of painting shadows  i loved that i could hide within this shadow my own painted version  
 and it would be almost invisible
 until the light changed
  all of a sudden my shadow would be brought to the light  
 i wanted to think about what else i could put shadows on  
 and i thought of my friend bernie  
 but i didn 't just want to paint the shadows  i also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale  
 i had a very specific vision of what this would look like and as i was painting him  i made sure to follow that very
  closely  but something kept on flickering before my eyes  i wasn 't quite sure what i was looking at and then when i took that moment to take a step back  
 magic  
 i had turned my friend into a painting i couldn 't have foreseen that when i wanted to paint a shadow i would pull out this whole other
  that i would collapse it that i would take a painting and make it my friend
 and then bring him back to a painting 
 i was a little conflicted though  because i was so excited about what i 'd found  but i was just about to graduate from college with a degree in political science  
 and i 'd always had this dream
 of going to washington d c and sitting at
  why did this have to get in the way of all that i made the tough decision of
 going home after graduation
 and not going up to capitol hill  but going down to my parents ' basement
 and making it my job to learn how to paint  
 i had no idea where to begin the last time i 'd painted  i was sixteen years old at summer camp
 and i didn 't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and
 practicing over and over again on that surface  because that 's not what this project was about for me it was about space and light 
 my early canvases ended up being things that you wouldn 't expect to be used as canvas like fried food  it 's nearly impossible
  impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg 
 even harder was getting paint to stick to the acid in a grapefruit  it just
 would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink i 'd put something down and instantly it would be gone  and if i wanted to paint on
  i was a little bit embarrassed to bring people down into my studio and show them that i spent my days in a basement putting paint on toast 
 it just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself 
 one of my favorite models actually ended up being a retired old man who not only didn 't mind sitting still and getting the paint in his
  he also didn 't really have much embarrassment about being taken out into very public places for exhibition like the metro  
 i was having so much fun with this process
  i was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles and
 i wanted to see what else i could do with it 
 i came together with a collaborator sheila vand  and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface
  and that was milk  
 we got a pool we filled it with milk  we filled it with sheila  and i began painting 
 and the images were always completely unexpected in the end  
 because i could have a very specific image about how it would turn out i could paint it to match that but the moment that sheila laid back into the milk everything would change 
 it was in constant flux
 and we had to rather than fight it embrace it see where the milk would take us and compensate to make it even better  
 sometimes  when sheila would lay down in the milk  it would wash all the paint off of her arms  
 and it might seem a little bit clumsy  but our solution would be okay hide your
  one time she got so much milk in her hair that it just smeared all the paint off of her face all right well  hide your face  and
 we ended up with something far more elegant than we could have imagined  
 even though this is essentially the same solution that a frustrated kid uses when he can 't draw hands just hiding them in the pockets  
 when we started out on the milk
  and when i started out i couldn 't have foreseen that i would go from pursuing my dream in politics and working at a desk
 to tripping over a shadow
 and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk  
 but then again i guess it 's also not unforeseeable that you can find the strange in the familiar as long as you 're willing to look beyond what 's already been brought to light that you can see what 's below the surface hiding in the shadows
  shadows  and recognize that there can be more there than meets the eye  thank you
