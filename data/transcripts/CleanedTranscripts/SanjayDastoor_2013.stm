  today i 'm going to show you an electric vehicle
 that weighs less than a bicycle that
 you can carry with you anywhere that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in fifteen minutes and you can run it for one thousand
  kilometers
 on about a dollar of electricity  
 but when i say the word electric vehicle 
 people think about vehicles they think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles and the vehicles that you use every day  but if you come about it from a different perspective 
 you can create some more interesting
  more novel concepts  so we built something
 i 've got some of the pieces in my pocket here so this is the
  motor 
 this motor has enough power to take you up the hills of san francisco at about twenty miles per hour about thirty kilometers an hour  
 and this battery 
 this battery right here has about six miles of range or ten kilometers which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the u s 
  but the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store 
 these are from remote control airplanes 
 and the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently you can really change things so today we 're going to show you one example of how you can use this 
 pay attention to not only how fun this thing is but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change
  the way you interact with a city like san francisco
  show you what this thing can do it
 's really maneuverable you have a hand held remote so you can pretty easily control acceleration braking  go in reverse if you like 
 also have braking
  it 's incredible just how light this thing is i mean this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go so
 i 'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles this uses twenty times less energy
 for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car 
 which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build  but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use
  terms of your transportation  so instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city now you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation  
 so next time you think about a vehicle i hope like us you 're thinking about something new
