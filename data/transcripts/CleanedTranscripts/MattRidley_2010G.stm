  when i was a student here in oxford in the 1970s the future of the world was bleak 
 the population explosion was unstoppable global famine was inevitable a cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives 
 the acid rain
  was falling on the forests the desert was advancing by a mile or two a year the oil was running out and a nuclear winter would finish us off 
 none of those things happened 
 and astonishingly if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime the average per capita income
 of the average person on the planet  in real terms adjusted for inflation has tripled
  lifespan is up by thirty percent in my lifetime  child mortality is down by 
  per capita food production
 is up by a third and all this at a time when the population has doubled 
 how did we achieve that whether you think it 's a good thing or not how did we achieve that how did we become the only species
 that becomes more prosperous as it becomes more populous
  the size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population and the level of the graph represents gdp per capita 
 i think to answer that question you need to understand how human beings
 bring together their brains and enable their ideas to combine and recombine to meet and indeed to mate  
  need to understand how ideas have sex 
 i want you to imagine how we got from making objects like this
 to making objects like this 
 these are both real objects one is an acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago of the kind made by homo erectus 
 the other is obviously a computer mouse  they 're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny
  i 've tried to work out which is bigger and it 's almost impossible  
 and that 's because they 're both designed to fit the human hand they 're both technologies in the end their similarity is not that interesting it just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand  the differences are what interest me 
  because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design for about a million years from one and a half million years ago to half a million years ago 
  thirty thousand generations of
 course there were a few changes but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days  
 there was no progress no innovation it 's an extraordinary phenomenon but it 's true whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years  
 and there 's another difference too which is the object on the left is made from one substance 
 the object on the right is made from a confection of different substances from silicon and metal and plastic and so on and
  more than that it 's a confection of different ideas the idea of plastic the idea of a laser the idea of transistors  they 've all been combined together in this technology  
 and it 's this combination this cumulative technology that intrigues me  because i think it 's the secret to understanding
 what 's happening in the world 
 my body 's an accumulation of ideas too the idea of skin cells the idea of brain cells the idea of liver cells  they 've come together how does evolution do cumulative
  combinatorial things well it uses sexual reproduction  
 in an asexual species if you get two different mutations in different creatures a green one and a red one  then one has to be better than the other one goes extinct for the other to survive  
 but if you have a sexual species  then it 's possible for an individual to inherit both mutations from different
  so what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species  it 's not confined to its own lineage what 's the process that 's having the same effect in cultural evolution
 as sex is having in biological evolution and i think the answer is exchange the habit of exchanging one thing for another it 's a unique human feature
  no other animal does it you can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange and indeed there 's reciprocity in other animals but the exchange of one object for another never happens as adam smith said no man 
  ever saw a dog make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog 
 you can have culture without exchange  you can have as it were asexual culture chimpanzees killer whales these kinds of creatures they have culture 
 they teach each other traditions which are handed down from parent to offspring in this case chimpanzees teaching each other
  to crack nuts with rocks but the difference is that
 these cultures never expand never grow never accumulate never become combinatorial  and the reason is because there is no sex as it were there is no
 exchange of ideas chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops there 's no exchange of ideas between them 
 and why does exchange raise living standards well the answer came from david ricardo in
  seventeen and here is a stone age version of his story although he told it in terms of trade between countries 
 adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe so oz is better at both spears and axes than adam he doesn 't need adam 
 he can make his own spears and axes well no because if you think about it if oz makes two
 spears and adam make two axes and then they trade 
 then they will each have saved an hour of work and the more they do this the more true it 's going to be 
 because the more they do this the better adam is going to get at making axes and the better oz is going to get at making spears  so the gains from trade are only going to grow and this is one of the beauties of exchange is it actually creates 
  the momentum for more specialization which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on 
  time in satisfying your needs ask yourself how long you would have to work to
 provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by 
 if you had to start from scratch let 's say you go out into the countryside you find a sheep you kill it you get the fat out of it you render it down you make a candle etc etc how long is it going to take you quite
  long time how long do you actually have to work to
 earn an hour of reading light if you 're on the average wage in britain today  and the answer is about half a second  
 back in one thousand nine hundred and fifty you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light 
 and that 's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you 've gained since one thousand nine hundred and fifty as it were because that 's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else  or you can acquire acquire another
  it would have been fifteen minutes to earn that amount of light on the average wage back in one thousand eight hundred  you 'd have had to work six hours to earn a candle that could burn for an hour 
 in other words the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in one thousand eight hundred 
 go back to this image of the axe and the mouse and ask yourself who made them and for who the stone axe was made by someone for himself it
  days  but the object on the right was made for me by other people 
 how many other people tens hundreds thousands you know
 i think it 's probably millions  
 because you 've got to include the man who grew the coffee which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig who was drilling for oil which was going to be made into the plastic etc they were all working for me 
 to make a mouse for me
 that 's the way society works that 's what
 we 've achieved as a species  
 in the old days if you were rich you literally had people working for you that 's how you got to be rich you employed them louis xiv had a lot of people working for him they made his silly outfits like this and
 they did his silly hairstyles or whatever he had four hundred and ninety eight people to prepare his dinner every night
  a modern tourist going around the palace of versailles and looking at louis xiv 's pictures 
 he has four hundred and ninety eight people doing his dinner tonight too they 're in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over paris  and they 're all ready to serve you at an hour 's notice with an excellent meal that 's probably got higher quality than louis xiv even had  
 and that 's what we 've done because we 're all working for each other we 're able to to draw upon specialization and exchange to
  raise each other 's living standards 
 now  you do get other animals working for each other too  
 ants are a classic example workers work for queens and queens work for workers but there 's a big difference which is that it only happens within the colony there 's no working for each other across the colonies  and the reason 
  for that is because there 's a reproductive division of labor that is to say they specialize with respect to
  the queen does it all in our species we don 't like doing that it 's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves is reproduction 
 even in england  we don 't leave reproduction to the queen 
 so when did this habit start and how long has it been going on and what does it mean well  i think probably the oldest version of this is
 probably the sexual division of labor but i 've got no evidence for that it just looks like the first thing we did was work male for female and female for male 
 in all hunter gatherer societies today  there 's a foraging division of labor between 
 on the whole hunting males and gathering females it isn 't always quite that simple but there 's a distinction between specialized roles for males and females 
 and the beauty of this system
 is that it benefits both sides 
  the woman knows that in the hadzas ' case here digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat and
 she doesn 't have to go on an exhausting hunt and try and kill a warthog and the man knows that he doesn 't have to do any digging to get
 roots all he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog it 's big enough to share some 
 and so both sides raise each other 's standards of living through the sexual division of labor when did this happen
 we don 't know but it 's possible that neanderthals didn 't do this  
 they were a highly cooperative species  they were a highly intelligent species their brains on average by the end were bigger than yours and mine in this room today  
 they were imaginative they buried their dead they had language  probably because we know they had the foxp2 gene of the same kind as us which was discovered here in oxford 
 and so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills they were brilliant people i 'm not dissing the
  neanderthals 
 but there 's no evidence of a sexual division of labor there 's no evidence of gathering behavior by females it looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men  
 and the other thing there 's no evidence for is exchange between groups  because
 the
 objects that you find in neanderthal remains the tools they made are always made from local materials
  for example in the caucasus there 's a site where you find local neanderthal tools they 're always made from local chert  
 in the same valley there are modern human remains from about the same date thirty thousand years ago  
 and some of those are from local chert but more but many of them are made from obsidian from a long way away  
 and when human beings began moving objects around like this  it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups trade
  is ten times as old as farming people forget that people think of trade as a modern thing exchange between groups has been going on for a hundred thousand years  
 and the earliest evidence for it crops up somewhere between eighty and one hundred and twenty thousand years ago in africa when you see obsidian and jasper and other things moving long distances in
  you also see seashells
 as discovered by a team here in oxford moving one hundred and twenty five miles inland from the mediterranean in algeria  
 and that 's evidence that people have started exchanging between groups and that will have led to specialization 
 how do you know that long distance movement means trade rather than migration well you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals who quarried for stone axes at a place called mount isa which was a
 quarry owned by the kalkadoon tribe
  traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs  and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of australia  
 so long distance movement of tools is a sign of trade not migration 
 what happens when you cut people off from exchange 
 from the the ability to exchange and specialize  and the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress  you can actually throw it into reverse
  an example is tasmania when the sea level rose and tasmania became an island ten thousand years ago the people on it not only experienced slower progress than than people on the mainland they actually experienced regress  
 they gave up the ability to make stone tools and fishing equipment and clothing
 because the population of about four thousand people was simply not large enough to maintain the specialized skills necessary to keep the
  technology they had it 's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island how many of the things in our pockets could we continue to make after ten thousand years  
 it didn 't happen in tierra del fuego
 similar island similar people 
 the reason because tierra del fuego is separated from south america by a much narrower straight and there was trading contact across that straight throughout ten thousand years  
 the tasmanians were isolated
  go back to this image again and ask yourself not only who made it and for who but who knew how to make it in
 the case of the stone axe the man who made it knew how to make it but who knows how to make a computer mouse  
 nobody  literally nobody there is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse  i mean this quite seriously  
 the president of the computer mouse company doesn 't know he just knows how to run a
 run a company 
 the person on the assembly line doesn 't know because he doesn 't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic and so on we all know little bits but none of us knows the whole 
 i am of course quoting from a famous essay by leonard read the economist in the  1950s called i pencil 
 in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil
  because the people who assemble it don 't know how to mine graphite  and they don 't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing  
 and what we 've done in human society through exchange and specialization is we 've created
 the ability to do things that we don 't even understand it 's not the same with language with language we have to transfer ideas that we understand
 with each other but with with technology we can actually do things
  that are beyond our capabilities we 've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind to an extraordinary degree  and by the way 
 that 's one of the reasons that i 'm not interested in the debate about i q about whether some groups have higher  i q s than other groups it 's completely irrelevant 
 what 's relevant to a society is how well people are communicating their ideas and how well they 're cooperating
 not how clever the individuals are 
 so we 've created something called the collective brain we 're just the nodes in the network we 're the neurons in this brain  
 it 's the interchange of ideas the meeting and mating of ideas between them that is causing
 technological progress  incrementally bit by bit however bad things happen and in the future as we go forward we will
  of course experience terrible things there will be wars there will be depressions there will be natural disasters  awful things will happen in this century i 'm absolutely sure  
 but i 'm also sure that because of the connections people are making and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before  
 i 'm also sure
  and therefore living standards will advance  
 because through the cloud through crowd sourcing through the bottom up world that we 've created where not just the elites elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate 
 we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation  thank you
