  humans in the developed world spend more than ninety percent of their lives indoors  where they breathe in and come into contact with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye 
 microorganisms
  buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us  and some that are bad for us  
 what determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors 
 buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems  
 and they are brought inside by humans and other
  the fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans 
 and with the human built environment and today architects and biologists are working together
 to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us  
 we spend an extraordinary amount of time in buildings that are extremely controlled environments like this building here
 environments that have mechanical ventilation systems that include filtering  heating and air conditioning 
 given the amount of time that we spend indoors it 's important to understand how this affects our health 
 at the biology and the built environment center we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the dna out of microbes in the air
  and we looked at three different types of rooms we looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated which are the data points in the blue 
 we looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable but they made them operable for our study
  and we also sampled the outdoor air  if you look at the x axis of this graph you 'll see that what we commonly want to do which is keeping the outdoors out we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation 
 so if you look at the green data points which is air that 's outside you 'll see that there 's a large amount of microbial diversity or variety of microbial types 
 but if you look at the blue data points which is mechanically ventilated air  it 's not as diverse  
 but being less
  diverse is not necessarily good for our health 
 if you look at the y axis of this graph you 'll see that in the mechanically ventilated air you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen or germ 
 than if you 're outdoors  so to understand why this was the case
  we took our data and put it into an ordination diagram  which is a statistical map
 that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples the data points that are closer together have microbial communities that are more similar than data points that are far apart 
 and the first things that you can see from this graph is if you look at the blue data points which are the mechanically ventilated
  they 're not simply a subset of the green data points  which are the outdoor air  what we 've found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans 
 it has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth our spit  and this is because we 're all constantly shedding microbes so all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one
  and when you 're outdoors that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt  
 why does this matter it matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the united states 
 hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings  and the model that we 're working with in hospitals and also with many many different buildings is to keep the
  outdoors out and this model may not necessarily be the best for our health  and given the extraordinary
 amount of nosocomial infections 
  hospital acquired infections 
 this is a clue that it 's a good time to reconsider our current practices  
 so just as we manage national parks where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others
  we 're working towards
 thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors  
 i 've heard somebody say that you 're as healthy as your gut  
 and for this reason many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora  and what we ultimately want to do is
  to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside thank you
