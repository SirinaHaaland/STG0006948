  some introductions my mom jennie took this picture that 's my dad frank in the middle and on his
  john patrick 's sitting on his lap and kevin michael 's on his right 
 and in the pale blue windbreaker  susan diane me 
 i loved growing up in a big family  and one of my favorite things was picking names  
 but by the time child number seven came along  we had nearly run out of middle
  names  it was a long deliberation before we finally settled
 on jennifer bridget every parent in this audience knows the joy
 and excitement of picking a new baby 's name  
 and i was excited and thrilled to help my mom in that special ceremonial moment 
  it 's not like that everywhere  
 i travel a lot and i see a lot  
 but it took me by surprise to learn in an area of ethiopia  parents delay picking the names for their new babies by a month or more 
 why delay why not take advantage of this special ceremonial time
  delay because they 're afraid 
 they 're afraid their baby will die  and this loss might be a little more bearable without a name 
 a face without a name
 might help them feel just a little less attached  so here we are in one part of the world a time of joy
  dreaming of the future of that child
 while in another world  
 parents are filled with dread not daring to dream of a future for their child beyond a few precious weeks 
 how can that be how can it be that two point six million babies
 die around the world before they
  're even one month old  two point six million that 's the population of vancouver  
 and the shocking thing is why in too many cases we simply don 't know
  now  i remember recently seeing an updated pie chart  and the pie chart was labeled
  of death in children under five worldwide 
 and there was a pretty big section of that pie chart about forty percent forty percent was labeled neonatal 
 now neonatal is not a cause of death neonatal is simply an adjective an adjective that means that the
  i 'm a scientist i 'm a doctor  i want to fix things  but you can 't fix what you can 't define 
 so our first step in restoring the dreams of those parents is to answer the question  why are babies dying
  talk about a new approach an approach that i feel will not only help us know why babies are dying  
 but is beginning to completely transform
 the whole field of global health 
 it 's called precision public health for me precision medicine comes from a very special
  place 
 i trained as a cancer doctor an oncologist  i got into it because i wanted to help people feel better  
 but too often my treatments made them feel worse 
 i still remember young women being driven to my clinic
  who had to be helped into my exam room by their mothers 
 they were so weak from the treatment i had given them  
 but at the time in those front lines in the war on cancer  we had few tools 
 and the tools we did have couldn 't differentiate between the cancer cells that we wanted to hit hard
 and those healthy cells that we wanted to preserve
 and so the side effects that you 're all very familiar with hair loss being sick to your stomach  having a suppressed immune system so infection was a constant threat
 were always
 surrounding us 
 and then i moved to the biotechnology industry  and i got to work on a new approach for breast cancer patients that could do a better job
 of telling the healthy cells from the unhealthy or cancer cells it 's a drug called herceptin  
 and what herceptin allowed us to do is to precisely target
 breast cancer at the time the scariest form of breast cancer  and that precision let us hit hard the
  cancer cells while sparing and being more gentle on the normal cells 
 a huge breakthrough  it felt like a miracle 
 so much so that today  we 're harnessing all those tools
 big data consumer
  gene sequencing and more to tackle a broad variety of diseases 
 that 's allowing us to target individuals with the right remedies at the right time 
 precision medicine revolutionized cancer therapy everything changed  
 and i want everything to change again 
 so i 've been
  asking myself why should we limit this smarter 
 more precise better way to tackle diseases to the rich world now
 don 't misunderstand me i 'm not talking about bringing expensive medicines like herceptin to the developing world  although i 'd actually kind of like that
  what i am talking about is moving from this precise targeting for individuals to tackle public health problems
 in populations  
 now  ok i know probably you 're thinking she 's crazy 
 you can 't do that that 's too ambitious 
 but here 's the thing 
 we 're already doing this in a limited way and it 's already starting to make a big difference
  difference  
 so here 's what 's happening now
 i told you i trained as a cancer doctor  
 but like many many doctors who trained in san francisco in the ' 80s i also trained as an aids doctor  
 it was a terrible time  aids was a death sentence all my
  things are better but hiv aids remains a terrible global challenge 
 worldwide about seventeen million women are living with hiv 
 we know
 that when these women become pregnant they can transfer the virus to their baby  
 we also know in the absence of therapy  half those babies will not survive until the age of two
  but we know that antiretroviral therapy can virtually guarantee that she will not transmit the virus to the baby  so what do we do 
  approach kind of like that blast of chemo would mean we test and treat every pregnant woman in the world that would do the job
  not practical 
 so instead we target those areas where hiv rates are the highest  
 we know in certain countries in sub saharan africa we can test and treat pregnant women where rates are highest 
 this precision approach to a public health problem has cut by nearly half hiv transmission from mothers to baby in the last five years
 screening pregnant women in certain areas in the developing world is a powerful example
 of how precision public health can change things on a big scale
  how do we do that we can do that because we know  we know who to target 
 what to target  where to target and how to target and that for me are the important elements of precision public health 
 who what where and how 
 but
 let 's go back to the two point six million babies who die before they 're one month old here 's the problem we just
  don 't know 
 it may seem unbelievable 
 but the way we figure out the causes of infant mortality in those countries with the highest infant mortality is a conversation with mom 
 a health worker asks a mom who has just lost her child was the baby
  did they have a fever and that conversation may take place as long as three months
 after the baby has died  now put yourself in the shoes of that mom 
 it 's a heartbreaking  excruciating conversation and even worse
 it 's not that helpful because we might know there was a fever or
  know why 
 so in the absence of knowing that knowledge we cannot prevent that mom that family or other families in that community from suffering the same tragedy  
 but what if we applied a precision public health approach 
 let 's say for example we find out in certain areas of africa that babies are dying because of a bacterial infection transferred from the mother to the baby
  as group b streptococcus 
 in the absence of treatment mom has a seven times higher chance that her next baby will die  
 once we define the problem  we can prevent that death with something as cheap and safe as penicillin  
 we can do that because then
  and that 's the point  once we know we can bring the right interventions
 to the right population in the right places to save lives 
 with this approach  and with these interventions and others like them  i have no doubt
 that a precision public health approach can help our world achieve our
  goal  and that would translate into a million babies ' lives saved every single year 
 one million babies every single year  
 and why would we stop there 
 a much more powerful approach to public health imagine what might be possible why couldn 't we more effectively
  tackle malnutrition 
 why wouldn 't we prevent cervical cancer in women 
 and why not eradicate malaria yes clap for that 
 so you know i live in two different worlds one
 world populated by scientists and another world populated by public health professionals 
 the promise of precision public health is to bring these two worlds together  
 but you know  we all live in two worlds the rich world
 and the poor world and what i 'm most excited about about precision public health is bridging these two worlds
  every day in the rich world we 're bringing incredible talent and tools everything at our disposal
 to precisely target diseases in ways
 i never imagined would be possible  surely  we can tap into that kind of talent and tools
  to stop babies dying in the poor world if we did  then every parent
 would have the confidence to name their child the moment that child is born 
 daring to dream that that child 's life will be measured in decades not days  thank you
