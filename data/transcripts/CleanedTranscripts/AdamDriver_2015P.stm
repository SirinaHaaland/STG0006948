  i joined a few months after september eleven feeling like i think most people in the country did at the time filled with a sense of patriotism and retribution
 and the desire to do something that coupled with that fact that i wasn 't doing anything 
 i was seventeen just graduated from high school that past summer living in the back room of my parents ' house paying rent 
 in the small town i was raised in in northern indiana called mishawaka  
 i can spell that later for people who are interested 
 mishawaka is many good things but cultural
  hub of the world it is not so my only exposure to theater and film was limited to the plays i did in high school and
 and blockbuster video  may she rest in peace 
 i was serious enough about acting that i auditioned for juilliard when i was a senior in high school 
 didn 't get in determined college wasn 't for me and applied nowhere else  which was a genius move  i also did that
 hail mary la acting odyssey that i always heard stories about of actors moving to la with like seven dollars and finding work and successful careers i got as far as amarillo texas
 before my car broke down  i spent all my money repairing it  finally made it to santa monica not even la
 stayed for forty eight hours wandering the beach basically got in my car drove home thus ending my acting career so 
 seventeen mishawaka parents ' house paying rent selling vacuums  
  cutting grass at the local 4 h fairgrounds this was my world going into september two thousand and one so after the 11th and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty and just being pissed off in general at myself 
 my parents the government not having confidence not having a respectable job my shitty mini fridge that i just drove to california and back
  driving and detonating expensive things was great  but i found i loved the marine corps the most for the thing i was looking for the least when i joined  which was the people 
 these weird dudes
 a motley crew of characters from a cross section of the united states
 that on the surface i had nothing in common with and over time 
 all the political and personal bravado that led me to the military dissolved  and for me the marine corps became synonymous with my friends and then 
 a few years into my service and months away from
  deploying to iraq i dislocated my sternum in a mountain biking accident  and had to be medically separated  those never in the military may find this hard to understand but being told i wasn 't getting deployed to iraq or afghanistan was very devastating for me i have
 a very clear image of leaving the base hospital on a stretcher and my entire platoon is waiting outside to see if i was ok  and then suddenly i was a civilian
  i knew i wanted to give acting another shot because
 again this is me i thought all civilian problems are small compared to the military i mean what can you really bitch about now you know it 's hot  
 someone should turn on the air conditioner this coffee line is too long 
 i was a marine i knew how to survive i 'd go to new york and become an actor if things didn 't work out i 'd live in central park and dumpster dive behind
  for juilliard and this time i was lucky i got in  but i was surprised by how complex the transition was from military to civilian  and i was relatively healthy i can 't imagine going through that process
 on top of a mental or physical injury but regardless it was difficult 
 in part because i was in acting school i couldn 't justify going to voice and speech class  
 throwing imaginary balls of energy at the back of the room doing acting exercises where i gave birth to myself
  my friends were serving without me overseas
  but also because i didn 't know how to apply the things i learned in the military to a civilian context i mean that both practically and emotionally  practically i had to get a job  
 and i was an infantry marine where you 're shooting machine guns and firing mortars there 's not a lot of places you can put those skills in the civilian world laughter
  i struggled to find meaning 
 in the military everything has meaning everything you do is either steeped in tradition or has a practical purpose  you can 't smoke in the field because you don 't want to give away your position you don 't touch your face
  you have to maintain a personal level of health and hygiene you face this way when colors plays out of respect for people who went before you walk this way talk this way because of this 
  your history and the respect you had earned in the civilian world there 's no rank 
 here you 're just another body and i felt like i constantly had to prove my worth all over again  and the respect civilians were giving me while i was in uniform
 didn 't exist when i was out of it there didn 't seem to be a 
 a sense of community whereas in the military i felt this sense of community  how often in the civilian world
 are you put in a  life or death situation with with your closest friends
  they constantly demonstrate that they 're not going to abandon you and meanwhile at acting school 
 i was really for the first time  discovering playwrights and characters and plays that had nothing to do with the military but were somehow
 describing my military experience in a way that before to me was indescribable  and i felt myself becoming less aggressive
 as i was able to put words to feelings for the first time and realizing
  what a valuable tool that was and when i was reflecting on my time in the military i wasn 't first thinking on the stereotypical drills and discipline and pain of it but rather the small intimate
 human moments moments of great feeling friends going awol because they missed their families friends getting divorced  grieving together celebrating together all within the backdrop of the military
 i saw my friends battling these circumstances and i watched the anxiety it produced in them and me
  not being able to express our feelings about it
 the military and theater communities are actually very similar you have a group of people trying to accomplish a mission greater than themselves it 's not about you you have a role you have to know your role within that team 
 every team has a leader or director sometimes they 're smart sometimes they 're not 
 you 're forced to be intimate with with complete strangers in a short amount of time the
  self maintenance i thought how great would it be to create a space that combined these two seemingly dissimilar communities that brought entertainment to a group of people that 
 considering their occupation could handle something a bit more thought provoking than the typical mandatory fun events that i remember being volun told to go to in the military 
 laughter all well intended but slightly
  win a date with a san diego chargers cheerleader where you answer a question about pop culture and if you get it right you win a date  which was a chaperoned walk around the parade deck with this
 already married  pregnant cheerleader 
 nothing against cheerleaders i love cheerleaders the point is more how great would it be to have theater presented through characters that were accessible without being condescending  
 so we started this nonprofit called arts in the armed forces
  where we tried to do that tried to join these two seemingly dissimilar communities we pick a play or select monologues
 from contemporary american plays that are diverse in age and race like a military audience is 
 grab a group of incredible theater trained actors arm them with incredible material  keep production value as minimal as possible no sets no costumes no lights just reading it
 to throw all the emphasis on the language and to show that theater can be created at any setting it 's a powerful thing getting in a room with
  strangers and reminding
 ourselves of our humanity and that self expression is just as valuable a tool as a rifle on your shoulder  and for an organization like the military  
 that prides itself on having acronyms for acronyms you can get lost in the sauce when it comes to explaining a collective experience and i can think of no better community to arm with a new means of
  than those protecting our country we 've gone all over the united states and the world from walter reed in bethesda maryland to
 camp pendleton to camp arifjan in kuwait to usag bavaria on and off broadway theaters in new york and for the performing artists we bring
  it 's a window into a culture they otherwise would not have had exposure to and for the military it 's the exact same 
 and in doing this for the past six years i 'm always reminded that acting is many things it 's a craft it 's a political act it 's a business
 whatever adjective is most applicable to you but it 's also a service i didn 't get to finish mine  
 so whenever i get to be of service to this ultimate service industry the military for me  again there 's not many things better than that 
 thank you we
 're going to be doing a piece from marco ramirez called i am not batman
  incredible actor and good friend of mine jesse perez is going to be reading and matt johnson who i just met a couple hours ago  they 're doing it together for the first time so we 'll see how it goes  jesse 
  perez and matt johnson jesse perez 
 it 's the middle of the night and the sky is glowing like
  mad radioactive red  and if you squint you can maybe see the moon through a thick layer of cigarette smoke and airplane exhaust that covers the whole city like a mosquito net that won 't let the angels in 
 and if you look up high enough you can see me standing on the edge of
  building and up there a place for gargoyles and broken clock towers that have stayed still and dead for maybe like one hundred years up there
 and i gots 
  batarangs and frickin ' bat caves like for real  and all it takes is a broom closet or a back room or a fire escape and danny 's hand me down jeans are gone 
 and my navy blue polo shirt the one that looks kinda good on me but has that hole on it near the butt from when it got
  fence behind arturo 's but it isn 't even a big deal because i tuck that part in and it 's like all good that blue polo shirt
 it 's gone too and i get like  like  transformational 
 and nobody pulls out a belt and whips batman for talkin ' back 
 or for not talkin ' back and nobody calls batman simple or stupid
 or skinny  and nobody fires batman 's brother from the eastern taxi company ' cause they was making cutbacks neither
  they got nothing but respect and not like
  nobody 's afraid of you ' cause batman doesn 't mean nobody no harm ever '
 cause all batman really wants to do is save people and maybe pay abuela 's bills one day and die happy and maybe get like
  and my cape is flapping in the wind cause it 's frickin ' long and my pointy ears are on and that mask that covers like half my face is on too and i got like bulletproof stuff all in my chest so
  somewhere in the city there 's a old lady picking styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can and she 's putting a piece of sesame chicken someone spit out into her own mouth 
 and somewhere there 's a doctor with a wack haircut in a black lab coat trying to find a cure for the diseases that are gonna make us all extinct for real one day and somewhere there 's a
  man a man in a janitor 's uniform stumbling home drunk and dizzy after spending half his paycheck on  40 ounce bottles of twist off beer and the other half on a four hour visit to some lady 's house 
  on a street where the lights have all been shot out by people who 'd rather do what they do in this city in the dark 
  and if they don 't find a cent on him which they won 't they 'll just pound at him till the muscles in their arms start burning till there 's no more teeth to crack out 
 but they don 't count on me  
 they don 't count on no dark knight with a stomach full of  grocery store brand macaroni and cheese and cut up vienna sausages '
 cause they 'd rather believe i don
  and i see janitor man mumble something in drunk language and turn pale  and from eighty seven stories up  i can hear his stomach trying to hurl its way out his dickies  so i swoop down like mad fast and i 'm like darkness
  hear what there ain 't nothing no really there ain 't no bat but then one out of the three good for nothings gets it to the head
 pow  and number two swings blindly into the dark cape before him but before his fist hits anything i grab a trash can lid and
  and number one comes back with the jump kick  but i know judo karate too so i 'm like 
 twice 
 but before i can do any more damage suddenly we all hear a click click 
 and suddenly everything gets quiet  
 and the one good for nothing left standing grips a handgun and aims it straight up  like he 's holding jesus hostage like he 's threatening maybe to blow a hole
  in the moon 
 and the good for nothing who got it to the head who tried to jump kick me and the other good for nothing who got it in the gut is both scrambling back away from the dark figure before ' em 
 and the drunk man the janitor man is huddled in a corner  praying to saint anthony ' cause that 's the only one he could remember 
 and there 's me  eyes glowing white cape blowing softly in the wind
 my heart beating right through it in a morse code for fuck with me just once come on just try 
 and the one good for nothing left standing the one with the handgun yeah he laughs  and he lowers his arm  and he points it at me and gives the moon a break  and he aims it right between my pointy ears like goal posts and he
 's special teams 
 and janitor man is still calling saint anthony but he ain 't pickin ' up  
 and for a second  it seems like  
 maybe i 'm gonna lose
  my hands now and i hate guns i hate holding ' em ' cause i 'm batman and asterisk  batman don 't like guns ' cause his parents got iced by guns a long time ago  but for just a second my 
  eyes glow white  and i hold this thing for i could speak to the good for nothing in a language he maybe understands
  it 's just me and janitor man  
 and i pick him up 
 and i wipe sweat and cheap perfume off his forehead  
 and he begs me not to hurt him and i grab him tight by his janitor man shirt collar  and i pull him to my face and he 's taller than me but the cape helps so he listens when i look him straight in the eyes and i say two words to him
  behind his shoulder every ten feet  and i swoosh from building to building on his way there ' cause i know where he lives  and i watch his hands tremble as he pulls out his key chain and opens the door to his building  
 and i 'm back in bed before he even walks in through the front door  
 and i hear him turn on the faucet and pour himself a glass of warm tap water  and he puts the glass back
  and i hear his footsteps  and they get slower as they get to my room  and he creaks my door open like  mad slow 
 and he takes a step in  which he never does 
 and he 's staring off into nowhere his face the color of sidewalks in summer  and i act like i 'm just waking up and i say ah what 's up pop 
 and janitor man says nothing to me 
 but i see in the dark
  see his arms go limp and his head turns back like towards me and he lifts it for i can see his face for i could see his eyes and his cheeks is drippin ' but not with sweat 
 and he just stands there breathing  like he remembers my eyes glowing white  like he remembers my bulletproof chest  
 like he remembers he 's my pop
  and for a long time i don 't say nothin ' 
 and he turns around hand on the doorknob and he ain 't looking my way  but i hear him mumble two words to me 
 i 'm sorry 
 and i lean over and i open my window just a crack if you look up high enough you could see me
  and from where i am
