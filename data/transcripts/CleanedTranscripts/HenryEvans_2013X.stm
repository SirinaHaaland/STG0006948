  all the way from los altos hills california mr henry evans
  i was living my version of the american dream  i grew up in a typical american town near st louis 
 my dad was a
  my mom was a homemaker my six siblings and i were good kids  but caused our fair share of trouble  
 after high school i left home to study and learn more about the world  i went to notre dame university
 and graduated with degrees in accounting and german including spending a year of study in austria  later
  i married my high school sweetheart  jane 
 i am lucky to have her  together we raised four wonderful children  
 i worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder eventually becoming a chief financial officer in silicon valley a job i really enjoyed 
 my family and i bought our first and only home on december thirteen
 two thousand and one
  fixer upper in a beautiful spot of los altos hills california from where i am speaking to you now 
 we were looking forward to rebuilding it but eight months after we moved in i suffered a stroke like attack caused by a birth defect 
 overnight
  mute quadriplegic
 at the ripe old age of forty 
 it took me several years  
 but with the help of an incredibly supportive family  i finally decided life was still worth living  
 i became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled 
 head tracking devices sold commercially by the company
 convert my tiny head movements into cursor movements and enable my use of a regular computer  
 i can surf the web exchange email with people and routinely destroy my friend steve cousins in online word games 
 this technology allows me to remain engaged  mentally active and feel like i am a part of the world
  one day i was lying in bed watching cnn when i was amazed by professor charlie kemp of the healthcare robotics lab at georgia tech demonstrating a pr2 robot
 i emailed charlie and steve cousins of willow garage and we formed the robots for humanity project 
 for about two years  robots for humanity developed ways for me to use the
 the pr2 as my body surrogate  
 i shaved myself for the first time in ten years  
 from my home in california  i shaved charlie in atlanta 
 i handed out halloween candy  
 i opened my refrigerator on my own
  i began doing tasks around the house  i saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities
 to live
 and contribute  both for myself and others in my circumstance  
 all of us have disabilities in one form or another  for
 for example if either of us wants to go sixty miles an hour both of us will need an assistive device called a car
  your disability doesn 't make you any less of a person and neither does mine 
 by the way  check out my sweet ride 
 since birth we have both suffered from the inability to fly on
  showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones 
 it was then i realized that i could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight  
 giving a sense of movement and
  using a mouse cursor i control with my head these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser 
 with a little practice  i became good enough with this interface to drive around my home on my own
  could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing
  i inspected the solar panels on our roof 
 one of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone on our basketball hoop  
 i went even further by seeing if i could use
  oculus rift as modified by fighting walrus to have an immersive experience controlling the drone
  with chad 's group at brown i regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week from my home three thousand miles away
  all work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer
  i never thought i would be able to casually move around a campus like brown on my own
  i just wish i could afford the tuition chad jenkins 
 henry  all joking aside i bet all of these people here would love to see you fly this drone from your bed in california
 three thousand miles away 
 okay henry have you been to
  big finish can you show us how good of a pilot you are
  little ways to go with that but
 i think it shows the promise what makes henry 's story amazing is it 's about
 understanding henry 's needs understanding what what people in henry 's situation need from technology and then also understanding
 what advanced technology can provide and then bringing those
  two things together for use in a wise and responsible way 
 what we 're trying to do is democratize robotics so that anybody can be a part of this we
 're providing affordable off the shelf robot platforms such as the a r drone three hundred dollars 
 the suitable technologies beam only seventeen thousand dollars
 along with open source robotics software so that you can be a part of what we 're trying to do and our hope is is that by providing these tools that you 'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled to
  provide care for our aging population to help better educate our children 
 to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future to both monitor and protect our environment and to explore the universe  
 back to you henry he 
 thank you chad
  with this drone setup we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world  
 and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination 
 where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else  and perhaps better 
 and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently
  considered vegetables 
 one hundred years ago  i would have been treated like a vegetable  
 actually that 's not true  i would have died
 it is up to us all of us to decide how robotics will be used for good or for evil for simply replacing people or for making people better for allowing us to do and enjoy more
 our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone 's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe 
 with the help of people like you we can make this dream a reality
