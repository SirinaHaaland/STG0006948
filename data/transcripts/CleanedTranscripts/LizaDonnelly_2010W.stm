  i was afraid of womanhood  not that i 'm not afraid now but i 've learned to pretend i 've learned to be flexible
  in fact i 've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear let me explain back in
 the ' 50s and ' 60s when i was growing up little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft  
 and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy
 really not quite clear what
  all around us we had our mothers our aunts our cousins our sisters and of course the 
  ever present media bombarding us with images and words telling us how to be 
 now my mother was different 
 she was a homemaker but she and i didn 't go out and do girlie things together and she didn 't buy me pink outfits instead she knew what i needed and she bought me a book of cartoons  
 and i just ate it up i
  drew and i drew and since i knew that humor was acceptable in my family  
 i could draw do what i wanted to do and not have to perform not have to speak i was very shy and i could still get approval 
 i was launched as a cartoonist  
 now when we 're young  we don 't always
  we know there are rules out there but we don 't always know
 we don 't perform them right  even though we are imprinted at birth
 with these things and we 're told what the most important color in the world is 
 we 're told what shape we 're supposed to be in 
 we 're told what to wear
  the rules that i 'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture we 're being corrected and
 the primary policemen are women because we are the carriers of the tradition we pass it down from from generation to generation
  not only that we always have this vague notion that something 's expected of us  and on top of all off these rules 
 they keep changing  we
 don 't know what 's going on half the time so it puts us in a very tenuous position 
 now if you don 't like these rules  and many of us don 't i know i
 i still don 't even though i follow them half the time not quite aware that i 'm following them
 what better way than to change them [ than ] with humor 
 humor relies on the traditions of a society  
 it takes what we know and it twists it it takes the the codes of behavior and the codes of dress and it
  that 's what elicits a laugh  
 now what if you put together women and humor  i think you can get change because women are on the ground floor  and we know the traditions so well we can bring a different voice to the table 
 now i started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos  i grew up not far from here in washington d c during the civil rights movement the assassinations the
 watergate hearings and then the
 feminist movement and i think i was drawing trying to figure out what was going on and then also my family was in chaos  and i drew to 
 try to bring my family together 
 it didn 't work my parents got divorced and my sister was arrested  
 but i found my place
 i found that i didn 't have to wear high heels i didn 't have to wear pink  and i could feel like i fit in now when i was a little older in my 
  i realized there are not many women in cartooning and i thought well maybe i can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning and so i did i became a cartoonist  and then i thought
 in my 40s i started thinking well why don 't i do something i always loved political
  so why don 't i do something with the content of my cartoons to to make people think about the stupid rules that we 're following as well as laugh 
 now my perspective is a particularly
  i can 't help it i live here  even though i 've traveled a lot i still think like
 an american woman  but i believe that the rules that i 'm talking about are universal of course that each
  culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the u s 
 consequently  we have 
 women because we 're on the ground we know the tradition we have amazing antennae  
 now my work lately has been to collaborate with international
  which i so enjoy  and
 it 's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to
 to get at the truth to get at the issues quickly and succinctly  and not only that it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect but through the heart 
 my work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world countries
  and we have
 sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties and these women are
 working so hard to get their voices heard in in some some very difficult circumstances but i feel i feel blessed to be able to work with them  and
 we talk about how women have such strong perceptions because of our tenuous position and
  we can have the great potential to be
 and i think i truly believe that we can change this thing one laugh at a time  thank you
