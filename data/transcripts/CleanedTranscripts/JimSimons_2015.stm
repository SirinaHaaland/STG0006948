  were something of a mathematical phenom  you had already taught at harvard and mit at a young age  and then the nsa came calling  what was that about jim simons 
  national security agency
 they didn 't exactly come calling they had an operation at princeton where they hired mathematicians to
 attack secret codes and stuff like that  and i knew that existed  
 and they had a very good policy because you could do half your time at your own mathematics and
 at least half your time working on their stuff  and they
  i got fired because 
 well the vietnam war was on  and the
 the boss of bosses in my organization was a big fan of the war and wrote a new york times article
  cover story about how we would win in vietnam  and i didn
 't like that war i thought it was stupid and i wrote a letter to the times which they published saying not everyone
 who works for maxwell taylor if anyone remembers that name
 agrees with his views  and i gave my own views
  said anything but then i was twenty nine years old at this time and some kid came around and said he was a stringer from newsweek magazine and he wanted to interview me
 and ask
 what i was doing about my views and i told him i 'm doing mostly mathematics now and when the war is over then i 'll do mostly their stuff
  i did the only intelligent thing i 'd done that day i
 told my local boss that i gave that interview and he said what 'd you say and i told him what i said and then
 he said i 've got to call taylor he called taylor  that took ten minutes  i was fired five minutes after that ca
 ok js but it wasn 't bad ca it wasn 't bad because you went you went on to stony brook and stepped up
  of the century i had known him
 when i was a graduate student at berkeley  and
 i had some ideas  and i brought them to him and he liked them together we did this work which you can
 easily
  i think you told me it had something to do with spheres  so let 's start
 well it did but i 'll say about that work
 it did have something to do with that but before we get to that that work
 was
 was good mathematics  i was very happy with it so was chern 
 it even started a little sub field that 's now flourishing but
  happened to apply to physics something we knew nothing about at least i knew nothing about physics and i don 't think chern knew a heck of a lot and
 about ten years after the paper came out a guy named ed witten
 in princeton started applying it to string theory and people in russia started applying it to what 's called condensed matter 
  spread through a lot of physics and it was amazing  we didn 't know any physics  it never occurred to me that it would be applied to physics but that 's the thing about
 mathematics you never know where it 's going to go ca this is so incredible so we 've been talking about how evolution shapes human minds that may or may not perceive the truth  somehow you come up with a mathematical theory 
 not knowing any physics
  discover two decades later that it 's being applied to profoundly describe the actual physical world   how can that happen js god knows  
 laughter but there 's a
 famous physicist named [ eugene ] wigner and he wrote
 an essay on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics 
  this mathematics which
 is rooted in the real world in some sense we learn to count measure everyone would do that and then it flourishes on its own 
 but so often it comes back to save the day 
 general relativity is an example [ hermann ] minkowski had this geometry and einstein realized hey it 's the very thing in which i can cast general relativity so 
 you never know
  what i 'm going to show here was originally observed by [ leonhard ] euler the great mathematician in the 
 and it gradually grew to be a very important field in mathematics
  algebraic topology  geometry  that paper up there
 had its roots in this so here 's this thing it has eight vertices  twelve edges six faces  and if you look at the difference vertices minus edges plus faces
 you get two ok
  that 's a good number here 's a different way of doing it these are triangles covering this has twelve vertices and thirty edges
 and
 twenty faces  twenty tiles  
 and vertices minus edges plus faces still equals two and in fact  you could do this any which way cover this thing with all kinds of polygons and triangles and mix them up 
 and you take vertices minus edges plus
  faces you 'll get two here 's a different shape this is a torus or the surface of a doughnut  sixteen vertices
 covered by these rectangles thirty two edges sixteen faces  vertices minus edges comes out 
 it 'll always come out to zero every time you cover a torus
  this is called the euler characteristic and it 's what 's called a
 topological invariant it 's pretty amazing no matter how you do it you 're always get the same answer so that was the first
 sort of thrust from the 
 into a subject which is now called algebraic topology ca and your own work took an idea
  like this and moved it into
 sort of 
 instead of
 the way it was typically done and that led to this work and we uncovered some some new things but if it wasn 't for mr euler
 who wrote almost seventy volumes of mathematics and had thirteen children who he
  on his knee while he was writing
 if it wasn 't for mr euler  there wouldn 't perhaps be
 these invariants ca ok so that 's at least given us a flavor of that amazing mind in there let
 's talk about renaissance because you took that amazing mind and
 you
  the financial industry  i think you probably didn 't buy efficient market theory  somehow you found a way of creating
 astonishing returns over two decades 
 the way it 's been explained to me what 's remarkable about what you did wasn 't just the size of the returns it 's that you took them with surprisingly low volatility and risk compared with other other hedge funds  so how on earth did you do this jim js
 i did it
 by assembling a wonderful group of people
  doing trading  i had gotten a little tired of mathematics  i was in my late 30s i had a little money  i started trading and it went very well
 i made quite a lot of money with pure luck  i mean i think it was pure luck it certainly wasn 't mathematical modeling  but in looking at the data 
 after a while i
  looks like there 's some structure here  and i hired a few mathematicians and we started making some models just the kind of thing we did
 back at ida [ institute for defense analyses ] you design an algorithm you test it out on a computer does it
  on earth could you trade looking at that and see something that wasn 't just random js 
 in the old days this is kind of a graph from the old days  
 commodities or currencies had a tendency to trend not necessarily the very light trend you see here but trending in in periods  and if you decided
  i 'm going to predict today  by the average move in the past
  twenty days
 maybe that would be a good prediction and i 'd make some money  and in fact years ago  such a system
 would work not beautifully  but it would work you 'd make money you 'd lose money you 'd make money but this is a year 's worth of days  and  you 'd
  you would test a bunch of lengths of trends in time and see whether for example a 10 day trend or a 15 day trend was predictive of what happened next js sure you would
 try all those things and see what worked best
  how did you stay ahead of the pack js we stayed ahead of the pack by finding by finding other other approaches
  approaches to some extent the real thing was to gather a tremendous amount of data and we had to get it by hand
 in the early days  we went down to the federal
  reserve and copied
 interest rate histories and stuff like that because it didn 't exist on computers we got a lot of data 
 and very smart people that was the key 
 i didn 't really know how to hire people to do fundamental trading  
 i had hired a few some made money some didn 't make money  i couldn 't make a business out of that but i did know how to hire scientists because i have some
  taste in that department  so that 's what we did and gradually these
 models got better and better and better and better  ca you 're credited with doing something remarkable at renaissance which is building this culture this group of people 
 who weren 't just hired guns who could be lured away by money their motivation was was doing exciting
  i 'd hoped that might be true  but
 some of it was money
 ca they made a lot of money js i can 't say that that no one came because of the money  i think a lot of them came because of the money but they also came because it would be fun ca 
 what role did machine learning play in in all this js
 in a certain sense what we did was machine learning
 you look at a lot of data and you try to
 simulate
 different predictive schemes until you get
  and better at it it doesn 't necessarily feed back on itself the way we we did things but
 it worked ca so these different predictive schemes can be really quite quite wild and unexpected
  we take in terabytes of data a day  and store it away and massage it and get it ready for analysis  
 you 're looking for anomalies  you 're looking for like you said
  the efficient market hypothesis is not correct ca but
 any one anomaly might be just a random thing  so  is the secret here to just look at multiple strange anomalies and see when they align 
 js any one anomaly might be a random thing however if you have enough data you can tell that it 's not you can see an anomaly
  persistent for a sufficiently long time the probability of it being
 random is is not high but these things
 fade after a while anomalies can get washed out so you have to keep on top of the business ca a lot of people look at the hedge fund industry now and are sort of
 shocked by it by how much wealth is created there and how much talent is going into it do you have any worries about
  that industry and perhaps the financial industry in general kind of being on a runaway train that 's that 's i don 't know helping increase inequality
 how would you
 champion
 what 's happening in the hedge fund industry js i think in the last three or four years hedge funds have not done especially well  we 've done dandy but the hedge fund industry as a whole has
  stock market has been on a roll going up as everybody knows  and
 price earnings ratios have grown so an awful lot of the wealth that 's been created in the last let 's say five or six years has not been created by hedge
  percent fixed fee and twenty percent of profits hedge funds are all different kinds of creatures ca rumor has it you charge slightly higher fees than that 
 js we charged the highest fees in the world at one
  but at a certain point as i think i told you we bought out all the investors because there 's a capacity
  but should we worry about the hedge fund industry attracting too much of the world 's great mathematical and other talent to work
  on that  as opposed to the many other problems in the world js well it 's not just mathematical  we hire astronomers and physicists and
 things like that 
 i don 't think we should worry about it too much it 's still a pretty small industry and in fact  bringing
 science into the investing world
  has improved that world it 's reduced volatility it 's increased liquidity  
 spreads are narrower because people are trading that kind of stuff so i 'm not too worried about einstein going off and
 starting a hedge fund ca you 're at a phase in your life now where you 're actually investing though at the other end of the supply chain you 're
 actually boosting mathematics
  marilyn started there she is up there my beautiful wife
 she started the foundation about twenty years ago  i think ' ninety four i claim it was ' ninety three she says it was ' ninety four but it was one of those two years
  as a convenient way to give charity  she kept the books and so on we did not have a
 vision at that time but gradually a vision emerged which was to focus on math and science to focus on basic research
  six years ago or so i left renaissance
 and went to work at the foundation  so that 's what we do ca and so math for america is basically investing in
 math teachers around the country  giving them some extra income giving them support and coaching and really trying to make that more effective and make that a calling to which teachers can aspire
  up the bad teachers which has created
 morale problems all through the educational community 
 in particular in math and science  we focus on celebrating the good ones and and giving them
 status  
 yeah we give them extra money  fifteen thousand dollars a year we have eight hundred math and science teachers in new york city in public schools today as part of a core 
  there 's a great morale among them they 're staying in the field 
 next year it 'll be one thousand and that 'll be ten percent of the math and science teachers in new york
  how did we get here and the other question is what did we start with what material if any did we have to work with on this route
  are two very very interesting questions the first question is a tortuous path from
 from geology up to rna or something like that how that how did that all work and the other what do we have to work with well  more than we think so what 's pictured there
 is a star in
  every year in our milky way which has one hundred billion stars about two new stars are created don 't ask me how but they 're created 
 and it takes them about a million years to settle out 
 so 
 in steady state there are about two million stars in formation at any time that one is somewhere along this settling down period 
 and there 's all this crap sort of circling around it dust and stuff
  probably a solar system or whatever it forms but here 's the thing
 in this dust that
 surrounds a forming star have been found 
 now significant organic molecules molecules not just like methane
  formaldehyde and cyanide things that are the building blocks
 the seeds  if you will of life so that may be typical and it may be typical that
 planets
 around the universe
 start off with some of these basic building blocks now does that mean there 's going to be life all around maybe
  but it 's a question of how tortuous this path is from those frail beginnings those seeds all the way to life and most of those seeds will fall on fallow
 planets ca so for you personally finding an answer to this question of where we came from of how did this thing happen that
 something you would love to see js would love to see and like to know
 if that path is tortuous enough  and so improbable that no matter what you start with
 we could be a singularity but on the other hand given all this organic dust that 's floating around  we could have
  the secret of his success and he said taking physics seriously
 was it listening to you what i hear you saying is taking math seriously that has
 infused your whole life it 's made you an absolute fortune and now it 's allowing you to invest in the futures of
  thousands and thousands of kids across america and elsewhere could it be that science actually works that math actually
 works js well math certainly works
 math certainly works  but this has been fun working with marilyn and
 giving it away has been
 very enjoyable ca i just find it it 's an inspirational thought to me that by taking knowledge seriously so much more can come from it so thank you for your amazing life and for coming here to ted
