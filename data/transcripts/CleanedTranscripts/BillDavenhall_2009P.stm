  can geographic information make you healthy 
 in two thousand and one i got hit by a train 
 my train was a heart attack i found myself in a hospital in an
  recuperating from emergency surgery  and i suddenly realized something that i was completely in the dark  
 i started asking my questions well why me why now why here could my doctor have warned me so what i want to do here in the few minutes i have with you
 is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health genetics lifestyle and
  environment that 's going to sort of contain our risks  and if we manage those risks we 're going to live a good life and a good healthy life 
 well  i understand the genetics and lifestyle part 
 and you know why i understand that because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this 
 have you ever had to fill out those long legal size forms in your doctor 's office  
 i mean if you 're lucky
  enough you get to do it more than once right 
 do it over and over again and they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history your medication history  your surgical history  
 your allergy history did i forget any history  
 but this part of the equation
 i didn 't really get and i don 't think my physicians really get this part of the equation
  what does that mean my environment  well it can mean a lot of things this is my life 
 these are my life places  we all have these while i 'm talking i 'd like you to also be thinking about how many places have you lived  
 just think about that you know wander through your your life thinking about this
  and you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places 
 you spend it at rest and you spend it at work and if you 're like me you 're in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place so it 's not really simple when somebody asks you where 
  do you live where do you work and where do you spend all your time  and where do you expose yourselves to risks
 seventy five percent of my time
 relatively in a small number of places  and i don 't wander far from that place for a majority of my time even though i 'm an extensive global trekker 
 now i 'm going to take you on a little journey here i started off in scranton pennsylvania i don 't know if anybody might hail from
  but this is where i spent my first nineteen years with my little young lungs you know 
 breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and methane gas 
 in unequal quantities nineteen years of this and if you 've been in that part of the country this is what those piles of burning  smoldering coal waste look like 
 so then i decided to leave that part of the
  and i was going to go to the 
  so i ended up in louisville kentucky  well i decided to be neighbors to a place called rubbertown  
 they manufacture plastics they use large quantities chloroprene and benzene  okay  i spent twenty five years in my middle age lungs now  
 breathing various concentrations of that and on a clear day it always looked like
  you never saw it it was insidious and it was really happening
 then i decided i had to get really smart i would take this job in the west coast  
 and i moved to redlands california  
 very nice and there my older  senior lungs as i like to call them  i filled with particulate matter  carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone 
  the highest in the nation alright this is what it looks like on a good day if you 've been there you know what i 'm talking about so what 's wrong with this picture  
 well the picture is there is a huge gap here the one thing that never happens in my doctor 's office  they never ask me about my place history  
 no doctor can i remember ever asking me 
 where have you lived they haven 't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that i put in my mouth
 or the food that i
  ingest into my stomach  they really don 't do that it 's missing  look at the kind of data that 's available 
 this data 's from all over the world countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research now i 've circled the places where i 've been 
 well by design if i wanted to have a heart attack i 'd been in the right places
  so  how many people are in the white how many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space  
 anybody boy you 're lucky  how many have spent it in the red places oh
 not so lucky there are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the
  give us some sense of what 's going to be our train wreck  but none of that 's in my medical record  and it 's not in yours either 
 so here 's my friend paul he 's a colleague 
 he allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours twenty four seven three hundred and sixty five days out of the year for the last two years  everywhere he went  and you can see he 's
  few places around the united states  and this is where he has spent most of his time  
 if you really studied that you you might have some clues as to what paul likes to do anybody got any clues
  ski right  we can zoom in here and we suddenly see that now we see where paul has really spent a majority of his time  and all of those black dots 
 are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the
  the epa did you know that data existed for every community in the united states you could have your own personalized map of that so
 our cell phones can now build a place history this is how paul did it he did it with his iphone this might be what we end up with this is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room
  of just the pink slip that said i paid at the counter  right this could be my little assessment and he looks at that and he says whoa bill  
 i suggest that maybe you not decide just because you 're out here in beautiful california and it 's warm every day 
 that you get out and run at six o 'clock at night i 'd suggest that that 's a bad idea bill  
 because of this report
 what i 'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions okay number one is we must teach physicians about the value of geographical 
  information it 's called geomedicine there are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this  
 of the world the importance of some of the information i 've shared here with you today 
 the second thing we need to do is while we 're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record  
 we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record  
 it not only will
  be important for the physician it will be important for the researchers
 that now will have huge samples to draw upon but it will also be useful for us 
 i could have made the decision if i had this information not to move
 to the ozone capital of the united states couldn 't i i could make that decision or i could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best
  of myself and my company
