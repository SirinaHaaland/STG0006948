  have you ever wondered what is inside your dental plaque  
 probably not but people like me do i 'm an archeological geneticist at the center for evolutionary medicine at the university of zurich
  and i study the origins and evolution of human health and disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans  
 and through this work i hope to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies so that we can improve
 and better manage our health in the future there are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine and one way is to extract human dna from ancient
  and from these extracts we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time and look for changes that might be related to adaptations  risk factors and inherited diseases  
 but this is only one half of the story 
 the most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mutations in our genome but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay between genetic variation
  microbes and parasites and our immune response
  all of these diseases have a strong evolutionary component that directly relates to the fact that we live today in a very different environment than the ones in which our bodies evolved  
 and in order to understand these diseases we need to move past studies of the human genome alone and towards a more holistic approach to human health in the past  
 but there are a lot of challenges for this and first of all what do we even study
  skeletons are ubiquitous they 're found all over the place  but of course all of the soft tissue has decomposed and the skeleton itself has limited health information 
 mummies are a great source of information except that they 're really geographically limited and limited in time as well  
 coprolites are fossilized human feces  and they 're actually
  extremely interesting you can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease but they are very rare 
 to address this problem i put together a team of international researchers in switzerland denmark and the u k 
 to study a very poorly studied little known
 material that 's found on people everywhere  it 's a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called officially dental calculus many of you
 may know it by the term tartar it 's what the dentist cleans off your teeth every time that you go in for a visit  and
 in a typical dentistry visit you may have about fifteen to thirty milligrams removed but in ancient times
 before tooth brushing up to six hundred milligrams might have built up on the teeth over a lifetime  
 and what 's really important about dental calculus is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton
  abundant in quantity before the present day and it 's ubiquitous worldwide we find it in every population around the world at all time periods going back tens of thousands of years  and 
  we even find it in neanderthals and animals  and so previous studies had only focused on microscopy they 'd looked at dental calculus under a microscope  and what they had found was things like pollen
  animal meats and bacteria  
 and so what my team of researchers what we wanted to do is say can we apply genetic and proteomic technology to go after dna and proteins and from this can we get better taxonomic resolution to really understand what 's going on  
 and what we found is that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria that inhabited the nasal passages and mouth 
 we also have
  found immune proteins related to infection and inflammation and proteins and dna related to diet  
 but what was surprising to us and also quite exciting is we also found bacteria that normally inhabit upper respiratory systems so it gives us virtual access to the lungs which is where many important diseases
 reside
  and we also found bacteria that normally inhabit the gut  and so we can also now virtually gain access to this even more distant organ system that from the skeleton alone has long decomposed  
 and so by applying ancient dna sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies to ancient dental calculus we can generate immense quantities of data that then we can use 
  to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture of the dynamic interplay between diet infection and immunity thousands
  of years ago  
 so what started out as an idea 
 is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long term evolutionary history of human health and disease right down to the genetic 
  code of individual pathogens  and from this information we can learn about how pathogens evolve
  value of dental calculus  and as a final parting thought on behalf of future archeologists i would like to ask you to please think twice before you go home and brush your teeth
