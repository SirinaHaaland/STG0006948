  i 'm delighted to be here i 'm honored
 by the invitation and thanks i would love to talk about stuff that i 'm interested in but unfortunately i suspect that what i 'm interested in won 't interest many other people
 first off my badge says i 'm an astronomer i would love to talk about my astronomy  but i suspect that the number of
  people who are interested in radiative transfer in non gray atmospheres and polarization of light in jupiter 's upper atmosphere are the number of people who 'd fit in a bus shelter  so
 i 'm not going to talk about that 
 it would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six and one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven when a computer hacker is breaking into our our systems
  and i caught the guys and they turned out to be working for what was then the soviet kgb and stealing information and selling it and i 'd love to talk about that and it 'd be fun
 but  twenty years later
  i find computer security frankly to be kind of boring  it 's tedious i 'm
 the first time you do something  it 's science
  going to talk about that 
 nor am i going to talk about what i think are obvious statements from my first book silicon snake oil 
 or my second book   nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers don 't belong in schools  
 i feel that there 's a massive
 and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools  my idea is 
 get them out of schools  and keep them out of schools
 and i 'd love to talk about this  but i think the argument is so obvious to anyone who 's hung around a fourth grade classroom that
 it doesn 't need much talking about but i guess i may be very wrong about that and everything
  else that i 've said so don 't go back and read my dissertation it probably has lies in it as well  having said that i outlined my talk about
 five minutes ago and if you look at it over here  the main thing i wrote on my thumb was the future i 'm supposed to talk about the future yes
  to talk about the future is bizarre because i 've got gray hair and so 
 it 's kind of silly for me to talk about the future in fact i think that if you really want to know what the future 's going to be if you really want to know about the future 
 don 't ask a technologist a scientist a
  don 't ask somebody who 's writing code no
 if you want to know what society 's going to be like in twenty years ask a kindergarten teacher 
 they know 
 in fact don 't ask just any kindergarten teacher ask an experienced one they 're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation
  i suspect do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring certainly all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there 
 but to me things aren 't the future what i ask myself is what 's society is going to be like  when
  the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and and
  have never gone bowling together  change is happening  and the change that is happening is not one that is in software but
 that 's not what i 'm going to talk about i 'd love to talk about it it 'd be fun but
 i want to talk about what i 'm doing now what am i doing now  oh the other thing that i think i 'd like to talk about is right over here  right over here
  what i 'd like to talk about is one sided things i would dearly love to talk about things that have one side because
 i love mobius loops  i not only love mobius loops but
 i 'm one of the very few people if
 not the only person in the world that makes klein bottles   right away i hope that all of your eyes glaze over this is a klein bottle for those
  of you in the audience who know you roll your eyes and say yup i know all about it it 's one sided  it 's a bottle whose inside is its outside it has zero volume and 
  has wonderful properties if you take two mobius loops and sew their common edge together you get one of these and i make them out of glass
 and i 'd love to talk to you about this  but i don 't
  in ted of course stands for design just two weeks ago i made you know i 've been making
 small  medium and big klein bottles for the trade but
 what i 've just made and i 'm delighted to show you first time in public here
 this is a klein bottle wine bottle 
 which 
 although in four dimensions it shouldn 't be able to hold any fluid at all it 's perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions and because our universe is only three spatial dimensions 
 it can hold fluids
  it 's highly
 that one 's the cool one that was a month of my life  but
 although i would love to talk about topology with with you  i 'm not going to
  passed away last summer 
 had collected photographs of me as mothers will do  could somebody put this this guy up 
 and i looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me  standing well  sitting in one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine in front of
  when i was working at the electronic music studio as a technician  repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at suny buffalo  and
 wow way back machine  and i said to myself  oh yeah and it sent me back
  another picture that she had a picture of me  this guy over here of course is me  this man is robert moog  
 the inventor of the moog synthesizer who passed away this past august 
 robert moog was a generous kind person extraordinarily competent engineer
  a musician
 who took time from his life to teach me  a sophomore a freshman at suny buffalo  he 'd come up from trumansburg
 to teach me
 not just about the moog synthesizer  but we 'd be sitting there  i 'm studying physics at the time this is one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine seventy seventy one 
 we 're studying physics i 'm studying physics and he 's saying that 's a
 good thing to do don 't get caught up in electronic music if you 're doing physics
  he 'd come up and spend
 hours and hours with me  
 he wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school 
 in the background my bicycle i realize that this picture was taken at a friend 's living room  bob moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show greg flint and i things about this we sat around talking about fourier
  modulation transfer functions stuff like this
 bob 's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us anyone who 's a musician has been profoundly influenced by robert moog 
 and i
 'll just say what i 'm about to do  
 what i 'm about to do i hope you can recognize that
  i can get to this place over here right kids kids is what i 'm going to talk about is that okay  it says kids over here  that 's what i 'd like to
  feel that the best way i can help out anything
 is to
 help out very very locally  so ph d this and
 degree there and the yadda yadda i was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago and one of them  several of them would come up to me
  so into kids and all this stuff  how come you ain 't over here on the front lines put your money where you mouth is 
 is true is true  i teach eighth grade science four days a week not just showing up every now and
  i strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do not just show up to class every now and then teach a solid week okay i 'm teaching three quarters time but
 good enough one of the things that i 've done for my science students is to tell them look i 'm going to teach you  college level physics no calculus i 'll cut out that you won 't need to know trig
  going to be doing genuine physics and that 's one of the things i thought i 'd do right now 
 oh  before i even turn that on one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class this is through the lens and one of the things we used a lens for was
  to measure the speed of light my students in el cerrito
 with my help of course and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope measured the speed of light we were off by twenty five percent  
 how many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light 
 in addition to that we 've measured the speed of sound i 'd love to measure the speed of light here  i was all set to do it and i was thinking aw man i was just going to impose upon impose upon the powers that be and measure
  all set to do it i 'm all set to do it 
 but then it turns out that to set up here  you have like ten minutes to set up and there 's no time to do it so next time  maybe
 i 'll measure the speed of light but meanwhile let 's measure the speed of sound well 
 the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo but probably
 one of my students ariel [ unclear ] 
  could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation and all of you know the wave equation is the frequency
 times the wavelength
 of any wave is a constant  when the frequency goes up the wavelength comes down wavelength goes up frequency goes down so 
 if we have
 a wave here over here  that 's what 's interesting
 as the pitch goes up things get closer pitch goes down  things stretch
  out right 
 this is simple physics  all of you know this from eighth grade remember
 what they didn 't tell you in physics in eighth grade physics but they should have and i wish they had was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength
  of sound or light 
 you get a constant and that constant is the speed of sound so in order to measure the speed of sound all i 've got to do
 is know its frequency well that 's easy  i 've got a frequency counter right here  set it up to
 around a above a above a there 's an a more or less now  so i know the frequency it 's one
  its wavelength all i need now is to flip on another beam  
 and the bottom beam is me talking right  so anytime i talk you 'd see it on the screen i
 'll put it over here  and as i move this away
 from the source you 'll notice
 the spiral the slinky moves
  the wave coming out this way those of you who are physicists i hear you rolling your eyes but bear with me
 to measure the wavelength all i need to do is measure the distance from here
 one full wave over to here  from here to here is the wavelength of sound so i 'll put a
 measuring tape here  measuring tape here
  here  move it back over to here  i 've moved the microphone twenty centimeters zero point two meters from here
  the wavelength was zero point two meters  let 's figure out what this is 
 one point seven six
 times zero point two over here is three hundred and fifty two meters per second
 if you look it up in the book it 's really
 really three hundred and forty three but here with kludgy material and lousy drink we 've been able to measure
 the speed of sound to not bad pretty good all of which comes to what i wanted to say go back to
  the vietnam war was going on and i 'm like oh my god i 'm studying physics landau lipschitz  resnick and halliday i 'm going home for a midterm a riot 's going on on campus there 's a riot
 hey elmo 's done 
 off
  there 's a riot going on on campus  and the police are chasing me  
 right  i 'm walking across campus  cop comes and looks at me and says you you 're a student 
 pulls out a gun goes boom  and a tear gas canister the size of a pepsi can goes 
 i get a breath of tear gas and i can 't breathe this cop comes after me with a rifle he wants to clunk me over the head
  i can i duck into
 hayes hall it 's one of these bell tower buildings the cop 's chasing me chasing me up the first floor  second floor third floor  chases me into this room
 the entranceway to the bell tower  
 i slam the door behind me climb up go past this place where i see a pendulum ticking and i 'm thinking oh yeah the square root of the length is proportional to its period 
 i keep climbing up go back i go to a place where a dowel splits off
 clock  clock clock clock the time 's going backwards because i 'm inside of it i 'm thinking of lorenz contractions and einsteinian relativity 
 i climb up and there 's this place way in the back that you climb up this wooden ladder i pop up the top  and there 's a cupola a dome one of these ten foot domes  i 'm looking out and i 'm seeing the cops bashing students ' heads  shooting tear gas and watching students throwing bricks
 then i remember what
 my english teacher in high school said  namely that
 when they cast bells they write inscriptions on them  so i wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells and i look at it  
 i 'm asking myself why am i
