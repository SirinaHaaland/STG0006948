  these are a few of the languages that i 've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six
  as i 've been to seventeen countries i think i 'm up to on this crazy tour i 've been doing 
 checking out various aspects of the project that we 're doing and i 'm going to tell you a little bit about later on and visiting some pretty incredible places 
 places like mongolia  cambodia  new guinea south africa  tanzania twice i was here a month ago  
 and the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that
 is utterly amazing for lots of reasons you see some incredible stuff
  and you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe  
 and the thing that you really take away from that the kind of surface thing that you take away from it 
 is not that we 're all one 
 although i 'm going to tell you about that 
 but rather how different we are there is so much diversity around the globe  
 six thousand different languages spoken by six and a half billion people all different colors shapes sizes you
  walk down the street in any big city you travel like that and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species  
 how do we explain that diversity  
 well  that 's what i 'm going to talk about today is how we 're using the tools of genetics population genetics in particular to tell us
 how we generated this diversity
  and how long it took 
 now the problem of human diversity like all big scientific questions how do you explain something like that can be broken down into sub questions and you can ferret away at those little sub questions 
 first one is really a question of origins do we all share a common origin in fact and given that we do and that 's the assumption everybody i think in this room would make when when was that  when did we originate as a species how long have we been divergent from each other  
 and the second question is related but
  slightly different if we do spring from a common source how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe and in the process generate all of this diversity the different ways of life the different appearances the different languages around the world
 well the question of origins as with so many other questions in biology seems to have been answered by darwin over a century ago in the descent of man he wrote in each great region of the world the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region 
  that africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee  
 and as these two species are now man 's nearest allies it 's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the african continent than elsewhere 
 so we 're done we can go home finished the origin question well not quite because darwin was talking about our distant ancestry
  our common ancestry with apes  and it is quite clear that apes originated on the african continent around twenty three million years ago they appear in the fossil record 
 africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time due to the vagaries of plate tectonics floating around the indian ocean 
 bumped into eurasia around sixteen million years ago and then we had the first african exodus as we call it the apes that left at that time ended up in southeast asia became the gibbons and the orangutans and the ones that stayed on in africa evolved into the gorillas the chimpanzees and us so yes
 if you 're talking about our common ancestry with apes it 's very clear by looking at the fossil record we started off here  but that 's not really the question i 'm asking i 'm asking about our human ancestry things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room if
 they were peering over your shoulder  you wouldn 't leap back like that 
 what about our human ancestry because if we go far enough back we share a common ancestry with every living thing on earth
  dna ties us all together so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria
 and mushrooms  if you go far enough back over a billion years 
 what we 're asking about though is human ancestry how do we study that well historically it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology  digging things up out of the ground  
 and largely on the basis of morphology the way things are shaped often skull shape saying this looks a little bit more like us than that
  so this must be my ancestor this must be who i 'm directly descended from 
 the field of paleoanthropology i 'll argue gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry but it doesn 't give us the probabilities that we really want
 as scientists what do i mean by that you 're looking at a great example here these are three extinct species of hominids potential human ancestors 
 all dug up just west of here in olduvai gorge by the leakey family
 and they 're all dating to roughly the same time from left to right we 've got homo erectus homo habilis and australopithecus now called paranthropus boisei the robust australopithecine 
 three extinct species same place same time 
 that means that not all three could be my direct ancestor which one of these guys am i actually related to 
 possibilities about our ancestry but not the probabilities that we 're really looking for well  a different approach has
  been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently again largely skull shape the first person to do this systematically
 was linnaeus  carl von linne a swedish botanist who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to
 categorize every living organism on the planet you think you 've got a tough job  and he did a pretty good job he categorized about twelve thousand species in
  naturae he actually coined the term homo sapiens it means wise man in latin  
 but looking around the world at the diversity of humans he said well you know we seem to come in discreet sub species or categories 
 and he talked about africans and americans and asians and europeans and a blatantly racist category he termed monstrosus 
 which basically included all the people he didn 't like including imaginary folk like elves
 it 's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre darwinian era except 
  if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as twenty or thirty years ago in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity human races
  is the best example
 had been diverging from each other this was in the post darwinian era for over a million years since the time of homo erectus  but based on what data 
 very little very little morphology and a lot of guesswork  
 well  what i 'm going to talk about today what i 'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry digging things up out of the ground possible ancestors and saying
  on the basis of morphology which we still don 't completely understand we don 't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation
 what we need to do is turn the problem on its head because what we 're really asking is a genealogical problem or a genealogical question what we 're trying to do is construct a family 
  tree for everybody alive today  and as any genealogist will tell you anybody have a member of the family or maybe you have tried to
  a family tree trace back in time you start in the present with relationships you 're certain about you and your siblings you have a parent in common you and
 your cousins share a grandparent in common you gradually trace further and further back into the past  
 adding these ever more distant relationships but eventually  
 no matter how good you are at digging up the church records and all that stuff  you hit what the genealogists call a
  a point beyond which you don 't know anything else about your ancestors and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history
 that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance who were these people who came before  
 we have no written record well  actually we do 
 written in our dna in our genetic code we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species  and that 's what we study 
 now a quick primer on dna i suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist
 it is a very long  linear molecule a coded version of how to make another copy of you it 's your blueprint  
 it 's composed of four subunits a c g and t we call them and it 's the sequence of those subunits that that defines that blueprint 
 how long is it well it 's billions of these subunits in length  a haploid genome we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes a
 haploid genome is around three point two billion nucleotides in length
  thing if you add it all together is over six billion nucleotides long if you take all the dna out of one cell in your body and stretch it end to end it 's around two meters long  
 if you take all the dna out of every cell in your body and you stretch it end to end  it would reach from here to the moon and back thousands of times it
 's a lot of information  and so when you 're copying this dna molecule to pass it on it 's a pretty tough job
  imagine the longest book you can think of war and peace now multiply it by one hundred 
 and imagine copying that by hand  
 and you 're working away until late at night and you 're very very careful and you 're drinking coffee and you 're paying attention but occasionally 
 when you 're copying this by hand you 're going to make a little typo  a spelling mistake
 substitute an i for an e or a c for a t same thing happens to our dna as it 's being passed
  on through the generations it doesn 't happen very often we have a proofreading mechanism built in 
 but when it does happen and these changes get transmitted down through the generations they become markers of descent if you share a marker with someone it
 means you share an ancestor at some point in the past  the person who first had that change in their dna  
 and it 's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation the pattern
  these markers in people all over the world and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history that we 've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today these are two pieces of dna 
  that we use quite widely in our work mitochondrial dna tracing a purely maternal line of descent you get your mtdna from your mother and your mother 's mother 
  falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees  
 now even though these are simplified versions of the real trees  they 're still kind of complicated so let 's simplify them turn them on their sides combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up 
 what 's the take home message  well  the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found
 within africa
 that means that africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer  
 and what that means is that we originated in africa  it 's written in our dna every piece of dna we look at has greater diversity within africa than outside of africa  
 and at some point in the past a sub group of africans left the african continent to go out and populate the rest of the world  
 now how recently do we share this
  ancestry was it millions of years ago  
 which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world
  no the dna tells a story that 's very clear within the last two hundred thousand years  we all share an ancestor  a single person mitochondrial eve you might have heard about her
 in africa  an african woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today  but what 's even more amazing is that if you look at the
 y chromosome side the male side of the story  
 the y chromosome adam only lived around sixty thousand years ago  that 's only about two thousand human generations  the blink of an eye
 in an evolutionary sense that tells us we were all still living in africa at that time this was an african man who gave rise to all the y chromosome
 diversity around the world  it 's only within the last sixty thousand years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world  
 such an amazing story we 're all effectively part of an extended african family  
 now  that seems so recent  why didn 't we start to leave earlier why didn 't
 homo erectus evolve into separate species or sub species rather human races around the world  why was it that we we seem to have come out of africa so recently
  in genetics and the study of history in general are always the big ones the ones that are tough to answer and so when all else fails talk about the weather 
 what was going on to the world 's weather around sixty thousand years ago well  we were going into the worst part of the last ice age the last ice age started roughly one hundred and twenty thousand years ago  it went up and down 
 and it really started to accelerate around seventy thousand years ago lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types oxygen isotopes and
  so on we hit the last glacial maximum around sixteen thousand years ago  but basically from seventy thousand years on things were getting really tough 
 getting very cold the northern hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets 
 new york city  chicago seattle all under a sheet of ice most of britain all of scandinavia covered by ice several
 kilometers thick now africa is the most tropical continent on the planet about eighty five percent of it lies between cancer and capricorn
 and there aren 't a lot of glaciers here  except on the high mountains here in east africa so what was going on here we weren 't covered in ice in africa  
 rather africa was drying out at that time this is a 
  map of what africa looked like between sixty thousand and seventy thousand years ago  reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that i mentioned before  the reason for that is that ice actually
  sucks moisture out of the atmosphere if you think about antarctica it 's technically a desert  it gets so little precipitation 
 so the whole world was drying out the sea levels were dropping and africa was turning to desert the sahara was much bigger then than it is now  
 and the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets compared to what we have today  
 the evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time roughly seventy thousand
  years ago crashed to fewer than two thousand individuals  we nearly went extinct we were hanging on by our fingernails  
 and then something happened a
 great illustration of it look at some stone tools  the ones on the left are from africa  from around a million years ago  the ones on the right were made by neanderthals our distant cousins not our direct
  living in europe and they date from around fifty thousand or sixty thousand years ago  
 now at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience 
 basically there 's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups the ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right we are in a period of long
 cultural stasis from a million years ago until around sixty thousand to seventy thousand years ago  the tool styles don 't change that much the evidence is that the human way of life didn 't change that much
  during that period 
 but then fifty sixty seventy thousand years ago somewhere in that region all hell breaks loose  art makes its appearance  
 the stone tools become much more finely crafted  
 the evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species at particular times of the year  the population size started to expand 
  according to what many linguists believe fully modern language syntactic language subject verb object that we use to convey complex ideas like i 'm doing now  appeared around that time  we became much more social the social networks expanded 
 this change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in africa  and they allowed us to start to expand
 around the world  we 've been talking at this conference about african success stories  well  you want the ultimate african success story
  look in the mirror you 're it the reason you 're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in africa probably somewhere in the region where we 're sitting right now
 around sixty seventy thousand years ago
 allowing us not only to survive in africa but to expand out of africa an early coastal migration along the south coast of asia leaving africa around sixty thousand years ago  reaching australia very rapidly by fifty thousand years ago a
  later migration up into the middle east these would have been savannah hunters  so those of you who are going on one of the post conference tours you 'll get to see what a real savannah is like and it 's basically a meat locker people 
  who would have specialized in killing the animals hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs moving up following the grasslands into the middle east around forty five thousand years ago  during
  the rare wet phases in the sahara 
 migrating eastward  following the grasslands because that 's what they were adapted to live on 
 and when they reached central asia  they reached what was effectively a steppe  super highway a grassland super highway the grasslands at that time this was during the last ice age stretched basically from germany all the way over to korea  
 and the entire continent was open to them  entering europe around thirty five thousand years ago and finally a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable 
 siberia inside the arctic circle
  during the last ice age temperature was at minus seventy minus eighty even minus one hundred perhaps migrating into the americas ultimately reaching that final frontier an amazing 
  story  and it happened first in africa the changes that allowed us to do that the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us allowing us to create novel cultures
  allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one i 've just been on 
 now  that story i just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world the great paleolithic wanderings of our species  
 and that 's the story that i told a couple of years ago in my book the journey of man and a film that we made with the same title
  and as we were finishing up that film it was co produced with national geographic
 i started talking to the folks at
  and they got really excited about it  they liked the film but they said you know we really see this as kind of the next wave
 in the study of human origins where we all came from using the tools of dna to map the migrations around the world you know
 the study of human origins is kind of in our dna and we want to take it to the next level what do you want to do next 
 which is a great question to be asked by national geographic
  well  you know  what i 've sketched out here is just that  it is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet  and it 's based on a few thousand people we 've sampled from you know 
 a handful of populations around the world studied a a few genetic markers 
 and there are lots of gaps on this map we 've just connected the dots what we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more hundreds of thousands of dna samples from people all over the world
  and that was the genesis of the genographic project 
 the project launched in april two thousand and five  it has three core components  obviously  science is a big part of it the field research that we 're doing around the world with indigenous peoples 
  people who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live
  so my ancestors come from all over northern europe i live in the eastern seaboard of north america when i 'm not traveling 
 where am i indigenous to nowhere really my genes are all jumbled up but there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the dna results 
 that 's the focus of the field research the centers that we 've set up all over the world ten of them top population geneticists 
  how often do you get to participate in a big scientific project the human genome project or a mars rover mission in this case you actually can you can go onto our website
  genographic you can order a kit you can test your own dna  
 and you can actually submit those results to the database and tell us a little about your genealogical background have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort 
 now this is all a
  and so the money that we raise after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components gets plowed back into the project the majority going to something we call the legacy fund it
 's a charitable entity basically a grant giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational cultural projects initiated by them they apply to this fund in order to do various projects and i 'll show you a couple of examples  so how are we doing on the
  we 've got about twenty five thousand samples collected from indigenous people around the world  
 the most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public two hundred and ten thousand people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago  which has raised around five million dollars 
  the majority of which at least half is going back into the legacy fund  we 've just awarded the first legacy grants totaling around five hundred thousand dollars 
 preserving traditional weaving patterns in gaza language revitalization in tajikistan etc etc  
 so the project is going very very well  and i urge you to check out the website and watch this space
