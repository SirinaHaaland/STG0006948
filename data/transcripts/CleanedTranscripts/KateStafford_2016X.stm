  a documentary by jacques cousteau
 won both the palme d  'or and an oscar award this film was called le monde du silence or the silent
  the premise of the title was that the underwater world
 was a quiet world 
 we now know sixty years later that the underwater world is anything but silent  although the sounds are inaudible above water
 depending on where you are and the time of year the underwater soundscape can be as noisy as any jungle or
  and marine mammals all use sound 
 they use sound to study their habitat to keep in communication with each other to navigate to detect predators and prey
 they also use sound by listening
 to know something about their environment take for an example the arctic
  it 's considered a vast inhospitable place sometimes described as a desert  
 because it is so cold and so remote and ice covered for much of the year  
 and despite this 
 there is no place on earth that i would rather be than the arctic  especially as days lengthen and spring comes
 to me the arctic really
  embodies this disconnect between what we see on the surface
 and what 's going on underwater you can look out across the ice all white and blue and cold
 and see nothing but if you could hear underwater the sounds you would hear
 would at first amaze and then delight you 
 and while your eyes are seeing nothing for kilometers but ice  your ears are telling you that out there
  there
 are bowhead and beluga whales  walrus and bearded seals 
 the ice too makes sounds it screeches and cracks and pops and groans as it collides and rubs
 when temperature or currents or winds change and under one hundred percent sea ice
 in the dead of winter bowhead whales are singing
 and you would never expect that because
 we humans we tend to be very visual animals for most of us  but not all 
 our sense of sight is how we navigate our world 
 for marine mammals that live underwater  where chemical cues and light transmit poorly sound is the sense
 by which they see
 and sound transmits very well underwater much better than it does in air so signals can be heard over great distances
 in the arctic  this is especially important because not only do arctic marine mammals have to hear each other  
 but they also have to listen for cues in the environment that might indicate heavy ice ahead or open water  
 remember  although they spend most of their
  lives underwater they are mammals and so they have to surface to breathe  
 so they might listen for thin ice or no ice or listen for echoes
 off nearby ice arctic marine mammals live in a rich and varied underwater soundscape in the
  but when the ice is frozen solid  and there are no big temperature shifts or
 current changes 
 the underwater arctic has some of the lowest ambient noise levels of the world 's oceans  
 but this is changing this is primarily due to a decrease in seasonal sea ice  
 which is a direct result of human greenhouse gas emissions  
 we are in effect with climate change  conducting a completely uncontrolled experiment with our planet 
 over the past thirty years areas of the arctic have seen decreases
  in seasonal sea ice from anywhere from six weeks
 to four months  this decrease in sea ice is sometimes referred to
 as an increase in the open water season that is the time of year when the arctic is navigable to vessels  
 and not only is the extent of ice changing  
 but the age and the width of ice is
  now you may well have heard that a decrease in seasonal sea ice is causing a loss of habitat for animals that rely on sea ice  
 such as ice seals or walrus or polar bears  
 decreasing sea ice is also causing increased erosion along coastal villages  and changing prey availability for marine birds and mammals 
 climate change
 and decreases in sea ice are also
 altering the underwater soundscape of the arctic
 what do i mean by soundscape  
 those of us who eavesdrop on the oceans for a living use instruments called hydrophones which are underwater microphones  
 and we record ambient noise the noise all around us and the soundscape describes the different contributors to this noise field
  we are hearing on our hydrophones
 are the very real sounds of climate change we are hearing these changes from three fronts 
 from the air from the water
 and from land  first air  wind on water
 creates waves 
 these waves make bubbles the bubbles break 
 and when they do they make noise and this noise is like a hiss or a static in the background
 in the arctic  when it 's ice covered most of the noise from wind doesn 't make it into the water column  because the ice acts as a buffer
 between the atmosphere and the water this is one of the reasons that the arctic can have very low ambient noise levels but
 with decreases in seasonal sea ice  not only is the arctic now open
 to this wave noise  but the number of storms and the intensity of storms in the arctic has been increasing 
 all of this is raising noise levels in a previously quiet ocean second water 
 with less seasonal sea ice  subarctic species are
  moving north  and taking advantage of the new habitat that is created by more open water 
 now arctic whales like this bowhead 
 they have no dorsal fin because they have evolved to live and swim in ice covered waters  
 and having something sticking off of your back is not very conducive to migrating through ice  
 and may in fact be excluding animals from the ice
 but now  everywhere we 've listened we 're hearing the sounds of fin whales and humpback whales and killer whales  
 further and further north  
 and later and later in the season  
 we are hearing in essence an invasion of the arctic by subarctic species  
 and we don 't know what this means
  will there be competition for food between arctic and subarctic animals 
 might these subarctic species introduce diseases or parasites into the arctic 
 and what are the new sounds that they are producing
 doing to the soundscape underwater  
 and third land  and by land  i mean people 
 more open water means increased human use of the arctic  
 just this past summer a massive
  cruise ship made its way through the northwest passage
 the once mythical route between europe and the pacific decreases in sea ice have allowed humans
 to occupy the arctic more often 
 it has allowed increases in oil and gas exploration and extraction  the potential for commercial shipping 
 as well as increased tourism
  and we now know that ship noise increases levels of stress hormones in whales and can disrupt feeding behavior 
 air guns which produce loud
 every ten to twenty seconds  changed the swimming and vocal behavior of whales 
 and all of these sound sources are decreasing the acoustic space
  which arctic marine mammals can communicate 
 now 
 arctic marine mammals are used to very high levels of noise at certain times of the year  
 but this is primarily from other animals or from sea ice  
 and these are the sounds with which they 've evolved  and these are sounds that are vital to their very survival 
 these new sounds are loud and they 're alien
  impact the environment in ways that we think we understand but also in ways that we don 't  
 remember 
 sound is the most important sense for these animals  and not only is the physical habitat of the arctic changing rapidly  but the acoustic habitat is
  it 's as if we 've plucked these animals up from the quiet countryside and dropped them into a big city in the middle of rush hour and they can 't escape it 
 so what can we do now  
 we can 't decrease wind speeds or keep subarctic animals from migrating north  
 but we can work on local solutions to reducing human caused underwater
  one of these solutions is to slow down ships that traverse the arctic  because a slower ship
 is a quieter ship we can restrict access in seasons and regions that are important for mating or feeding
 or migrating we can get smarter about quieting ships and find better ways to explore the ocean
  and the good news is there are people working on this right now  
 but ultimately we humans have to do the hard work of reversing or at the very least
 decelerating human caused atmospheric changes  so let 's return to this idea
 of a silent world underwater it 's entirely possible that many of the whales swimming in the arctic today
  especially long lived species like the bowhead whale that the inuits say can live two human lives it 's possible that these whales were alive in 
 when jacques cousteau made his film and in retrospect  considering all the noise we are creating in the oceans today  
 perhaps it really was the silent world
