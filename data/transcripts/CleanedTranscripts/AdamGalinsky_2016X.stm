  speaking up
 is hard to do  i understood the true meaning of this phrase exactly one month ago when my wife and i became
 new parents 
  it was an amazing moment it was exhilarating and elating but it was also scary and terrifying and it got particularly terrifying
 when we got home from the hospital and we were unsure whether our little baby boy was getting enough nutrients from breastfeeding  
 and we wanted to call
 our pediatrician  but we also didn 't want to make a bad first impression or come across as a crazy neurotic
  so we worried  and we waited  when we got to the doctor 's office the next day she immediately gave him formula because he was pretty dehydrated 
 our son is fine now and our doctor has reassured us we can always contact her 
 but in that moment  i should 've spoken up  but i didn 't 
 but sometimes we speak up when we shouldn 't and i learned that over ten years ago when i let my twin brother down my twin brother
 and for one of his first films he got an offer from a distribution company 
 he was excited and he was inclined to accept the offer  but as a negotiations researcher  i insisted he make a counteroffer  and i helped him craft the perfect one 
 and it was perfect
  the company was so offended they literally withdrew the offer and my brother was left with nothing  
 and i 've asked people all over the world about this dilemma of speaking up when they can assert themselves when they can push their interests when they can express an opinion 
 when they can make an ambitious ask  
 and
 the range of stories are varied and diverse  but they also make up a universal tapestry can i correct my boss when they make a
  mistake can i confront my coworker
 who keeps stepping on my toes can i challenge my friend 's insensitive joke can i tell the person i love the most
 my deepest insecurities  
 and through these experiences i 've come to recognize that each of us have something called a range of acceptable behavior  now  sometimes
 we 're too strong we push ourselves too much
  's what happened with my brother even making
 an offer was outside his range of acceptable behavior  but sometimes we 're too weak  that 's what happened with my wife and  i 
 and this range of acceptable behaviors when we stay within our range  we 're rewarded  when we step outside that range  we get punished in a variety of ways we get dismissed or demeaned or even ostracized or we lose that raise or that promotion
 or that deal  now  the first thing we need to know is what is my range  but
 the key thing is our range isn 't fixed
 it 's actually pretty dynamic  it expands
 and it narrows based on the context and there 's one thing that determines that range more than anything else  
 and that 's your power  your power determines your range
  what is power  power comes in lots of forms in negotiations it comes in the form of alternatives  
 so my brother had no alternatives  he lacked power  the company had lots of alternatives  they had power sometimes it 's being new to a country like an immigrant or new to 
  an organization or new to an experience like my wife and i as new parents  sometimes it 's at work where someone 's the boss and someone 's the subordinate
  sometimes it 's in relationships where one person 's more invested than the other person 
 and the key thing is is that when we have lots of power  our range is very wide we have a lot of leeway in how to behave  
 but when we lack power  our range narrows  we have very little leeway 
 the problem is
  double bind happens when if we don 't speak up we go unnoticed  
 but if we do speak up  we get punished  
 now many of you have heard the phrase the double bind and connected it with one thing and that 's gender the gender double bind is women who don 't speak up go unnoticed
  and women who do speak up get punished  and the key thing is that women have the same need as men to speak up  
 but they have barriers to doing so 
 but what my research has shown over the last two decades is is that what looks like a gender difference is not really a gender double bind 
 it 's a really a low power double bind  and what looks like a gender difference are really often just power differences in disguise 
  and a woman or men and women  and think biological cause there 's something fundamentally different about the sexes 
 but in study after study i 've found that a better explanation for many sex differences
 is really power  and so it 's the
  lack power we have a narrow range and our double bind is very large 
 so we need to find ways to expand our range and over the last couple decades my colleagues and i have found two things really matter  
 the first you seem seem powerful in your own eyes the second you seem powerful in the eyes of others  when i
 i feel powerful 
 i feel confident not fearful i expand my own range  when other people see me as powerful 
 they grant me a wider range  so we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior and i 'm going to give you a set of tools today 
  speaking up is risky  
 but these tools will lower your risk of speaking up
  the first
 tool i 'm going to give you
 got discovered in negotiations in an important finding 
 on average women make less ambitious offers and get worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table 
 but hannah riley bowles and emily amanatullah have discovered there 's one situation where women get the same outcomes as men and are just as ambitious 
 that 's when they
  when they advocate for others  they discover their own range and expand it in their own mind they become more assertive  this is sometimes called the mama bear effect 
 like a mama bear defending her cubs when we advocate for others we can discover our own voice  
 but sometimes we have to advocate for ourselves
  how do we do that one of the most important tools we have to advocate for ourselves is something called perspective taking and 
 is really simple it 's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person 
 it 's one of the most important tools we have to expand our range  when i take your perspective  and i think about what you really want you 're more likely to give me what i really want  
 but here 's the problem
 is hard to do so let 's do a little experiment  i want you all to hold your hand just like this your finger put it up 
 and i want you to draw a capital letter e on your forehead as quickly as possible  
 ok  it turns out that we can draw this e in one of two
  this was originally designed as a test of perspective taking i 'm going to show you two pictures of someone with an e on their forehead my former student erika hall
 and you can see over here that 's the correct e i drew the e so it looks like an e to another person that 's the  perspective taking e because it looks like an e from someone else 's vantage point but this e over here
  crisis  i want to tell you about a particular crisis a man walks into a bank in watsonville california  
 and he says give me $ two thousand or i 'm blowing the whole bank up with a bomb 
 now the bank manager didn 't give him the money  she took a step back she took his perspective  and she noticed something really important 
 he asked for a specific amount of money  so she said
 why did you ask for $ two thousand and he said my friend is going to be evicted unless i get him $ two thousand immediately and she said oh 
 you don 't want to rob the bank you want to take out a loan
  someone 's perspective it allows us to be ambitious and assertive but still be likable
  here 's another way to be assertive but still be likable  and that is to signal flexibility 
 now  imagine you 're a car salesperson  and you want to sell someone a car you 're going to more likely make the sale if you give them
  my research shows that when you give people a choice among options  it lowers their defenses and they 're more likely to accept your offer 
 and this doesn 't just work with salespeople it works with parents  when my niece was four  she resisted getting dressed and rejected everything  
 but then my sister in law had a brilliant idea
  what if i gave my my daughter a choice this shirt or that shirt  ok that shirt this pant or that pant ok  that pant  and it worked brilliantly she got dressed quickly and without resistance when
 i 've asked the question around the world when people feel comfortable speaking up  the number one answer is when i have social support in my
  so we want to get allies on our side how do we do that well 
 one of the ways is be a mama bear when we advocate for others we expand our range in our own eyes and the eyes of others  but we also earn strong allies 
  another way we can earn strong allies  especially in high places is by asking other people for advice  
 when we ask others for advice
  like us because we flatter them  and we 're expressing humility  and this really works to solve another double bind  and that 's the 
 the self promotion double bind is that if we don 't advertise our accomplishments  no one notices  and if we do we 're not likable  but if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments we
 are able to be competent in their
  eyes but also be likeable and this is so powerful
 it even works when you see it coming there
 have been multiple times in life when i have been forewarned that a low power person has been given the advice to come ask me for advice
 i want you to notice three things about this first i knew they were going to come ask me for advice two
 've actually done research on the
  strategic benefits of asking for advice  and three  it still worked  
 i took their perspective i became more invested in their cause i became more committed to them because they asked for advice  
 now  another time we feel more confident speaking up
 is when we have expertise expertise gives us credibility  when we have high power  we already have credibility we
  only need good evidence 
 when we lack power  
 we don 't have the credibility  we need excellent evidence 
 and one of the ways we can come across as an expert is by tapping into our passion  
 i want everyone
 in the next few days to go up to friend of theirs and just say to them i want you to describe a passion of yours to me i 've had people do this all over the world
 and i asked them what did you notice about the other person when they described their passion and the answers are always the same their eyes lit up and got big they smiled 
 a big beaming smile they used their hands all over i had to duck because their hands were coming at me 
 as you listened to their passion 
 they said my eyes lit up  i smiled i leaned in 
 when we tap into our passion  we give ourselves the courage in our own eyes to speak up  but we also get the permission from others to speak up
 tapping into our passion even works when we come across as too weak  both men and women get punished
  at work when they shed tears 
 but lizzie wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion  the condemnation of our crying
 disappears for both men and women i want to end with a few words from my late father that he spoke at my twin brother 's wedding
  my dad was a psychologist like me but his real love and his real passion was cinema like my brother  and so he wrote a speech for my brother 's wedding
 about the roles we play in the human comedy  
 and he said the lighter your touch  the better you become at improving and enriching your performance those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance
 grow change
 and expand the self play it well  and your days will be mostly joyful 
 what my dad was saying is that we 've all been assigned ranges and roles in this world  
 but he was also saying the essence of this talk  
 those roles and ranges are constantly expanding and
  so when a scene calls for it be a ferocious mama bear
 and a humble advice seeker have excellent evidence and strong
 allies be a passionate perspective taker  and if you use those tools and each and every one of you can use these tools
 you will expand your range of acceptable behavior  and your days will be mostly joyful  thank you
