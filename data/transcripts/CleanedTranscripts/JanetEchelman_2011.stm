  this story is about taking imagination seriously  
 fourteen years ago  i first encountered this ordinary material fishnet used the same way for centuries  
  i 'm using it to create permanent billowing voluptuous forms the scale of hard edged buildings in cities around the world 
 i was an unlikely person to be doing this i never studied sculpture engineering or architecture 
 in fact after college i applied to seven art schools
 and was rejected by all seven  i went off on my own to become an artist and i painted for ten years
  years  when i was offered a fulbright to india 
 promising to give exhibitions of paintings i shipped my paints and arrived in mahabalipuram the deadline for the show arrived
 my paints didn 't 
 i had to do something this fishing village was famous for sculpture  so i tried bronze casting  
 but to make large forms was too heavy and expensive
  went for a walk on the beach  watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand i 'd seen it every day  but this time i saw it differently
 a new approach to sculpture a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials 
 my first satisfying sculpture was made
  we hoisted them on poles to photograph  
 i discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns i was mesmerized  
 i continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans next in lithuania
  with lace makers  i liked the fine detail it gave my work  
 but i wanted to make them larger to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in 
 returning to india to work with those fishermen  we made a net of a million and a half
 thousands of people saw it 
 and one of them was the urbanist manual  sola morales who was redesigning the waterfront in porto portugal
  he asked if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city  i didn 't know if i could do that and preserve my art  durable 
  those are in opposition to idiosyncratic delicate and ephemeral 
 for two years i searched for a fiber
 that could survive ultraviolet rays salt air  pollution and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind 
 we needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic
  we had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds  
 but there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving  
 i found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for america 's cup racing yachts named peter heppel  
 he helped me tackle the twin
  challenges of precise shape
 and gentle movement  
 i couldn 't build this the way i knew because hand tied knots weren 't going to withstand a hurricane 
 so i developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory  learned the variables of their machines and figured out a way to make lace with
  there was no language to translate this ancient idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce  
 so we had to create one  three years and two children later
  we raised this 
 lace net it was hard to believe that what i had imagined was now built permanent and had lost nothing in
  translation 
 this intersection had been bland and anonymous 
 now it had a sense of place  
 i walked underneath it for the first time 
 as i watched the wind 's choreography unfold  i felt sheltered and at the same time connected to limitless sky
 my life was not going to be the same 
 i want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world  
 i 'm going to share
 two directions that are new in my work  historic philadelphia city hall
  its plaza i felt needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting  
 so we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind
 and in testing discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet
  i 'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time
 like an x ray of the city 's circulatory system unfolding  
 next challenge 
 the biennial of the americas in denver asked could i represent the thirty five nations of the western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture
 i didn 't know where to begin  but i said yes  
 i read about the recent earthquake in chile
 and the tsunami that rippled across the entire pacific ocean 
 it shifted the earth 's tectonic plates  sped up the planet 's rotation and literally shortened
  so i contacted noaa and i asked if they 'd share their data on the tsunami and translated it into this 
 its title one point two six refers to the number of microseconds that the earth 's day was shortened  
 i couldn 't build this with a steel ring the way i knew  its shape was too complex now so i replaced the metal armature with a soft
  fine mesh of a fiber fifteen times stronger than steel 
 the sculpture could now be entirely soft  which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings
 literally becoming part of the fabric of the city 
 there was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity  so we had to create it
 then i got a call from new york city
 asking if i could adapt these concepts
 to times square or the high line 
 this new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers 
 they don 't have funding yet
  now of bringing these to cities around the world where they 're most needed  
 fourteen years ago  i searched for beauty
 in the traditional things in craft forms 
  materials and engineering
 to create voluptuous billowing forms the scale of buildings 
 my artistic horizons continue to grow i 'll leave you with this story i got a call from a friend in phoenix 
 an attorney in the office who 'd never been interested in art never visited the local art museum  
 dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down
  underneath the sculpture there they were in their business suits laying in the grass noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn 't know 
 sharing the rediscovery of wonder  
 thank you
