  i have a feature on my website where every week people submit hypothetical questions for me to answer  
 and i try to answer them using math science and comics so for example one person asked what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at ninety percent of the speed of light 
 i did some calculations now 
 normally when an object flies through the air the air will flow around the object but in this case the ball would be going so fast that the air molecules wouldn 't have time to move out of the way the ball would smash right into and through them 
 and the collisions with these air molecules would knock away the nitrogen carbon and hydrogen from the ball fragmenting it off into tiny particles  and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion in the air around it
  this would result in a flood of x rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles plasma inside centered on the pitcher 's mound  and that would move away from the pitcher 's mound slightly faster than the ball  
 now at this point about thirty nanoseconds in the home plate is far enough away that light hasn 't had time to reach it which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to
  throw and has no idea that anything is wrong 
 now  
 after seventy nanoseconds the ball will reach home plate or at least the cloud of expanding plasma that used to be the ball
  and it will engulf the bat and the batter and the plate and the catcher and the umpire
 and start disintegrating them all as it also
  starts to carry them backward through the backstop which also starts to disintegrate
 so if you were watching this whole thing from a hill  ideally far away
  what you 'd see is a bright flash of light that would fade over a few seconds followed by a blast wave spreading out shredding trees
 and houses as it moves away from the
  and then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined city 
 so the major league baseball rules are a little bit hazy but 
 laughter under rule six point zero two and five point zero nine  i think that in this situation the batter would be considered hit by pitch
 and would be eligible to take first base if it still existed  so this is the kind of question i answer  and i get people writing in with
  a lot of other strange questions  i 've had someone write and say  scientifically speaking what is the best and fastest way to hide a body can you do this one soon  and i had someone write in  
 i 've had people write in about can you prove whether or not you can find love again after your heart 's broken
 and i 've had people send in what are clearly homework questions they 're trying to get me to do for them
  but one one week 
 a couple months ago i got a question that was actually about google 
 if all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards how big would google 's data warehouse be 
 now google 's pretty secretive about their operations so no one really knows how much data google has and in fact no one really knows how many data centers google has except people at google itself  
 and i 've tried i 've met them a few times
  asking them and they aren 't revealing anything  
 so i decided to try to figure this out myself there are a few things that i looked at here  
 i started with money google has to reveal how much they spend in general and that lets you put some caps on
 how many data centers could they be building because a big data center costs a certain amount of money  and you can also then put a cap on how much of the
  world hard drive market are they taking up which turns out it 's pretty sizable  i read a calculation at one point i think google has a drive failure about
 every minute or two and they just throw out the hard drive and swap in a new one so they go through a huge number of them
  and so by looking at money you can get an idea of how many of these centers they have you can also look at power you can look at how much
 electricity they need
  you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers and google is more efficient than most but they still have some basic requirements and that lets you put a
 limit on the number of servers that they have you can also look at square footage and see
 of the data centers that you know how big are they how much room is that how many server racks could you fit in
  for some data centers you might get two of these pieces of information you know how much they spent  
 and they also say because they had to contract with the local government to get the power provided you might know what they made a deal to
 to buy so you know how much power it takes  then you can look at the ratios of those numbers  
 and figure out for a data center where you don 't have that information  you can figure out but maybe you only have one of those you know
  the square footage then you could figure out well maybe the power is proportional  
 and you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities you know with guesses about the total amount of storage the number of servers the number of drives per server  
 and in each case using what you know to come up with a model that narrows down your guesses for the things that you don 't know it 's sort of circling around the number you 're trying to get and this is a lot of fun the math is not all that advanced
  's like nothing more than solving a sudoku puzzle  so what i did  i
 went through all of this information  spent a day or two researching and there are some things i didn 't look at you could always look at the google 
  recruitment messages that they post that gives you an idea of where they have people sometimes when people visit a data center they 'll take a cell cam photo and post it and they
  can just look at pizza delivery drivers turns out they know where all the google data centers are at least the ones that have people in them
  but i came up with my estimate  which i felt pretty good about that was about
 about ten exabytes of data across all of google 's operations  and then another maybe five exabytes
  offline storage in tape drives which it turns out google is about the world 's largest consumer of so
 i came up with this estimate and this this is a staggering amount of data it 's quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has as far as we know there 's a couple of other contenders especially 
 everyone always thinks of the nsa but using some of these same methods we can look at the nsa 's data centers and figure out you know we don 't know what 's going on there but it 's pretty clear that their operation is not the size of google
  adding all of this up i came up with the other thing that we can answer which is how many punch cards would this take  and so a punch card can hold about eighty characters 
  and you can fit about two thousand or so cards into a box  and you put them in say my home region of new england it would cover the entire region up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers  which is about three times deeper than
  the glaciers during the last ice age about twenty thousand years ago  so this is this is impractical but i think
 that 's about the best answer i could come up with  and i posted it on my website i wrote it up and i didn 't expect to get an answer from google 
 because of course they 've been so secretive they didn 't answer of my questions and so i just put it up and said
  but then a little while later
 i got a message a couple weeks later from google saying hey someone here has an envelope for you  
 so i go and get it  open it up and it 's punch cards 
 google branded punch cards  
 and on these punch cards there are a bunch of holes and i said thank you thank you  okay so what 's on here  so i get some software and start reading it and scan them and it turns out it 's a puzzle  there 's a bunch of code
 and i get some friends to help and we we crack the code and then inside that is another code and then there are some equations and then we solve those equations  and then finally out pops a message from google which is their official answer to my article  and it said
  and it 's not that i love doing the math i do a lot of math  but i don 't really like math for its own sake
  what i love is that it lets you take some things that you know  and just by
 moving symbols around on a piece of paper  find out something that you didn 't know that 's very surprising  and i have a lot of stupid questions
  and i love that math gives the power to answer them sometimes
 and sometimes not this is a question i got from a reader 
 an anonymous reader and the subject line just said urgent and this was the entire email 
 if people had wheels and could fly how would we differentiate them from airplanes
