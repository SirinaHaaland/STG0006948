  i come from lebanon 
 and i believe that running can change the world  i know what i have just said is simply not obvious 
 you know lebanon as a country has been once destroyed by a
  long and bloody civil war  honestly  i don 't know why they call it civil war when there is nothing civil about it with
 syria to the north  israel and palestine to the south  and our government even up till this moment is still fragmented
 and unstable 
  the country has been divided between politics
 and religion however for one day a year  we truly stand united  and that 's when the marathon
 takes place i used to be a marathon runner long distance running was not only good for my 
 but it helped me meditate and dream big
  the longer distances i ran  the bigger my dreams became  
 until one fateful morning  and while training  i was hit
 by a bus  i nearly died was in a coma  stayed at the hospital for two years
  be able to walk again 
 as soon as i came out of my coma  i realized that i was no longer the same runner i used to be 
 so i decided if i couldn 't run myself  i wanted to make sure
 that others could  so out of my
  i asked my husband to start taking notes and a few months later  the marathon
 was born organizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident
 may sound strange  
 but at that time even during my most vulnerable condition  i needed to dream big  i needed something to take me out of my pain an objective to look forward to
 i didn 't want to pity myself  nor to be pitied  
 and i thought by organizing such a marathon i 'll
 be able to pay back to my community  build bridges with the outside world  and invite runners to come to lebanon and run under the umbrella of
  organizing a marathon in lebanon
 is definitely not like organizing one in new york 
 how do you introduce the concept of running to a nation that is constantly at the brink of war  
 how do you ask those who were once fighting and killing each other to come together and run next to each
  more than that how do you convince people to run a distance of twenty six point two miles
 at a time they were not even familiar with the word marathon 
 so we had to start from scratch for almost two years we went all over the country and even visited remote villages  
 i personally met with
  the president of the country even housewives 
 i learned one thing  when you walk the talk people believe you  
 many were touched by my personal story  and they shared their stories in return
 it was honesty and transparency that brought us together  we spoke one common language to each other  
 and that was from one human
 to another  
 once that trust was built  everybody wanted to be part of the marathon to show the world the true colors of lebanon
 and the lebanese
  and their desire to live in peace
 and harmony 
 in october two thousand and three over six thousand runners from forty nine different nationalities
 came to the start line  all determined  and when the gunfire went off this time it was a signal
 to run in harmony for
  a change 
 the marathon grew  so did our political problems  
 but for every disaster we had the marathon found ways to bring people together 
 in two thousand and five our prime minister was assassinated and the country came to a complete standstill
  organized a  five kilometer united we run campaign 
 over sixty thousand people came to the start line all wearing white t shirts with no political slogans 
 that was a turning point for the marathon where people started looking at it as a platform for peace
 and unity between two thousand and six up to
  thousand and nine our country lebanon went through unstable years
  invasions  and more assassinations that brought us close to a civil war  
 the country was divided again  so much that our parliament resigned 
 we had no president for a year  
 and no prime minister 
 but
 we did have a
  marathon 
 so through the marathon  we learned that political problems can be overcome 
 when the opposition party decided to shut down part of the city center  we negotiated alternative routes 
 government protesters became
 sideline cheerleaders they even hosted juice stations 
 you know  the marathon
 has really become one of its kind it gained credibility from both the lebanese and the international community  last november
  different nationalities
 came to the start line  but this time they challenged a very stormy and rainy weather  the streets were flooded  but people didn 't want 
  to miss out on the opportunity of being part of such a national day
  the disabled the mentally challenged the blind  the elite the amateur runners even moms with their babies  
 themes have included runs for the environment  breast cancer for the love of lebanon for peace or just simply to run 
 the first annual
  in the region has just taken place only a few weeks ago with four thousand five hundred and twelve women including the first lady  
 and this is only the beginning
 reshape lebanon  raising funds for their causes
 and encouraging others to give  
 the culture of giving and doing good has become contagious  stereotypes have been broken
  and future leaders have been created i
  such a respected event in the region that government officials in the region like iraq  egypt and syria have asked 
  the organization to help them structure a similar sporting event 
  we are now one of the largest running events in the middle east but most importantly it is a platform for hope
 and cooperation in 
 and unstable part of the world from boston
 to beirut  we stand as one 
  from national marathons or from national events to smaller regional races we 've seen that people want to run
 for a better future  after all  peacemaking
 is not a sprint it is more of a marathon  thank you
