  do i look real to you  hope so i have no idea if you 're seeing this but i 'm just going to
  look ahead and trust that you 're there i 've
 drawn a semicircle in the sand in front of me so i don 't walk past it and look like i 'm floating in midair
 right now i 'm standing in the open air on a beach under a palm tree 
 in the exact spot where your stage used to be 
 i have twelve minutes with you  i set a limit
  wife navid once said that
 infinite possibility is a creator 's worst enemy  
 for example this dress i 'd asked her to design something that a priest might have worn in 23rd century cairo  
 but
 we only had three days to make it and the only fabric we had was an old duvet cover that another resident left behind but
 she did it and it 's perfect and she looked at it and
  said proof of concept creation needs constraint 
 so with these twelve minutes  i 'm going to tell you about my greatest discovery
 for my whole life my obsession has been eternal life
  as i know it is so many of yours
  you may be happy to know that your research will pay off  
 i am three hundred and eighteen years old 
 the average human lifespan is now four hundred and thirty two years  and my work has been to extend the human lifespan indefinitely 
 and i 've never questioned that someday we 'll reach a point
  but the opposite keeps happening the longer we live the longer we want to live  the less we want to die  
 who can blame us the universe is so
 big there won 't ever not be more to see just yesterday i was reading about how you can take out a boat on europa and sail from island to island all over
  some of the islands have villages that you can stay and visit and sleep under the shadow of jupiter  and then there 's this other island where there 's just one songwriter who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean  and then there are others where there 's no one
 and there never has been and so you go just for the pleasure of touching your foot to sand that no foot has ever touched before 
 you could spend four hundred years doing just that
 right now the moon is rising in the northeast  
 i can see the cities on it with my naked eye they 're connected like nerve clusters  mariapolis on the south pole  and
 ramachandran on the equator  and new
  tehran in the sea of tranquility 
 that 's where navid and i met we were both artists downtown
  the day we met we were passing each other in azadi square and we bumped shoulders  and i turned to apologize and she without
 saying hello or introducing herself or anything said well why do you think we didn 't just pass through each other 
  but second the question annoyed me because the answer is so simple
  i said we didn 't pass through each other because elementary particles have mass and because the space between elementary particles is filled with the binding energy that also has the properties of 
  mass and we 've known that for eight hundred years 
 she must have been in one of those moods where she likes to mess with strangers or maybe she was just flirting with me
 because she looked at me and said i thought you 'd say that 
 think deeper and then she took off her belt this belt that i 'm wearing now  and she said 
 our universe is built so that
  without that basic constraint we 'd have just passed right through each other at the speed of light and never even known and
 that 's how our romance began
 navid and i
 never ran out of things to talk about
  never it was incredible it was like we were both heroes climbing up into a mountain range together and
 we kept arriving at new vistas and these new perfect constellations of words would come out of us to describe them and we 'd forget them as soon as we made them and throw them over our shoulder and go on to the next 
  thing on and up or one time  navid said that our talk was like we were always making bread
  and that we were always adding in a little more flour and a little more water  and folding it in and turning it over and never
 getting around to baking it 
 if my obsession was eternal life navid 's obsession was touch 
 she had a genius for it all of her work revolved around it
 my body was like a canvas for her and she would
 draw her fingertip
 down over my face so slowly that i couldn 't feel it moving and she was obsessed
 with the exact moment when i would stop being able to tell the difference between her body and mine
 or she would just lie across me and dig her shoulder into mine and say
  why does this feel so good i
 'd say i don 't know 
 and she always had a facetious answer for her facetious question but the answer i remember today is 
 it feels good because the universe chose its constraints and we are its art
  's always funny what you think the future is going to be like versus what it turns out to be 
 in your time scientists thought humans could freeze themselves and wake up in the future 
  and they did but then they died 
 in your time scientists thought humans could
 replace organs and extend life for hundreds of years  and they did but eventually they died anyway
  in your time  earth is the only place people live  
  earth is the place people come to die
 so when navid started to
 show the signs our friends assumed i would do what everyone does which is say goodbye and send her to earth so that none of us would have to
 look at her or
 be around her or think about her and her failure to keep
  want to be around her actual physical body they kept referring to it as declining 
 even though she herself was fascinated by it the changes it was going through 
 following the rules of its nature day by day independent of her will 
  i did send navid to earth  
 but i came with her 
 i remember a friend of ours just before we left said i just think it 's arrogant
  like the rules don 't apply to you like you think your love is that special 
 but i did
 so even here on earth i kept working on how to extend life it didn 't occur to
  that there could be any other response  i kept going back to that thing that navid said to me that that day in azadi square that without that basic constraint
 a universe that granted mass to matter we would not exist 
 that 's one rule another rule is that all mass is subject to
  and there is no way to be in this universe without mass i know  i tried everything  i tried creating a photon box where the higgs field was altered  
 i tried
 recording all subatomic movements in my body and replaying them on closed loop  nothing worked  
 but my final innovation was to create a coil dimension with the boundaries of
  body in which time moved infinitely slower 
 but whose projection would appear to move in normal time 
 that body would then appear in our universe as a hologram
 here but not here
 when i realized i 'd done it
  room so happy to tell her i 'd done it moving through space almost normally to all eyes  even to my own  
 and went to lie down next to her
  and forgot and fell right through her 
 i 'd found a way to eternal
  life 
 at the expense of the one thing navid loved most which was to touch and be touched  
 and she threw me out  
 i still got to watch though  humans live four hundred years now and we still die
  and when death comes the dying still
 pick at their bedsheets  and their arms break out in blue and violet blooms on the insides and
 their breaths get further and further apart like
 they 're falling asleep
  i 've always thought that what gives a life meaning is adventure 
 and death is just a problem we haven 't discovered the solution to yet
  but maybe a life has meaning only because it ends 
  maybe that 's the paradox  constraints don 't constrain they allow perfect freedom
