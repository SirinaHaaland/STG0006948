 give a few notes and
 this is from a book i 'm preparing called letters to a young scientist i 'd thought it 'd be appropriate to
 present it on the basis that i have had extensive experience in
  teaching counseling scientists across a broad array of fields 
 and you might like to hear some of the principles that i 've developed in doing that that teaching and counseling  
 so let me begin
 by urging you  particularly you on the youngsters ' side  on this path you 've chosen  to go as far as you can 
  the world needs you badly humanity is now fully into the 
  age  there is going to be no turning back  
 although varying among disciplines say astrophysics  molecular genetics the immunology the microbiology the public
 health to the new area of the human body as a symbiont
  environmental science knowledge in medical science and science overall is doubling every fifteen
 to twenty years technology is increasing at a comparable rate between them  the two already pervade as most of you here seated realize 
  every dimension of human life  so swift is the velocity
  so startling in its countless twists and turns that no one can predict its outcome even a decade
 from the present moment  there will come a time of course  
 when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge which actually began in the 1600s 
 has to peak and level off but that 's not going to matter to you the revolution is going to continue
 for at least several more
  render the human condition radically different from what it is today
  traditional fields of study
 are going to continue to grow
 and in so doing  inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines 
 in time all of science will come to be a continuum of description 
 an explanation of networks of principles and laws  that 's why you need not just be training in one specialty but
  also acquire breadth
 in other fields related to and even distant from your own initial choice  keep your eyes lifted
 and your head turning  the search for knowledge is in our genes 
 it was put there by our distant ancestors who spread across the world and it 's never going to be quenched
  to understand and use it sanely as a part of the civilization yet to evolve requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people
 like you 
 in education medicine law  diplomacy  government  business and the media that exist today our political leaders
  need at least a modest degree of scientific literacy which most badly lack today no applause
 please it will be better for all if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job therefore you will do well to act 
  on the side no matter how far into the laboratory you may go
  and before else to a subject that is both a vital asset and a potential barrier to a scientific career  if you are a bit short in mathematical skills don 't worry  
 many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically 
 a metaphor will serve here where elite mathematicians and
 statisticians and theorists often
  serve as architects in the expanding realm of science  the remaining large majority of basic applied scientists 
 including a large portion of those who could be said to be of the first rank are the ones who map the terrain they scout the frontiers they cut the pathways 
  they raise the buildings along the way  some may have considered me
  foolhardy  
 but it 's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics when talking to candidate scientists  
 during forty one years of teaching biology at harvard  i watched sadly as bright students turned away
 from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non required courses in science because they were afraid of failure
  science and medicine
 of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent here 's how to relax your anxieties if you have them understand that mathematics is a language
 ruled like other verbal languages or like verbal language generally by its own grammar
 and system of logic any person with average quantitative intelligence intelligence who learns to read and write
  mathematics
 at an elementary level will as in verbal language have little difficulty picking up most of the fundamentals if they choose 
  to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science the longer you wait to become at least semi literate the harder the language
  language but it can be done at any age i speak as an authority on that subject because i 'm an extreme case  i didn 't take algebra 
 until my freshman year at the university of alabama  they didn 't teach it
 tenured professor at harvard  where i sat uncomfortably in classes with
  undergraduate students 
 little more than half my age a couple of them were students in a course i was giving on evolutionary biology 
 i swallowed my pride  and i learned calculus i found out that in science and all its applications what is crucial
 is not that technical ability
  but it is imagination in all of its applications  
 the ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes pictured by intuition  
 i found out that advances in science rarely come upstream
 from an ability to stand at a blackboard and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions and equations  they are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work during which mathematical
  reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant  ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied for its own sake 
 of foremost importance is a thorough
  knowledge of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain you propose to enter when something new is
  discovered it 's logical then that one of the follow up steps
 is to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward if that step proves too difficult for
 the person or team that made the discovery 
 a mathematician
  then be added by them
 as a collaborator  consider the following principle which i will modestly
 call wilson 's principle number one 
 it is far easier for scientists
 including medical researchers to require needed collaboration in mathematics and statistics
 than it is for mathematicians and statisticians to find scientists able to make use of their equations
 is important in choosing the direction to take in science to find the subject
 at your level of competence that interests you deeply and focus on that keep in mind then
 wilson 's second principle for every scientist
  at any level of mathematical competence there exists a discipline in science or medicine
 for which that level is enough to achieve excellence 
 now i 'm going to offer quickly several more principles that will be useful in organizing your education and career or if you 're teaching
  how you might
 enhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists 
 in selecting a subject in which to conduct original research or to develop world class expertise  
 take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited  
 judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on
  the essential requirement of broad training or the value of apprenticing yourself
 in ongoing research to programs of high quality it is important also to acquire older mentors
 within these successful programs and to make friends and colleagues of your age for mutual support  but through it all look for a way to
 break out 
 to find a field and subject not yet popular we have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine 
 there is the quickest way advances are likely to occur as measured in discoveries per investigator per year you may have heard the military dictum
 for the gathering of armies  march to the sound of the guns  in science the exact opposite is the case
  from the sound of the guns  so wilson 's principle number three  
 march away from the sound of the guns  observe from a distance but do not join the fray 
 make a fray of your own 
 once you have settled
 on a specialty a specialty and the profession you can love and you 've secured opportunity
  potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it enough to become an expert  
 there are thousands of professionally delimited subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry to biology and medicine 
 and on then into the social sciences where it is possible in short time
 to acquire the status of an authority when the subject is still very
  thinly populated you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority  the world needs this kind of
 expertise  and it rewards the kind of people willing to acquire it the existing information and what 
  may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect to other bodies of knowledge
 well if that 's the case  good why hard instead of easy  the answer deserves to be stated
 as principle number four 
 in the attempt to make scientific discoveries every problem is an opportunity and the more difficult the problem the greater will be the importance of its
  now this brings me
 to a basic categorization in the way scientific discoveries are made 
 scientists  pure mathematicians among them  
 follow one or the other of two pathways first through early discoveries a problem is identified
 and a solution is sought  
 the problem may be relatively small for example where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread 
 or larger what 's
  role of dark matter
 in the expansion of the universe  
 as the answer is sought other phenomena are typically discovered and other questions are asked this first of the two strategies is like a hunter 
 exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry who finds other quarries along the way
  second strategy
 of research is to study a subject broadly searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena like a hunter
 in what we call the naturalist 's trance the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting any quarry worth taking the search is not for the solution of the problem  
 but for problems themselves worth solving  the two strategies of research  original research can be stated
 the final principle i 'm going to offer you 
 for every problem in a given discipline of science  there exists a species or entity or phenomenon ideal for its solution  
 and conversely for every species or other entity or phenomenon there exist important problems
 for the solution of which
  particular objects of research are ideally suited find out what they are 
 you 'll find your own way to discover to
 learn  to teach the decades ahead will see dramatic advances in disease prevention  
 general health the quality of life 
  all of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice
 of the medicine and the science behind it you will master 
 you have chosen a calling that will come in steps to give you satisfaction at its conclusion 
 of a life well lived and i thank you for having me here tonight
