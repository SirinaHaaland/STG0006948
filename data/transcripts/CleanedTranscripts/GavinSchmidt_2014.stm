  we live in a very complex environment  complexity and dynamism and patterns of evidence from satellite photographs from videos you can even see it outside your window 
  it 's endlessly complex but somehow familiar  but the patterns kind of repeat but they never repeat exactly 
 it 's a huge challenge
 to understand the patterns that you see
 are there at all of the different scales  
 but you can 't chop it into one little bit and say oh well let me just make a smaller climate 
 i can 't use the normal products of reductionism to get a smaller and smaller thing
  that i can study in a laboratory and say oh now that 's something i now understand it 's the whole or it 's nothing 
 the different scales that give you these kinds of patterns
 range over an enormous range of magnitude  
 roughly fourteen orders of magnitude  from the small microscopic particles that seed clouds
 to the
  size of the planet itself from ten to the minus six to ten to the eight fourteen orders of spatial magnitude 
 in time from milliseconds to millennia  again around fourteen orders of magnitude  
 what does that mean  okay well if you think about how you can calculate these things you can take
  chop it up into lots of little boxes  and that 's the result of physics right  and if i think about a weather model that spans about five orders of magnitude from the planet
 to a few kilometers  and the time scale from a few minutes to ten days  maybe a month 
 we 're interested in more than that we 're interested in the climate  that 's years that 's
 millennia  and we need to go to even smaller scales  the stuff that we can 't resolve the
  we need to approximate in some way that is a huge challenge climate models in the  1990s took an even smaller chunk of that only about three orders of magnitude
 climate models in the 
  kind of what we 're working with now  four orders of magnitude  
 we have fourteen to go  and we 're increasing our capability of simulating those at about one extra order of magnitude
 every decade 
 one extra order of magnitude in space is ten thousand times more calculations  
 and we keep adding more things more questions to these different models  so what does a climate model look like 
 this is an old climate model admittedly a punch card a single line of fortran
  we no longer use punch cards we do still use fortran new fangled ideas like c really haven 't
 had a big impact on the climate modeling community  
 but how do we go about doing it how do we go from
 that complexity that you saw to a line of code  
 we do it one piece at a time this is a picture of sea ice taken flying over the arctic  we can look at all of the different equations that go into
  making the ice grow or melt or change shape  we can look at the fluxes we can look at the rate at which snow turns to ice  and we can code that 
  we can encapsulate that in code these models are around a million lines of code at this point and growing by tens of thousands of lines of code every year  
  clouds what happens when clouds form when they dissipate when they rain out that 's another piece 
 what happens when we have radiation coming from the sun going through the atmosphere being absorbed and reflected we can code each of those very small pieces as well 
 there are other pieces the winds changing the ocean currents  we can talk about the role of vegetation
 in transporting water from the soils back into the atmosphere  
 and each of these different elements we can encapsulate and put into a system  each of those pieces ends up adding to the whole 
 and you get something like this you get a beautiful representation of what 's going on in the climate system
  and every one of those
 emergent patterns that you can see the swirls in the southern ocean the tropical cyclone in the gulf of mexico and there 's two more that are going to pop up in the pacific at any point now 
 those rivers of atmospheric water 
 all of those are emergent properties that come from the interactions of all of those small scale processes i mentioned
  there 's no code that says do a wiggle in the southern ocean there 's no code that says have two tropical cyclones that spin around each other 
 all of those things are emergent properties 
 this is all very good this is all great  but what we really want to know is what happens to these emergent properties when we kick the system 
  when something changes what happens to those properties and there 's lots of different ways to kick the system  
 there are wobbles in the earth 's orbit over hundreds of thousands of years that change the climate  
 there are changes in the solar cycles every eleven years and longer that change the climate  big volcanoes go off and change the climate  
 changes in biomass burning in smoke in aerosol particles all of those things change the climate  
 the ozone hole
 changed the climate  
 deforestation changes the climate by changing the surface properties and how water is evaporated and moved around in the system  
 contrails change the climate by creating clouds where there were none before  and of course greenhouse gases
 change the system  each of these different kicks provides
  us with a target
 to evaluate whether we understand something about this system  
 so we can go to look at what model skill is now i use the word skill advisedly models are not right or wrong  they 're always wrong they 
  're always approximations  the question you have to ask is whether a model tells you more information than you would have had otherwise if it does
 it 's skillful 
 this is the impact of the ozone hole on sea level pressure  so low pressure high pressures around the southern oceans around antarctica this is observed data  this is modeled data  
 there 's a good match because we understand the physics that controls the temperatures in the stratosphere and what that does to the winds around the southern oceans
  we can look at other examples  the eruption of mount pinatubo in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one put an enormous amount of aerosols small particles into the stratosphere 
 that changed the radiation balance of the whole planet there was less energy coming in than there was before  so that cooled the planet  and those red lines and those green lines those are the differences between what we expected and what actually happened  
 the models are skillful
  just in the global mean  but also in the regional patterns 
 i could go through a dozen more examples  the skill associated with solar cycles changing the ozone in the stratosphere the skill associated with orbital 
  changes over six thousand years  we can look at that too  and the models are skillful  the models are skillful in response to the ice sheets twenty thousand years ago  the models are skillful
 when it comes to the 20th century trends over the decades 
 models are successful at modeling lake outbursts into the north atlantic eight thousand years ago  
 and we can get a good match to the data  
 each of these different targets each of these different evaluations leads us to add more scope
 to these models  and leads us to
  more and more complex situations that we can
 ask more and more interesting questions like  how does dust from the sahara that you can see in the orange interact with tropical cyclones in the atlantic 
 how do organic aerosols from biomass burning which you can see in the red dots  
 intersect with clouds and rainfall patterns
  how does pollution which you can see in the white wisps of sulfate pollution in europe how does that affect the temperatures at the surface and the sunlight that you get at the surface  
 we can look at this
 across the world  we can look
 at the pollution from china  we can look at the impacts of storms on sea salt
  particles in the atmosphere  we can see the
 combination of all of these different things happening all at once  and we can ask much more interesting questions how do air pollution and climate
 coexist can we change things that affect air pollution and climate at the same time the answer is yes  
 so this is a history of the 20th century  the first one
  one is the model  the weather is a little bit different to what actually happened the second one are the observations and we 're going through the 1930s there 's variability there are things going on but it 's all kind of in the noise as you get towards the 
 things are going to start to change they 're going to start to look more similar
  and by the time you get to the 
  already seeing the patterns of global warming both in the observations and in the model  we know what happened over the 20th century  
 right  we know that it 's gotten warmer we know where it 's gotten warmer  and if you ask the models why did that happen  and you say okay well yes  basically it 's because of the carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere  
 we have a very good match up until
  but there 's one key reason why we look at models  and that 's because of this phrase here 
 because if we had observations of the future  we obviously would trust them more than models
  but unfortunately observations of the future are not available at this time  
 so when we go out into the future there 's a difference the future is unknown the
 future is uncertain  and there are choices 
 here are the choices that we have we can do some work to mitigate the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere  that 's the top one  
 we can do more work
 to really bring it down so that by the end of the century  it 's not much more than there is now or we can just
 leave it to fate and continue on with a
  the differences between these choices can 't be answered by looking at models  
 there 's a great phrase that sherwood rowland  
 who won the nobel prize for the chemistry that led to ozone depletion 
 when he was accepting his nobel prize 
 he asked this question what is the use of having developed a science well enough to make
  predictions if in the end all we 're willing to do is stand around
 and wait for them to come true the models are skillful  but what we do with the information from those models
 is totally up to you
