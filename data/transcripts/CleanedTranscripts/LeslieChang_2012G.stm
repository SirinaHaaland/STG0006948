  talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day our shoes our handbags our computers and cell phones 
 now this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt
  imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes 
 or the young chinese man who jumps off a rooftop after working overtime assembling your ipad 
 we the beneficiaries of globalization  seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make 
 and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves  
 after all what 's wrong with a world in which a worker on an iphone assembly line can 't even afford
  to buy one it 's taken for granted that chinese factories are oppressive  and that it 's our desire for cheap goods that makes them so 
 so this simple narrative equating western demand and chinese suffering is appealing  
 especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the
  but it 's also inaccurate and disrespectful 
 we must be peculiarly self obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world
 to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways 
 in fact china makes goods for markets all over the world  including its own  thanks to a combination of factors  
 its low costs  its large and educated workforce 
 and a flexible manufacturing system that responds
  quickly to market demands 
 by focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets 
 we have rendered the individuals on the other end into invisibility as tiny and interchangeable as the parts of a mobile phone 
 chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for ipods  they choose to leave their homes in order to earn money to learn new skills and to see the world
 in the ongoing debate about globalization what 's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves  here are a few bao
 my mother tells me to come home and get married  but if i marry now  before i have fully developed myself 
 i can only marry an ordinary worker 
 so i 'm not in a rush
  i went home for the new year  everyone said i had changed  they asked me what did you do that you have changed so much 
 i told them that i studied and worked hard if you tell them more they won 't understand anyway 
 wu chunming even if i make a lot of money it won 't satisfy me just to make money is not enough meaning in life
 now after i get off work i study english  because in the future our customers won 't be only chinese so we must learn more languages 
 all of these speakers by the way are young women eighteen or nineteen years old 
 so i spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south china factory city called dongguan  certain subjects came up over and over
  how much money they made  what kind of husband they hoped to marry whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were 
 other subjects came up almost never including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life  
 ten or fifteen workers in one room fifty people sharing a single bathroom  
 days and nights ruled by the factory clock  
 everyone they knew lived in similar
  circumstances  and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural china 
 the workers rarely spoke about the products they made  and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did 
 when i asked lu qingmin  the young woman i got to know best what exactly she did on the factory floor  she said something to me in chinese that sounded like
  only much later did i realize that she had been saying qc or quality control  
 she couldn 't even tell me what she did on the factory floor all she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didn 't even understand 
 karl marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism  the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor
  maker of shoes or cabinets the worker in an industrial factory has no control 
 no pleasure and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work 
 but like so many theories that marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the british museum  he got this one wrong 
 just because a person spends her time making a piece of something
 does not mean that she
  becomes that a piece of something 
 what she does with the money she earns  what she learns in that place and how it changes her these are the things that matter 
 what a factory makes is never the point  and the workers could not care less who buys their products 
 journalistic coverage of chinese factories on the other hand  plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make
  many articles calculate how long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he 's making 
 for example an entry level line assembly line worker in china in an iphone plant would have to shell out two and a half months ' wages for an iphone 
 but how meaningful is this calculation
  for example i recently wrote an article in the new yorker magazine but i can 't afford to buy an ad in it 
 but who cares i don 't want an ad in the new yorker and most of these workers don 't really want iphones their calculations are different 
 how long should i stay in this factory how much money can i save  
 how much will it take to buy an apartment or a car to get married  or to put my child through school 
 the workers i got to know had a curiously abstract relationship
 with the product of their labor 
 about a year after i met lu qingmin  or min she invited me home to her family village for the chinese new year 
 on the train home she gave me a present a coach brand change purse with brown leather trim  
 i thanked her assuming it was fake like almost everything else for sale in dongguan  
 after we got home min gave her mother
 another present a pink dooney & bourke handbag and a few nights later her sister was showing off a maroon lesportsac shoulder bag 
 slowly it was dawning on me
 that these handbags were made by their factory and every single one of them was authentic 
 min 's sister said to her parents in america this bag sells for three hundred and twenty dollars
  farmers looked on speechless and that 's not all coach is coming out with a new line two thousand one hundred and ninety one she said one bag will sell for six thousand 
 she paused and said i don 't know if that 's six thousand yuan or six thousand american dollars  but anyway it 's six thousand 
 min 's sister
 's boyfriend who had traveled home with her for the new year said 
 it doesn 't look like it 's worth that much 
 min 's sister turned to him and said some people actually understand these things 
 you don 't understand shit 
 in min 's world the coach bags had a curious currency 
 they weren 't exactly worthless but they were nothing close to the actual value because almost no one they knew wanted to buy one or knew how much it was worth
 once when min 's older sister 's friend got married  she brought a handbag along as a wedding present  
 another time after min had already left the handbag factory her younger sister came to visit  bringing two coach signature handbags as gifts 
 i looked in the zippered pocket of one  and i found a printed card in
  the burnished patina of an all american baseball glove
 inspired the founder of coach to create a new collection of handbags from the same luxuriously soft gloved hand leather 
 six skilled leatherworkers crafted twelve signature handbags
 with perfect proportions and a timeless flair they were fresh functional and women everywhere adored them
 a new american classic was born 
 i wonder what karl marx would have made of min and her sisters 
 their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated surprising and funny than he could have imagined
  and yet his view of the world persists and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses to imagine that we can know what they 're really thinking
 the first time i met min she had just turned eighteen and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory 
 over the next two years i watched as she switched jobs five times  eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory 
 later she married a fellow migrant worker moved with him to his village gave birth to two daughters
  saved enough money to buy a secondhand buick for herself
 and an apartment for her parents  
 she recently returned to dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes  
 temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village 
 in a recent email to me she explained 
 a person should have some ambition while she is young
 so that in old
  age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose 
 across china there are one hundred and fifty million workers like her one third of them women 
 who have left their villages to work in the factories  the hotels  the restaurants and the construction sites of the big cities  
  they make up the largest migration in history  
 and it is globalization this chain that begins in a chinese farming village and ends with iphones in our pockets and nikes on our feet
  and coach handbags on our arms that has changed the way these millions of people work and marry and live and think
  that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers i also worried that nothing would ever happen to them or that they would have nothing to say to me 
 instead i found young women who were smart and funny and brave and generous 
 by opening up their lives to me they taught me so much about factories and about china and about how to live in the world
  this is the coach purse that min gave me on the train home to visit her family  i keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me to the young women i wrote about 
 ties that are not economic but personal in nature measured not in money but in memories 
 this purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine sitting in your office
  or in the library are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world
  you know what really impressed me about the workers is how much they 're self motivated self driven resourceful 
 and the thing that struck me what they want most is education to learn because most of them come from very poor backgrounds they usually left school when
  parents are often illiterate and then they come to the city and they on their own at night during the weekends they 'll take a computer class they 'll take an english class and learn
 really really rudimentary things you know like how to type a document in word or how to how to say really simple things in english so if you really want to help these workers  start these small 
 very focused  very pragmatic classes in these schools and what 's going to happen is all your workers are going to move on but hopefully they 'll move on into higher jobs within apple
  and
 you can help their social mobility and their  self improvement when you talk to workers that 's what they want they do not say i want better hot water in the showers i want a nicer room i want a tv set i mean 
 it would be nice to have those things but that 's not why they 're in the city and that 's not what they care about ca was there a sense from them of a narrative that
 things were kind of tough and bad or was there a narrative of of some kind of level of growth that things
 over time were
 getting better lc oh definitely definitely i mean you know it was interesting because i spent basically two years
 hanging out in this city dongguan and over that time you could see immense change in every person 's life 
 upward downward sideways but generally upward  if you spend enough time it 's upward and i met people who had moved to the city ten years ago and who are now basically urban middle class people so the trajectory is definitely upward  it 's just hard to see when
  you 're suddenly sucked into the city it looks like everyone 's poor and desperate but that 's not really how it is certainly the factory conditions are really tough and it 's nothing you or i would want to do 
 but from their perspective where they 're coming from is much worse  and where they 're going is hopefully much better and i just wanted to give that context of what 's going on in their minds not what necessarily is going on in yours
