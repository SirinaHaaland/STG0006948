  brain magic what 's brain magic all about brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind reading effects so unlike traditional magic it uses the power of words 
 linguistic deception non verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense
  'm going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how  i want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody i want everybody to put out your hands like this for me first of all 
 ok clap them together once 
 ok  reverse your hands now follow my actions exactly now about half the audience has their left hand up  why is that ok swap
  them around put your right hand up
 cross your hands over so your right hand goes over interlace your fingers like this then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb that 's very important yours is the other way around so swap it around  
 excellent  ok  extend your fingers like this for me 
 all right tap them together once ok now  if you did not allow me to deceive your minds you would all be able to do this
  now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind once you know how 
 now i remember when i was about fifteen 
 i read a copy of life magazine  which detailed a story about a  75 year old blind russian woman
 who could sense printed letters there 's
  and even sense colors just by touch and she was completely blind she could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed face down on a hard surface 
 now i was fascinated  but at the same time skeptical how could somebody read using their fingertips
  you know if you actually think about it  if somebody is totally blind
 a guy yesterday did a demonstration
  where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things
  and it 's just a really weird thing to try and figure out how could somebody read using their fingertips now earlier on as part of a tv show that i have coming up on mtv i attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight  
 so  let 's take
  expert can see through somebody else 's eyes
  i 'm trying to see through your eyes
  the way two days ago  we were going to film this down there at the race
  we got a guy into a car and we got a camera man in the back  but halfway through the drive he told me he had i think it was a nine millimeter stuck to his leg so i stopped pretty quick and that was it
 so do you believe it 's possible to see through somebody else 's eyes that 's the question now most people here would automatically say no  ok
  want you to just think about it for a moment a lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened all right but because your brains are not trained in the art of deception 
 the solutions you come up with will ninety nine percent of the time be way off the mark 
 this is because magic is all about directing attention if for instance i didn 't want you to look at my right hand then i don 't look at it  but if i wanted you to look at my right hand  then i look at it
  you know how but very complicated in other ways i 'm going to give you some demonstrations right now i need two people to help me out real quick can you come up  
 and let 's see 
 down at the end here can you also come up real quick do you mind  yes at the end  ok give them a round of applause as they come up you might want to use the stairs there it
  's very important for everybody here to realize i haven 't set anything up with you you don 't know what 
 would you mind just standing over here for a moment  your name is
  i want you to just stand exactly like this for me pull up your sleeves if you don 't mind 
 ok now i want you to be aware of all the different sensations around you because we 'll try a voodoo experiment i
 want you to be aware of the sensations  but don 't say anything until i ask you 
 and don 't open
  your eyes until i ask you  from this point onwards close your eyes  do not say anything do not open them be aware of the sensations
 yes or no did you feel anything nicole yes kb you did feel that what did you feel
  extend your left arm out in front of you extend your left arm ok ok
 keep it there  be aware of the sensations don 't say anything don 't open your eyes ok did
  can you show us where 
 ok excellent  open your eyes  i never touched you i just touched his back  
 and i just touched his arm a voodoo experiment yeah
 i walk around nightclubs all night like this 
 you just take a seat over here for a second i 'm going to use you again in a moment can you take a seat right over here
 if you don 't mind sit right here man
 ok kb ok take a seat  excellent  ok  now what i want you to do is look directly at me  ok  just take a deep breath in through your nose letting it out through your mouth  
 and relax allow your eyes to close on five four three two one close your eyes right now ok now i 'm not
  i 'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity so our minds are along the same lines 
 and as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind  
 i 'm going to take your left hand  and just place it up here i want you to hold it there just for a moment  and i only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness and allow it to go
  i want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop ok
 now allow it to stay there 
 ok now in a moment  you 'll feel a certain pressure  ok  and i want you to be aware of the pressure just
 be aware of the
  only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release but only when you feel the pressure release do you understand 
 just answer yes or no man yes kb 
 hold it right there and only when you feel the pressure go back allow your hand to drift back to the
  that was wonderfully done  let 's try it again  
 excellent  now that you 've got the idea let 's try something even more interesting allow
  to stick firmly to the tabletop keep your eyes closed can you stand up
 just stand stage forward i want you to point directly at his forehead  
 ok  imagine a connection between you and him 
 only when you want the pressure to be released  make an upward gesture like this but only when you want it to be released you can wait as long as you want  but only when you want the pressure
  only when you want the pressure to go back make a downward gesture you can wait as long as you want
  want you to be aware that in a moment  when i snap my fingers your eyes will open again 
 it 's ok to remember to forget or forget to remember what happened  most people ask you what the hell just happened up here 
 but it 's ok that even though you 're not hypnotized you will forget everything that happened 
 on five four three two one open your eyes
  i once saw a film called the gods are crazy has anybody here seen that film  yeah remember when they threw the coke out of the airplane and it landed on the ground  and it didn 't break now 
 see that 's because coke bottles are solid  
 it 's nearly impossible to break a coke bottle
  you see psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes 
 for some magicians or mentalists  sometimes the spoon will bend or melt  sometimes it will not  sometimes the object will slide across the table sometimes it will not it depends on how much energy you have that day so on and so
  going to try an experiment in psychokinesis right now  come right over here next to me
 excellent  now  have a look at the coke bottle make sure it is solid there 's only one hole and it 's a normal coke bottle and you can whack it against the table if you want be careful  
 even though it 's solid i 'm standing away   i want you to
 pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb excellent now i 've got a shard of glass here
 ok i want you to examine the shard of glass careful  it 's sharp just hold on to it for a moment  now  hold it out here  i want you to imagine right now
 a broken relationship from many years ago  i want you to imagine
 all the negative energy from that broken relationship from that guy  being imparted into the broken piece of glass  which will represent him  ok  
 but i want you to take this very seriously stare at the glass  ignore everybody right here in a moment you 'll feel a certain sensation  
 ok  and when you feel that sensation  i want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle  think of that guy
  that ba that
 guy i 'm
 trying to be good here  ok  and when you feel the sensation it might take a while drop it into the glass
 ok drop it in now
  all that negative energy in there  imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass and i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side
  how many letters in the title of his name there 's five letters in the title you didn 't react to that so it 's four letters think of one of the letters in the title there 's a k in his name there is a k i knew that because my name starts with a k also but his name doesn 't start with a k it starts with an m 
 tell mike i said hello the next time you see him was that his name
  i 've got one more thing to share with you right now  actually  chris i was going to pick you for this but instead of picking you can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment 
  i was going to use you but i decided i might want to come back another year ca well to reward him for saying eureka and for selecting michael mercil to come and talk to us steve jurvetson
  assistants underneath there  they insist that because i was a magician put a nice black tablecloth on there you are ok 
 i 've got four wooden plinths here steve  one
 two three and four now they 're all the exact same except this one obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it i
 want you to examine it and make sure it 's solid
  i 'm going to stand in front of the table when i stand in front of the table i want you to put the cups on the plinths in any order you want and then mix them all up  so nobody has any idea where the spike is all right sj no one in the audience kb yes and just to help you out i 'll
 block them from view  so nobody can see what you 're doing i 'll also
  look away so go ahead and mix them up now  ok and tell me when you
  you know where the spike is but nobody else does  correct  but i don 't want you to know either  so swivel around on your chair they 'll keep an eye on me to make sure i don 't do anything funny
  going to put on the blindfold don 't stack them up ok  give them an extra
  give the plinths an extra mix up and then line them up 
  put the blindfold on give them an extra mix up  no messing around this time ok
  yes or no
  do you think it 's here yes or no  this is your decision not mine
  give me both hands now  put them on both cups  do you think the spike is under your left
