  can be hell you can grab the
  is over  
 you can never tell
  people tell you this one thing
 will make your life complete so you you give it everything you got
 and you wind up on the street
  one day you wake up 
 and they tell you you 're a queen
 but lose your edge or lose your cool they will drop
  they can be hell you
  maybe i 'm just cynical 
 and all these words are lies but
 experience keeps telling me that the cautious
  but caution makes you hesitate 
 and hesitate you 're lost
