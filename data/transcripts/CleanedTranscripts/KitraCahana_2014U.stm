  as a little girl i always imagined i would one day run away 
 from the age of six on i kept a packed bag with some clothes and cans of food tucked away in the back of a closet 
 there was a deep restlessness in me a primal fear that i would fall
  prey to a life of routine and boredom 
 and so many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i would walk across borders forage for berries 
 and meet all kinds of strange people living unconventional lives on the road  
 years have passed but many of the adventures i fantasized about as a child
 traveling and weaving my way between worlds other than my own have become
  realities through my work as a documentary photographer  but no other experience has felt as true to my childhood dreams
 as living amongst and documenting the lives of fellow wanderers across the united states 
 this is the nomadic dream a different kind of american dream lived by young hobos travelers hitchhikers vagrants
  and tramps 
 in most of our minds the vagabond is a creature from the past 
 the word hobo conjures up an old black and white image of a weathered old man covered in coal legs dangling out of a boxcar but these photographs are in color 
 and they portray a community swirling across the country fiercely alive and creatively free  seeing sides of
  america that no one else gets to see 
 like their predecessors today 's nomads travel the steel and asphalt arteries of the united states 
 by day they hop freight trains stick out their thumbs and ride the highways with anyone from truckers to soccer moms 
 by night they sleep beneath the
  huddled together with their packs of dogs  cats and pet rats between their bodies 
 some travelers take to the road by choice  renouncing materialism traditional jobs and university degrees in exchange for a glimmer of adventure 
 others come from the underbelly of society 
 never given a chance to mobilize upwards  foster care dropouts  teenage runaways escaping abuse and unforgiving homes 
 where others
  see stories of privation and economic failure travelers view their own existence through the prism of liberation and freedom  
 they 'd rather live off of the excess of what they view as a wasteful consumer society
 than slave away at an unrealistic chance at the traditional american dream  
  they take advantage of the fact that in the united states up to forty percent of all food ends up in the garbage
 by scavenging for perfectly good produce in dumpsters and trash cans  they sacrifice material comforts in exchange for the space
 and the time to explore a creative interior to dream to read to work on music  art and writing  
 but there are many aspects to this life that are far from idyllic no
  one loses their inner demons by taking to the road  
 addiction is real the elements are real 
 freight trains maim and kill and anyone who has lived on the streets can attest to the exhaustive list of laws
 that criminalize homeless existence 
 who here knows that in many cities across the united states it is now illegal to sit on the sidewalk to wrap oneself
  in a blanket to sleep in your own car to offer food to a stranger 
 i know about these laws because i 've watched as friends and other travelers were hauled off to jail or received citations for committing these so called crimes 
 many of you might be wondering why anyone would choose a life like this under the thumb of discriminatory laws eating out of
  trash cans sleeping under bridges picking up seasonal jobs here and there 
 the answer to such a question is as varied as the people that take to the road  but travelers often respond with a single word  
 freedom  
 until we live in a society where every human
  is assured dignity in their labor so that they can work to live well not only work to survive 
 there will always be an element of those who seek the open road as a means of escape 
 of liberation
 and of course of rebellion thank you
