  information technology grows in an exponential manner 
 it 's not linear and our intuition is linear when we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago we made linear predictions where that animal would be and that
  's hardwired in our brains but the pace of exponential growth is really what describes
 information technologies and it 's not just computation 
 there is a big difference between linear and exponential growth if i take thirty steps linearly one two three four five i get to thirty if
 i take thirty steps exponentially two four eight sixteen i get to a billion it makes a huge
  and that really describes information technology when i was a student at mit we all shared one computer that took up a whole building the computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper a million times 
  smaller a thousand times more powerful that 's a billion fold increase in capability per dollar that we 've actually experienced since i was a student  and we 're going to do it again in the next twenty five years information technology progresses through a series of
  each one is a different paradigm so people say what 's going to happen when moore 's law comes to an end which will happen around two thousand and twenty we 'll then go to the next paradigm  
 and moore 's law was not the first paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing the exponential growth of computing started decades before gordon moore was even born  and it doesn 
  't just apply to computation it 's really any technology where we can measure the underlying information properties here we have
  put them in a logarithmic graph  the logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase because this represents  trillions fold increase since the 
 and ninety census in 1950s they were shrinking vacuum tubes making them smaller and smaller they finally hit a wall they couldn 't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum and that was the end
 of the shrinking of vacuum tubes but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing we went to the fourth paradigm
  transistors and finally integrated circuits  when that comes to an end we 'll go to the sixth paradigm 
  molecular circuits  but what 's even more amazing really than this
 fantastic scale of progress is that look at how predictable this is i mean this went through thick and thin through war and peace through boom times and recessions the great depression
 made not a dent in this exponential progression
  the same thing in the economic recession we 're having now at least the exponential growth of information technology capability
 will continue unabated  
 and i just updated these graphs because i had them through two thousand and two in my book the singularity is near 
 so we updated them so i could present it here to two thousand and seven and i was asked well aren 't
  it kind of didn 't stay on this exponential progression i was a little nervous because maybe the data wouldn 't be right but
 i 've done this now for thirty years and it has stayed on this exponential progression look at this graph  here you could buy one transistor for a dollar in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight you can buy half a billion today and they are actually better  because they are faster  
 but look at how predictable this is
  and the cost of a transistor cycle which is a measure of the price performance of electronics comes down about every year that 's a fifty percent deflation rate and it 's also true of other examples like dna data or brain data 
 but we more than make up for that we actually ship more than twice as much of every form of information technology we 've had eighteen percent growth in constant dollars in every form of information technology for the last
  fact that you can get twice as much of it each year
  this is a completely different example this is not moore 's law 
 the amount of dna data we 've sequenced has doubled every year  the cost has come down by half
 every year and this has been a smooth progression since the beginning of the genome project and halfway through the project  skeptics
  this is not working out  you 're halfway through the genome project and you 've finished one percent
 of the project but that was really right on schedule because if you double one percent seven more times which is exactly what happened you get one hundred percent and the project was finished on time 
 communication technologies fifty different ways to measure this 
 the number of bits being moved around the size of the internet  but this has progressed at an exponential pace this is deeply democratizing
  over twenty years ago in the age of intelligent machines when the soviet union was going strong that it would be swept away by this growth of decentralized
 communication  
 and we will have plenty of computation as we go through the 21st century to do things like simulate regions of the human brain but where will we get the software some critics say oh well software is stuck in the mud 
 but we are learning more and more about the human brain spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year  the amount of data we 're getting about the brain is doubling every year
  and we 're showing that we can actually turn this data
 into working models and simulations of brain regions there is about twenty regions of the brain that have been modeled  simulated and tested  the auditory cortex  regions of the visual cortex 
 cerebellum where we do our skill formation slices of the cerebral cortex where we do our rational
  of this has fueled an increase very smooth and predictable of productivity we 've gone from thirty dollars to one hundred and thirty dollars in constant dollars in the value of an average hour of human labor fueled by this information technology  
 and we 're all concerned about energy and the environment well
 this is a logarithmic graph this represents a smooth doubling every two years 
 of the amount of solar energy we 're creating particularly as we 're now applying nanotechnology a form of information technology to solar panels 
  only eight doublings away from it meeting one hundred percent of our energy needs and there is ten thousand
 times more sunlight than we need 
 we ultimately will merge with this technology it 's already very close to us when i was a student it was across campus now it 's in our pockets 
 what used to take up a building now fits in our pockets what now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood
  and we will begin
 to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence as we get closer and closer to this technology 
 based on that we are announcing here at ted in true ted tradition singularity university it 's a new university that 's founded by peter diamandis who is here in the audience and myself it 's backed by nasa and google
  our goal was to assemble the leaders both teachers and students in these exponentially growing information technologies and their application but larry page made an impassioned speech at our organizing meeting  
 saying we should
 devote
 this study to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing
  and if we did that then google would would back this and so that 's what we 've done 
 the last third of the of the nine week intensive summer session will be devoted to a group project to address
 some major challenge of humanity like for example applying the internet  which is now ubiquitous in the rural areas of china or in africa 
 to bringing health information
 to developing areas of the world
  and these projects will continue past these sessions  using collaborative interactive communication all the
 intellectual property that is created and taught will be online and available and developed online in a collaborative fashion here
 is our founding meeting  but this is being announced today it will be permanently headquartered in silicon valley at the nasa ames research center  there are different programs
  for graduate students for executives at different companies the first six tracks here artificial intelligence advanced computing technologies biotechnology nanotechnology are the different 
 core areas of information technology then we are going to apply them to the other areas like energy
