  a few years ago my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis 
 her wrists  knees and toes swelled up causing crippling chronic pain
  she had to file for disability she stopped attending our local mosque  some mornings it was too painful for her to brush her teeth  
 i wanted to help  but i didn 't know how  i 'm not a doctor 
 so what i am is a historian of medicine so i started to research the history
  an entire history of pain collection in their archives and i found a story
 a fantastic story of a man who saved rescued millions of people from pain  people like my mom 
 yet i had never heard of him there were no biographies of him no hollywood
  the circus had just arrived in the tiny town of brookfield new york
  spectators flocked to see the wire walkers the tramp clowns if they were lucky the human cannonball  
 they also came to
  see the strongman johnny bull walker  a brawny bully who 'd pin you for a dollar you know 
 on that particular day a voice rang out over the circus p a system 
 they needed a doctor urgently in the live animal tent something had gone wrong with the lion
 tamer the climax of his act had
 gone wrong and his head was stuck inside the
  lion 's mouth
 he was running out of air  the crowd watched in horror as he struggled and then
 passed out  when the lion finally did relax its jaws the lion tamer just
 slumped to the ground  motionless  when he came to a few minutes later
 he saw a familiar figure hunched over him  it was bull walker
  the strongman had given the lion tamer
 and saved his life 
 now the strongman hadn 't told anyone but he was actually a third year medical student 
 he toured with the circus during summers to pay tuition  but kept it a secret to protect his persona
  he was supposed to be
 a brute a villain not a nerdy do gooder 
 his medical colleagues didn 't know his secret either as he put it if you were an athlete you were a dumb dodo 
 so he didn 't tell them about the circus or
 about how he wrestled professionally on evenings and weekends  he used a pseudonym like
 bull walker or later the masked marvel 
 he even kept it a secret that same year when he was crowned the light heavyweight champion of the world 
 over the years john j bonica lived these parallel lives  he was a wrestler  he was a doctor
 he was a heel  he was a hero
 he inflicted pain  and he treated it and he didnt know
  it at the time but over the next five decades  he 'd draw on these dueling identities to forge a whole new way to think about pain 
 it 'd change modern medicine so much so that decades later time magazine would call him pain relief 's founding father  
 but that all happened later
  medical school and married emma his sweetheart  whom he had met at one of his matches years before 
 he still wrestled in secret  he had to his internship at new york 's st vincent 's hospital paid nothing 
 with his championship belt he wrestled in
  the matches took a toll on his body  he tore hip joints fractured ribs 
 one night the terrible turk 's big toe scratched a scar like capone 's down the side of his face the next morning
  he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it
 twice bonica showed up to the o r with one eye so bruised he couldn 't see out of it 
 but worst of all were his mangled cauliflower ears he said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head 
 pain just kept accumulating in his life  next he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital
  heaved and pushed clearly in anguish 
 her obstetrician called out to the intern on duty to give her a few drops of ether to ease her pain 
 but the intern was a young guy just three weeks on the job he was jittery and in applying the ether  
 irritated emma 's throat she vomited and choked
  who was watching all this pushed the intern out of the way  cleared her airway  and saved his wife and his unborn daughter 
 at that moment  he decided to devote his life to anesthesiology 
 later he 'd even go on to help develop the epidural for delivering mothers  but
  showed up to madigan army medical center near tacoma at seven thousand seven hundred beds it was one of the largest army hospitals in america 
 bonica was in charge of all pain control there
  everything he had learned 
 pain was supposed to be a kind of alarm bell in a good way a body 's way of signaling an injury like a broken arm
 but in some cases  like after a patient had a leg amputated 
 that patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg
 but if the injury had been treated why would the alarm bell keep ringing
 there were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever  and yet still the patient hurt
 bonica tracked down all the specialists at his hospital surgeons neurologists psychiatrists  others 
 and he tried to get their opinions on his patients it took too long so he started
 organizing group meetings over lunch
 it would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient 's pain no one had ever focused on pain this way before 
 after that he hit the books 
 he read every medical textbook he could get his hands on carefully noting every mention of the word pain 
 out of the fourteen thousand pages he read the word
  seventeen and a half of them seventeen and a half for the most
 basic most common most frustrating part of being a patient
 bonica was shocked i 'm quoting him he said what the hell kind of conclusion can you come to there the most important thing from the patient 's perspective
  they don 't talk about 
 so over the next eight years bonica would talk about it he 'd write about it he 'd write those missing pages 
 he wrote what would later be known as the bible of pain 
 in it he proposed
 new strategies new treatments using nerve block injections he proposed a new institution the pain clinic based on those
  the most important thing about his book was that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine a desperate plea to doctors to
 take pain seriously in patients ' lives
 he recast the very purpose of medicine  the goal wasn 't to make patients
 better it was to make patients
 feel better
 he pushed his pain agenda for decades before it finally took hold in the 
 hundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world  but as they did
 a tragic twist  bonica 's years of wrestling caught up to him 
 he had been out of the ring for over twenty years but those
  hundred professional bouts had left a mark on his body 
 still in his mid 50s he suffered severe osteoarthritis 
 over the next twenty years he 'd have twenty two surgeries  including four spine operations  and hip replacement after hip replacement 
 he could barely raise his arm
  he needed aluminum crutches to walk his friends and former students became his doctors one recalled that
 he probably had more nerve block injections than anyone else on the planet  already a workaholic he worked
 even more 15 to 18 hour days  healing others became more than just his job it was his own most effective form of relief
  if i wasn 't as busy as i am he told a reporter at the time i would be a completely disabled guy 
 on a business trip to florida in the early 1980s bonica got a former student to drive him to the hyde park area in tampa 
 they drove past palm trees and pulled up to an old mansion with
  silver howitzer cannons hidden in the garage  
 the house belonged to the zacchini family who were something like american circus royalty 
 decades earlier bonica had watched them  clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles  doing the act they pioneered
 the human cannonball  but now they were like him
 that generation is all dead now  including bonica so there 's no way to know exactly what they said that day but
 still i love imagining it  the strongman and the human cannonballs reunited  showing off old scars and new ones  
 maybe bonica gave them medical advice
  maybe he told them what he later said in an oral history which is that his time in the circus and wrestling
 deeply molded his life
  bonica saw pain close up he felt it he lived it 
 and it made it impossible for him to ignore in others  
 out of that empathy he spun a whole new field  played a major role in getting
  medicine to acknowledge pain in and of itself in that same oral history bonica claimed that pain
 is the most complex human experience  that it involves your
 past life your current life  your interactions your family
  was definitely true for bonica but it was also true for my mom it
 's easy for doctors to see my mom as a kind of
 professional patient a woman who just spends her days in waiting rooms  
 sometimes i get stuck seeing her that same way  
 but as i saw bonica 's pain a testament
  to his fully lived life i started to remember all the things that my mom 's pain holds 
 before they got swollen and arthritic my mom 's fingers
  when i was a kid they cut my hair
