  i 've learned some of my most important life lessons from drug dealers
 and gang members
 and prostitutes  and i 've had some of my most profound theological conversations
  not in the hallowed halls of a seminary
 but on a street corner on a friday night at one
 a m that 's a little unusual since i am a baptist minister
 and pastored a church for over twenty years  but it 's true  it came as a part of my participation
  in a public safety crime reduction strategy that saw a seventy nine percent reduction in violent crime
 over an eight year period in a major city  
 but i didn 't start out wanting to be a part of somebody 's crime reduction strategy  i was twenty five had my
  if you would have asked me what my ambition was i would have told you i wanted to be a megachurch pastor  i wanted a 
  church  i wanted my own television ministry  i wanted my own clothing line 
 i wanted to be your long distance carrier  you know the whole nine yards 
 after about a year of pastoring my membership went up
  about twenty members so megachurchdom was way down the road  
 but seriously if you 'd have said what is your ambition i would have said just to be a good pastor 
 to be able to be with people through all the passages of life to preach messages that would have an everyday meaning for folks and
  i serve  but there was something else that was happening
 in my city and in the entire metro area  and in most metro areas
 in the united states and that was the homicide rate
 started to rise precipitously  and there were young people who were killing each other for reasons that i thought were very trivial
 like bumping into someone in a high school
  hallway  and then after school  shooting the person someone
 with the wrong color shirt on on the wrong street corner at the wrong time
  and something needed to be done about that 
 it got to the point where it started to change the character of the city  you could go to any housing project for example like the one
  that was down the street from my church  
 and you would walk in and it would be like a ghost town  because the parents wouldn 't allow their kids to come out and play even in the summertime because of the violence  
 you would listen in the neighborhoods on any given night and to the untrained ear it sounded like fireworks but it was gunfire  you 'd hear it
  you were cooking dinner  telling your child a bedtime story or just watching tv  
 and you can go to any emergency room at any
 hospital  and you would see lying on gurneys
 young black and latino men shot and dying  and i was doing funerals but not of the venerated matriarchs and patriarchs
  and i was standing in a church or at a funeral home struggling to say something that that would make some meaningful impact
 and so while my colleagues were building these cathedrals great and tall and buying property outside
  outside of the city and and moving their congregations out so that they could
 create or recreate their cities of god 
 the social structures in the inner cities were sagging under the weight of all of this violence  
 and so i stayed because somebody needed to do something and so i
 i had looked at what i had and and moved on that i started to preach decrying the violence in the community  
 and i started to look at the programming in my church and i started to build programs that would catch the at risk youth those who were on the fence to the violence  
 i even tried to be innovative in my preaching you all have heard of
 rap music right rap music  i even tried to rap sermon one time  
  but i preached and i built these programs and i thought maybe if my colleagues did the same that it would make a difference  but the violence just careened out of
  control and people who were not involved in the violence were getting shot and killed somebody going to buy
 a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store or someone who was sitting at a bus stop just waiting for a bus 
 or kids who were playing in the park  oblivious to the violence on the other side of the
  but it coming and visiting them  things were out of control  and i didn 't know what to do  and then something happened
 that changed everything for me it was a kid by the name of jesse mckie walking home with his friend rigoberto carrion
 to the housing project down the street from my church  they met up with a group of youth who were from a gang in in dorchester and they were killed
  but as jesse was running from the scene mortally wounded he was running in the direction of my church  and he died some one hundred one hundred and fifty yards away  
 if he would have gotten to the church it wouldn 't have made a difference  because the lights were out nobody was home  and i took that as a sign  
 when they caught some of the youth that had done this deed to my surprise they were around my age
  but the gulf that was between us was vast it was like we were in two completely different worlds  
 and so as i contemplated all of this and looked
 at what was happening  i suddenly realized that there was a paradox that was emerging inside of me 
 and the paradox was this
  in all of those sermons that i preached decrying the violence i was also talking about building community 
 but i suddenly realized that there was a certain segment of the population
 that i was not including in my definition of community  
 and so the paradox was this if i really wanted the community that i was preaching for i needed to reach out
 and embrace this group that i had cut out of my definition which
  meant not about building programs to catch those who were on the fences of violence  
 but to reach out and to embrace those who were committing the acts of violence the gang bangers the drug dealers 
 as soon as i came to that realization a quick question came to my mind  why me  
  a law enforcement issue this is why we have the police right
 as soon as the question why me came the answer came just as quickly  
 why me  because i 'm the one who can 't sleep at night thinking about it 
 because i 'm the one looking around saying somebody needs to do something about this and i 'm starting to realize that that someone is me i mean
 isn 't that how movements start anyway they don 't start with a a grand convention and people coming together and
  then walking in lockstep
 with a with a statement  
 but it starts with just a few or maybe just one 
 it started with me that way  
 and so i decided to figure out the culture of violence in which these young people who were committing them existed and i started to volunteer at the high school 
 after about two weeks of volunteering at the high school i realized that the youth that i was trying to reach
 they weren 't going to high school  
 i started to walk in the community and it didn 't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren 't out during the day 
 so i started to walk the streets at night  
 late at night  going into the parks where they were building the relationship that was necessary 
 a tragedy happened in boston that brought a
  number of clergy together 
 and there was a small cadre of us who came to the realization that we had to come out of the four walls of our sanctuary and meet the youth where they were and not try to figure out
 how to bring them in and
 so we decided to walk together and
 we would get together in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the city on a friday night and on a saturday night
 p m and we would walk until two or three in the morning  i imagine we were quite the anomaly when we first started walking i mean  we weren 't
 drug dealers we weren 't drug customers we weren 't the police some of us would have collars on it was probably a really odd thing  
 but they started speaking to us after a while and what we found out is that
 while we were walking they were watching us
  us  and they wanted to make sure of a couple of things that number one we were going to be consistent in our behavior 
 that we would keep coming out there and then secondly they had wanted to make sure that we weren 't out there to exploit them
 because there was always somebody who would say we
 're going to take back the streets but they would always seem to have a television camera with them or a reporter  and they would enhance
  their own reputation to the detriment of those on the streets so when they saw that we had none of that they decided to talk to us  
 and then we did an amazing thing for preachers we decided to listen and not preach 
 come on give it
  we said to them we don 't know our own communities after nine p m at night  between nine  p m and five a m but you do 
 you are the subject matter experts if you will of that period of time 
 so talk to us  teach us help us to see what we 're not seeing help us to
  understand
 what we 're not understanding 
 and they were all too happy to do that  and we got an idea of what life on the streets was all about very different
 than what you see on the eleven o 'clock news  very different
 than what is portrayed in popular media and even social media and as we were talking with them a number of myths were dispelled
  about them with us  and one of the biggest myths was that these kids were cold and heartless
 and uncharacteristically bold in their violence  what we found out was the exact opposite 
 most of the young people who were out there on the streets are just trying to make it on
  and we also found out that some of the most intelligent and creative and
 magnificent
 and wise people that that we 've ever met
 were on the street  
 engaged in a struggle  
 and i know some of them call it survival but i call them overcomers because when you 're in the conditions that they 're in to be able to live every day
 is an accomplishment of overcoming  
 and as a result of that we said to them how do you see this church how do you see this institution
 helping this situation and we developed a plan in conversation with these youths  we stopped looking at them as the problem
  and we started looking at them as partners as assets as
 in the struggle to reduce violence in the community  imagine developing a plan you have one minister at one table and a and a heroin dealer at the other table 
 coming up with a way in which the church can help the entire community  
 the boston miracle was about bringing people together
  we had other partners  we had law enforcement partners we had police officers
 it wasn 't the entire force because there were still some who still had that lock ' em up mentality  but there were other cops
 who saw the honor in partnering with the
  who saw the responsibility from themselves to be able to work as partners with community leaders and faith leaders in order to reduce violence in the community  
 same with probation officers  same with judges  
 same with folks who were up that law enforcement chain  because they realized like we did that we 'll never arrest
  that there will not be enough prosecutions made and you cannot fill these jails up
 enough in order to alleviate the problem 
 i helped to start an organization
 twenty years ago a faith based organization to deal with this issue i left it about four years ago and
  started working in cities across the united states nineteen in total  
 and what i found out was that in those cities there was always this component of community leaders
 who put their heads down and their nose to the grindstone who checked their egos at the door and saw the whole as greater than the sum of its parts  
 and came together and found ways
  ways to work with youth out on the streets that the solution is not
 more cops  
 but the solution is is mining the assets that are there in the community  to have a strong community component
 in the collaboration around violence reduction now there is a movement in
 the united states of young people who i am very proud of who are dealing with the structural issues
 that need to change if we 're going to be a better society  but there is this political ploy to try to pit
 police brutality and police misconduct
  but it 's a fiction  it 's all connected  when you think about
 decades of failed housing policies and and poor educational structures when you think about persistent
 unemployment and underemployment in a community  when you think about poor healthcare  and then you throw drugs into the mix
 and duffel bags full of guns little wonder that
  you would see this culture of violence emerge  and then the response that comes from the state is more cops
 and more suppression
 of hot spots it 's all connected  and one of the wonderful things that we 've been able to do
 is to be able to show the value of partnering together community
  law enforcement private sector the city in order to reduce violence you have to value that community component  
 i believe that we can end the era of violence in our cities  
 i believe that it is possible and that people are doing it even now  but i need your help
 't just come from folks who are burning themselves out in the community  they need support  they need help 
 go back to your city  find those people you need some help i 'll help you out 
 find those people they 're there bring them together with
  the private sector and the city with the one aim of reducing violence but make sure that that community component is strong  
 because the old adage that comes from burundi is right that you do
 for me  without me  you do to me  god bless you
