  is a good word even in the times of h1n1 i like the word 
 laughter is contagious passion is contagious 
 inspiration is contagious  we 've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers  
 but for me
  was contagious about all of them
 was that they were infected by something i call the i can bug so
 the question is 
 why only them in a country of a billion people and some why so few 
 is it luck is it chance can we all not systematically and consciously get infected
  the next eight minutes i would like to share with you my story 
 i got infected when i was seventeen 
 when as a student of the design college  i encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas  challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me 
 and i was struck by just how wonderful it felt  and how contagious that feeling was 
 i also realized i should have got infected when i was seven
  when i started riverside school ten years ago it became a lab a lab to prototype and refine a design process
 that could consciously infect the mind with the i can bug  
 and i uncovered that if learning is embedded in real world context that if you blur the boundaries between school and life 
 then children go through a journey of aware where they can see the change
  the change  and that directly increased student wellbeing children became more competent  and less helpless  
 but this was all common sense so i 'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at riverside 
 a little background when my grade five was learning about child rights  they were made to roll
  experience what it means to be a child laborer it transformed them what you will see is their journey  and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world
  that child labor just had to be abolished 
 and look at ragav that moment when his face changes because he 's been able to understand that he has
 shifted that man 's mindset and that can 't happen in a classroom 
  i am doing it and that 's the i can mindshift and it is a process that can be energized and nurtured 
 but we had parents who said okay making our children good human beings is all very well  but what about math and science and english show us the grades and we did 
 the data was conclusive when children are empowered not only do they do
  they do well  in fact very well  as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over two thousand schools in india 
 riverside children were outperforming the top ten schools in india in math english and science 
 so it worked it was now time to take it outside riverside  
 so on august 15th independence day two thousand and seven the children of riverside set out to infect
  now it was not about riverside school it was about all children so we were shameless we walked into the offices of the municipal corporation the police the press  
 businesses  and basically said when are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child 
 when will you include the child in the city basically open your hearts and your minds to the child so how did the city respond
  since two thousand and seven every other month
 the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic
 and converts it into a playground for children and childhood here was a city telling its child you can a glimpse of infection in ahmedabad
 they are skating  they are doing street plays
  city gives to the children 
 in the future the children will give back to the city kbs 
  're getting the pattern first two hundred children at riverside then thirty thousand children in ahmedabad and growing  it was time now to infect india  
 so on august 15th again independence day two thousand and nine empowered with the same process we empowered one hundred
  we designed a simple toolkit converted it into eight languages  and reached thirty two thousand schools
 we basically gave children a very simple challenge  we said  take one idea  anything that bothers you choose one week 
 and change a billion lives  
 and they did stories of change poured in from all over india 
 from nagaland in the east to jhunjhunu in the west from sikkim in the north
 to krishnagiri in the south 
 children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism and thirty two children who stopped sixteen child marriages in rajasthan  
 i mean  it was incredible basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in
  rally and a street play in a rural school unheard of
  it was a revelation for me
  it was a revelation
  doesn 't strike me that they had so much
  they were changing lives  it was incredible so
 how can we still stay immune 
 how can we stay immune to that passion that energy that excitement 
 i know it 's obvious but i have to end with the most powerful symbol of change  gandhiji  seventy years ago it took one man to infect an entire
  with the power of we can
