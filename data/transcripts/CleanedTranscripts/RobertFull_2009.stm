  let me share with you today
 an original discovery  but i want to tell it to you the way it really happened not the way i present it in a scientific meeting or the way you 'd read it in a scientific paper
  story about beyond biomimetics to something i 'm calling biomutualism 
 i define that as an association between biology and another discipline where each discipline reciprocally advances the other but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field 
 now in terms of biomimetics as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature nature becomes a much more useful teacher  
  engineering can be inspired by biology by using its principles and analogies when they 're advantageous  but then integrating that with the best human engineering ultimately to make something actually better than nature now
 being a biologist i was very curious about this these are gecko toes  and we wondered how they use these bizarre toes to climb up a wall so quickly we discovered it  and what we found was
  structures on their toes with millions of tiny hairs
 that look like a rug and each of those hairs has the worst case of split ends possible about one hundred to one thousand split ends that are nano size and the individual has two billion of these nano size split ends 
 they don 't stick by velcro or suction or glue they actually stick by intermolecular forces alone van der waals forces 
 and i 'm really pleased to report to you today that the first synthetic self cleaning dry adhesive has been made
 from the simplest version in nature one branch my engineering collaborator ron fearing at berkeley had made the first synthetic version 
 and so has my other incredible collaborator mark cutkosky at stanford he made much larger hairs than the gecko  but used the same general principles 
 and here is its first test
  's kellar autumn my former ph d student professor now at lewis and clark literally giving his first born child up for this test
  60 foot ascent  lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing of hollywood
 and science man so you 're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko lynn verinsky ha wow 
 and what a privilege that has been robert full 
 that 's what she did on rough surfaces but she actually used these on smooth surfaces two of them to climb up and pull herself up and you can try this in the
  the gecko inspired material
  now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can 't get unstuck with the material  
 this is the gecko 's solution they actually peel their toes away from the surface at high rates as they run up the wall  well i 'm really excited today to show you
 the newest version
  here is what it does
  able to do in designing this incredible robot oh 
 one thing i want to
 point out is look at stickybot 
 you see something on it it 's not just to look like a gecko  it has a tail and just when you think you 've figured out nature this kind of thing happens 
 the engineers told us for the climbing robots that if they don 't have a tail  they fall off the wall 
 so what they did was they asked us an important question 
 they said well it kind of looks like a tail even though we put a passive bar there do animals use their tails when they climb up walls
 what they were doing was returning the favor by giving us a hypothesis to test in biology that we wouldn 't have thought of 
 so of course in reality we were then panicked being the biologists and we should know this already  we said well what do tails do well we know that tails store fat for example  we know that you can grab onto things with them 
 and perhaps it is most well known that they provide static
  balance it can also act as a counterbalance so watch this kangaroo 
 see that tail that 's incredible  
 marc raibert built a uniroo hopping robot  
 and it was unstable without its tail  
 now mostly tails limit maneuverability like this human inside this dinosaur suit
 my colleagues actually went on to test this limitation 
 by increasing the moment of inertia of a student  
 so they had a tail and running them through and obstacle course and found a decrement in performance like you 'd predict 
 but of course  this is a passive tail and you can also have active tails and when i went back to research
  that one of the great ted moments in the past from nathan we 've talked about an active tail video myhrvold thinks tail cracking dinosaurs were interested in love 
 not war robert full
 he talked about the tail being a whip for communication  it can also be used in defense  
  so we then went back and looked at the animal  
 and we ran it up a surface but this time what we did is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there and watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips this is slowed down ten times  
 so here is normal speed  and watch it now slip  and see what it does with its tail 
  has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg and it contributes to stability  if you make it slip a huge amount  this is what we discovered
  this is incredible  the engineers had a really good idea  
 and then of course we wondered  okay they have an active tail but let 's picture them they 're climbing up a wall  or a tree and they get to the top and let 's say there 's
 some leaves there and what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf and there was some wind or we shook it 
 and we did that experiment that you see here and
 this is what we discovered now that 's real time you can 't see anything but there it is slowed down 
 what we discovered was the world 's fastest air righting response for those of you who remember your physics that 's a zero angular momentum righting response
  cats falling cats do this they twist their bodies  but geckos do it better and they do it with their tail  
 so they do it with this active tail as they swing around and then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture 
 okay now we wondered if we were right we should be able to test this in a physical model in a robot  so for ted we actually built a robot
  over there a prototype with the tail and we 're going to attempt the first air righting response in a tail  with a robot if we could have the lights on it 
 okay  
 there it goes  and
 show the video 
 there it is and it works just like it does in the animal  so all you need is a swing
  of course we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations so we thought oh that 's okay we 'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel we
 'll blow the air up we 'll give it a landing target a tree trunk just outside the plexi glass enclosure  and see what it does 
 so we did and here is what it does so the wind is coming from the
  slowed down ten times 
 it does an equilibrium glide  
 highly controlled this is sort of incredible  but actually it 's quite beautiful when you take a picture of
 and it 's better than that it just in the slide maneuvers in mid air and the way it does it is it takes its tail and it swings it one way to yaw left and it swings its other way to yaw right  
 so we can maneuver this way 
 and then we had to film this several times to believe this
 it also does this watch this it oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin  it can actually swim through the air  
 but watch its front legs can you see what they are doing 
 what does that mean for the origin of flapping flight 
 maybe it 's evolved from coming down from trees and trying to control a glide 
 stay tuned for that
  so then we wondered can they actually maneuver with this so there is the landing target could they steer towards it
 with these capabilities here it is in the wind tunnel and it
 certainly looks like it you can see it even better from down on top watch the animal  
 definitely moving towards the landing target watch the whip of its tail as it does
  we have to go to the field  and see if it actually does this completely opposite of the way you 'd see it on a nature film of course 
 we wondered do they actually glide in nature well we went to the forests of singapore and southeast asia  
 and the next video you see is the first time we 've showed this this is the actual video not staged a real research video of animal gliding down  
 there is a red trajectory line look at the end to see the animal
  but then as it gets closer to the tree look at the close up and see if you can see it land  
 so there it comes down there is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line you see it there there watch it come down now watch up there and you can see the landing did you see it hit it
 actually uses its tail too just like we saw in the lab
