  it can spread over acres and acres of area or it could fit in a small space as small as your house garden
  is just two years old 
 i have a forest in the backyard of my own house  
 it attracts a lot of biodiversity bird
 call i wake up to this every morning like a disney princess 
 i am an entrepreneur who facilitates the making of
  public parks
 and even a zoo
 to have one of such forests a forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together a forest
 can be an integral part of
  our urban existence 
 a forest for me is a place so dense with trees that you just can 't walk into it it doesn 't matter how big or small they are 
 most of the world we live in today
 was forest this was before human intervention then we built up our cities on those forests like so paulo
  we belong to nature as well  as much as eight point four million other species on the planet 
 our habitat stopped being our natural habitat 
 but not anymore for some of us a few others and i today make these forests professionally
 anywhere and everywhere  
 i 'm an industrial engineer  i specialize in making cars in my previous job at toyota i learned how
  natural resources into products 
 to give you an example we would drip the sap out of a rubber tree convert it into raw rubber and make a tire out of it the product 
 but these products can never become a natural resource again 
 we separate the elements from nature and convert them into an irreversible state that 's industrial production 
 nature on the
  other hand works in a totally opposite way the natural system produces by bringing elements together  atom by atom 
 all the natural products become a natural resource again 
 this is something which i learned
 when i made a forest in the backyard of
  my own house and this was the first time i worked with nature rather than against it since then we have made
 such forests in twenty five cities across the world 
 every time we work at a new place  we find that every single element needed to make a forest
 is available right around us  all we have to do is to bring these elements together and let nature take over
  to make a forest we start with soil  we touch  feel and even taste it
 to identify what properties it lacks if the soil is made up of small particles it becomes compact so compact that water cannot seep in
 we mix some local biomass available around which can help soil become more porous 
 water can now
  now seep in if the soil
 doesn 't have the capacity to hold water  we will mix some more biomass some water absorbent material like peat or bagasse so soil can hold this water
 and it stays moist to grow plants need water sunlight and nutrition 
 what if the soil doesn 't have any nutrition in it we don 't just
  add nutrition directly to the soil  that would be the industrial way  it goes against nature  
 we instead add microorganisms to the soil they produce the nutrients in the soil naturally 
 they feed on the biomass we have mixed in the soil  so all they have to do is eat and multiply  and as their number grows the soil starts
 breathing again it becomes alive  
 we survey the native tree species of the place how do we decide what 's native or not 
 well  whatever existed before human intervention is native that 's the simple rule  
 we
 survey a national park
 to find the last remains of a natural forest 
 we survey the sacred groves or sacred forests around old temples
  and if we don 't find anything at all we go to museums to see the seeds or wood
 of trees existing there a long time ago we research old paintings  poems and literature
 from the place to identify the tree species belonging there 
 once we know our trees we divide them in four different layers  shrub layer sub tree layer tree layer and canopy layer
  we fix the ratios of each layer and then we decide the percentage of each tree species in the mix 
 if we are making a fruit forest we increase the percentage of fruit bearing trees it could be a flowering forest 
 a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees or it could simply be a native  wild evergreen forest
  we collect the seeds and germinate saplings out of them 
 we make sure that trees belonging to the same layer are not planted next to each other or they will fight for the same vertical space when they grow tall 
 we plant the saplings close to each other 
 on the surface we spread a thick layer of mulch  so when it 's hot outside the soil stays moist when it 's cold  frost formation happens
  only on the mulch  so soil can still breathe while it 's freezing outside the soil is very soft
 so soft that roots can penetrate into it easily
 rapidly  
 initially the forest doesn 't seem like it 's growing but it 's growing under the surface in the first three months roots reach a depth of one meter 
 these roots form a mesh
  holding the soil  
 microbes and fungi live throughout this network of roots 
 so if some nutrition is not available in the vicinity of a tree  these microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree  
 whenever it it rains  magically  mushrooms appear overnight and this means the soil below has a healthy
  once these roots are established forest starts growing on the surface as the forest grows
 we keep watering it for the next two to three years  we water the forest  
 we want to keep all the water and soil nutrition only for our trees so we remove the weeds growing on the ground as this forest
  it blocks the sunlight 
 eventually the forest becomes so dense that sunlight can 't reach the ground anymore  weeds cannot grow now because they need sunlight as well  
 at this stage  every single drop of water that falls into the forest doesn 't evaporate back into the atmosphere 
 this dense forest condenses the moist air and retains its moisture 
 we gradually reduce and eventually stop watering the forest
  without watering the forest floor stays moist and sometimes even dark 
 now  when a single leaf falls on this forest floor  it immediately starts decaying 
 this decayed biomass forms humus which is food for the forest  
 as the forest grows more leaves fall on the surface it means more humus is produced it means more food so the forest can grow
  still bigger and this forest keeps growing exponentially  
 once established these forests are going to regenerate themselves again and again probably forever 
 in a natural forest like this no management is the best management it 's a tiny
  this forest grows as a collective  if the same trees same species would have been planted independently it wouldn 't grow so fast 
 and this is how we create a 100 year old forest in just ten years  thank you very much
