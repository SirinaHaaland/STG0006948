  i thought a lot about the first word i 'd say today and i decided to say colombia 
 and the reason i don 't know how many of you have visited colombia but colombia is just north of the border with brazil  
 it 's a beautiful country with extraordinary people like me and others
 and
 it 's populated with incredible fauna flora it 's got water it 's got everything to be the perfect place  
 but we have a few problems you may have heard of some of them we have the oldest
 standing guerrilla in the world  it 's been around for over fifty years which means
 that in my lifetime i have never lived one day of peace in my country
 this guerrilla and the main group is the farc guerrillas revolutionary armed forces of colombia 
 they have financed their war by kidnapping by extortion by getting into the drug trade by illegal mining there has been
  's not really good and
 if you look at the human cost of this war over fifty years we have had more than five point seven million displaced population it 's one of the biggest displaced populations in the world 
 and this conflict has cost over two hundred and twenty thousand lives  so it 's a little bit like the
  are now
 in the middle of peace talks and we 've been trying to help resolve this problem peacefully 
 and as part of that we decided to try something completely lateral and different 
 christmas lights  
 so christmas lights  and you 're saying what the hell is this guy going to talk about  
 i am going to talk about
 gigantic trees that we put
  in nine strategic pathways in the jungle covered with christmas lights these trees
 helped us demobilize three hundred and thirty one guerrillas  roughly five percent of the guerrilla force at the time 
 these trees were lit up at night  and they had a sign beside them that said if christmas can come to the jungle
 you can come home demobilize at christmas everything is possible so
 how do we know these trees worked well we got three hundred and thirty one which is okay  but we also know that not a lot of guerrillas saw them  but we know that a lot of guerrillas heard about them  
  because we are constantly talking to demobilized guerrillas so let me take you back four years before the trees 
 four years before the trees we were approached by the government to help them
 come up with a communications strategy to get as many guerrillas as we could out of the jungle the government had a military strategy it had a legal strategy  
 it had a political strategy but it said we don 't really have a communications strategy and
 it probably would be a good thing to have
  we decided to
 immediately jump into this 
 because it is an opportunity to affect the outcome of the conflict conflict with the things that we do with the tools that we have  
 but we didn 't know very much about it we didn 't understand in colombia 
 if you live in the cities you 're very far away from where the war is actually happening so you don 't really understand it and we asked the government
  to give us access to as many demobilized guerrillas as possible  and we talked to about sixty of them 
 before we felt we fully understood the problem 
 we talked about they told us why they had joined the guerrillas why the left the guerrillas what their dreams were what their frustrations were and from those conversations came the underlying insight that has guided this whole campaign
  which is
 that guerrillas are as much prisoners of their organizations as the people they hold hostage 
 and at the beginning we were so touched by these stories we were so amazed by these stories that we thought that maybe the best way to talk to the guerrillas was to have them talk to themselves  
 so we recorded about a hundred different stories during the first year  and we put them
  on the radio and television so that the guerrillas in the jungle could hear stories 
 their stories or stories similar to theirs  and when they heard them they decided to go out  i want to tell you one of these stories  
 this person you see here is giovanni andres giovanni andres is twenty five when we took that picture he had been seven years in the guerrilla and he had demobilized very recently
  story is the following  he was recruited when he was seventeen and sometime later 
 in his squadron  if you will this beautiful girl was recruited and they fell in love 
 their conversations were about what their family was going to be like what their kids
  names would be how their life would be when they left the guerrilla  
 but it turns out that love is very strictly forbidden in the lower ranks of the guerrilla so their romance was discovered and they were separated  
 he was sent very far away and she was left behind she was very familiar with the territory  
 so one night when she was on guard she just left 
 and she went to
 to the army she
  and she was one of the persons that we had the fortune to talk to and we were really touched by this story so we made a radio spot  
 and it turns out  by chance that far away  many many kilometers north 
 he heard her on the radio and when he heard her on the radio he said what am i doing here 
 she had the balls to get out  i need to do the same thing
  did he walked for two days and two nights
  and he risked his life and he got out and the only thing he wanted was to see her the only thing that that was in his mind was to see her 
 the story was they did meet  i know you 're wondering if they did meet  they did meet  she had been
  recruited when she was fifteen and she left when she was seventeen so there were a lot of other complications but they did eventually meet  i don 't know if they 're together now  
 but i can find out 
 but what what i can tell you is
 that that our radio strategy was working the problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla it was not working with the commanders the people that are more difficult to replace because you can easily
  recruit but you can 't get the older the older commanders  so
 we thought well we 'll use the same strategy we 'll have commanders talking to commanders  
 and we even went as far as asking ex commanders of the guerrilla to fly on helicopters with microphones
 telling the people that used to fight with them there is a better life out there
  but 
 as you can all imagine it was very easy to counteract because what was the guerrilla going to say yeah right if he doesn 't do that he 's going to get killed so it was easy  so we were suddenly left with nothing 
 because the guerrilla were spreading the word that
 all of those things are done because
 if they don 't do it they
  and somebody some brilliant person in our team came back and said you know what i noticed i noticed
 that around christmastime there have been peaks of demobilization since this war has started 
 and that that was incredible because
 that led us to think that we needed to talk to the human being and not to the
  soldier we needed to step away from talking from government to
 to army from army to army  and we needed to talk about the universal values and we needed to talk about humanity  and that was
 when the christmas tree happened this picture that i have here you see this is the planning of the christmas trees  and that man you see there with
 with the three stars  he 's captain juan manuel valdez captain valdez
 was the first high ranking official to give us the helicopters and the support we needed to put these christmas trees up and 
  he said in that meeting something that i will never forget  he said i want to do this because
  makes my men feel stronger 
 and i get very emotional when i remember him because he was he was killed later in combat and we really miss him  but
  i wanted you all to see him because he was really really important he gave us all the support to put up the first christmas trees 
 what happened later is that the guerrillas who came out during the christmas tree operation
  and all of that
 said that 's really good christmas trees are really cool but you know what we really don 't walk anymore  we use rivers 
 so rivers are the highways of the jungle and this is something we learned  
 and most of the recruiting was being done in and around the river villages  
 so we went to these river villages  and we asked the people and probably
  some of them were direct acquaintances of the guerrillas we asked them can you send
 guerrillas a message we collected over six thousand messages 
 some of them were notes saying get out some of them were toys some of them were candy even people took off their jewelry their little crosses and religious things and 
  put them in these floating balls that we sent down the rivers
 so that they could be picked up at night  and we sent thousands of these down the rivers and then picked them up later if they weren 't 
 but lots of them were picked up this generated 
 on average a demobilization every six hours  so this was incredible and it was about come home at christmas 
 then
 came the peace process  and when the peace process started
 the whole mindset of the guerrilla changed  and it changed because
 it makes you think well if there 's a peace process this is probably going to be over at some point i 'm going to get out 
 and their fears completely changed  and their fears were not
 about am i going to get killed  their fears were am i going to be rejected
  when i get out of this am i going to be rejected so the past christmas what we did was we asked
 we found twenty seven mothers of guerrillas  and we asked them to give us pictures
 of their children 
 when they only could recognize themselves so as not to put their lives in danger  and we asked them to give the most motherly message you can get  which is
 you were a guerrilla you were my child  so come home i 'm waiting for you
  you can see the pictures here i 'll show you a couple thank you 
 and these pictures were placed in many different places 
 and a lot of them
  work with society  so we did mothers around christmastime now let 's talk about the rest of the people 
 and you may be aware of this or not but there was a world cup this year
 and colombia played really well  
 and it was a unifying moment for colombia and what we did was
 tell the guerrillas
  jungle we 're saving a place for you so this was television this was 
 all different types of media saying we are saving a place for you the soldier here in the commercial says 
 i 'm saving a place for you right here in this helicopter so that you can get out of this jungle and go enjoy the world cup 
 ex football players radio announcers everybody was saving a place for
  so since we started this work a little over eight years ago seventeen thousand guerrillas have demobilized 
 i do not thank
 you i don 't want to say in any way
  that it only has to do with what we do  
 but what i do know is that our work and the work that we do may have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization 
  and it may have helped a lot of them take the final decision 
  but on behalf of all the colleagues i see here who work in advertising and of all the team that has worked with me to do this that
 if you want to change the world  or if you want to achieve peace please call us we 'd love to help  thank you
