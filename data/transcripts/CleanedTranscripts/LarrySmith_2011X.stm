  i want to discuss with you this afternoon why you 're going to fail to have a great career 
 i 'm an economist i do
  end of the day  it 's ready for dismal remarks 
 i only want to talk to those of you who want a great career  i know some of you have already decided you want a good career  
 you 're going to fail too 
 because goodness you 're all cheery about failing canadian group undoubtedly 
  those trying to have good careers are going to fail  
 because really good jobs are now disappearing  there are great jobs and great careers  and then there are the
 bloodsucking soul destroying kinds of jobs and practically nothing in between so people looking for good jobs are going to fail  i want to talk about those looking for great jobs 
 great careers and why you 're going to
  matter how many times people tell you 
 if you want a great career  you have to pursue your passion you have to pursue your dreams  you have to pursue the greatest fascination in your life you hear 
  it again and again and then you decide not to do it  it doesn 't matter how many times you download
  you still look at it and decide not to do it i 'm not quite sure why you decide not to do it  you 're too lazy to do it it 's too hard  you 're afraid if you look for your passion and don 't find 
  it you 'll feel like you 're an idiot so then you make excuses about why you 're not going to look for your passion they are excuses ladies and gentlemen we 're going to go through a whole long list your creativity 
  in thinking of excuses not to do what you really need to do if you want to have
  for example one of your great excuses is 
 well great careers are really and truly for most people just a matter of luck  so i 'm going to stand around i 'm going to try to be lucky  
  and if i 'm lucky i 'll have a great career if not i 'll have a good career but a good career is an impossibility so that 's not going to work then
  your other excuse is yes  there are special people who pursue their their passions  but they are geniuses they are steven  j i 'm not a genius 
  when i was five i thought i was a genius but my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since
  fifty being completely
 competent that would have given you a great career but guess what this is almost two thousand and twelve  and saying to the world i am totally completely competent 
 is damning yourself
 with the faintest of praise  and then of course another excuse
  i would do this  i would do this but but well after all  
 i 'm not weird  everybody knows that people who pursue their passions are somewhat obsessive a little strange hmm hmm 
 okay you know a fine line between madness and genius i 'm not weird 
  i 've read steven j ' s biography oh my goodness i 'm not that
  but i still want a great career  i 'm not prepared to pursue my passion  so i know what i 'm going to do  because i have i have a solution i have a strategy  it 's the one mommy and daddy told me about mommy and daddy told me that if i worked
 i worked hard i 'd have a good career  
 so if you work hard and have a good career  if you work really really really hard  you 'll have a great career doesn 't that like mathematically make sense hmm 
 not 
 but you 've managed to talk yourself into that you know what here 's a little secret you want to work you want to work really really really hard  you know what you 'll succeed the world will give you the opportunity to work really
  you so sure that that 's going to give you a great career  when all the evidence is to the contrary so 
 let 's deal with those of you who are trying to find your passion you actually understand that you really had better do it  never mind the excuses you 're trying to find your passion 
  you found something you 're interested in i have an interest  i have an interest you tell me  you say i have an interest i say that 's wonderful  
 and what what are you trying to tell me well i have an interest i say do you have passion i have an interest you say 
 your interest is compared to what well  i 'm interested in this 
 and what about the rest of humanity 's
  is your greatest love passion is the thing that will
 help you create the highest expression of your talent passion  interest it 's not the same thing are you really going to go to your sweetie and say marry me  
  what you want what you want what you want 
 is passion it
 is beyond interest 
 you need twenty interests  and then one of them one of them might grab you one of them might engage you more than anything else  and then you may have found your greatest love in
 comparison to all the other things that interest
 and that 's what passion is i have a friend  proposed to his sweetie he was an economically rational person
  he said to his sweetie let us marry  
 let us merge our interests 
 laughter yes he did i love you
  i love you deeply  
 i love you more than any other woman i 've ever encountered  
 i love you more than mary  jane susie penelope ingrid gertrude  gretel
 i was on a german exchange program then  i love you more than 
 all right she left the room halfway through his
 enumeration
 of his love for her  after he got over his surprise at being
 know turned down he concluded he 'd had a narrow escape from marrying an irrational person
 although he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed it was perhaps not necessary to enumerate
 all of the women he had auditioned for the part
  but the point stands you must look for alternatives so that you find your destiny  or are you afraid of the word 
 the word destiny scare you that 's what we 're talking about and if you don 't find the highest expression of your talent  if you settle for interesting what the hell ever that means do you know what will happen at the end of your long life your friends and family will be
  gathered in the cemetery and there beside your gravesite will be a tombstone and inscribed on that tombstone it will say here lies a distinguished engineer who invented velcro 
 but what
 that tombstone should have said in an alternative lifetime what it should have said if it was your highest
  here lies the last nobel laureate in physics who formulated the grand unified field theory and demonstrated the practicality of warp drive 
 laughter velcro indeed 
 one was a great career  one
 was a missed opportunity  but then there are some of you
  in spite of all these excuses you will find you will find your passion 
 and you 'll still fail  you 're going to fail  because
 because you 're not going to do it  because you will have invented
 a new excuse any excuse to fail to take action and this
  excuse i 've heard so many times yes  i would pursue
 a great career  but i value
 human relationships more than accomplishment  i want to be a great friend  i want to be a
  i want to be a great parent  and i will not sacrifice them on the altar of great accomplishment 
 what do you want me to say now  do you really want me to say now tell you really i swear i don 't kick children 
 look at the worldview you 've given yourself you 're a hero no matter what
  and i by suggesting
 ever so delicately that you might want a great career  must hate children i don 't hate children i don 't kick them  yes there was a little kid wandering through this building
 when i came here and no i didn 't kick him 
 laughter course i had to tell him the building was for adults only and to get out 
 he mumbled something about his mother  and i told him she 'd probably find him outside anyway
 last time i saw him he was on the stairs crying 
 what a wimp but
 what do you mean that 's what you expect me to say  do you really think it 's appropriate that you should actually take
 children and use them as a shield  you know what will happen someday
  ideal parent you 
 the kid will come to you someday and say 
 i know what i want to be 
 i know what i 'm going to do with my life you are so happy it 's the conversation a parent wants to hear  because your kid 's good in math  and you know you 're going to like what comes next 
 says your kid i have decided i want to be a magician i want
  and what do you say  you say  you say 
 that 's risky kid
 might fail kid don 't make a lot of money at that kid  i don 't know kid you should think about that again kid you 're so good at math why don 't
 you the kid interrupts you and says but it is my dream it
  is my dream to do this and what are you going to say  you know what you 're going to say look kid  i had a dream once too but
 but so how are you going to finish the sentence with your but but 
 i had a dream too once kid  but i was afraid to pursue it or are you going to tell him this i had a dream once kid 
  do you really want to use your family do you really ever want to look at your spouse and your kid  and see your jailers 
 there was something you could have said to your kid  when he or she said i have a dream you could have said
 looked the kid in the face and said 
 go for it kid  
 just like i did 
 but you won 't be able to say that 
 because you didn 't so you can 't 
 and so the sins of the parents
  are visited on the poor children 
 why will you seek refuge in human relationships as your excuse
 not to find and pursue your passion  you know why in your heart of hearts
  you know why and i 'm being deadly serious  you know why you would get all warm and fuzzy and wrap yourself up in human relationships
 it is because you are
 you know what you are you 're afraid
 to pursue your passion  
 you 're afraid to look ridiculous you 're afraid to try  you 're afraid you may fail  
 great friend great spouse
  great parent 
 great career is that not a package is that not who you are how can you be one without the other  
 but you 're afraid 
 and that 's
 why you 're not going to have a great career
  is also attached to that other most terrifying phrase if only i had
  your brain it will hurt a lot so those are the many reasons why you are going to fail
 to have a great career
