  have milestones in life that we remember so vividly 
 the first one for me was when i was entering kindergarten my big brother was in school and by golly it was my time
  and i went trottin ' down that hallway  i was so excited i almost wet myself  and i go to the door and there was the teacher with a warm welcome
 and she took me into the classroom  showed me my little cubbyhole we all remember those little cubbyholes don 't we and we put our stuff in there 
 and then she said go over to the circle and play with the kids until class starts 
 so i went over there and plopped down like
  and i 'm playing and all of a sudden the boy next to me he was wearing
 a white shirt with blue shorts i remember it like it was yesterday  suddenly he stopped playing and he said why are you so short 
 and i just kept playing i didn 't think he was talking to me 
 and in a louder voice he said hey  why are you so short so i looked up and i said  what are you talking about
  been waiting for this 
 and so we played and about a minute later the girl next to him in a white shirt and a pink skirt stood up put her hands on her hips and said 
 yeah why do you look so different 
 and i went what are you talking about i don 't look different i 'm not short  again let 's just play
  about this time i looked all around the circle i was in and all the kids had stopped playing and they were all looking at me
 and i 'm thinking
 in today 's language it would be omg or wtf 
 what just happened  
 so all the confidence that i went in with that morning was was withering away as the morning went on and the questions kept coming
  the end of the morning before i went home 
 the teacher had us in a circle and i actually found myself outside of the circle i couldn 't look at anybody  i could not understand what just happened  
 and over the next few years i hated to go out in public i felt every stare every giggle every pointed
  not the finger  but every pointed finger  and i hated it  i would hide behind my parents ' legs like nobody could see me  
 and as a child you can 't understand another child 's curiosity nor an adult 's ignorance
 it became very apparent to me that the real world was not built
 for someone of my size both literally or figuratively  and so
 i have no anonymity as you
  can probably tell 
 and while you can see my size we all go through many challenges through our lifetime  
 and some you can see like mine most you can 't 
 you can 't tell if someone 's dealing with a mental illness 
 or they 're struggling with their gender identity they 're caring for an aging parent 
 they 're having financial difficulty you can 't see that kind
  of stuff 
 so while you can see one of my challenges is my size  
 seeing does not mean you understand what it 's truly to be me on a daily basis or what i go through 
 and so i 'm here to debunk a myth  i do not believe you can walk in someone else 's shoes  
 and because of that we must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves
  stated  i will never know what it 's like to be you and you will never know what it 's like to be me  
 i cannot face your fears or chase your dreams and you can 't do that for me  but we can be supportive of each other 
 instead of trying to walk in each other 's shoes we must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves
  i learned at an early age that i did have to do some things different than most people 
 but i also learned there were things i was on equal footing with and one of those was the classroom heh heh 
 heh i was equal as
 a matter of fact i excelled in the classroom  this was vitally important i discovered as i grew older and realized i wasn 't going to be able to do a physical
  i needed an education  
 so i went on and got a university degree  
 but i felt to be one step ahead of everyone for employment  i needed to have an advanced university degree  so i went ahead and got that now i 'm ready for my interview  
 remember your first interview what am i going to wear 
 what questions and don 't forget that firm handshake  i was right there with you 
  hours before my interview a friend of mine who i 've known all my life
 called and said michele 
 the building you 're going in has steps and she knew i couldn 't climb steps  
 so suddenly my focus changed in my shoes  i was worried about how am i going to get there  
 so i went early and found a loading dock and got in and had a great interview  they had no idea what i went through for the day and that 's ok 
 you 're probably thinking my greatest challenge that day was the interview
 or getting in the building in reality my biggest challenge that day was getting through the loading dock without getting run over 
 i am very vulnerable in certain situations  
 airports hallways  parking lots  loading docks  
 and so i have to be very careful
 i have to anticipate and be flexible
 and move as quickly as i can sometimes  
 so i got the job  and in my current role i travel quite a bit and travel is a challenge for all of us these days  
 and so you probably get to the airport  run through security get to the gate did i get my aisle seat or my window seat did i get my upgrade 
 me first
  i get to experience the personal patdown i won
 't comment on that 
 and then i make my way to the gate  and with my gift of gab that my parents said i was born with 
 i talk to the gate agent and then i say by the way my scooter weighs this much  
 i have a dry cell battery  and i can drive it down to the door of the plane
  the day before i had called the city where i 'm traveling to to find out where i could rent a scooter in case mine gets broken
 on the way  so in my shoes it 's a little bit different 
 when i get onto the plane i use my gift of gab to ask the lady to put my bag up and they graciously do 
 i try not to eat or drink on a plane because i don 't want to have to get up and walk on the plane  
 but nature has its own schedule
  not long ago  it knocked and i answered so i walked up to the front of the plane
 and gabbed with the flight attendant and said can you watch the door i can 't reach the lock 
 so i 'm in there doing my business and the door flies open  and there 's a gentleman there
 with a look of horror on his face i 'm sure i had the same look 
 as i came out i noticed that he was sitting right across from me 
 and he 's in total
 complete embarrassment  
 so i walk up to him and i quietly go 
 are you going to remember this as much as i am 
 and he goes i think so now 
 while he 's probably not talking about it publicly i am
  we talked for the rest of the flight  
 and we got to know each other our families sports work 
 and when we landed he said michele i noticed someone put your bag up can i get that for you and i said of course thank you 
 and we wished each other well  and the most important thing that day was that he was not going to leave with that embarrassment
  that experience of embarrassment he won 't forget it and neither will i but i think he
  remember more
 our chat and our different perspectives 
 when you travel internationally it can be even more challenging in certain ways a few years ago i was in zanzibar  
 and i come wheeling in and think about that 
 short  white  blond
 woman in a chair that doesn 't probably happen every day  so i go
  up and with my gift of gab i start to talk to the agent so friendly and i ask about their culture and so forth and i notice there wasn 't a jet bridge  
 so i had to kind of say 
 not only do you have to lift my chair  i could use some help getting up the steps so we got to spend about an hour together while we waited for the flight  
 and it was the most magnificent hour our perspective changed for both of us that day
  and once i got on the flight he patted me on the back and wished me well  
 and i thanked him so much  
 and again i think he 's going to remember that experience more than when i first came in and there was a bit of hesitation  
 and as you notice i get a lot of help i would not be where i am today if it was not for my family my friends my colleagues
 and the many strangers that help me every single day of my life 
 and it 's important that we all have a support system asking for help is a strength not a weakness 
 we all need help throughout our lifetime
  as important
 that we are part of other people 's support systems we must adopt that way of giving back 
 we all obviously have a role to play in our own successes  
 but think about the role we have to play in other people 's successes just like people do for me every single day 
 it 's vitally important that we help each other because
  society is increasingly placing people in silos
 based on biases and ideologies  and we must look past the surface
 and be confronted with the truth that none of us are what you can see 
 there 's more to us than that and we 're all dealing with things that you cannot see
  so living a life free of judgment allows all of us to share those experiences together
 and have a totally different perspective just like the couple of people i mentioned earlier in my stories  
 so remember the only shoes you truly can walk
  i cannot walk in yours  i know you can 't walk in my size 1s but you can try  
 but we can do something better than that 
 with compassion  courage and understanding we can walk side by side
 and support one another and think about how society can change if we all do that
 instead of judging on only what you can see  thank you
