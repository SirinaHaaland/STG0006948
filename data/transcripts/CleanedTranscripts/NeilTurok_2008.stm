 an incredible surprise to me
 to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life  
 because basically  i work as a theoretical physicist  i develop
 and test models of the big bang
  data  and i 've been moonlighting for the last five years
 helping with a project in africa 
 and i get a lot of flak for this at cambridge  people wonder you know how do you have time to do this and so on
  and so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreciated
 both those sides  so i thought i 'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself and why i lead this schizophrenic life
  well i was born in south africa
 and my parents were imprisoned for resisting the racist regime  when they were released we left
 and we went as refugees to kenya and tanzania  both were very young countries then and full of hope for the future  
 we had an amazing childhood we didn 't have any
  money  but we were outdoors most of the time we had fantastic friends
 and we saw the wonders of the world like kilimanjaro  serengeti
 and the olduvai gorge  well then we moved to london for high school  and
 after that there 's nothing much to say about that it was rather dull  but i came back to
  africa at the age of seventeen as a volunteer teacher
 to lesotho which is a tiny country  surrounded at that time by apartheid south africa  
 well  eighty percent of the men in lesotho worked
 in the mines over the border in brutal conditions
  'm sure as a rather irritating young white man coming into their village  
 i was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth but the kids were the best part the
 kids were amazing extremely eager
 and often very bright and i 'm just going to tell you one story  which got through to me  i used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible to
  the academic stuff with the real world  and they weren 't used to that  but
 i took them outside one day and i said i want you to estimate the height of the building 
 and i expected them to put a ruler next to the wall size it up with a finger and make an estimate of the height but there
 was one little boy very small for his age he was the son of one of the poorest families in the
 in the village  
 and he wasn 't doing that he was scribbling with chalk on the pavement  
 and so 
 i said i was annoyed i said 
 what are you doing  i want you to estimate the height of the building he said ok  i measured the height of a brick  
 i counted the number of bricks and now i 'm multiplying 
 well
  i hadn 't thought of that one 
 and many experiences like this happened
 to me another one is that i met a miner  he was home
 on his three month leave from the mines sitting next to him one day
 he said there 's only one thing that i really loved at school and you know what it was shakespeare and he recited some to me
 these and many similar experiences convinced me that there are just tons of bright kids in africa
 and starved of opportunity  and if africa is going to get fixed  it 's by them not by us
  and i went to cambridge  and there i fell for theoretical physics  
 well  i 'm not going to explain this equation but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject we can write down all the laws of physics we know
 in one line
 and admittedly it 's in a very shorthand notation  
 and it contains eighteen free parameters
 ok  which we have to fit to the data so it 's not the final story  but it 's an incredibly powerful summary
 of everything we know about nature at the most basic level and apart
  from a few very important loose ends  
 which you 've heard about here like dark energy and dark matter this equation describes seems to describe everything about the universe
 and what 's in it  but there 's one big puzzle remaining  and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary
 school math teacher in tanzania who 's a wonderful scottish lady
 who i still stay in touch with  
 and she 's now in her 80s and when i try to explain my work to her 
 she waved away all the details and she said neil there 's only one question that really matters
  's a question we 've all been avoiding the standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence full of a strange kind of 
  energy
 but the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state is completely
  i worked on that theory for a while with stephen hawking and others but then i began to explore another alternative  the alternative is that the big bang wasn 't the beginning  
 perhaps the universe existed before the bang  
 and the bang was just a violent event in a pre existing universe  well this possibility is actually suggested
 by the
  the unified theories  which try to explain all those eighteen free parameters
 in in a single framework which will hopefully predict all of them 
 and i 'll just share a cartoon of this idea here it 's all i can convey  
 according to these theories there are extra dimensions of space not just the three we 're familiar with but at every point in the room there are more dimensions and in particular there 's one rather strange one in the most elegant unified theories we have
 the strange one looks likes this that we live
 in a three dimensional world we live in one of these worlds  and i can only show it as a sheet but it 's really
 and a tiny distance away there 's another sheet 
 also three dimensional and they 're separated by a gap the gap is very tiny and i 've blown it up so you can see it  but it 's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic
  nucleus i won 't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this but it comes out of the math
 and trying to explain the physics that we know  
 well i got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question which is what happens if these two three dimensional worlds should actually collide  
 and if they collide  it would look a lot like the big bang  but it 's slightly different than in the conventional picture
  conventional picture of the big bang is a point everything comes out of a point you have infinite density 
 and all the equations break down  no hope of describing that 
 in this picture you 'll notice the bang is extended it 's not a point  the density of matter is finite  and we have a chance of a consistent
 set of equations that can describe the whole process so to cut a long story short  we 've explored this
  alternative we 've shown that it can fit all of the data
 that we have about the formation of galaxies  the fluctuations in the microwave background 
 furthermore there 's an experimental way to to tell this theory apart from the the inflationary explanation that i told you before it involves gravitational waves  
 and in this scenario not only was the big bang not the beginning
 as you can see from the picture it can happen over and over again it may be that we live in an endless universe  both in space and in time and there 've been
 bangs in the past and there will be bangs in the future  and
 maybe we live in an endless universe  well making and testing models of the universe
 is for me the best way i
  have of enjoying and appreciating
 the universe 
 we need to make the best mathematical models we can the most consistent ones  and then we scrutinize them logically and with data  and we try to convince ourselves
 we really try to convince ourselves they 're wrong that 's progress when we
  hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world  as i pursued my career something
 was always gnawing away inside me what about africa  what about those kids i 'd left behind
 instead of developing as we 'd all hoped in the ' 60s things had gotten worse africa was gripped by poverty disease and war 
 this is very
  graphically shown by the worldmapper website and project  and so the idea is to represent each country
 on a map but scale the area according to some quantity  
 so here 's just the standard area map of the world by the way africa is very large and the next map now shows africa
  around the time of independence for many african states now this is 
 and then two thousand and two and here 's a projection for two thousand and fifteen 
 big changes are happening in the world  
 but they 're not helping africa  what about africa 's population the population isn 't out of proportion to its area but africa leads the world
 in deaths
 from often preventable causes  malnutrition simple infections
 and birth complications then there 's hiv aids  and then there are deaths from war ok
 currently there are forty five thousand people a month dying in the congo as a consequence of the war there
 over coltan and diamonds and other things
  it 's still going on 
 what about africa 's capacity to do something about these problems 
 well here 's the number of physicians in africa  
 here 's the number of people in higher education  and here most shocking to me
 the number of scientific
  research papers coming out of africa it just doesn 't exist
 scientifically  
 and this was very eloquently argued at ted africa  
 that all of the aid that 's been given has completely failed to put africa onto its own two feet well
 the transition to democracy in south africa in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four was literally a dream come true for many of us  
 my parents were both elected
  to the first parliament  alongside nelson and winnie mandela they were the only other couple 
 and in two thousand and one i took a research leave to visit them 
 and while i was busy working i was working on these colliding worlds in the day
  but i learned that there was a desperate shortage of
  the ability to make and test models
 has become essential not only to every single area of science today  but also to modern society itself  and if
 you don 't have math you 're not going to enter the modern age  so i
  and the idea was very simple the idea was to set up an african institute for mathematical sciences  or aims 
 and let 's recruit students from the whole of africa  bring them together with lecturers from all over the world
 and we 'll try to give them a fantastic education 
 well as a cambridge professor i had many contacts and to my astonishment they backed me one hundred percent they said go and do
  it and we 'll come and lecture and i knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant
 students from these countries
 where they don 't have any opportunities together with the best lecturers in the world who i knew would come because of the interest in africa
 and put them together and just let the sparks fly  
 so we bought a
  derelict hotel near cape town  it 's an 80 room art deco hotel from the 
 the area was kind of seedy  so we got an 80 room hotel
 for one hundred thousand dollars  it 's a beautiful building  
 we decided we would refurbish it and then put out the word we 're going to start the best math institute in africa
 in this hotel well the new south africa is a very
  exciting country  and those of you who haven 't been there you should go  it 's very very interesting what 's happening  
 and we recruited wonderful staff  highly motivated staff 
 the other thing that 's happened which was good for us is the internet even though the internet is very expensive all over africa  there are internet cafes
  and bright young africans are desperate to join the global community to be successful
 and they 're very ambitious they want to be the next einstein  
 and so when word came out that aims was opening it spread very quickly via 
  e mail and our website and we got lots of applicants  
 well  we designed
  learning environment and it was fantastic to start a university from
 the beginning  you have to rethink what is the university for 
 and that 's really exciting  so we designed it to have interactive teaching  no droning on at the chalkboard
 we emphasize 
 working in groups every student discovering and maximizing their own potential and not chasing grades
  lives together in this hotel lecturers and students and it 's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at one a m the
 students don 't usually leave the computer lab till two or three a m and then they 're up again at eight in the morning
 lectures problem solving and so on it 's an extraordinary place 
  we especially emphasize areas of great relevance to africa 's development  
 because in those areas scientists working in africa will have a competitive advantage they 'll publish be invited to conferences they 'll do well  they 'll have successful careers 
 and
 aims has done extremely well  here is a list of last year 's graduates graduated in june and what they 're currently doing
 where they are is indicated over here and
 where they 've gone so these are all postgraduate students and they 've all gone on to master 's and ph d degrees in excellent places 
 five students can be educated at aims for the cost of educating one
 in the u s or europe
  is a continual source
 of strength  pride and commitment to africa 
 we illustrate aims ' progress by coloring in the countries of africa  
 so here you can see behind this list  
 when a county is colored yellow  we 've received an application  orange  we 've accepted an application and green a
 student has graduated  so here is where we were after the first graduation in two thousand and four  
 and we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green
  so there 's two thousand and five minus six minus seven minus eight 
 we 're well on
  we had some of the students filmed at home before they came to aims and i 'll just show you one
  so tendai
 came to aims and
 did very well and i 'll let her take it from there tm 
 my name is tendai mugwagwa and i was a student at aims
  in two thousand and three and two thousand and four  after leaving aims i went on to do a master 's in applied mathematics at the university of cape town in south africa  
 after that i came to the netherlands where i 'm now doing a ph d in theoretical immunology professor tendai
 is working very independently 
 she communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital  so all in all i have a very good ph d student from south africa  so i 'm happy she 's
 in the first year of aims was shehu  and he 's shown here with his favorite
 high school teacher  and then entering university in northern nigeria  and
 after aims  shehu wanted to do high energy physics  and he came to cambridge
  here are the current students at aims there are fifty three of them from twenty different countries including twenty women  so now i 'm going to get to my
 business well we had a party this is africa  we have good parties in africa and last month they threw a surprise party for me here 's somebody you 've seen already
  point out a few other exceptional people in this picture so we were having a party as you can see they 're completely eclipsing me at this point this is ezra she 's from darfur 
 she 's a physicist  and somehow stays smiling in
  spite of everything going on back home but she wants to continue in physics  and she 's doing extremely well  
 this is lydia lydia is the first ever woman to graduate in mathematics in the central african republic  and she 's now at aims
  our wish  as you 've already gathered  and our wish has two parts one is a dream and the other 's a plan
 ok our ted dream is that the next einstein will be african
  of creative genius  we want to give thousands of people the motivation  the encouragement and the courage
 to obtain the high level skills they need to help africa  
 among them will be not only brilliant scientists i 'm sure of that from what we 've seen at aims they 'll also be the
  african gates  brins
 and pages of the future well
 i said we also have a plan and our plan is quite simple aims is now a proven model 
 and what we need to do is to replicate it 
 we want to roll out fifteen aims centers in the next five years all over africa  each will have a
  in a different area of science we want to use science to overcome the national and cultural cultural barriers as it does at aims and we want to add elements to the curriculum we want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills
 the expanded aims will be a coherent pan african institution  and its graduates will form a powerful network working together for peace and progress across the continent
 over the last
 year we 've been visiting sites in africa  looking at potential sites for new aims centers and here are the ones we 've selected 
 and each of these centers has a strong local team 
 each is in a beautiful place an interesting place  which international lecturers will be happy to
  our partners across africa are extremely enthusiastic about this  everyone wants an aims center in their country  and last
 november  the conference of all the african ministers of science and technology  held in mombasa  
 called for a comprehensive plan to roll out aims  so we have political support right across the continent  it won 't be easy 
 at every site there will be huge challenges local scientists
  must play leading roles
 and governments must be persuaded to buy in 
 conditions are very difficult but we cannot afford to compromise on those principles which made aims work
