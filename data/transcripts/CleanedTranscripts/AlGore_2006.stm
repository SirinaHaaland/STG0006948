  it 's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice i 'm extremely grateful i have been blown away
  and i want to thank all of you for the the many
 nice comments about what i had to say the the other night  and i say that sincerely  
 partly because i need that 
 put yourselves in my position
  i flew on air force two for eight years 
 now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane i 'll
 tell you one quick story to illustrate what that 's been like for me
  every bit of this is true  soon after tipper and i left the white house 
 we were driving from our home in nashville to a little farm we have fifty miles east of nashville  
 driving ourselves 
 i know it sounds like a little thing to you but
 i looked in the rear view mirror and
 all of a sudden it just hit me  there was no motorcade back there 
 you 've heard of phantom limb pain
  this was a rented ford taurus 
 laughter it was dinnertime  and we started looking for a place to eat
 we were on i 40 we got to
 exit two hundred and thirty eight lebanon tennessee we got off the exit we found a shoney 's restaurant
 low cost family restaurant chain for those of you who don 't know it 
 we
  sat down at the booth and the waitress came over made a big commotion over tipper 
 she took our order and then went to the couple in the booth next to us and she
 lowered her voice so much i had to really strain to hear what she was saying and she said yes that 's former vice president al gore and his wife tipper
  's been kind of a series of epiphanies the very next day continuing the totally true story i got on a
 to fly to africa to make a speech in nigeria in the city of lagos on the topic of
 energy  and i began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in nashville  
 and i told it pretty much the same way i 've just shared it with you tipper and i were driving ourselves shoney 's low cost family restaurant chain what the man said they laughed 
 i gave my speech then went back out to the airport to fly back home  i fell asleep on the plane
 until during the middle of the night
  we landed on the azores islands for refueling  i woke up they opened the door i went out to get some fresh air and i looked and there was a man running across the runway  
 and he was waving a piece of paper and he was yelling call washington  call washington 
 and i thought to myself in the middle of the night in the middle of the atlantic what in the world could be wrong in washington then i remembered it could be a bunch of things
 laughter but what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely
 upset because one of the wire services
 in nigeria had already written a story about my speech  and it had already been printed in cities all across the united states
 of america it was printed in monterey
  i checked laughter
 and
 the story began former vice president al gore announced in nigeria yesterday quote ' my wife tipper and i have opened a low cost family restaurant
  leno had already
 started in on one of them had me in a big white chef 's hat 
 tipper was saying one more burger with fries three days later  i got a nice long handwritten letter from my friend and
 partner and colleague bill clinton saying congratulations on the new restaurant
  we like to celebrate each other 's successes in life i was
 going to talk about information ecology  
 but i was thinking that  since i plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to ted that maybe i could talk about that
  i want to focus
 on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on what can you do
 about the climate crisis  i want to start with a couple of
 i 'm going to show some new images  and i 'm going to
  i update the slide show
 every time i give it i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it it
 's like beach combing you know every time the tide comes in and out you find some more shells just in the last two days  we got the new
 temperature records in
  this is just for the united states of america historical average for 
  degrees  last month was thirty nine point five degrees  now i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment
 i 'm kidding  but these are the recapitulation slides and then i 'm going to go into new material about what you can do  but i wanted to elaborate on a
 couple of these
 first of all this is where we 're projected to go with the u s contribution to global warming  under business as usual 
 efficiency in in end use electricity and end use of all energy is the low hanging fruit efficiency and conservation
 it 's not a cost it 's a profit the sign is wrong 
 it 's not negative it 's positive these are investments that pay for themselves but they are also very effective
  in deflecting our path 
 cars and trucks i talked about that in the slideshow  but i want you to put it in perspective
  it 's an easy visible
 target of concern and it should be but
 there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks cars and trucks are very significant
 and we have the lowest standards in the world and so we should address that but it 's part of the puzzle 
 other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks  
 renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference and with what vinod and
  john doerr and others many of you here there are a lot of people directly involved in this this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it 
 carbon capture and sequestration that 's what ccs
 stands for is likely to become the killer app
 that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe
 not quite there yet  ok now  what can you do 
 reduce emissions in your home most of these
 expenditures are also profitable 
 insulation better design buy green electricity where where you can i mentioned automobiles
 buy a hybrid
 use light rail  figure out some of the other options that are much better it 's important 
 be a green consumer you have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh
 effect or a much less harsh effect
 on the on the global
  consider this make a decision to live a 
 life  those of you who are good at branding  i 'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this
 in a way that connects
 with the most people it is easier than you think it really is 
 a lot of us
  in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy it means reduce your carbon
 dioxide emissions
 with the full range of choices that you make 
 and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced 
 and what what it means is elaborated
  calculator  participant productions convened
 with my active involvement the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a
  you will be given options to reduce and
 by the time the movie comes out in may  this will be updated to two point zero and we will have  click through purchases of offsets 
 next consider making your business 
 again some of us have done that and it 's not as hard as you think  integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations whether you
  are from the technology or entertainment or design and architecture community invest sustainably  majora mentioned this 
 listen if you
 have invested money
 with managers
 who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance don 't ever again complain about quarterly report ceo management 
  time people do what you pay them to do and if they judge
 how much they 're going to get paid on
 your your capital that they 've invested based on the short term returns you 're going to get short term decisions a
 lot more to be said about that become a catalyst of change teach others  learn about it talk about it
 the movie is a movie version of the slideshow i gave two nights ago except it 's a lot more entertaining  
 and it comes out in may many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it  
 consider sending somebody to
  and i am personally going to train people to give this slideshow re purposed
 with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach and
 it 
 it 's not just the slides it 's what they mean and it 's how they link together  and so
 i 'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse
  communities all across the country and we 're going to update the the slideshow for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cutting edge  
 working with larry lessig  it will be somewhere in that process posted with tools and  limited use
 copyrights so that
 young people can remix it and do it in their own way
 where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm 's length from politics  it doesn 't mean that if you 're a republican that i 'm trying to convince you to be a democrat 
 we need republicans as well this used to be a bipartisan issue  and i know that in this group it really is become politically active make our democracy work the way it 's supposed to work 
 support the idea of capping
  carbon dioxide emissions
 global warming pollution and trading it here 's why 
 as long as the united states is out of the world system  
 it 's not a closed system  once it becomes a closed system  
 with u s participation then everybody who 's on a board of directors how many people here serve  serve on the board of directors of a corporation 
 once it 's a closed system  you will have legal
  liability if you do not
 urge your ceo
 to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided 
 the market will work to solve this problem
 if if we can accomplish this 
 help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring  we have to change the minds of the american people
 because presently the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to to be done 
 and in our modern country the role of logic and reason no longer no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did  it 's now repetition of short
  as many of you have suggested  i like climate crisis instead of climate collapse but again those of you who are good at branding  i need your help on this 
 somebody said the test we 're facing now a scientist told me is whether
 the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination 
 laughter that 's really true
  i said the other night and i 'll repeat now this is not a political issue  again the republicans here
 this shouldn 't be partisan you have more influence than some of us who are democrats do 
 this is an opportunity not just this but connected to
 the ideas that are here to bring more coherence to them we are
  one thank you very much i
