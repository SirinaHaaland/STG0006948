  in the past several days i heard people talking about china and also i talked to friends about china
 and chinese internet something is very challenging to me i want to make my friends understand china is complicated
 so i always want to tell the story like one hand it is that the other hand is that you can 't just tell a one sided story i 'll
 give an example china is a bric country bric country means brazil
  on the other hand china is a sick country the terminology coined by facebook ipo papers
 file he said the sick country means syria  
 iran china and north korea  the four countries have no access to facebook
  to watch china and chinese internet  and now today i want to tell you my personal
 observation in the past several years  from that wall so if you are a fan of the game of thrones  you definitely know
 how important a big wall is for an old kingdom
 weird things from the north 
 same was true for china in the north  there was a great wall  chang cheng  
 it protected china from invaders for two thousand years  but china also has a great
 firewall  that 's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world it 's not only to
  defend the chinese regime from overseas  from the universal values  
 but also to prevent china 's own citizens to access the global free internet  
 and even separate themselves into blocks not united
  but if you think the chinanet is something like a
 deadland wasteland i think it 's wrong  
 but we also use a very simple metaphor  the cat and the mouse game to describe in the past fifteen years
 the continuing fight between chinese censorship government censorship  the cat
  and the chinese internet users  that means us the mouse  
 but sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple  so today i want to upgrade it to two point zero version 
 in china we have five hundred million internet users  that 's the biggest population of netizens internet users in the whole world so
 even though china 's is a totally censored internet but still chinese internet society is really booming  how to make it it 's
 simple  you have google  we have baidu  you have twitter  we have weibo  
 you have facebook  we have renren  
  international web two point zero service  and we chinese copycat every one so that 's the kind of
 the thing i call smart censorship  that 's not only to censor
  to satisfy people 's need of a social network  which is very important people really love social networking  
 but on the other hand they want to keep the server in beijing so they can access the data any time they want 
 that 's also the reason
 google was pulled out from china because they can 't accept the fact
  government wants to keep the server 
 sometimes the arab dictators didn 't understand these two hands  for example mubarak he shut down the internet
 he wanted to prevent the netizens
  very simple we all know mubarak is technically dead  
 but also  
 ben ali  tunisian president didn 't follow the second rule  that means keep the server in your
  inside of tunisia so he can 't prevent it his own citizens to post critical videos against his corruption 
 the same thing happend  he was the first to topple
 during the arab spring  but those two very smart international censorship policies didn 't
 prevent chinese social media
  sphere a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of chinese officials 
 because we have three hundred million microbloggers in china it 's the entire population of the united states  
 so when these three hundred million people microbloggers even they block
 the tweet in our censored platform but itself the
  chinanet but itself can create very powerful
 energy which has never happened in the chinese history 
 two thousand and eleven in july two [ unclear ] trains crashed 
 in wenzhou a southern city  right after the train crash  authorities literally wanted to cover up the
  bury the train so it angered the chinese netizens the first five days after the train crash  
 there were ten million criticisms of the posting
 on social media  which never happened in chinese history and later this year  the rail minister
 was sacked and sentenced to jail for ten years
 environment ministry and the american embassy in beijing
 because the ministry blamed the american embassy for intervening in chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of beijing 
 so the up is the embassy data the pm two point five he showed one hundred and
 forty eight they showed it 's dangerous for the sensitive group so a suggestion it 's not good to go outside  but that
 is the ministry 's data  he shows fifty  he says it 's good it 's good to go outside  
 but ninety nine percent of chinese microbloggers stand firmly
 on the embassy 's side i live in beijing
 every day i just watch the
 american embassy 's data to decide whether i should open my window 
 why is chinese social networking even within the censorship so booming  
 part of the reason is chinese languages  
 you know 
 twitter and twitter clones have a kind of
 limitation of one hundred and forty characters  but in english it 's twenty words or a sentence with a short link  maybe in germany in german language it may be just
  you can see exactly one chinese tweet is equal to
 three point five english tweets chinese is always cheating right 
 so because of this the chinese really
 regard this microblogging as a media not only a headline to
  media  and also 
 the clone  sina company is the guy who cloned twitter it even has its own name  with weibo weibo is the chinese translation for microblog 
 it has its own innovation at the commenting area [ it makes ] the chinese weibo more like facebook  
 rather than the original
  anything not mentioned in weibo  it does not appear
 to exist for the chinese public  but also chinese social media is really changing chinese
  mindsets
 and chinese life for example  they give the
 voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard we had a petition system it 's a remedy outside
 the judicial system  because the chinese central government wants to keep a myth  the emperor is good  
 the old local officials are thugs  so that 's why the petitioner
 want to take the train to beijing to petition to the central government they want the emperor to settle the problem 
 but when more and more people go to beijing  they also cause the risk of a revolution 
 so they send them back in recent years  and even some of them were put into black jails  but now
  so i call it the weibo petition people just use their cell phones to tweet 
 so your sad stories by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters professors or celebrities one of them is yao chen  
 she is the most popular microblogger in china who
 has about twenty one million followers  they 're almost like a
 national tv station if you so a sad story will be picked up by her
 weibo social media even in the censorship  still gave the chinese a real chance
 for three hundred million people every day chatting together  talking together it 's like a big ted  right  
 but also  it is like the first time a public sphere
  chinese people start to learn how to negotiate
 and talk to people  
 but also  
 the cat the censorship is not sleeping it 's so hard to post some sensitive words on the chinese weibo for example you can 't post
 the name of the president
 hu jintao  and also you can 't post the city of chongqing the name and
  until recently you can 't search the surname of top top leaders so the chinese are very good at these puns and
 alternative wording and even memes  they even name themselves
 you know use the name of this
 battle between the grass mud horse and the river crab
  when some very political exciting moments happened you can see on weibo
  weird
 phrases and words even if you have a phd of chinese language you can 't understand them 
 but you can 't even expand more no because chinese sina weibo when it was founded was exactly one month after the official blocking of twitter com that means from the very beginning
  has already convinced the chinese government we will not become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime for example  anything you want to post like 
  get together or meet up or walk it is automatically recorded and data mined
  already waiting for you why because they have the data they have everything in their hands  so they can use the
 scenario data mining of the dissident  so the crackdown is very serious  
 but i want you to notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat and mouse 
 the cat is the censorship but chinese is not only one cat
  but also has local cats central cat and and local cats you know the server is in the [ central ] cats ' hands  so even that
 when the netizens criticize the local government the local government has not any access to the data in beijing  without bribing the central cats  he can do nothing only apologize  
 so these three years
  past three years social movements about
 microblogging really changed local government became more and more transparent  because they can 't access the data the server is in beijing  
 the story about the train crash  maybe the question is not about why ten million criticisms in
 five days but why the chinese central government allowed the five days of freedom of speech online  it 's never happened before 
 and so it 's very simple  because even the top leaders were fed up with this guy this independent kingdom  so they want an excuse public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him  
 but also the bo xilai case recently  very big news he 's a princeling but from february to
  a marketplace of rumors  you can almost joke everything about these princelings everything it 's almost like you 're living in the united states  
 but if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup about beijing  you definitely will be arrested  
 so this kind of freedom is a targeted
  chinese in china  censorship is normal  something you find is freedom
 is weird  something will happen behind it 
 because he was a very popular leftist leader so the central government wanted to purge him and he was very cute he convinced
 all the chinese people why he is so bad  so weibo the three hundred million public sphere
 but this technology is very new  but technically is very old it was made famous by chairman mao mao zedong  because he mobilized millions of chinese people in the cultural revolution to
 destroy every local government it 's very simple because chinese central government doesn 't need to even lead the public opinion  they just give them a target window to not censor people
  censoring in china has become a political tool  
 so that 's the update about this game
 cat and mouse social media changed chinese mindset more and more chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their birthright not some imported american
 privilege
  national public sphere for people to it 's like a training of their citizenship  preparing for future democracy but it didn 't change the chinese political system 
  and also  the chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen its power to counter the local government and the different factions 
  what 's the future after all we are the mouse  whatever the future is we should fight against the [ cat ]
 there is not only in china but also in the united states there are some very small cute but bad cats
  they are friends of the mouse  but sometimes we see them dating the cats  so
 my conclusion is very simple  we chinese fight for our
  can tweet anytime anywhere  without fear
