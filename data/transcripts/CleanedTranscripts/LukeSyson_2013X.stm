  two years ago  i have to say there was no problem two years ago i knew exactly what an icon looked like  it looks like this 
 everybody 's icon but also the default position of a curator of italian renaissance paintings which i was then and in a way  this is
  also another default selection leonardo da vinci 's exquisitely soulful
 image of the lady with an ermine and i use that word soulful deliberately 
 or then there 's this or rather these the two versions of leonardo 's virgin of the rocks that were about to come together in london for the very first time 
 in the exhibition that i was then in the absolute throes of organizing i was literally
 up to my eyes in leonardo and i had been for three years 
 so he was occupying every part of my my brain leonardo had taught me  during that three years about what a picture can do about taking you 
  from your own material world into a spiritual world he said actually that he believed the job of the painter was to paint everything that was visible and invisible
 in the universe that 's a huge a huge task
  and yet somehow he achieves it he shows us i think the human soul he shows us the capacity of of ourselves to move into a spiritual realm
  to see
 a vision of the universe that 's more perfect than our own to see god 's own plan in some sense  so this in a sense
  was really what i believed an icon was at
 about that time  i started talking to tom campbell  director here of the metropolitan museum about what my next move might be 
 the move in fact back to
 an earlier life one i 'd begun at the british museum back to the world of three dimensions of sculpture and of decorative arts to take over the department of european sculpture and decorative arts
 here at the met  but it was an incredibly busy time all the conversations were done at very peculiar times of the day
 over the phone
 in the end i accepted the job without actually having been here again i 'd been there a couple of years before but on that particular visit  
 so it was just before the time that the leonardo show was due to open when i finally made it back
 to the met
  to new york to see my new domain 
 to see what european sculpture and decorative arts looked like beyond those renaissance collections with which i was so already familiar  and i thought on that very first day  i better 
  tour the galleries  fifty seven of these galleries like fifty seven varieties of baked beans i believe
  the italian renaissance  and then i moved gradually around feeling a little lost sometimes
  my head also still full of the leonardo exhibition that was about to open and i came across
 this  and i thought to myself what the hell have i done 
 there was absolutely no connection in my mind
  all and in fact if there was any emotion going on it was a kind of of repulsion this object felt utterly and completely alien silly at a level that i hadn 't yet understood silliness to be
  and then it was made worse
 there were two of them 
  i started thinking about why it was in fact that i
 disliked this object so much what was the anatomy of my of my distaste  well so much gold  so vulgar you
 know so nouveau riche frankly 
  leonardo himself had preached against the use of gold so it was absolutely anathema at that moment  and then there 's little pretty sprigs of flowers everywhere
  finally  that pink  that damned pink  it 's
 such an extraordinarily artificial color i mean it 's a color that i can 't think of anything that you actually see in nature that looks that that shade 
 the object even has its own tutu 
 this little flouncy spangly bottomy bit that sits at the bottom of the
  reminded me in an odd kind of way of my niece 's fifth birthday party
  where all the little girls would come either as a princess or a fairy there was one who would come as a fairy princess you should have seen the looks 
 and i realize that this object was in my mind born from the same mind from the same womb practically as barbie ballerina 
 and then there 's the elephants
  those extraordinary elephants with
 their little sort of strange sinister expressions and greta garbo eyelashes 
 with these golden tusks and so on i realized this was an elephant that had absolutely nothing to do with a majestic march across the serengeti 
 it was a a dumbo nightmare
  but something more profound was happening as well 
 these objects it seemed to me were quintessentially the kind that i and my liberal left friends in london had always seen as summing up something deplorable about the french aristocracy in the in the  18th century 
 the label had told me that these pieces were made by
  actually somebody of extraordinary distinction as i later learned  but for me they summed up a kind of 
 that sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy in the in the  18th century  i and my colleagues had always
  that these objects in way summed up the the idea of you know no wonder there was a revolution  or indeed  thank god there was a revolution 
 there was a sort of idea really that if you owned a vase like this then there was really only one fate possible 
 so there i was in
  i took the job and i went on looking at these vases i sort of had to because they 're on a through route
 in the met so almost anywhere i went there they were  they had this kind of
 odd sort of fascination  like a car accident  where i couldn 't stop looking 
 and as i did so  i started thinking well what are we
  what i started with was was understanding this as really
 a supreme piece of of design it took me a little time but that tutu for example actually this is a piece that does dance in its own way  it has an extraordinary lightness and yet it is also amazing balanced  
 it has these kinds of sculptural ingredients
   and then the play between actually really quite carefully disposed color and gilding and the sculptural surface is really
  really rather remarkable  
 and then i realized that this piece went into the kiln four times at least four times in order to arrive at this how many moments for accident can you think of that could have happened to this piece and then remember  not just one but two so 
  he 's having to arrive at two exactly matched vases of this
  and then this question of uselessness well actually the end of the trunks were originally candle holders so what you would have had were candles
 on either side imagine that effect of candlelight on that surface on the slightly uneven pink  on the beautiful gold  it would have glittered in an interior a little like a little firework
 and at that point actually a firework went off in my brain  somebody reminded me that that word ' fancy ' which in
  sense for me  encapsulated this object actually comes from the same root as the word  ' fantasy '
 and that what this object was just as much in a way  in its own way as a leonardo da vinci painting is a portal to somewhere else this is
  if you think about divans and perhaps even  opium induced visions of pink elephants then at that point this object starts to make
 sense this is an object which is all about escapism it 's about an escapism that that happens
 that the aristocracy in france sought very deliberately
  to distinguish themselves from ordinary people
  of the imagination
