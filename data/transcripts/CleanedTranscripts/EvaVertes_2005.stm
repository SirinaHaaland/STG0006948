  a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager  today i want to talk to you about the future  but first i
  tell you a bit about the past 
 my story starts way before i was born  my grandmother was on a train to auschwitz the death death camp and
 she was going along the tracks and the
 the tracks split and somehow we don 't really know exactly the whole story but the train took the wrong track and went to a
 work camp rather than the death camp
  my grandmother survived
 and
 married my grandfather they were living in hungary  and my mother was born  and when my mother was two years old the hungarian revolution
 was raging  and they decided to escape hungary 
 they got on a boat and yet another divergence the boat was either going to canada or to australia they got on and didn 't know where they were going  and ended up in
  to make a long story short they came to canada my grandmother was a chemist she worked at the banting institute in toronto
  and at forty four she died of stomach cancer
  i never met my grandmother but i carry on her name
 her exact name eva vertes
 and i like to think i carry on her scientific passion too i found this passion not far from here actually when i was nine years old
 my family was on a road trip and
 we were in the grand canyon  and
 i had never been a reader when i was young my dad had tried me with the hardy boys i tried nancy drew i tried all that and i just didn 't like reading books  
 and my mother bought this book when we were at the grand canyon called the hot zone it was all about
  the outbreak of the ebola virus and something about it just kind of drew me towards it there was this big sort of bumpy looking virus on the cover and
 i just wanted to read it i picked up that book and as we drove from the edge of the grand canyon to big sur and to actually here where we are today in monterey  
 i read that book  and from
 when i was reading that book i knew that i wanted to have a life
  i wanted to be like the explorers i 'd read about in the book who
 went into the jungles of africa went into the research labs and just tried to figure out what this deadly virus was 
 so from that moment on i read every medical book i could get my hands on 
 and i just loved it so much i was a passive observer observer of the medical world  it wasn 't until i entered high
  maybe now you know being a big high school kid i can maybe become an active part of this big medical world  
 i was fourteen and i emailed professors at the
 local university to see if maybe i could go work in their lab and hardly anyone responded but i mean why would they respond to a 14 year old anyway 
  and i got to go talk to one professor dr jacobs who accepted me into the lab
 at that time i was really interested in neuroscience and wanted to do a research project in neurology specifically looking at
 the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system so
 i started that and
 worked in his lab for a year  and
 found the results that i guess you 'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals that it really really impaired the nervous system
  spinal cord had breaks the neurons were crossing
 in every which way  and from then i wanted to look not at impairment but at prevention of impairment 
 so that 's what led me to alzheimer 's
 i started reading about alzheimer 's and tried to familiarize myself with the research 
 and at the same time when i was in the i was reading in the medical library one day and i read this article about something called
 and they seemed to have cell 
 properties and being naive about the whole field i kind of thought oh you have cell death in alzheimer 's which is causing the memory deficit  and then you have
 this compound purine derivatives that are promoting cell growth and so i thought maybe if it can promote cell
  the project that i
 pursued for that year and it 's continuing now as well  and found that
 a specific purine derivative called guanidine had inhibited the cell growth by approximately sixty percent  so i presented
 those results at the international science fair which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life and there i was
  best in the world in medicine which
 allowed me to get in or at least get get a foot in the door of the big medical world 
 and
 from then on since i was now in this huge exciting world  
 i wanted to explore it all i wanted it all at once but knew i couldn 't really get that 
 and i stumbled across something called cancer stem cells and this is really what i want to talk to you about today about cancer 
 at first when i heard of cancer stem cells
 i didn 't really know how to put the two together i 'd heard of stem cells and i 'd heard of them as the panacea of the future the therapy of many diseases to come in the future perhaps
  but i 'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time so how did the good and bad go together
 last summer i worked at stanford university doing some research on cancer stem cells and while i was doing
  this i was reading the cancer literature trying to again familiarize myself with this new medical field and it seemed that
 that tumors actually begin from a stem cell  this fascinated me  
 the more i read the more i looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it
 it seems that cancer is a direct result to injury  if you smoke you damage your lung tissue  and then
 lung cancer arises if you drink you damage your liver and then liver cancer occurs 
 and it was really interesting there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture and then bone cancer arises
  these phenomenal cells
 that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue  so  if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ
 and then it 's initiating cancer it 's almost as if this is a repair response and the cancer the body is saying the lung tissue
  we need to repair the lung and cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair because you have this excessive proliferation
 of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue  
 but it 's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response but can 't quite control it it hasn 't yet become fine tuned enough to finish what has been initiated  
 so this really really fascinated me
  really think that we can 't think about cancer let alone any disease in such black and white terms 
 if we eliminate cancer the way we 're trying to do now with chemotherapy and radiation we 're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins or with radiation trying to kill it it 's almost as if we 're getting back to this starting point 
 we 're removing the cancer cells but we 're revealing the the previous damage that
  the body has tried to fix  shouldn 't we think about manipulation rather than elimination if somehow we can
 cause these cells to differentiate to become bone tissue lung tissue liver tissue  whatever that cancer has been put there to do
 it would it would be a repair process
  really changed my view of looking at cancer  
 and while i was reading all these articles about cancer  
 it seemed that the articles a lot of them focused on you know the genetics of breast cancer and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer
 tracking the cancer through the body  tracing where
  it struck me that i 'd never heard of
 cancer of the heart or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter 
 and skeletal muscle constitutes fifty percent of our body or over fifty percent of our body  
 and so
 at first i kind of thought well maybe there 's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn 't get cancer at least not that i know of
  i looked further into it found as many articles as i could and it was amazing because
 it turned out that it was very rare some articles
 even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer  and furthermore not only to cancer but of 
 going to skeletal muscle  and what metastases are is when the tumor when a piece breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ
 that 's what a metastasis is it 's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous if cancer was localized 
 we could likely remove it or somehow
 you know it 's contained it 's very contained but once it starts moving throughout the body that 's when it becomes deadly so the fact that not not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal
  but cancer didn 't seem to go to skeletal muscle there seemed to be something here so these articles were saying you know skeletal
 metastasis to skeletal muscle is very rare but it was left at that no one seemed to be asking why  so
 i decided to ask why  at first the first thing i did was i emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle
  cancer doesn 't really go to skeletal muscle is there a reason for this and a lot of the replies i got were that
 muscle is terminally differentiated tissue meaning that
 you have muscle cells but they 're not dividing so it doesn 't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack  but then again this fact that the 
  go to skeletal muscle
 made that seem unlikely and furthermore that nervous nervous tissue brain gets
 cancer and brain cells are also terminally differentiated so i decided to ask why and
 here 's some of i guess my hypotheses that i 'll be starting to investigate this this may at the sylvester cancer
  institute in miami  and
 i guess i 'll keep investigating until
 i get the answers but i know that in science once you get the answers  
 inevitably you 're going to have more questions so i guess you could say that i 'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life
 some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle 
 there 's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle  and the first thing that makes me think is that
  blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells  
 tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels and you think the more highways there are in a tissue the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases 
 so first of all i thought  you know wouldn 't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle and as well cancer
 tumors require a process called angiogenesis which is really
  really the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow 
 without angiogenesis the tumor remains the size
 of a pinpoint
 and it 's not harmful  so angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer  
 and one article that really
 stood out to me when i was just reading about this trying to figure out why
  cancer doesn 't go to skeletal muscle was that it had reported sixteen percent of
 to skeletal muscle upon autopsy sixteen percent  meaning that there there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle
  the angiogenesis is able to control the tumors
 recruiting these blood vessels 
 we use skeletal muscles so much  it 's the one portion of our body our heart 's always beating we 're always moving our muscles 
 is it possible that
 muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply
  it needs to be constantly contracting so therefore it 's almost selfish it 's grabbing its blood vessels for itself therefore when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue  
 it can 't get a blood supply and can 't grow  so this suggests that maybe if there
  factor in skeletal muscle or perhaps even more an angiogenic routing factor so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow
 this could be a potential future therapy for cancer and
  another thing that 's really interesting is that
 there 's this whole the way
 tumors move throughout the body it 's a very complex system and there 's something called the chemokine network 
 and chemokines are essentially chemical attractants and they 're the stop and go signals for cancer  
 so a tumor a tumor expresses chemokine receptors and another organ a distant organ
  somewhere in the body
 will have the corresponding chemokines and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it 
 is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn 't express this type of molecules 
 and the other really interesting thing is that
 when skeletal muscle there 's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is
  that 's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle  
 and furthermore when skeletal muscle is injured that 's what causes chemokines these signals saying cancer you can come to me the go signs for the tumors
 it causes them to highly express these chemokines so there 's so much interplay here
 for why tumors don 't go to skeletal muscle but it seems like
 by investigating by attacking cancer  by searching where cancer is not there has got to be something there 's got to be something that 's
 making this tissue resistant to tumors and can we utilize can we take this
  and apply it to
 cancer therapy in general now one thing that kind of ties the
 resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body
 is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called
 and what myod essentially does
 is it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells  
 so this this compound myod has been tested on a lot of different cell types
 and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells 
  is it possible that the tumor cells
 are going to the skeletal muscle tissue but once
 in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue  myod acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become
 skeletal muscle cells  maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells and this is why
 it seems as if it is so
  it 's not harmful it has just repaired the muscle muscle is constantly being used constantly being damaged  
 if every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way 
 cancer occurred
 i mean  everybody would have cancer almost and i hate to say that but it it seems as though
 muscle cell possibly because of all its use has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to
  injury to fine tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process
 which the body wants to finish i really believe that the human body is very very smart and we can 't
 counteract something the body is saying to do it 's different when a bacteria comes into the
  a foreign object we want that out but when the body is actually initiating a process and we 're calling it a disease it doesn 't seem as though elimination is the right solution 
 so even
 to go to go from there it 's
 possible although far fetched that in the future we could almost think of
 cancer being used as a therapy if those diseases where tissues are deteriorating for example alzheimer 's
 the brain the brain cells die and we need to restore new brain cells new functional brain cells what if we could 
 in the future use cancer a tumor put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate
 into brain cells 
 that 's a very far fetched idea  but i really believe that it may be possible these cells are so versatile these cancer
  cells are so versatile we just have to manipulate them in the right way  and again some of these may be far fetched but
 i figured if there 's anywhere to present far fetched ideas it 's here at ted so
 thank you very much
