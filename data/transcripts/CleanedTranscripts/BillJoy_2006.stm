  what technology can we really apply
 to reducing global poverty  and what i found was quite surprising  we started looking at things like death rates in the 20th
  how they 'd been improved and very simple things turned out you 'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water but it 's actually the opposite
  and so very simple things off the shelf technologies that
 we could easily find on the then early web
 would clearly make a huge difference to
 to that problem  but i also in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering
 and other new
 emerging kind of digital technologies became very concerned
 about the potential for abuse
  if you think about it in history a long long time ago
 we dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual we came up with something the ten commandments thou shalt not kill that 's
  we organized into cities we had many people and
 to keep the many from tyrannizing the one  we came up with concepts like individual liberty
 and then to have to deal with large groups 
 and we had to have mutual non aggression or through a series of
 conflicts  we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace
 but now we have a new situation really what people call an asymmetric situation where technology is so powerful that
 it extends beyond a nation state it 's not the nation states that have potential access to
 mass destruction but individuals and this is a consequence of the
 fact that these new technologies tend to be
  digital we saw genome
 sequences you can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the internet if you want to and clearly
 someone recently
 i saw in a science magazine they said well the one thousand nine hundred and eighteen eighteen flu is too dangerous to fedex around if people want
 to use it in their labs for working on research just reconstruct it yourself
  because you know it might break in fedex so
 that this is possible to do this is not
 deniable so individuals in small groups   super empowered by access to these kinds of self replicating technologies whether
 it be biological or other are clearly a danger in our world  and the danger is that they can cause roughly what 's a
 and we really don 't have experience with pandemics  and we 're also not very good as a society at acting to things we don 't have direct and sort of gut level experience with
 so it 's not in our nature to pre act 
 and
 in this case piling on more technology doesn 't solve the problem because it only
  people more 
 so the solution has to be as people like russell and einstein and others imagine in a conversation that existed in a much stronger form i think early in the 20th century 
 that the solution had to be
 not just the head but the heart you know public policy and moral progress
 the bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use
  we get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is
 legal  and so
 to limit the danger of these new things we have to limit ultimately the ability of individuals to have access essentially to pandemic power  we also have to have sensible defense because no
 no limitation is going to prevent a crazy person from
  the troubling thing is that it 's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things so the offensive uses
 really have an asymmetric advantage so these are the kind of thoughts i was thinking in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and two thousand and my friends told me i was getting really depressed and they were really worried about me  
 and then i signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this and moved into a
 hotel room in new york
 with one room full of books on the plague  and you know nuclear bombs exploding in new york where i would be within the circle
 and so on and then i was there on september  11th
 and i stood in the streets with everyone and it was quite an experience to be there i got up the next morning and walked out of the city and
 all the sanitation trucks were parked on houston street and ready to go down and start taking the rubble away and i walked down the middle up to the train station and everything below 14th street was closed
  it was quite a compelling experience but not really i suppose a surprise to someone who 'd had his room full of the books it was always a surprise that that it happened then and there but it wasn 't a surprise that it happened
 at all 
 and everyone then started writing about this thousands of people started writing about this and i eventually abandoned the book and then chris called me to talk at the conference i really don 't talk about this anymore because
  and depressing things going on  but i agreed to come and say a few things about this and i would say that
 we can 't give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat which is what we seem to be doing
 because of the present the people that are in
 power because that 's to give up the thing that makes
  and we can 't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we 're doing because a million dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage causes a trillion dollar response which is largely ineffective and arguably  probably almost certainly has made the problem worse  
 so we can we can 't fight the thing with a
  book and i
 had the great honor to be able to join kleiner perkins about a year ago  
 and to work through venture capital
 on the innovative side  and to try to find some innovations that could address what i saw as some of these big problems 
  you know a factor of ten difference can make a factor of one thousand difference in the outcome i
 've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk  
 it 's overwhelming at times i 'm very thankful for google and wikipedia so i can understand at least a little of what people are talking about
 who come through the doors but i wanted to share with you three areas that i 'm particularly excited about and that relate to the
  problems that i was talking about in
 the wired article  
 the first is this whole area of education and it really relates to what nicholas was talking about with a $ one hundred computer and that is to say that
 there 's a lot of legs left in moore 's law  the most advanced transistors today are at sixty five nanometers  and
 we 've seen and i 've had the pleasure to invest in companies that give me great confidence
 that we 'll extend moore 's law all the way down to roughly the ten nanometer scale another factor of say six
 in dimensional reduction which should give us about another factor of one hundred
 in raw improvement in what the chips can do 
 and so to put that in practical terms if something costs about one thousand dollars today
 say  the best personal computer you can buy that might be its cost  i think we can have that in two thousand and twenty twenty
 for ten dollars okay now just imagine what
 that $ one hundred computer will be in two thousand and twenty twenty as a tool for education i think the challenge for us is
 i 'm very certain that that will happen the challenge is will we develop
  the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device i 'd argue today that
 we have incredibly powerful computers but we don 't have very good software for them 
 and it 's only in retrospect after the better software comes along and you take it and you run it on a ten year old machine you say god the machine was that fast i remember when they took the
  apple mac interface and they put it back on the apple ii the apple ii was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface we just didn 't know how to do it
 at the time 
 so given that we we know and should believe because moore 's law 's been like a constant i mean it 's just been very predictable progress over the last forty years 
  or whatever we can know what the computers are going to be like in two thousand and twenty twenty 
  's great that we have initiatives to say let 's go create the education and educate people in the world because that 's a great force for peace  and we can give everyone in the world a $
 one hundred computer or a $ ten computer
 in the next
 fifteen years the second area that i 'm focusing on is the
 environmental problem because that 's clearly going to put a lot of pressure on
 this world we 'll hear a lot more about that from al gore very shortly the thing that we see as the kind of
  moore 's law trend that 's driving improvement in our ability to address the environmental problem is
 is new materials we have a challenge  because the urban population is growing
 in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time people are moving to the cities they all need clean water they need energy they need transportation and we want them to develop in a green way 
 we 're reasonably efficient in
  the industrial sectors we 've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency but the consumer sector especially in america is
 very inefficient but these new materials bring such incredible innovations
 that there 's a strong basis for hope
 that
 these things will be so profitable that they can be brought to the market and
 i want to give you a specific example of a new material that was discovered fifteen years ago if we take carbon nanotubes
 iijima discovered them 
 they just have incredible properties and these are the kinds of things we 're going to discover as we start to engineer at the nano scale  
 their strength they 're almost the strongest material  tensile strength material known
  they 're very very stiff they stretch very very little in two dimensions if you make like a fabric out of them they 're thirty times stronger than
  kevlar
 and if you make a three dimensional structure like a buckyball  they have all sorts of incredible properties if you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them they repair themselves they go zip and they repair the hole in femtoseconds which is not is really quick
 laughter if you shine a light
  you flash them with a camera they catch on fire  if you put electricity on them they emit light 
 if you run current through them  you can run one thousand times more current through one of these than through a piece of metal
  you can make both p and n type semiconductors which means you can make transistors out of them  they conduct heat along their length but not across
  there is no width but not in the other direction if you stack them up that 's a property of carbon fiber also
  if you put particles in them and they go shooting out the tip they 're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns the inside
 of the nanotubes is so small the smallest ones are zero point seven nanometers that it 's basically a quantum world 
 it 's a strange place inside a nanotube  and so we begin to see and we 've seen business plans already 
 where the kind of things lisa randall 's talking about are in there i had one
  business plan where i was trying to learn more about witten 's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial so
 inside of 
 at the limit here  so what we see is with these and other new materials
 that we can we can do things with different properties lighter stronger and apply these new materials to
 the environmental problems  new materials that can make water new materials that can make fuel cells work better new materials that
 catalyze chemical reactions that cut pollution and so on ethanol
 new ways of making ethanol new ways of making electric transportation  the whole green dream
 because it can be profitable  and we 've dedicated we 've just raised a new fund we
  dedicated one hundred million dollars to these kinds of investments
 we believe that genentech the compaq the lotus the sun the netscape the amazon the google
 in these fields are yet to be found because this materials revolution
 will drive these things forward
  the third area that we 're working on  and we just announced last week we were all in new york we raised
 two hundred million dollars in a specialty fund
 to work on a pandemic in biodefense  
 and to give you an idea of the last fund that kleiner raised was a $ four hundred million fund so this for us is a very substantial
 fund  and what we did  over the last few months well a
  ray kurzweil and i wrote an op ed in the new york times about how publishing the one thousand nine hundred and eighteen eighteen genome was very dangerous and john doerr and brook and others got 
 and
 we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepared for a pandemic and we saw a lot of gaps  and so we asked ourselves  
 you know can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps
  brooks told me in a break here he said he 's found so much stuff he can 't sleep because there 's so many great technologies out there
 we 're essentially buried and we need them  you know we have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling that still works roughly that 's tamiflu  
 but tamiflu the virus is resistant it is resistant to tamiflu  
 we 've discovered with aids we need cocktails to to work well so that that the viral resistance we need several anti virals we need
  better surveillance we need networks that can find out what 's going on we need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has
 a strain of flu which we have only identified very recently we 've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly  we need new anti virals and cocktails we need new kinds of vaccines vaccines that are broad spectrum 
 vaccines that we can manufacture quickly
  cocktails more polyvalent vaccines
  get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains we need we don 't know where this thing is going
  we believe that if we could fill these ten gaps  we have a chance to help really
 reduce the risk of a pandemic  and the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of one thousand
  in deaths and certainly enormous economic impact  so we 're very excited because we think we can fund ten or speed up ten
 projects and see them come to market in the next couple years
 that will address this so if we can address use technology help address education help address the environment help address the pandemic  
 does that solve the larger problem
 that i was talking about in the wired article and i 'm afraid
 the answer is really no because
 you can 't solve a problem with the management of technology with more
 technology 
 if we let an unlimited amount of power loose 
 then we will a very small number of people will be able to abuse it we can 't fight at a  million to one disadvantage 
 so what we need to do is we need better
  and for example some things we could do that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now but perhaps with the change of administration would be
 use markets markets are a very strong force 
 for example rather than trying to regulate away problems which probably won 't work if we could price into the cost of doing business the cost of catastrophe 
 so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe would have to take insurance against that risk
 so if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on but it wouldn 't have to be approved by regulators you 'd have to convince an actuary
 that it would be safe  and if you apply the notion of insurance more more
 broadly you can use a more powerful force a market force to provide feedback how could you keep the law i think the law would be a really good thing to keep well you have to hold people
  have any personal responsibility for the consequences of their actions so if you tie that you have to tie that back with the law  and finally i think we have to do something that 's
 not really it 's almost unacceptable to say this which we have to begin to design the future  we can 't pick the future  but we can steer
  our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes  
 we may not be able to stop it but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem  so we can we can design the future
 if we choose what kind of things we want to have happen and not have happen and steer us to a 
 place  vice president gore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory into a lower
  probability of catastrophic risk
