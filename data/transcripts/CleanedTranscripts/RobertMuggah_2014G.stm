  we can cut violent deaths around the world
 by fifty percent in the next three decades all we have to do
 is drop killing by two point three percent a year and we 'll hit that target  you don 't believe me
 the leading epidemiologists and criminologists around the world seem to think we can and so do i but only if we focus on our cities  especially the most fragile ones  
 you see  i 've been thinking about this a lot for the last twenty years i 've been working in countries and cities
  ripped apart by conflict violence terrorism or some insidious combination of all  
 i 've tracked gun smugglers from russia to somalia  i 've worked with warlords in afghanistan and the congo 
 i 've counted cadavers in colombia in haiti in sri lanka  in papua new guinea 
 you don 't need to be on the front line though to get a sense that our planet is spinning out of control right 
 there 's this feeling that international instability is the new normal but i want you to take a closer look
 and i think you 'll see that the geography of violence is changing  because it 's not so much our nation states that are gripped by conflict and crime
 as our cities  
 aleppo  bamako caracas erbil  mosul  tripoli salvador violence is migrating to the metropole 
 and maybe this is to be expected  
  most people today  they live in cities not the countryside just six hundred cities  including thirty megacities account for two thirds of global gdp  but when it comes 
  to cities  the conversation is dominated by the north that is north america western europe  australia and japan where violence is actually at historic lows 
  now i hope that mayors do one day rule the world  
 but you
 know the fact is we don 't hear any conversation really about what is happening in the south  and by south i mean latin america  africa 
 asia  where violence in some cases is accelerating where infrastructure is overstretched  and where governance is sometimes an aspiration and not a reality
  diplomats and development experts and specialists  they talk about forty to fifty fragile states that will shape security in the 21st century 
 i think it 's fragile cities which will define the future of order and disorder 
 that 's because warfare and humanitarian action are going to be concentrated in our cities  
 and the fight for development whether you define that as eradicating poverty
  universal healthcare  beating back climate change will be won or lost in the shantytowns slums and favelas of our cities  i want to talk to 
 that i think will define fragility in our time  
 and if we can get to grips with these i think we can do something with that lethal violence problem 
 so let me start with some good news fact is we 're living in the most peaceful moment in
  human history  
 steven pinker and others have shown how the intensity and frequency of conflict is actually at an all time low  
 now  gaza syria  sudan  ukraine 
 as ghastly as these conflicts are and they are horrific they represent a relatively small blip upwards in a  50 year long secular decline 
 what 's more we 're seeing a dramatic reduction
  in homicide manuel eisner and others have shown that for centuries we 've seen this incredible drop in murder  especially in the west 
 most northern cities today are one hundred times safer than they were just one hundred years ago 
 these two facts the decline in armed conflict and the decline in murder are amongst the most extraordinary
  accomplishments of human history  and we should be really excited right well
 yeah we should  there 's just one problem 
 these two scourges are still with us  you see five hundred and twenty five thousand people
 men women boys and girls
 die violently every single year  
 research i 've been doing with keith krause and others has shown that between fifty thousand and sixty thousand people are dying in war zones violently
  rest almost five hundred thousand people are dying outside of conflict zones in other words  ten times more people are dying outside of war than inside war 
 what 's more violence is moving south to latin america
 and the caribbean to parts of central and southern africa  and to bits of the middle east and
  forty of the fifty most dangerous cities in the world are right here in latin america thirteen in brazil and the most dangerous of all it 's san pedro sula 
 honduras ' second city with a staggering homicide rate of one hundred and eighty seven murders per one hundred thousand people that 's twenty three times the global average  
 now  if violence is re concentrating geographically  it 's also being reconfigured to the world
  because when it comes to cities the world ain 't flat like thomas friedman likes to say  it 's spiky  
 the dominance of the city as the primary mode of of urban living is one of the most extraordinary demographic reversals in history
  and it all happened so fast  you all know the figures right there 's seven point three billion people in the world today there will be nine point six billion by two thousand and fifty but
  one in thirty people lived in cities today it 's one in two and tomorrow virtually everyone is going to be there  
 and this expansion in urbanization is going to be neither even nor equitable the vast majority ninety percent will be happening in the south  in cities of the south  
 so urban geographers and demographers  they tell us that it 's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities that predicts violence
  tokyo with thirty five million people is one of the largest and some might say safest urban metropolises in the world  
 no  it 's the speed of urbanization that matters i call this
  one of the key drivers of fragility when you think about the incredible expansion of these cities  and you think about
 karachi was about five hundred thousand people in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven a hustling bustling city today it
 million people and apart from accounting for three quarters of pakistan 's gdp  it 's also one of the most violent cities in south asia  
 dhaka  lagos  kinshasa these cities are now forty times larger than they were in
  look at new york the big apple  it took one hundred and fifty years to get to eight million people 
 so paulo  mexico city took fifteen to reach that same interval now what do these medium large 
  look like what is their profile well for one thing  they 're young  what we 're seeing
  is the rise of the youth bulge  
 now this is actually a good news story it 's a function of reductions in child mortality rates  
 but the youth bulge is something we 've got to watch what it basically means is the proportion of young people living in our fragile cities is much larger than those living in our healthier and wealthier ones in some fragile cities
  percent of the population is under the age of thirty think about that three in four people are under thirty  it 's like palo alto on steroids
  now if you look at
 mogadishu for example in mogadishu the mean age is sixteen years old  ditto for dhaka  dili and kabul and tokyo 
 same for most western european cities  
 now it 's not just youth that necessarily predicts violence  that 's one factor among many but youthfulness combined with unemployment lack of education  and this is the kicker
 being male is a deadly proposition  
 they 're statistically correlated all those risk factors with youth and they tend to to relate to increases in violence  
 now  for those of you who are parents of teenage sons  you know what i 'm talking about right just imagine your boy without any structure
 with those unruly friends of his  out there cavorting about now take away the parents
  take away the education  limit the education possibilities  sprinkle in a little bit of drugs alcohol and guns  and sit back
 and watch the fireworks 
 the implications are disconcerting right here in brazil  the life expectancy is seventy three point six years  if you live in rio  i 'm sorry shave off two right there
 but if you 're young  you 're uneducated  you lack employment you 're black and you 're male
  your life expectancy drops to less than sixty years old  there 's a reason why youthfulness and violence are the number one killers in this country 
 okay  so it 's not all doom and gloom in our cities  after all cities are hubs of innovation  dynamism prosperity excitement connectivity  they 're where the smart people gather 
 and those young people i just mentioned  they 're more digitally savvy and
 tech aware than ever before  
 and this explosion the internet and mobile technology means that the digital divide separating the north and the south between countries and within them is shrinking 
 but as we 've heard so many times these new technologies are dual edged right  take the case of law enforcement 
 police around the world are starting to use remote sensing and big data to anticipate crime
  cops are able to predict criminal violence before it even happens the future crime scenario  
 it 's here today  and we 've got to be careful  we have to manage the issues of the public safety against rights to individual privacy  
 but it 's not just the cops who are innovating we 've heard extraordinary activities of civil society groups who are engaging in
  local and global collective action  and this is leading to digital protest and real revolution  but most worrying of all are criminal gangs
 who are going online and starting to colonize cyberspace in ciudad jurez in mexico where i 've been working  
 groups like the zetas and the sinaloa cartel are hijacking social media  they 're using it to recruit to sell their products to coerce to intimidate and to kill 
 violence is going virtual  
 so this is just a partial sketch
  of a fast moving and dynamic and complex situation  i mean there are many other megarisks that are going to define fragility in our time not least income inequality 
 poverty  climate change  impunity  
 but we 're facing a stark dilemma
 where some cities are going to thrive and drive global growth and others are going to stumble and pull it backwards if we 're going to change course  we need to start a
  conversation we can 't only focus on those cities that work 
 the singapores the kuala lumpurs the dubais the shanghais we 've got to bring those fragile cities into the conversation 
 one way to do this might be to start twinning our fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones kickstarting a process of learning and collaboration and
  sharing of practices of what works and what doesn 't a wonderful example of this is coming from el salvador and los angeles where the mayors in san salvador
 and los angeles are collaborating on getting ex gang members to work with current gang members  offering tutoring education  
 and in the process are helping incubate cease fires and truces  and we 've seen homicide rates go down in san salvador once the world 's most violent city by fifty percent 
 we can also focus on hot cities but also hot
  spots place and location matter fundamentally in shaping violence in our cities  did you know that between one and two percent
 of street addresses in any fragile city can predict up to ninety nine percent of violent crime 
 take the case of so paulo where i 've been working
 it 's gone from being brazil 's most dangerous city to one of its safest and it did this by doubling down on information collection hot spot mapping and police reform
  in the process it dropped homicide by seventy percent in just over ten years  
 we also got to focus on those hot people  it 's tragic  but being young  unemployed uneducated  male  increases the risks of being killed
 and killing 
 we have to break this cycle of violence and get in there early with our children our youngest children and valorize them not stigmatize them
  's wonderful work that 's happening that i 've been involved with in kingston jamaica and right here in rio  which is putting education  employment  recreation
 up front for these high risk groups and as a result we 're seeing violence going down in their communities  we 've also got to make our cities safer more inclusive and livable for all the
 fact is social cohesion
  in our cities  we 've got to get away from this model of segregation exclusion and cities with walls my favorite example of how to do this comes from medelln when i lived in colombia in the late 1990s medelln was the murder capital of the world  
 but it changed course  and it did this by deliberately investing in its low income and most violent areas and integrating them with the middle class ones through a network of cable cars of
  and in the process  it dropped homicide by seventy nine percent in just under two decades  and finally there 's technology 
 technology has enormous promise but also peril  
 we 've seen examples here of extraordinary innovation and much of it coming from this room the police are engaging in predictive analytics citizens are engaging in new crowdsourcing solutions even my own group is involved in developing applications to
 provide more accountability over police and increase safety among citizens  but we need to be careful  
 if i have one single message for you it 's this 
 there is nothing inevitable about lethal violence and we can make
 our cities safer  folks  we have the opportunity of a lifetime
 to drop homicidal violence in half within our lifetime so i have just one question what are we waiting for thank you
