  you know cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy for students it 's quite an experience 
 but for a school  it could be very difficult
 or expensive to maintain  so we learned the
  majority of anatomic classes taught 
 they do not have a cadaver dissection lab  
 maybe those reasons  or depending on where you are cadavers may not be easily available  so to address this 
 we developed with a dr brown in stanford  
 virtual dissection table
  so with this anatomage table students can experience
 the dissection without a human cadaver and the table form is important and since 
 just like the way they do dissections in the lab or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact
  with your table our digital body
 is one to one life size  
 so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy i
 'm going to do
 some demonstrations  as you can see
  i use my finger to interact with my digital body
  i 'm going to do some cuts i can cut any way i want to so i cut right here  
 then it 's going to show inside 
 and i can change my cut to see different parts  
 maybe i can cut there see the brain
  and i can change my cut you can see some internal organs
  so we call this
 the slicer mode  
  going to do another cut 
 right there 
 this shows a lot of internal structures
  so if i want to see the back side i can flip
 and see from behind 
  images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you that means
 we did the right job  
 so our doctors said these are eye candies
  so instead of just butchering the body  i 'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to peel off all the skin
  muscles and bones  just to see a few internal organs  
 right here  
 let 's say
 i 'm going to cut the liver right here
  let 's say i 'm interested in looking at the heart  i 'm going to do some surgery here
  going to make a cut right there  
 and then you can see the inside of the heart you can see the atrium and the ventricles how blood flows to our
  and veins
  just like this students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to 
 it doesn 't have to be always dissection since it 's digital we can do reverse dissection 
 so let me show you i 'm going to start with the skeletal structure and i can add a few internal organs
 yep maybe i can add quickly this way 
 and i can build muscles gradually just
 like that we can see tendons and muscles 
 wish i could build my muscle this fast
  way to
 learn anatomy another thing i can show you is more often than not doctors get to meet patients
 in x ray form so anatomage table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear
  and also if you want you can compare
 with how anatomy would appear in x ray too so when you are done  just bring back
 the body
 and then it 's ready for another session it
 looks like our table also can transform gender too it 's a female now
