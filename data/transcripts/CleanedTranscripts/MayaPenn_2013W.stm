  i 've been drawing ever since i could hold a crayon  and i 've been making animated flip books since i was three years old  at that age i also learned about what an animator was
  a program on tv about jobs most kids don 't know about 
 when i understood that an animator makes the cartoons i saw on tv i immediately said that 's what i want to be 
 i don 't know if i said it mentally or out loud  but that was a greatly defining moment in my life  
 animation and art has always been my first love 
 it was my love for technology that sparked the idea for
  a virus on my computer and i was trying to get rid of it 
 and all of a sudden i just thought what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer  
 maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do virusy things  and thus malicious dishes was born 
 at four years old my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again that started my love for technology  
 i built my first website myself in html  and i 'm learning javascript and python
  i 'm also working on an animated series called the pollinators it 's about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why they 're so important 
 if plants aren 't pollinated by the pollinators  then all creatures including ourselves that depend on these plants would starve  
 so i decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team
  should have known  i need to
  all of my animations start with ideas  but what are ideas ideas can spark a movement ideas are
  ideas truly are what make the world go round 
 if it wasn 't for ideas we wouldn 't be where we are now with technology medicine art  culture and how we even live our lives 
 at eight years old  i took my ideas and started my own business called maya 's ideas 
 and my nonprofit maya 's ideas for the planet 
 and i make eco friendly clothing and accessories  i 'm thirteen now
  i started my business in two thousand and eight my artistic journey started way before then 
 i was greatly influenced by art and i wanted to incorporate it in everything i did even my business  
 i would find different fabrics around the house and say this could be a scarf or a hat and i had all these ideas for designs  
 i noticed when i wore my creations people would stop me and say wow that 's really cute where can i get one and i thought
  can start my own business  
 now i didn 't have any business plans at only eight years old  i only knew i wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and i wanted to give back 
 my mom taught me how to sew and on my back porch i would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon  and i would write down the names and the price of each item 
 i started making more items like hats scarves and bags  
 soon my items began selling all
  over the world and i had customers in denmark  italy  australia  canada and more 
 now i had a lot to learn about my business like branding and marketing  staying engaged with my customers and seeing what sold the most and the least
 soon my business really started to take off then one day  forbes magazine contacted me when i was ten years old 
 they wanted to feature me
 and my company in their article 
 now a lot of people ask me why is your business eco friendly 
 i 've had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since i was little 
 my parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment 
 i heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet  so i started
  doing my own research  and i discovered that even after dyeing has being completed there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment 
 for example the grinding of materials or the dumping of dried powder materials 
 these actions can pollute the air making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it so when i started my business i knew two things 
 all of my items had to be
  ten to twenty percent of the profits i made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations 
 i feel i 'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business  but also a sustainable future  
 i feel that i can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow we
  live in a big diverse and beautiful world and that makes me even more passionate to save it but it 's never enough to just to get it through your heads about the things that are happening in our world 
 it takes to get it through your hearts  because when you get it through your heart that is when movements are sparked 
 that is when opportunities and innovation are created  and that is why ideas come
