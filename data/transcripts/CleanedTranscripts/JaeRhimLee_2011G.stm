  so i 'm here to explain why i 'm wearing these ninja pajamas  
 and to do that i 'd like to talk first about environmental toxins in our bodies  so some of you may know about the chemical bisphenol a 
  it 's a material hardener and synthetic estrogen that 's found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics 
 so bpa mimics the body 's own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems and it 's everywhere a recent study found 
  percent of people six and older  but it 's just one chemical the center for disease
  says we have two hundred and nineteen toxic pollutants in our bodies  and this includes preservatives  pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury 
 to me this says three things  first don 't become a cannibal 
 second we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution  
 and third our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins 
 so what happens
  all these toxins when we die  
 the short answer is they return to the environment in one way or another  continuing the cycle of toxicity  
 but our current funeral practices make the situation much worse  
 if you 're cremated  all those toxins i mentioned are released into the atmosphere  and this includes five thousand pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year 
 and in a traditional
  american funeral a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive  
 it 's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition
 a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel  
 so by trying to preserve our dead bodies  we deny death poison the living and further harm the
  environment  green or natural burials  which don 't use embalming are a step in the right direction  but they don 't address the existing toxins in our bodies  
 i think there 's a better solution  
 i 'm an artist  so i 'd like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art  science and culture 
 the infinity burial project an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose
  and clean toxins in bodies the infinity burial project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the infinity mushroom
 a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots  leaving clean compost 
 but i learned it 's nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom 
 i also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms
 can clean environmental toxins in soil  so i thought maybe i could train an army of
 edible mushrooms to eat my body  so today  i 'm collecting what i shed or slough off my hair skin and nails
 and i 'm feeding these to edible mushrooms  as the mushrooms grow  i pick the best feeders to become infinity mushrooms
 it 's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife  
 so when i die the infinity mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it 
 all right so for some of you this may be really really out there 
 just a little  i realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food
  we want to eat not be eaten by our food  
 but as i watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body  
 i imagine the infinity mushroom as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment  
 see for me  cultivating the infinity mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation
 or gardening or raising a pet it 's a step
  towards accepting the fact that someday i will die and decay  
 it 's also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet 
 growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice of cultivating decomposing organisms called decompiculture a concept that was developed by an entomologist
  timothy myles the infinity mushroom is a subset of decompiculture i 'm calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation
 the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies  
 and now about these ninja pajamas  
 once it 's completed i plan to integrate the infinity mushrooms into a number of objects first a burial suit infused with mushroom spores
  i 'm wearing the second prototype of this burial suit it 's covered with a crocheted netting
 that is embedded with mushroom spores the dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia which are the equivalent of plant roots  
 i 'm also making a decompiculture kit a cocktail of capsules that contain infinity mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition
  and toxin remediation these capsules are embedded in a nutrient rich jelly a kind of second skin  
 which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms  
 so i plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two and then i 'd like to begin testing them  
 first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects 
  or not a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms 
 what i 've learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment  
 i wanted to cultivate this perspective
 just like the mushrooms  so i formed the
  decompiculture society a group of people called decompinauts
 who actively explore their postmortem options  seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the infinity mushroom 
 the decompiculture society shares a vision of a cultural shift from our current culture of death denial and body preservation
 to one of decompiculture a radical
 of death and decomposition 
 accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment as the research on environmental toxins confirms 
 and the saying goes  we came from dust and will return to dust 
 and once we understand that we 're connected to the environment  we see that the survival of our species
 depends on the survival of the planet  i believe
  this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility  thank you
