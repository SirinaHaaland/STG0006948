  i would like to demonstrate for the first time in public that it is possible to transmit a video from a standard
 there is no wi fi involved it 's just light and you may wonder what 's the point  and the point is this 
 there will be a massive extension of the internet to close the digital divide  
 and also to allow for what we call the internet of things tens of billions of devices connected to the internet 
 in my view  such an extension of the internet
  work if it 's almost
 this means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible  and this is where the solar cell
 and the led come in i demonstrated for the first time at ted in two thousand and eleven
  data incredibly fast and also in a safe and secure manner 
 data is transported by the light encoded in subtle changes of the brightness 
 if we look around we have many leds around us so there 's a rich infrastructure of li fi transmitters around
  but so far we have been using special devices small photo detectors to receive the information
 encoded in the data 
 i wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure to receive data from our li fi lights  
 and this is why i have been looking into solar cells and solar panels 
 a solar cell absorbs light
 and converts it into electrical energy this is why we can use
  a solar cell
 to charge our mobile phone  but now we need to remember that the data is encoded
 in subtle changes of the brightness of the led 
 so if the incoming light fluctuates  so does the energy harvested from the solar cell  
 this means we have a principal mechanism in place
 to receive information
  from the light
 and by the solar cell  because the fluctuations of the energy harvested correspond to the data transmitted 
 of course the question is can we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness  such as the ones transmitted by our led lights  
 and the answer to that is yes we can 
 we have shown in
 the lab that we can receive up to fifty megabytes per second
 from a standard off the shelf solar cell and this is faster than most broadband connections these days now
 let me show you in practice 
 in this box is a standard
  it is connected to the laptop  and also we have an instrument here
 to visualize the energy we harvest from the solar cell  
 and this instrument shows something at the moment this is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light 
 now what i would like to do first is
  only switch on the light for a moment  
 and what you 'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right 
 so the solar cell for a moment is harvesting energy from this artificial light source  
 if i turn it off we see it drops i turn it on so we harvest energy
 with the solar cell  but next i would like to activate the streaming of the video
  and i 've done this by pressing this button so now this led lamp here is streaming a video
 by changing the brightness of the led in a very subtle way and in a way that you can 't recognize with your eye  because the changes are too fast to recognize  
 but in order to prove the point i can block the light
 of the solar cell
  so first you notice
 the energy harvesting drops and the video stops as well if i remove the blockage the video will restart  
 and i can repeat
 that so we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well  so that is to show
 that the solar cell acts as a receiver  but now imagine that this led lamp is a street light and there 's fog
 and so i want to simulate fog  and that 's why i brought a handkerchief with me and let me put the handkerchief over
 the solar cell  first you notice
 the energy harvested
  drops as expected  
 but now the video still continues 
 this means despite the blockage  
 there 's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell  so that the solar cell is able to decode
 and stream that information in this case a high definition video 
 what 's really important here is that a solar cell has
  become a receiver for high speed wireless signals encoded in light  while it maintains its primary function
 as an energy harvesting device that 's why it is possible to use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut
 to act as a broadband receiver from a laser station on a close by hill  or indeed lamp post
  doesn 't matter where the beam hits the solar cell 
 and the same is true for translucent solar cells integrated into windows solar cells integrated into street furniture  
 or indeed solar cells integrated into these billions of devices that will form the internet of things  because simply  we don 't want to charge these devices regularly  or worse replace the batteries every few
  months 
 as i said to you this is the first time i 've shown this in public it 's very much a lab demonstration a prototype  
 but my team and i are confident that we can take this to market within the next two to three years  
 and we hope we will will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide  and also contribute to connecting all these billions of devices to the internet
 and all of this without causing a massive explosion of energy consumption because of the solar cells quite the opposite  thank you
