  am an engineering professor  and for the past fourteen years
 i 've been teaching crap not that i 'm a bad teacher  but i 've been studying and teaching about human waste
 and how waste is conveyed through these wastewater treatment
  plants and how we engineer and design these treatment plants so that we can protect surface water like rivers  i 've based my scientific career
 on
 using leading edge molecular techniques dna and rna based methods to look at microbial populations in biological reactors  and again to optimize these
  and over the years i have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets and
 i 've been known to sneak into toilets and take my camera phone
 all over the world  
 but along along the way i 've learned that it 's not just the technical side but
 there 's also this thing called the culture of crap  
 so for example  how many of you are washers and how many of you are wipers
 if well  i guess you know what i mean 
 if you 're a washer then you use water for anal cleansing that 's the technical term  and if you 're a
 wiper  then you use toilet paper or in some regions of the world where it 's not available  newspaper
 or rags or corncobs
 and this is not just a a piece of trivia  but it 's really important to understand and solve the sanitation problem  and it is a big problem  
 there are two point five billion people in the world who don 't have access to adequate sanitation for them there 's no modern toilet  
 and there are one point one billion people
 whose toilets are the streets or river banks or open
  spaces  and again the technical term for that is open defecation  but that is really simply
 shitting in the open  
 and if you 're living in fecal material and it 's surrounding you you 're going to get sick it 's going to get into your drinking water into your food into your immediate surroundings 
 so the united nations estimates
 that every year there are one point five million child deaths
 because of inadequate sanitation 
 that 's one preventable death every twenty seconds one hundred and seventy one every hour four thousand one hundred
 every day  and so to avoid open defecation  municipalities and cities build
 infrastructure for example like
  they 've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines  but there 's a problem when you scale up
 to tens of thousands and the problem is what happens when the pits are full this is what happens 
 people defecate around the toilet 
 in schools children defecate on the floors and then leave a trail outside the building and start defecating around the building 
 and these
  pits have to be cleaned and manually emptied and who does the emptying you 've got these workers
 who have to sometimes go down into the pits
 and manually remove the contents it 's a dirty and dangerous business
 as you can see there 's no protective equipment no protective clothing
  there 's one worker down there i hope you can see him he 's got a face mask on but no shirt  
 and in some countries like india the lower castes are condemned
 to empty the pits and they 're further condemned by society  
 so you ask yourself how can we solve this and why don 't we just build western style flush toilets for these two and a half billion 
 and the answer is it 's just not possible in some of these areas there 's not enough water there 's no energy
  energy it 's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars to lay out the sewer lines and to build the facilities and to operate and maintain these systems  
 and if you don 't build it right you 're going to have flush toilets that basically go straight into the river just like what 's happening in many cities in the developing world 
 and is this really the solution  because essentially what you 're doing is
 you 're using clean water and you 're using it to flush
  toilet  
 convey it to a wastewater treatment plant which then discharges to a river  and that river  again is a drinking water source  so we 've got to rethink sanitation and
 we 've got to reinvent
 the sanitation infrastructure  and i 'm going to argue that to do this you have to employ systems thinking we have to look at the whole
  we start with a human interface  
 and then we have to think about how feces are collected and stored  transported 
 treated and reused and not just disposal but reuse so let 's start with the human user interface 
 i say it doesn 't matter if you 're a washer or a wiper 
 a sitter or a squatter the human user interface should be clean and easy to use because after all taking a dump should be pleasurable
 and when we open the possibilities to understanding this sanitation chain then the back end technology the collection to the reuse 
 should not really matter and then we can apply locally
 adoptable and  context sensitive solutions so we can open ourselves to possibilities
  and there 's two holes in this toilet  there 's the front and the back and the front collects the urine  and the back collects the fecal material and so what you 're doing is you 're separating the urine which has eighty percent of the nitrogen and fifty percent of the phosphorus  
 and then that can then be treated and precipitated to form things like struvite which is a high value fertilizer  and then the fecal material can then be disinfected
 and again converted to
  example in some of our research 
 you can reuse the water by treating it in on site sanitation systems like planter boxes or constructed wetlands  so we can open up all these possibilities 
 if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets and treatment plants 
  i 'm going to argue that governments should fund
 sanitation infrastructure ngos and donor organizations 
 they can do their best but it 's not going to be enough governments should fund sanitation the same way they fund roads and schools and hospitals
 and other infrastructure like bridges because we know  and the who has done this study that for every dollar that we invest in sanitation infrastructure we get something like three to thirty four dollars back
 let 's go back to the problem of pit emptying  so at north carolina state university we challenged our students to come up with a simple solution  
 and this is what they came up with a simple modified screw auger
 that can move the waste up
 from the pit and into a collecting drum  and now the pit worker doesn 't have to go down into the pit we tested it in south africa and it works we need to make it more robust and we 're going to do more testing
 in malawi and south africa this coming year  
 and our idea is to make this a professionalized pit emptying service so that we can create a small business out of it create profits and jobs  and the hope is that as we are rethinking sanitation 
 we are extending the life of these pits
 so that we don 't have to resort to quick solutions that don 't really make sense i believe
 that access to adequate sanitation is a basic human right  
 we need to stop the practice of lower castes and lower status people going down and being condemned to empty pits 
 it is our moral it is our social and our environmental obligation thank you
