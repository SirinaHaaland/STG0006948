  're going to the bahamas to meet a remarkable group of dolphins that i 've been working with in the wild for the last  twenty eight years 
 now i 'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains and what they might be doing with all that brainpower in the wild  
 and we know they use some of that brainpower for just
  living complicated lives  but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence well
 we know a few things we know that their brain to body ratio which is a physical measure of intelligence is second only to humans 
 cognitively they can understand artificially created languages  
 and they pass self awareness tests in mirrors
  and in some parts of the world they use tools like sponges to hunt fish  
 but there 's one big question left do they have a language and if so what are they talking about 
 so decades ago  not years ago  
 i set out to find a place in the world where i could observe dolphins underwater to try to crack the code of their communication system  
 now in most parts of the world the water 's pretty murky so it 's very hard to observe animals underwater but i found a community of dolphins that live
  these beautiful clear  shallow sandbanks of the bahamas which are just east of florida  
 and they spend their daytime resting and socializing in the safety of the shallows but at night they go off the edge
 and hunt in deep water  now it 's not a bad place to be a researcher either  so we go out for about five months every summer in a 20 meter
  and we live sleep
 and work at sea for weeks at a time 
 my main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone which is an underwater microphone  and this is so i can correlate sound and behavior 
 and most of our work 's pretty non invasive we try to follow dolphin etiquette while we 're in the water since we 're actually observing them physically in the water  
 now atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species to work with for a couple of reasons they 're born without spots and they get spots with age  and they go through pretty distinct
  phases so that 's fun to track their behavior and by about the age of fifteen they 're fully spotted black and white  now the mother you see here is mugsy she 's thirty five years old in this shot  but dolphins can actually live into their early 50s 
 and like all the dolphins in our community we photographed mugsy and tracked her little spots and nicks in her dorsal fin and also the unique spot patterns as she matured over time
  time  
 now young dolphins learn a lot as they 're growing up and they use their teenage years to practice social skills and at about the age of nine the females become sexually mature so they can get pregnant  
 and the males mature quite a bit later at around fifteen years of age 
 and dolphins are very promiscuous and so we have to determine who the fathers are so we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material out of the water and extracting
  dna  so what that means is after twenty eight years we
 are tracking three generations including grandmothers and grandfathers 
 now dolphins are natural acousticians they make sounds ten times as high and hear sounds ten times as high as we do  but they have other communication signals they use they 
  have good vision  so they use body postures to communicate  they have taste not smell  
 and sound can actually be felt in the water because the acoustic impedance of tissue and water 's about the same  so dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance  
 now we do know some things about how sounds are used with certain behaviors now the signature whistle is a whistle that 's specific to an individual dolphin  
 and it 's like a name 
  because it 's easy to measure really and you 'd find this whistle when mothers and calves are reuniting for example
  another well studied sound are echolocation clicks this is the dolphin 's sonar dolphin echolocation
 noises and they use these clicks to hunt and feed  
 but they can also tightly pack these clicks together into buzzes and use them socially for example males will stimulate a female during a courtship chase you know
 i 've been buzzed in the water
  don 't tell anyone it 's a secret  and you can really feel the sound that was my point with that 
 so dolphins are also political animals so they have to resolve conflicts dolphin
 and they use these burst pulsed sounds as well as their head to head behaviors when they 're fighting  and these are very unstudied sounds because they 're hard to measure  now this is
  some video of a typical dolphin fight 
 so you 're going to see two groups and you 're going to see the head to head posturing some open mouths lots of
 squawking there 's a bubble  and basically one of these groups will kind of back off and
 everything will resolve fine and it doesn 't really escalate into violence
 now in the bahamas we also have resident bottlenose that interact socially with the spotted dolphins for example they babysit each other 's calves 
 the males have dominance displays that they use when they 're chasing each other 's females 
 and the two species actually form temporary alliances when they 're chasing sharks away  
 and one of the mechanisms they use to communicate their coordination is synchrony they synchronize their sounds and their
  body postures
 to look bigger and sound stronger now 
 these are bottlenose dolphins  
 and you 'll see them starting to synchronize their behavior and their sounds you see they
 're synchronizing with their partner as well as the other dyad
  i wish i was that coordinated 
 now it 's important to remember that you 're only hearing the human audible parts of dolphin sounds and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds and we use special equipment in the water to collect these sounds  
 now researchers have actually measured whistle complexity using information theory  and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages
  now  these are three spectragrams two are human words  and one is a dolphin vocalizing so just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin 
 now it turns out burst pulsed sounds actually look a bit like human phonemes 
 now one way to crack the code is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean
 but it 's a difficult job and we actually don 't have a rosetta stone yet  
 but a second way to crack the code is to develop some technology an interface to do two way communication and that 's what we 've been trying to do in the bahamas and in real time  
 now  scientists have used keyboard interfaces
 to try to bridge the gap with species including chimpanzees and dolphins this underwater keyboard in orlando florida
  at the epcot center was actually the most sophisticated ever two way interface designed for humans and dolphins to work together under the water and exchange information 
 so we wanted to develop an interface like this in the bahamas but in a more natural setting  
 and one of the reasons we thought we could do this is because the dolphins were starting to show us
 a lot of mutual curiosity they were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations and our postures and they were also
  inviting us into dolphin games  
 now dolphins are social mammals so they love to play  and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed or sargassum in this case around 
 and they 're very adept they like to drag it and drop it from appendage to appendage  
 now in this footage the adult is caroh she 's twenty five years old here and this is her newborn  cobalt  and he 's just learning how to play this game
  of teasing him and taunting him he
 really wants that sargassum 
 now when dolphins solicit humans for this game they
 'll often sink vertically in the water and they 'll have a little sargassum on their flipper and they 'll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes on the bottom
  have a little seaweed keep away game but when we don 't dive down and get it they 'll bring it to the surface and they 'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail
 and drop it for us like they do their calves  and then we 'll pick it up and have a game  
 and so we started thinking well wouldn 't it be neat to build some technology that would allow the dolphins to request these things in real time their favorite toys 
 so the original vision was to have a keyboard hanging from the boat attached to a computer and the divers and dolphins would activate the
  on the keypad and happily exchange information and request toys from each other but we quickly found out that dolphins simply were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard
  they 've got better things to do in the wild they might do it in captivity but in the wild so we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water and we labeled four objects they like to play with the scarf rope sargassum and also had a bow ride which is a fun activity for a
  and that 's the scarf whistle which is also associated with a visual symbol  and these are artificially created whistles they 're outside the dolphin 's normal repertoire  
 but they 're easily mimicked by the dolphins  
 and i spent four years with my colleagues adam pack and fabienne delfour working out in the field with this keyboard using it with each other to do requests for toys while the dolphins were watching  and the dolphins could get in on the game they could point at the
  visual object  or they could mimic the whistle  now this is video
 of a session the diver here has a rope toy  and i 'm on the keyboard on the left  and i 
 've just played the rope key and that 's the request for the toy from the human 
 so i 've got the rope i 'm diving down and i 'm basically trying to get the dolphin 's attention because they 're kind of like little kids you have to keep their
 i 'm going to drop the rope see if they come over 
 here they come and then they 're
 going to pick up the rope and drag it around as a toy  
 now i 'm at the keyboard on the left  and this is actually the first time that we tried this i 'm going to try to request
 this toy  the rope toy from the dolphins using the rope sound let 's see if they
 might actually understand what that means
 that 's the rope whistle
  up come the dolphins and drop off the rope yay wow so
 this is only once
 we don 't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles  okay so here 's a second
 second toy in the water this is a scarf toy and i 'm trying to lead the dolphin over to the keyboard
 to show her
 the visual and the acoustic signal  now this dolphin we call her the scarf thief 
 because over the years she 's absconded with about twelve scarves in
 fact we think she has a boutique somewhere in the bahamas  
 so i 'm reaching over she 's got the scarf on her right side  and we try to not touch the animals too much we really don 't want to over habituate them  and i 'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard
 and the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound
 to request the scarf so i try to give her the scarf whoop almost lost it
  but this this is the moment where everything becomes possible the dolphin 's at the keyboard you 've got full attention  and this sometimes went on for hours
  and i wanted to share this video with you not to show you any big breakthroughs because they haven 't happened yet  but to show you the level of intention and focus that these dolphins have and interest in the system  
 and because of this we really decided we needed some more sophisticated technology 
 so we joined forces with georgia tech with thad starner 's wearable computing group to build us an underwater wearable computer that we 're calling chat [ chat cetacean hearing and telemetry ]
 now instead of pushing a keyboard through the water
  the diver 's wearing the complete system and it 's acoustic only 
 so basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad on the forearm  the sounds go out through an underwater speaker if a dolphin mimics the whistle or a human plays the whistle  the sounds come in and are localized by two hydrophones 
 the computer can localize who requested the toy if there 's a word match and the real power of the system is in the real time sound recognition
  so we can respond to the dolphins quickly and accurately 
 and we 're at prototype stage but this is how we hope it will play out so diver a and diver b both have a wearable computer
 and the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle the diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water but also as a word through bone conduction 
 so diver a plays the scarf whistle or diver b plays the sargassum whistle to request a toy from whoever has it what we hope will happen
 is that the dolphin mimics the whistle  and if diver a has the
  sargassum if that 's the sound that was
 played and requested then the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin and they 'll swim away happily into the sunset playing
 sargassum for
 forever 
 now how far can this kind of communication go 
 well  chat is designed specifically to empower the dolphins to request things from us it 's designed to really be
  learn to mimic the whistles functionally we hope so and we think so 
 but as we decode their natural sounds we 're also planning to put those back into the computerized system for example  right now we can put their own signature whistles in the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin 
 likewise we can create
 our own whistles our own whistle names and let the dolphins request specific divers
  to interact with now it may be that all our mobile technology will actually be the same technology that helps us
 communicate with another species down the road 
 in the case of a dolphin you know  it 's a species that well they 're probably close to our intelligence in many ways and we might not be able to admit that right now
  but they live in quite a different environment and you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems i mean
 imagine what it would be like to really understand the mind of another intelligent species on the planet
