  it 's a mold with an identity crisis because it 's not a mold so let 's get that straight to start with it is one of seven hundred known slime molds belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba
  organism  a cell that joins together with other cells to form a mass super cell to maximize its resources  
 so within a slime mold you might find thousands or millions of nuclei  all sharing a cell wall all operating as one entity 
 in its natural habitat you might find the slime
  but you might equally find it in research laboratories  classrooms  and even artists ' studios  
 i first came across the slime mold about five years ago a microbiologist friend of mine gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it and told me to go home and play with it 
 the only instructions i was given that it likes it dark and damp and its favorite food is porridge oats
 i 'm an artist who 's worked for many years with biology with scientific processes 
 so living material is not uncommon for me i 've worked with plants bacteria  cuttlefish fruit flies  so i was keen to get my new collaborator home to see what it could do  
 so i took it home
 and i watched  
  i fed it a varied diet  
 i observed as it networked it formed a connection between food sources i watched it leave a trail behind it indicating where it had been  
 and i noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish it would escape and find a better home 
 i captured my observations through time lapse photography slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour  so it 's not really
 ideal for live viewing unless there 's some form of really extreme meditation  but through the time lapse  i could observe some really interesting behaviors 
 for instance  having fed on a nice pile of oats  the slime mold
 goes off to explore new territories in different directions simultaneously 
 when it meets itself  it knows it 's already there it recognizes it 's there and instead retreats back and grows in
  directions i was quite impressed by this feat at how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime
 could somehow map its territory  know itself  and move with seeming intention  
 i found countless scientific studies research papers journal articles all citing incredible work with this one organism
  a few of those with you 
 for example  a team in hokkaido university in japan filled a maze with slime mold it joined together and formed a mass cell they introduced food at two points oats of course  
 and it formed a connection between the food  it retracted from empty areas and dead ends 
 there are four possible routes through this
  time and time again the slime mold established the shortest and the most efficient route 
 quite clever  the conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold had a primitive form of intelligence 
 another study exposed cold air at regular intervals to the slime mold  it didn 't like it it doesn 't like it cold it doesn 't like it dry  they did this at repeat intervals  
 and each time the slime mold slowed down its growth
 in response  however at the next interval
  researchers didn 't put the cold air on yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation of it happening  
 it somehow knew that it was about the time for the cold air that it didn 't like  
 the conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn 
 a third experiment the slime mold was invited
 to
  to explore a territory covered in oats  it fans out
 in a branching pattern as it goes each food node it finds it forms a
 network a connection to and keeps foraging 
 after twenty six hours it established quite a firm network between the different oats  now there 's nothing remarkable in this until you learn that the center oat that it started from represents the city of
  and the surrounding oats are suburban railway stations the slime mold had replicated the tokyo transport network
 a complex system developed over time by community dwellings civil engineering urban planning what had taken us well over one hundred years took the slime mold just
 over a day  the conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold can form efficient networks and solve the traveling salesman problem
  it is a biological computer 
 as such it has been mathematically modeled  algorithmically analyzed it 's been sonified replicated simulated 
 world over teams of researchers are decoding its biological principles to understand its computational rules and applying that learning to the fields of electronics
 programming and robotics 
 so the question is how does this thing work  it doesn 't have a central nervous system  
 it doesn 't have a brain yet it can perform behaviors that we associate with brain function  it can learn it can remember it can solve problems it can make decisions  
 so where does that intelligence lie  so this is a microscopy  a video i shot and it 's about one hundred times magnification
  the slime mold  there is a rhythmic pulsing flow 
 a vein like structure carrying cellular material nutrients and chemical information through the cell  
 streaming first in one direction and then back in another 
 and it is this continuous  synchronous oscillation within the cell that allows it to form quite a complex understanding of its environment
 but without any large scale control center this is where its intelligence lies  
 so it 's not just academic researchers in universities that are interested in this organism a
 few years ago i set up slimoco the slime mould collective it 's an online  open  democratic
  slime mold researchers and enthusiasts to share knowledge and experimentation
 across disciplinary divides and across academic divides
  the slime mould collective membership is  self selecting people have found
 the the collective as the slime mold finds the oats  
 and it comprises of scientists and computer scientists and
  you name it it 's a very interesting eclectic membership 
 just a few examples an artist who paints with fluorescent physarum a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with 3d printing technologies in a workshop  
 another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map
  their area  here  the slime mold is being used directly as a biological tool but metaphorically as a symbol for ways of talking about
 social cohesion communication
 and cooperation  
 other public engagement activities i run lots of slime mold workshops  a creative way of engaging with the organism  
 so people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do
 and they design their own petri dish experiment an environment for the slime mold to navigate so they can test its properties  everybody takes home a new pet
 and is invited to
 post their results on the slime mould collective  and the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting
  which is in the final stages of edit and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon it 's also enabled me to conduct what i think is
 the world 's first human slime mold experiment this is part of an exhibition in rotterdam
 last year we invited people to become slime mold for half an hour
  essentially tied people together so they were a giant cell
  and invited them to follow slime mold rules you have to communicate through oscillations 
 no speaking  you have to operate as one entity one mass cell  no egos  
 and
 the motivation for for moving and then exploring the environment is in search of food
  so a chaotic shuffle ensued as this bunch of strangers tied together with yellow ropes wearing being slime mold t shirts wandered through
 the museum park
  when they met trees they had to reshape their connections and reform as as a mass cell through not speaking
 this is a ludicrous experiment in many many ways this isn
 not trying to prove  demonstrate anything  
 but what it did provide us was a way of engaging a broad section of the public with ideas of intelligence agency  autonomy  
 and provide a playful platform for discussions
 about
 the things that
  one of the most exciting things about this
 experiment was the conversation that happened afterwards an
 entirely spontaneous symposium happened in the park people talked about the human psychology of how difficult it was to let go of their individual
 personalities and egos  other people talked about bacterial communication each person brought in their own individual
  our conclusion from this experiment was that the people of rotterdam were highly cooperative  especially when given beer 
 we didn 't just give them oats  we gave them beer as well
 but they weren 't as efficient as the slime mold  and the slime mold for me is a fascinating subject matter  it 's biologically fascinating it 's computationally interesting but it 's also a symbol a way of engaging with ideas
 of community
 collective behavior cooperation
 a lot of my work draws on the scientific research so this pays homage to the maze experiment but in a different way 
 and the slime mold is also my working material it 's a 
 of photographs prints animations  participatory events whilst the slime mold doesn 't choose to work with me exactly
  collaboration of sorts 
 i can predict certain behaviors by understanding how it operates but i can 't control it the slime mold has the final say in the in the creative process 
 and after all it has its own internal aesthetics  
 these branching patterns that we see we see across all forms scales of nature from river deltas to lightning strikes from
 our own blood vessels to neural networks
  networks 
 there 's clearly significant rules at play in this simple yet complex organism  
 and no matter what our disciplinary perspective or our mode of inquiry  there 's a great deal that we can learn from observing and engaging with this beautiful brainless blob  
 i give you
