  so there 's this thing called the
 law of unintended consequences i thought it was just like a saying  but it actually exists i guess there 's like academic papers about it  
 and i 'm a designer i don 't like
 unintended consequences people hire me because they have consequences
  that they really intend and what they intend is for me to help them achieve those consequences  so
 i live in fear of unintended consequences  and so this is a story about
 consequences intended and unintended i got called by an organization called robin hood to do a favor for them robin hood is based in
  a wonderful philanthropic organization that does what it says in the name they take from rich people give it to poor people in this case what they wanted to benefit was the new york city 
  school system a huge enterprise that educates more than a million students at a time  and in buildings that are like this one old buildings 
 big buildings drafty buildings sometimes buildings that are in disrepair certainly buildings that could use a renovation robin hood had this ambition to improve these buildings in some way
  but what they realized was to fix the buildings would be
 too expensive and impractical  so instead they tried to figure out what one room they could go into
 in each of these buildings in as many buildings that they could and 
 fix that one room so that they could improve the lives of the children inside as they were studying  and what they came up with was the school library and they came up with this idea called
  initiative all the students have to pass through the library that 's where the books are that 's where the
 heart and soul of the school is so let 's fix these libraries so they did this wonderful thing where they brought in first ten then twenty then more architects each one of 
  whom was assigned a library to rethink what a library was they trained special librarians
  so they started this mighty enterprise to reform public schools by improving these libraries  then they called me up and they said could you make a little contribution i said sure what do you want me to do 
 and they said well  we want you to be the graphic designer in charge of the whole thing and so i thought  i know what that means that means i get to design a logo i know how to design that i design logos that 's what people come to me for so ok  let 's design a logo for this thing  
 easy to do actually compared with architecture and being a librarian
  contribution and then you 're out and you feel really good about yourself and i 'm a great guy and i like to feel good about myself when i do these favors  so
 i thought let 's overdeliver i 'm going to give you three logos all based on this one idea  so you have three options pick any of the three they 're all great i said  so
 the basic idea was these would be new school libraries for new york schools and so the idea is that it 's a new thing a new idea that needs a new name what i wanted to do
  dispel the idea that these were musty old libraries the kind of places that everyone is bored with you
 know not your grandparents ' library  don 't worry about that at all this is going to this new exciting thing 
 not a boring library so option number one  so instead of thinking of it as a library  think of it as a place where it is like do
  meet you after school down at owl  i like that right now what does owl stand for well it could be one world library  or it could be open wonder learn or it could be and i
 i figure librarians could figure out other things it could be because they know about words so other things right  and then look at this it 's like the eye of the owl this is irresistible in my opinion but there 's even another idea
  option number three option number three was based actually on language it 's the idea that read is the past tense of read and they 're both spelled the same way so why don 't we call this place the red zone
  red get red  i 'm well red 
 i really loved this idea and i somehow was not focused on the idea that librarians as a class are sort of interested in spelling and i don 't know 
 but
 sometimes cleverness is more important
  and i thought this would be one of those instances
 so usually when i make these presentations i say there 's just one question and the question should be how can i thank you mike 
 but in this case the question was more like um 
 are you kidding because they said  the premise of all this work was that kids were bored with old libraries musty old libraries they were tired of them 
 and instead they said  these kids have never really seen a library the school libraries in these schools are really so dilapidated
  if they 're there at all that they haven 't bored anyone  they haven 't even been there to bore anyone at all  so the idea was 
 just forget about giving it a new name just call it 
 one last try a library
  and there you have it the library initiative so i thought  mission accomplished there 's your logo so what 's interesting about this logo an unintended consequence was that it turned out that they didn 't really even need my design 
  because you could type it any font you could write it by hand and when they started sending emails around they just would use shift and one they 'd get their own logo just right out of the thing
  feel free to use that logo  and then i embarked on the real rollout of this thing working with every one of the architects to put this logo on the front door of their own library right  
 so here 's the big rollout
 basically i 'd work with different architects   first robin hood was my client now these architects were my client i 'd say here 's your logo put it on the door here 's your logo  put it on both doors
  logo then i got a call from
 one of the architects a guy named richard lewis and he says i 've got a problem you 're the graphics guy can you solve it and i said ok  sure and he said the problem is that there 's a space 
  between the shelf and the ceiling so that sounds like an architectural issue to me not a graphic design issue so i 'm go on and
  the top shelf has to be low enough for the kid to reach it but i 'm in a big old building and the ceilings are really high  so actually i 've got all this space up there and i need something like a mural 
 and i 'm like whoa you
 know i 'm a logo designer i 'm not diego rivera or something i 'm not a muralist and
 so he said but
 can 't you think of anything so i said 
 what if we just took pictures of the kids in the
  just put them around the top of the thing and maybe that could work and my wife is a photographer and i said dorothy there 's no budget can you come to this school in east new york take these pictures 
 she did and if you go in richard 's library 
 which is one of the first that opened it has this glorious frieze of like the heroes of the school oversized looking down into the little dollhouse of the real library right and
 the kids were great hand selected by the principals and the
 librarian
  of created this heroic atmosphere in this library this very dignified setting below and the joy of the children above  so naturally all the other librarians in the other schools see this and they said well we want murals too  and i 'm like 
 ok so then i think well it can 't be the same mural every time so
 dorothy did another one  and then she did another one but then we needed more help so i called an illustrator i knew named lynn pauley and lynn did
  these beautiful paintings of the kids then i called a guy named charles wilkin at a place called automatic design he did these amazing collages 
 we had rafael esquer do these great silhouettes he would work with the kids asking for words and then based on those prompts come up with this little delirious kind of constellation of silhouettes of things that are
  peter arkle interviewed the kids and had them talk about their favorite books and he put their testimony as a frieze up there 
 stefan sagmeister worked with yuko shimizu and they did this amazing manga style statement everyone who is honest is interesting that goes all the way around  
 christoph niemann  brilliant illustrator did a whole series of things where he embedded books into the faces and characters and images and places that you find in the books 
 and then even maira kalman did this amazing
  cryptic installation of objects and words that kind of go all around and will fascinate students
 for as long as it 's up there so this was really satisfying and basically my role here was reading
 a series of dimensions to these artists and i would say three feet by fifteen feet  whatever you want  let me know if you have any problem
  and they would go and install these it just was the greatest thing
 but the greatest thing actually was every once in a while i 'd get like an invitation in the mail made of construction paper and it would say you are invited to the opening of our new library 
 so you 'd go to the library  say you 'd go to ps10 and you 'd go inside there 'd be balloons there 'd be a student ambassador there 'd be speeches that were read poetry that was written specifically
  dignitaries would present people with certificates and the whole thing was just a delirious fun party  so i loved going to these things i would stand there dressed like this obviously not belonging  and someone 
 would say what are you doing here mister and i 'd say well  i 'm part of the team that designed this place
  nice work if you can get it so
 it was so satisfying going to these little openings despite the fact that i was kind of largely ignored or humiliated
 but it was it was actually fun going to the openings so i decided that i wanted to get the people in my office who had worked on these projects get the illustrators and photographers
  and i said  why don 't we rent a van and drive around
 the five boroughs of new york and see how many we could hit at one time and eventually there were going to be sixty of these libraries so we probably got to see maybe
 half a dozen in one long day 
 and the best thing of all was meeting these librarians who kind of were running these  took possession of these places like their private stage upon which they were invited to mesmerize 
  their students and bring the books to life and it was just this really exciting experience
  for all of us to actually see these things in action
 so we spent a long day doing this and we were in the very last library it was still winter because it got dark early  
 and the librarian says i 'm about to close down  so really nice having you here  hey wait a second do you want to see how i turn off the lights i 'm like 
 ok and she said i have this special way that i do
  and then she showed me what she did was she turned out every light one by one by one by one and the last light she left on was the light that illuminated the kids ' faces 
 and she said that 's the last light i turn off every night because i like to remind myself why i come to work 
  i would like to take credit for and like to think i can think through the experience to that extent but i can 't i was just focused on a foot ahead of me as far as i could reach with my own hands instead 
 way off in the distance was a librarian who was going to find
 the chain of consequences that we had set in motion a source of inspiration so that she in this case could do her work really well  forty thousand kids a year are affected by these libraries  they 've been happening for more than ten years now so those
  librarians have kind of turned on a generation of children to books and so it 's been a thrill to find out that sometimes unintended consequences are the best consequences  thank you very
