  i am a palliative care physician and i would like to talk to you today about health care i 'd like to talk to you about the health and care
 of the most vulnerable population
  our country those people dealing with
 the most complex serious health
 issues i 'd like to talk to you about economics as well  and the intersection of these two should scare the hell out of you
 it scares the hell out of me  
 i 'd also like to talk to you about palliative medicine 
 a paradigm of care for this population  grounded in what they value patient centric care based on their values
 that helps this population live better and longer  it 's a care model that tells the truth
 and engages one on one and meets people where they 're at i 'd
 like to start by telling the story of my very first patient it was my first day as a physician
  the long white coat 
 i stumbled into the hospital and right away there 's a gentleman harold sixty eight years old came to the emergency department he had had headaches for about six weeks that got worse and worse and worse and worse and worse
 evaluation revealed he had cancer that had spread to his brain the attending physician
 directed me to go share with harold and his family
 the
  the prognosis and options of care
 five hours into my new career  i did the only thing i knew how 
 i walked in sat down  
 took harold 's hand 
 took his wife 's hand
 and just breathed
  harold went fishing the next day he died a week later as i 've gone through my training in my career
 i think back to harold and i think that this is a conversation
 that happens far too infrequently  
 and it 's a conversation that had led us to crisis 
 to the biggest threat to the american way of life today which is health care expenditures  
 so what do we know we know that this population the most ill takes up fifteen percent of the gross domestic
  product nearly two point three trillion dollars 
 so the sickest fifteen percent take up fifteen percent of the gdp  if we extrapolate this out over the next two decades
 with the growth of baby boomers at this rate it is sixty percent of the gdp
 sixty percent of the gross domestic product of the united states of america it has very little to do
  health care at that point  
 it has to do with a gallon of milk with college tuition  it has to do with every thing that we value and every thing that we know
 presently  it has
 at stake the free market economy and capitalism of the united states of america let 's
 forget all the statistics for a minute forget the numbers
  about the value we get for all these dollars we spend 
 well the dartmouth atlas about six years ago looked at every dollar spent by medicare generally this population 
 we found that those patients who have the highest per capita expenditures
 had the highest suffering pain 
  more often than not they die sooner
 how can this be we live in the united states it has the greatest health care system on the planet we spend ten times more on these patients
 than the second leading country in the world that doesn 't make sense 
 but what we know is out of the top fifty countries on the planet with
  african countries rank higher than us as far as quality and value  
 something i experience every day in my practice and i 'm sure something many of you on your own journeys have experienced 
 more
 is not more those individuals
  who had more tests more bells more whistles more chemotherapy more surgery more whatever the more that we do to someone 
 it decreases the quality of their life  
 and it shortens it most often so what
 are we going to do about this what are we doing about this  and why is this so the grim reality ladies and gentlemen is that we the health care
  industry long white coat physicians are stealing from you stealing from you the opportunity
 to choose how you want to live your lives in the context of whatever disease it is we focus on disease and pathology and surgery and pharmacology  
 we miss the human being  
 how can we treat this
  without understanding this 
 we do things to this  
 we need to do things for this 
 the triple aim of healthcare one improve patient experience two improve the population
  decrease per capita expenditure across a continuum 
 our group palliative care in two thousand and twelve  working with the sickest of the sick
 cancer  heart disease lung disease  renal disease  dementia
 how did we improve patient experience i want to be at home doc ok we 'll bring the care to you
  of life  enhanced think about
 the human being two population health how did we look at this population differently and
 engage with them at a different level a deeper level and connect to a broader sense of the human condition
 than my own how do we manage
 this group  so that of
  in two thousand and twelve never had to go to the hospital not because they couldn 't 
 but they didn 't have to we brought the care to them we maintained
 their value their quality 
 number three per capita expenditures for
 this population that today is two point three trillion dollars and in twenty years is sixty percent of the gdp
 we reduced health care expenditures by nearly seventy percent 
 they got more of what they wanted based on their values lived better and are living longer 
 for two thirds less money 
 while harold 's time was limited palliative care 's is not
  palliative care is a paradigm from diagnosis
 through the end of life
  the hours weeks months years 
 across a continuum with treatment without treatment  meet christine  
 stage iii cervical cancer so metastatic cancer that started in her cervix  spread throughout her body
 50s and she is living 
 this is not about end of life this is about life 
 this is not just about the elderly this is about people 
 this is richard end stage lung disease richard what is it that you hold sacred
  can 't drive you around on it because i can barely pedal a bicycle but let 's see what we can do richard came to me  and
 he was in rough shape  he had this little voice telling him that maybe his time was weeks to months  and then we just
  i listened and tried to hear big difference use these in proportion to this i said
 alright let 's take it one day at a time like we do in every other chapter of our life and we have met richard where richard 's 
 and it 's a phone call or two a week  but he 's thriving in the context of end stage lung disease
 now palliative medicine is not just for the elderly it is not just for the middle aged it
 is for everyone  meet my friend jonathan we
 have the honor and pleasure of jonathan and his father joining us here today jonathan is in his 20s and i met him several years ago
  he was dealing with metastatic testicular cancer
 spread to his brain he had a stroke he had brain surgery  radiation chemotherapy  
 upon meeting him and his family he was a couple of weeks away from a bone marrow transplant and in listening and engaging they said 
 help us understand what
 is
  how did we get this far
 without understanding what we 're dealing with how did
 we get this far without empowering somebody to know what it is they 're dealing with and then taking the next step and engaging in who they are as human beings to know if that is what we should do 
 lord knows we can do any kind of thing to you 
 but should we
  don 't take my word for it all the evidence that is related to palliative care these days
 demonstrates with absolute certainty people live better and live longer there was a seminal article out of the new england journal of medicine in two thousand and ten a
 study done at harvard by friends of mine colleagues end stage lung cancer  one group with
  similar group without 
 the group with palliative care reported less pain  
 less depression they needed fewer hospitalizations and ladies and gentlemen  
 they lived
 three to six months longer  if palliative care
 were a cancer drug every cancer doctor on the planet would write a prescription for it
  don 't they again because we goofy long white coat physicians are trained
 and of the mantra of dealing with this 
 not with this 
 this is a space that we will all come to at some point  but this conversation today is not about
  dying it is about living living based on our values what we find sacred and how we want to write the chapters of our lives whether it 's the last
 or the last five  
 what we know what we have proven is that this conversation needs to happen today
 not next week not next year what is at stake is our lives today and the
  lives of us as we get older and the lives of our children and our grandchildren 
 not just in that hospital room or on the couch at home  but everywhere we go and everything we see 
 palliative medicine is the answer to engage with human beings to change the journey that we will all face  
 and change it for the better
 to my colleagues  
 to my patients 
 to my government to all human beings  i ask that we stand and we shout and we demand
 the best care possible 
 so that we can live better today and ensure a better life tomorrow we need to shift today
 so that we can live tomorrow  thank you very much
