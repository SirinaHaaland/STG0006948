  fifty s said that we overestimate technology in the short term and we underestimate it in the long term and i
 i think that 's some of the fear that we see about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and
 robots that we 're overestimating the technology in the short term but i am worried
 whether we 're going to get the technology we need in the long term because the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing and that we 
 our society is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future so i 'm scared we won 't have enough robots
  losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time
 back in one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven there was a spencer tracy katharine hepburn movie so you know how it ended up spencer tracy brought a computer a mainframe computer of one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven in to help the librarians 
 the librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives what are the names of santa 's reindeer and they would look that up and this mainframe computer was going to help them with that
  job well of course a mainframe computer in one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven wasn 't much use for that job the librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear but that 's not what happened in fact the number of jobs 
  for librarians increased for a long time after one thousand nine hundred and fifty seven it wasn 't until the internet came into play the web came into play and search engines came into play that the need for librarians went down and i think everyone from
 totally underestimated the level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today and
 we can just ask what are the names of santa 's reindeer and be told instantly or anything else we want to ask
 by the way the wages for librarians went up faster than
 wages for other jobs in the u s over that same time period because librarians became partners of computers computers became tools and they got more tools that they could use and become more 
  effective during that time same thing happened in offices back in the old days people used spreadsheets spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper and they calculated by hand
  replace office workers but it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers so office workers became programmers of spreadsheets it increased their 
  capabilities they no longer had to do the mundane computations but they could do something much more
  when soldiers came across roadside bombs in iraq and afghanistan instead of putting on
 a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick as they used to do up until about two thousand and two they now send the robot out so the robot takes over the dangerous jobs on the right are
  some tugs from a company called aethon in pittsburgh these are in hundreds of hospitals across the u s and they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry they take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen they bring the medicines up from the pharmacy and it frees
  up the nurses and the nurse 's aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients in fact robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways
 but i think when it comes to factory robots people are sort of afraid because factory robots are
 dangerous to be around
 in order to program them you have to understand six dimensional vectors and quaternions and ordinary people can 't interact with them and i think it 's the sort of technology that 's gone wrong it 's displaced the worker from the technology
 and i think we really have to look at technologies that ordinary workers can interact with and so i want to tell you today about baxter which we 've been talking about and baxter i see as a way a first wave of robot that ordinary
  people can interact with in an industrial setting so baxter is up here this is chris harbert from rethink robotics we 've got a conveyor there
 and if the lighting isn 't too extreme
 ah ah there it is it 's picked up the object off the conveyor it 's going to come bring it over here and put it down and
  go back reach for another object
 the interesting thing is baxter has some basic common sense by the way what what 's going on with the eyes the eyes are on the screen there the eyes look ahead where the robot 's going to move so 
 a person that 's interacting with the robot understands where it 's going to reach and isn 't surprised by its motions here chris took the the object out of its hand and baxter didn 't go and try to
  put it down it went back and realized it had to get another one it 's got a little bit of basic common sense goes and picks the objects and baxter 's safe to
  interact with you wouldn 't want to do this with a current industrial robot but with baxter it doesn 't hurt it feels the force
 understands that that chris is there and doesn 't push through him and hurt him but i think the most interesting thing about baxter is the user interface and so
 chris is going to come and grab the other arm now
 and when he grabs an arm it goes into zero force gravity compensated mode and
  graphics come up on the screen you can see some icons on the on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm he 's going to put something in its hand he 's going to bring it over here
 press a button and let let go of that thing
 in the hand and the robot figures out ah he must mean i want to put stuff down it puts a little icon there he
 comes over here and he
 gets the fingers to
  grasp together and the robot infers ah you want an object for me to pick up that puts the green icon there he 's going to
 map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from
 it just moves it around and
 the robot figures out that was an area search he didn 't have to select that from a menu and now he 's going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object while we continue talking
 so as we continue
  here i want to tell you about what this is like in factories these robots we 're shipping every day they go to factories around the country this is mildred mildred 's a factory worker in connecticut she 's worked on the line for over twenty years
 one hour after she saw her first industrial robot she had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory
 she decided she really liked robots and it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand now she 's got the
  robot doing it
 when we first went out to talk to people in factories about how we could get robots to interact with them better one of the questions we asked them was do you want your children to work in a factory the universal answer was no i want a better job than that for my children
 and as a result of that mildred is very typical of today 's factory workers in the u s they 're older and they 're getting older and older there aren 't
 many young people coming into factory work
  as their tasks become more onerous on them
 we need to give them tools that they can collaborate with so that they can be part of the solution so that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the u s and so
 our vision is that mildred who 's the line worker becomes mildred the robot trainer
  she lifts her game like the office workers of the one thousand nine hundred and eighty s lifted their game of what they could do
 we 're not giving them tools that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use they 're tools that they can just learn how
 to operate in a few minutes there 's two great forces that are
 both volitional but inevitable that 's climate change and demographics demographics is really going to change our world
 this is the percentage of adults who are working age and it 's gone down slightly over the last forty years but over the next
  years it 's going to change dramatically even in china the percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically and turned up the other way the people who are 
 retirement age goes up very very fast as the baby boomers get to retirement age
  that as we get older we get more frail and we can 't do all the tasks we used to do
 if we look at the statistics on the ages of caregivers before our eyes those caregivers are getting older
 and older that 's happening statistically right now
 and as the number of people who are older above retirement age and getting older as they increase there will be less people to take care of them and i think we 're really going to have to have robots
  to help us and i don 't mean robots in in terms of companions i mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves but get harder as we get older getting the groceries in from the car up the stairs into the kitchen
 or even as we get very much older driving our cars to go visit people and i think robotics
 gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older by having control
 of the robotic solution so they don 't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them and so i really think that that we 're going to
 be spending more time with robots like baxter and and working with robots like baxter in our daily
  and that we will
 here baxter it 's good and that we will all come to rely on robots over the next forty years as part of our everyday lives thanks very much
