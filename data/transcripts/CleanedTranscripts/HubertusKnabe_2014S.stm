  communist regime was moved away the berlin wall came down and one year later the german democratic republic
 the gdr in the east was unified with the federal republic of germany in the west
 to found today 's germany  
 among many other things germany inherited the archives of the east german secret police 
 known as the stasi  only two years after its dissolution
  to the public and historians such as me started
 to study these documents to learn more about
 how the gdr surveillance state functioned  
 perhaps you have watched the movie the lives of others this movie made the stasi known
  as we live in an age where words such as 
 surveillance or wiretapping are on the front pages of newspapers  
 i would like to speak about how the stasi really worked 
 at the beginning let 's have a short look
 at the history of the stasi because it 's really important for understanding its
  the russian communists founded the emergency commission for combating 
 and sabotage  shortly cheka it was led by felix 
 the cheka was an instrument of the communists to establish their regime by terrorizing the population and executing
  the cheka was the idol of the stasi officers they called 
 and even the emblem was very similar as you can see here  in fact the secret police of russia
 was the creator and instructor
  it immediately expanded there and soon it started to train the german communists to build up their own secret police 
 by the way  in this hall
 where we are now  the ruling party of the gdr was founded 
 five years later
  the stasi was established and step by step the dirty job of oppression was handed over to it 
 for instance the central jail for political prisoners which was established by the russians 
 was taken over by the stasi and used until the end of communism you see it here  
 at the beginning every important step took place
 place under the attendance of the russians  
 but the germans are known to be very effective so the stasi grew very quickly  and already 
 it had more employees than the gestapo had the secret police of nazi germany  the number doubled in each decade
  nine hundred and eighty nine more than ninety thousand employees worked for the stasi  this meant that one employee was responsible for one hundred and eighty
  inhabitants which was really unique in the world at
 the top of this tremendous apparatus there was one man erich mielke 
 he ruled the ministry of state security for more than thirty years 
 he was a scrupulous functionary in his past he killed two policemen
 not far away from here
 who in fact personalized
 the stasi  
 but what was so exceptional about the stasi  
 foremost it was its enormous power  because it united different functions in one organization 
 first of all the stasi was an intelligence service  it used all the imaginable instruments for getting information secretly
 such as informers or tapping phones as you can see it on the picture here  
 and it was not only active in east germany  but all over the world  
 secondly  the stasi was a secret police it could stop people on the street and arrest them in
  the stasi worked as a kind of public prosecutor  it had the right to open preliminary investigations
 and to interrogate people officially 
 last but not least  the stasi had its own armed forces 
 more than eleven thousand soldiers were serving in its so called guards regiment
  was founded to crash down protests and uprisings 
 due to this concentration of power  the stasi was called a state in the state 
 but let 's look in more and more detail
 at the tools of the stasi  please keep in mind that at that time the web and smartphones were not yet invented 
 of course  the stasi used all kinds of technical instruments to survey people
  telephones were wiretapped  including the phone of the german chancellor in the west and often also the apartments 
 every day ninety thousand letters were being opened by these machines  
 the stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people using specially trained agents and secret cameras to document every step one
 this picture you can see me as a young man just in front of this building
 where we are now  photographed by a stasi agent the stasi even collected the smell of people 
 it stored samples of it in closed jars which were found after the peaceful revolution 
 for all these tasks
  specialized departments were responsible 
 the one which was tapping phone calls was completely separated from the one which controlled the letters 
 for good reasons because if one agent quit the stasi  his knowledge was very small  contrast that
 with snowden for example  
 but the vertical specialization was also important to prevent all kinds of empathy with the object of observation 
 the agent who shadowed me
 didn 't know who i was or why i was surveyed in fact i smuggled forbidden books from west to east germany but
 what was even more typical for the stasi was the use of human intelligence people who reported
  secretly to the stasi  for the minister of state security these so called unofficial employees were the most important tools 
 on nearly two hundred thousand people collaborated constantly with the stasi  more than one percent
  the population 
 and in a way the minister was right  because technical instruments can only register what people are doing 
 but
 agents and spies can also report what people are planning to do
 and what they are thinking therefore the stasi recruited so many informants 
 the system of how to get them and how to educate them as it was called was
  very sophisticated  
 the stasi had its own university not far away from here  where the methods were explored and taught to the officers 
 this guideline
 gave a detailed description of every step you have to take if you want to convince human beings to betray their fellow citizens
  said that informants were pressured to becoming one but that 's mostly not true  because a forced informant is a bad informant 
 only someone who wants to give you the information you need
 is an effective whistleblower  the main reasons why people cooperated with the stasi were political political conviction
 and material benefits
 the officers also tried to create a personal bond between themselves and the informant 
 and to be honest  the example of the stasi shows
 that it 's not so difficult to win someone in order to betray others 
  he was the leader of the peaceful revolution and he nearly became the first freely elected prime minister of the gdr
 until it came out that he was an informant the net of spies was really broad 
  in nearly every institution even in the churches or in west germany  there were many of them 
 i remember telling a leading stasi officer if you had sent an informant to me  
 i would surely have recognized him his answer was we didn 't send anyone we took those who were around you 
 and in fact two of my best friends reported about me to the stasi
  not only in my case informers were very close for example  vera lengsfeld another leading dissident  in her case it was her husband who spied on her 
 a famous writer was betrayed by his brother 
 this reminds me of the novel
  the stasi collect all this information in its archives  the main purpose was to control the society 
 in nearly every speech the stasi minister gave the order to find out who is who which meant who thinks what 
 he didn 't want to wait until somebody tried to act against the regime he wanted to know in advance what people were thinking and
  planning 
 the east germans knew of course that they were surrounded by informers 
 in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust
 and a state of widespread fear the most important tools to oppress people in any dictatorship 
  why not many east germans tried to fight against the communist regime 
 if yes  the stasi often used a method which was really diabolic 
 it was called zersetzung and it 's described in another guideline 
 the word is difficult to translate because it means originally biodegradation 
 but actually it 's a quite accurate description
  the goal was to destroy secretly the 
  of people 
 for example by damaging their reputation 
 by organizing failures in their work  and by destroying their personal relationships  
 considering this east germany
  was a very modern dictatorship the
 stasi didn 't try to arrest every dissident  it preferred to paralyze them and it could do so
 because it had access to so much personal information and to so many institutions
 detaining someone was used only as a last resort 
 for this the stasi owned seventeen remand prisons one in every district
 here the stasi also developed quite modern methods
 of detention  normally the interrogation officer didn 't torture the prisoner  
 instead he used a sophisticated system of psychological pressure
 in which strict isolation was central nearly no prisoner resisted without
  giving a testimony 
 if you have the occasion do visit the former stasi prison in berlin and attend a guided tour with a former political prisoner
 who will explain to you how this worked one more question needs to be answered if the stasi were so well organized
 because these officers
 were kept busy during the peaceful revolution with only one thing to destroy the documents
 they had produced during decades  
 fortunately they had been stopped by human rights activists that 's why today we can use the files
 to get a better understanding of how a surveillance state
  a couple of questions because i have here der spiegel from last week
  neighbor  the spies and the informant from east germany so there is a direct link between these two stories or there isn 't 
 what 's your reaction as a historian when you see this hubertus knabe i think there are
 several aspects to mention at first  i think there 's a difference
 why you are collecting this data are you doing that for protecting your people against terrorist attacks
 doing that for
 oppressing your people so that makes a fundamental difference but on the other hand 
 also in a democracy  these instruments can be abused  and
 that is something where we really have to be aware to stop that and that also the intelligence services are respecting the rules we have
  we really can be happy that we live in a democracy  because you can be sure that russia and china are doing the same  
 but nobody speaks about that because nobody could do that 
 the story came out first  last july last
  did so because of the second point i mentioned that i think especially in a democracy  the rules are
 for everybody they are made for everybody so it 's not allowed that
 any institution doesn 't respect the rules in the criminal code of germany it 's written that it 's not allowed to tap somebody without the permission of the
 in the criminal code of germany  so if it 's not respected then
 i think an investigation is necessary  and it took a very long time that the public prosecutor of germany started this and he started it only in the case of angela merkel and not in the case of all the other people living in germany
  because of the story you told seen from the outside i live outside of germany and i expected the germans to react 
 much more strongly  immediately and instead  the reaction really came only when chancellor merkel was revealed as being wiretapped why so hk 
 i take it as a good sign because people feel
 secure in this democracy
  will be arrested and if you leave this hall after the conference 
 nobody has to be afraid that the secret police is standing out and is arresting you so that 's a good sign i think people are not really scared as they could be 
 but of course i think  
 the institutions
 are responsible to stop illegal actions in germany or wherever they happen bg a personal question
  and this is the last one  there has been a debate in germany about
 granting asylum to edward snowden would you be in favor or against hk oh 
 that 's a difficult question but if you ask me  and if i answer honestly i would give him the
 asylum because i think it was really brave what he did and he destroyed his whole life and his family and everything 
 so i think for these people we should do something
  and especially
 if you see the german history  where so many people had to escape and they asked for asylum in other countries and they didn 't get it so it would be a good sign to give him
