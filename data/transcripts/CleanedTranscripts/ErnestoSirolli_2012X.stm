  everything i do  and everything i do professionally my life
 has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in
  i look young but i 'm not 
 i worked in zambia kenya  
 ivory coast  algeria somalia 
 in projects of technical cooperation with african countries i worked for an italian ngo 
 and
 every single
  that we italians were good people and we were doing good work in africa  instead everything we touched
 we killed 
  ripples from the zambezi was a project where we italians
 decided to teach zambian people how to grow food  
 so we arrived there with italian seeds in southern zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley
 going
  going down to the zambezi river and we taught the local people how to grow italian tomatoes and zucchini and 
 and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that so we paid them to come and work and sometimes they would show up 
 and we were amazed that the local people in such a fertile valley would not have any agriculture
  but instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything we simply said thank god we
 just in the nick of time to save the zambian people from starvation 
 and of course 
 everything in africa grew beautifully we had these magnificent tomatoes in italy a tomato would grow to this size  in zambia to this size
  and we could not believe and we were telling the zambians look how easy agriculture is
  when the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red overnight some two hundred hippos came out from the river and they ate everything 
 and we said to the zambians 
 the hippos and the zambians said yes that 's why we have no agriculture here
 blundering around africa  but then i saw what the americans were doing what the english were doing what the french were doing  
 and after seeing what they were doing  i became quite proud of of our project in zambia  because you see at least we fed the hippos  
 you should
  you should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting african people you want to read the book read dead aid by dambisa moyo zambian woman economist 
 the book was published in two thousand and nine we western donor countries have given the african continent
  in the last fifty years 
 i 'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done 
 just go and read her book
 read it from an african woman the damage that we have done  
 we western people
 are imperialist colonialist missionaries  and there are only two ways we deal with people  we either patronize them
  or we are paternalistic  the two words come from the latin root pater which means father 
 but they mean two different things 
 paternalistic  i treat anybody from a different culture
 as if they were my children i love you so much 
  i treat everybody from another
 culture as if they were my servants that 's why the white people in africa are called bwana boss  
 i was given a slap in the face reading a book small is beautiful written by schumacher 
 who said  
 above all in economic development if people do not wish to be helped leave them alone this should
  be the first principle of aid the first principle of aid is respect 
 this morning  the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor and said can we can you imagine
 a city
 that is not neocolonial 
 i decided when i was
  to only respond to people and i invented a system
 called enterprise facilitation where you never initiate anything  you never motivate anybody 
 but you become a servant of the local passion  the servant of local people who have
  to become a better person so what you do
 you shut up  you never arrive in a community with any ideas  and you sit
 with the local people  
 we don 't work from offices  we meet at the cafe  we meet at the pub  we have zero infrastructure
  and what we do  we become friends  and we find out what that person wants to do 
 the most important thing is passion  
 you can give somebody an idea  if that person doesn 't want to do it  what are you going to do 
 the passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing the passion that that man has
 for his own personal growth is the most
  important thing  and then we help them to go and find the knowledge  because nobody in the world can succeed alone 
 the person with the idea may not have the knowledge  but the knowledge is available 
 so years and years ago  i had this idea why don 't we for once
  instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do why don 't for once listen to them 
 but not in community meetings  
 let me tell you a secret 
 there is a problem
 with community meetings entrepreneurs never come 
 and they never tell you in a public meeting  what they want to do with their own
  own money  what opportunity they have identified  so planning
 has this blind spot the smartest people in your community you don 't even know  because they don 't come to your public meetings 
  you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn 't exist you have to create a new profession 
 the profession is the family doctor of enterprise 
 the family doctor of business who sits with you in your house at your kitchen table at the
  and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living  i started this as a tryout in
 in esperance in western australia i was a doing  a ph d at the time 
 trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do 
 and so
 what i did in esperance that that first year was to just walk the streets and
 in in three days i had my first client and i helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage was a maori guy  
 and i helped him to sell to the restaurant in perth to get organized and then the fishermen came to me to say you the guy who helped maori can you help us and i 
  helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to
  cannery in albany for sixty cents a kilo  but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to japan for fifteen dollars a kilo  and the farmers came to talk to me said hey you helped them can you help us 
  projects going on and the government came to see me to say how can you
  we 've done it in three hundred communities around the world we have helped to start forty thousand businesses
 is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude  peter drucker one of the greatest management consultants
 in history  died age  ninety six a few years ago  
 peter drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business and this is what
  with an entrepreneurial society and economy planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship 
 so now you 're rebuilding christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy 
 you have to learn
 how to get these people to come and talk to you 
 you have to offer them confidentiality  privacy  you have to be fantastic at helping them  
 and then they will come and they will come in droves  
 in a community of ten thousand people we get two hundred clients can you imagine a community of four hundred thousand people the intelligence and the passion
 which presentation have you applauded the most this morning local passionate people that 's who you have applauded  
 so what i 'm saying is that
 entrepreneurship is where it 's at we are at the end of the first industrial revolution
  we have systems which are not sustainable  the internal combustion engine is not sustainable freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable what we have to look at is at how we
 feed  
 cure  educate transport  communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way  
 the technologies do not exist to do that
 who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution 
 universities  forget about it 
 government  forget about it it
 will be entrepreneurs and they 're doing it now there
 's a lovely story that i read
  in a futurist magazine many many years ago  there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of new york in one thousand eight hundred and sixty and in one thousand eight hundred
 and sixty this group of people came together and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of new york in one hundred years and the conclusion was unanimous the city of new york would not exist in one hundred years  
 why  because they looked at the curve and
  if the population keeps growing at this rate 
 to move the population of new york around they would have needed six million horses
 and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with they were
 already drowning in manure so one thousand 
 eight hundred and sixty they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of new york
 so what happens in forty years ' time in the year one thousand nine hundred 
 in the united states of america there were one thousand and one
 car manufacturing companies
 one thousand and one
 the idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over  and there were tiny
  tiny little factories in backwaters  dearborn michigan  henry ford  
 however there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs first you have to offer them
 confidentiality  otherwise they don 't come and talk to you then you have to
  passionate service to them  
 and then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship
  the smallest company  the biggest company has to be capable of doing three things beautifully  
 the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic  
 you have to have fantastic marketing  and you have to have tremendous financial management guess what
  we have never met a single human being in the world
 who can make it sell it and look after the money it doesn 't exist 
 this person has never been born we 've done the research  and we have looked at the one hundred iconic companies of the world
  all the new companies google yahoo there 's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common only one  
 none
 were started by one person now we teach entrepreneurship
 to 16 year olds in northumberland  
  and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of richard branson 's autobiography  and the task of the 
 to underline in the first two pages of richard branson 's autobiography how many times richard uses the word i 
 and how many times he uses the word we 
 never the word i and the word we thirty two times he wasn 't alone when he started 
 nobody started a company alone
  no one  so we can create the community
 where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes  in bars  and
 your dedicated buddies
 who will do to you what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic somebody who will say to you
 what do you need what can you do can you make it  okay can you sell it can you look after the money oh no i cannot do this would you like me to find you somebody 
 we activate communities we have groups of volunteers supporting the enterprise facilitator to help you to find resources and people
 and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change
 the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion the energy and imagination of your own people
