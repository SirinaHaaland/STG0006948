  i thought i 'd talk a little bit about how nature makes materials i brought along with me an abalone shell this abalone shell is a biocomposite material that 's ninety eight percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass
  it 's three thousand times tougher than its geological counterpart and a lot of people might use
 structures like abalone shells like chalk 
 i 've been fascinated by how nature makes materials and there 's a lot of secrets to how they do such an exquisite job part of it is that these materials are are macroscopic in structure 
  but they 're formed at the nano scale  they 're formed at the nano scale and they use
  something i think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non living structures like batteries and like solar cells what if they had some of the same capabilities 
 that an abalone shell did in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure  using nontoxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment  so that 's kind of the vision that
 that i 've been thinking about and so what if you could grow a battery in a petri dish or what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time and do so in an environmentally friendly way  
 and so going back to this abalone shell besides being nanostructured one thing that 's fascinating is when a male and female
  abalone get together  they pass on the genetic information that says this is how to build an exquisite
 material here 's how to do it at room temperature and pressure  using nontoxic materials same with diatoms which are shown right here which are glasseous structures  every time the diatoms replicate 
 they give the genetic information that says here 's how to build glass in the ocean that 's perfectly nanostructured and you can do it the same over and over again so what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery  i like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year old
  but anyone who 's who 's ever had or knows small children knows they 're incredibly complex organisms 
 if you wanted to convince them to do something they don 't want to do it 's very difficult so when we think about future technologies we actually think of
 using bacteria and viruses simple organisms can you convince them to work with a new toolbox
  so they can build a structure that will be
 important to me also when we think about future technologies we start with the beginning of of earth basically it took a billion years to have have life on earth and very rapidly 
 they became multi cellular they could replicate they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their their energy source  but it wasn 't until about five hundred million years ago during the cambrian geologic time period that organisms in the ocean started making
  it was during this time that there was increased calcium iron and silicon in the environment  and organisms learned how to make hard materials 
 so that 's what i would like to be able to do convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table  now if you look at at biology there 's many structures like dna antibodies proteins and ribosomes you 've heard about
  nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nano scale  what if we could harness them and convince them to not not be an antibody that that does something like hiv  what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us 
 here are some examples  natural shells  natural biological materials the abalone shell here if you fracture it you can look at the fact that it 's nanostructured there 's diatoms made out of sio2 and there are magnetotactic bacteria that make small
  used for navigation what all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nano scale  and they have a dna sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures  
 now  going back to the abalone shell the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins these proteins are very negatively charged
  can pull calcium out of the environment and put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate calcium and carbonate it has the chemical sequences of amino acids which says this is how to build the structure 
 here 's the dna sequence here 's the protein sequence in order to do it so an interesting idea is what if you could take any material you wanted or any element on the periodic table  and find its corresponding 
  dna sequence then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure  but not build an abalone shell build something that
  has never had the opportunity to work with yet  and so here 's the periodic table  i absolutely love the periodic table every year for the incoming
 freshman class at mit i have a periodic table made that says welcome to mit now you 're in your element 
 laughter and you flip it over and it 's the amino acids with the with the ph at which they have different charges and so
  i give this out to thousands of people and i know it says mit and this is caltech but i have a couple extra if people want it i was really fortunate to have
 president obama visit my lab this year on his visit to mit and i really wanted to give him a periodic table so i stayed up at night and talked to my husband how do i
 give president obama a periodic table what if he says ' oh i already have one ' or ' i 've already memorized it ' so
 he came to visit my
  lab and looked around it was a great visit and then afterward i said sir i want to give you the periodic table  in case you 're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight
  it out and said and people at mit they give out periodic tables 
 so so basically what i didn 't tell you is that about five hundred million years ago the organisms started making materials  but it took them about fifty million years to get good at it fifty million 
  years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell and that 's a hard sell to a graduate student i have this great project 
 a nontoxic virus called m13 bacteriophage whose job is to infect bacteria well it has a simple dna structure that you can go in and and cut and paste
 additional dna sequences into it and by doing that it allows the virus to express random protein sequences this is pretty easy biotechnology and you could basically do this a billion times
  have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical but they differ from each other based on their their tips on one sequence 
 that codes for one protein now if you take all billion viruses and put them in one drop of of liquid you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table  and through a process of selection 
  evolution you can pull one of a billion that does something you 'd like it to do like grow a battery or a solar cell basically viruses can 't replicate themselves they need a host once you find that one out of a billion
  infect it into a bacteria and make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence  the other thing that 's beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite
 structures with nice link scales these viruses are long and skinny  and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors
 or materials for batteries now
  battery that we grew in my lab we engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube the other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode 
  material for a battery  and then it wires itself to the current collector  and so through a process of selection evolution we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a 
 battery that 's all made at room temperature basically at the benchtop that battery went to the white house
  house for a press conference and i brought it here you can see it in this case
 that 's lighting this led now if we could scale this 
 you could actually use it to to run your prius which is kind of my dream to be able to drive a virus powered car
  basically you can you can
  pull one out of a billion and make lots of amplifications to it basically you make an amplification in the lab and then you get it to self assemble into a structure like a battery we
 're able to do this also with catalysis 
 this is the example of a photocatalytic splitting of water  and what we 've been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye absorbing molecules and line them up 
  on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna  and you get an energy transfer across the virus and then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material
 that can be used to split
 water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for for clean fuels i brought an example of that with me today my students promised me it would work these are 
 when you shine light on them you can see them bubbling in this case you 're seeing oxygen bubbles come out 
  by controlling the genes you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance the last example are solar cells you can also do this with solar cells we 've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide
 around them and use it as a
 way of getting electrons through the device  and what we 've found is through genetic engineering we can actually increase
 the efficiencies of these solar cells
 to
  numbers for these types of
 of dye sensitized systems and i brought one of those as well 
 that you can play around with outside afterward so this is a virus based solar cell through evolution and selection we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an eleven percent efficiency solar cell so i hope that i 've convinced you that
 that there 's a lot of great
 interesting things to be learned about how nature makes
  materials and about taking it the next step to see if you can you can force or take advantage of how nature makes materials to make things that that nature hasn 't yet dreamed of making thank you
