  that 's how we traveled in the year one thousand nine hundred  
 that 's an open buggy  it doesn 't have heating it doesn 't have air conditioning  that horse is pulling it along at one percent of the speed of sound  
 and the rutted dirt road
 turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains
  that 's a boeing seven hundred and seven only sixty years later  it travels at eighty percent of the speed of sound  and we don 't travel any faster today because commercial 
  supersonic air travel turned out to be a bust  so i started wondering and pondering could it be that the best years of american
  that leads to the suggestion maybe economic growth is almost over 
 some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial  
 there are four headwinds that are just hitting the american economy in the face they 're demographics education debt and inequality  
 they 're powerful enough
 to cut growth in half  so we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline
 and here 's my theme because of the headwinds if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last one hundred and fifty years growth is cut in half 
 if innovation is less powerful invents less great wonderful things then growth is going to be even lower than half of history 
 now here 's eight centuries of economic growth the vertical axis is just percent per year
  of growth zero percent a year one percent a year two percent a year 
 the white line is for the u k and then the u s takes over as the leading nation in the year one thousand nine hundred when the line switches to red you 'll notice that for the first four centuries there 's hardly any growth at all just zero point two percent 
 then growth gets better and better it maxes out in the 1930s
  and then it starts slowing down and here 's a cautionary note  that last downward notch in the red line is not actual data  that is a forecast that i 
  made six years ago that growth would slow down to one point three percent  but you know what the actual facts are you know what the growth in per person income has been in the united states in the last six years 
  what if i try to fit a curved line
 to this historical record 
 i can make the curved line end anywhere i wanted  
 but i decided i would end it at zero point two just like the u k growth for the first
 four centuries  now the history
 that we 've achieved is that we 've grown at two point zero percent per year
  to two thousand and seven  and remember it 's been a little bit negative since two thousand and seven  but if growth slows down  
 instead of doubling our standard of living every generation  americans in the future can 't expect
 to be twice as well off as their parents or even a quarter [ more well off than ] their parents 
 now we 're going to change and look at the level of per capita income the vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today 's prices
  notice that in one thousand eight hundred and ninety one over on the left we were at about five thousand dollars today we 're at about forty four thousand dollars of total output per member of the population  
 now what if we could achieve that historic two percent growth for the next seventy years well it 's a matter of arithmetic two percent growth quadruples your standard of living in seventy
  that means we 'd go from forty four thousand to one hundred and eighty thousand well we 're not going to do that 
 and the reason is the headwinds the first headwind is demographics  it 's a truism
 that your standard of living rises faster than productivity rises faster than output per hour 
 if hours per person increased and we got that gift back in the ' 70s and ' 80s when women entered the labor force but now it 's turned
  hours per person are shrinking first because of the retirement of the baby boomers  
 and second because there 's been a very significant dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution 
 the next headwind is education we 've got problems all over our educational system despite race to the top in college
  we 've got cost inflation in higher education that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care  
 we have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt and our college completion rate
 is fifteen points fifteen percentage points
 below canada  we have a lot of debt our
 economy grew from two thousand to two thousand and seven
 on the back of consumers massively
  overborrowing  
 consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons why our economic recovery is so sluggish today 
 and everybody of course knows that the federal government debt is growing as a share of gdp
 at a very rapid rate and the only way that 's going to stop is some combination of faster growth in taxes or slower
  in entitlements also called transfer payments 
 and that gets us down from the one point five where we 've reached for education down to one point three  and then we have inequality  
 over the fifteen years before the financial crisis 
 the growth rate of the bottom ninety nine percent of the income distribution was half a point slower than the averages we 've been talking about before all the rest went to the top one
  so that brings us down to zero point eight  and that zero point eight is the big challenge 
 are we going to grow at zero point eight if so that 's going to require that our inventions are as important as the ones that happened over the last one
 hundred and fifty years  so let 's see what some of those inventions were if you wanted to read in 
 at night you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp  they created pollution they created odors they were
  hard to control the light was dim  and they were a fire hazard by 
 electric light was everywhere  
 we had the vertical city  the invention of the elevator  
 central manhattan became possible  
 and then in addition to that at the same time hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools and
  electric tools all achieved by electricity electricity was also very helpful in liberating women 
 women back in the late 19th century  spent two days a week doing the laundry  they did it on a scrub board then they had to hang the clothes out to dry  then they had to bring them in the whole thing took two days
  and then we had the
 electric washing machine and by one thousand nine hundred and fifty  they were everywhere  but the women still had to shop every day  
 but no they didn 't because electricity brought us the electric refrigerator 
 back in the late 19th century the only source of heat in most homes was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating the bedrooms were cold
  in america before the motor vehicle transportation depended entirely on the urban horse  
 which dropped  without restraint twenty five to fifty pounds of manure
 on the streets every day together with a gallon of urine that comes
  out at five to ten tons
 daily per square mile in cities 
 those horses also ate up fully one quarter of american agricultural land that 's the percentage of american agricultural land it took
 to feed the horses of course  when the motor vehicle was invented and
  agricultural land could be used for human consumption or for export  and here 's an interesting ratio starting from zero in one thousand nine hundred only thirty years later  
 the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households in the united states reached ninety percent in just thirty years  
 back before the turn of the century
  women had another problem all the water for cooking cleaning and bathing
 had to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside it 's a historical fact that in one thousand eight hundred and eighty five the average north carolina housewife walked one hundred and forty eight miles a year carrying thirty five tons of water  
 but by 
 cities around the country had put in underground water pipes they had put in
 underground sewer pipes  
 and as a result one of the great scourges of the late 19th century  waterborne diseases like cholera  began to disappear  
 and an amazing fact
 for  techno optimists is that in the first half of the 20th century  the rate of improvement of life expectancy was three times faster
 than it was in the second half of the
 19th century  so it 's a truism that things can 't be more than one hundred percent of themselves 
 and i 'll just give you a few examples  we went from one percent to ninety percent of the speed of sound  electrification central heat 
 ownership of motor cars  they all went from zero to one hundred percent urban environments make people more productive than on the farm  we went from
  early postwar years  
 what about the electronic revolution here 's an early computer  it 's amazing the mainframe computer was invented in one thousand nine hundred and forty two 
 by one thousand nine hundred and sixty we had telephone bills bank statements were being produced by computers 
 the earliest cell phones the earliest personal computers were invented in
  gates dos atm machines to replace bank tellers bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector  
 fast forward through the ' 90s we had the dotcom revolution and a temporary rise in productivity growth but i 'm now going to give you an experiment 
 you have to choose either option a or option b 
 option a is you get to keep everything invented up till
  ten years ago so you get google you get amazon you get wikipedia  and you get running water and indoor toilets or you get everything invented to yesterday including facebook
 and your iphone but you have to give up go out to the outhouse and carry in the water  
 hurricane sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century  maybe for a couple of days in some cases for more than a week electricity running water heating
 gasoline for their cars  and a charge for their iphones 
 the problem we face is that all these great inventions 
 we have to match them in the future and my prediction that we 're not going to match them brings us down from the original two percent growth
 down to zero point two the fanciful curve that i drew you at the beginning so here we are back to the horse and buggy
  i 'd like to award an oscar
 to the inventors of the 20th century  
 the people from alexander graham bell to thomas edison to the wright brothers i 'd like to call them all up here  and they 're going to call back to you 
 your challenge is can you match what we achieved thank you
