  the beginning of any collaboration
 starts with a conversation and i would like to to share with you
 some of the bits of the conversation that we started with i grew up in a log cabin in washington state with too much time on my hands yves behar and in scenic switzerland for me
 i always had a passion for alternative vehicles this is a land yacht racing across the desert in nevada yb 
 combination of windsurfing and skiing
 into this this invention there fn and i also had an interest in dangerous inventions  this is 
 tesla coil that i built in my my bedroom
  much to the dismay of my mother yb to the dismay of my mother  this is dangerous teenage fashion right there fn 
 and i brought this all together this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across australia also the u s and japan yb 
 so wind power solar power we had a lot to talk about we had a lot that
 got
  so we decided to do
 a special project together to combine engineering and design
 and fn really make a fully integrated product something beautiful yb and we made a baby fn 
 can you bring out our baby 
 this baby is fully electric it goes one hundred and fifty miles an hour
  twice the range of any electric motorcycle really the exciting thing about a motorcycle is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design
  it 's got an amazing user experience it was wonderful working with yves behar he came up with our name and logo we 're mission motors and we 've only got
 three minutes but we could talk about it for hours
