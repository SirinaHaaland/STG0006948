  everyone 's familiar with cancer 
 but we don 't normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease the tasmanian devil has shown us that not only
 can cancer be a contagious disease  but it can also threaten an entire species with extinction  
 so first of all what is a tasmanian devil 
 many of you might be familiar with taz the cartoon character the one that spins around and around and around 
 but not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the tasmanian devil and it 's the world 's largest carnivorous marsupial a marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo
  the tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes 
 the tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger  and it uses its powerful jaws and its
 sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals [ the ]
 tasmanian devil is found only on the island of tasmania which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of australia  and despite their ferocious
 appearance tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals  
  growing up in tasmania it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a tasmanian devil in the wild  
 but the tasmanian devil population has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline  
 and in fact  there 's concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within twenty to thirty years 
 and the reason for that is the emergence of a new disease a contagious cancer
  the story begins in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here of a tasmanian devil with a large tumor on its face 
 at the time this was thought to be a one off animals  just like humans  sometimes get strange tumors  
 however we now believe that this is the first sighting
 of a new disease  which is now an epidemic spreading through tasmania
 the disease was first sighted in the northeast of tasmania 
 and has spread across tasmania like a huge wave now there 's only a small part of the population which remains unaffected 
 this disease appears first as tumors usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected tasmanian devils 
 these tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors
  such as these ones here  and the next image i 'm going to show is quite gruesome  but inevitably these tumors
 progress towards being enormous
  ulcerating tumors like this one here 
 this one in particular sticks in my mind because this is the first case of this disease that i saw myself 
 and i remember the horror of seeing this little female devil with this huge ulcerating
  foul smelling tumor inside her mouth that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw 
 she hadn 't eaten for days 
 her guts were swimming with parasitic worms  her body was riddled with secondary tumors and yet she was feeding three little baby tasmanian devils in her pouch 
 of course they died along with the mother  they were too young to survive without their
 in fact in the area where she comes from more than ninety percent of the tasmanian devil population has already died of this disease  
 scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer this infectious cancer that was spreading through the tasmanian devil population
  and our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women which is spread by a virus  and to the aids epidemic
 which is associated with a number of different types of cancer  all the evidence suggested that this devil cancer was spread by a virus  
 however  we now know and i 'll tell you right now that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus in fact  the infectious agent of disease in this 
 cancer is something altogether more sinister and something that we hadn 't really thought of before
 but in order for me to explain what that is i need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself 
 cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year 
 one in three people in this room will develop cancer at some stage in their lives 
 i myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when i was only fourteen 
 cancer occurs
  when a single cell in your body acquires a set of random mutations in important genes that cause that cell to start to produce more and more and more and more copies of itself  
 paradoxically once established  natural selection actually favors the continued growth of cancer  
 natural selection is survival of the fittest  and when you have a population of
  cells if one of them acquires new mutations which allow them to grow more quickly acquire nutrients more successfully invade the body 
 they 'll be selected for by evolution 
 that 's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat  
 it evolves  throw a drug at it and resistant cells will grow back 
 an amazing fact is that given the right
 and the right nutrients a cancer cell has the potential to go on growing forever  
 however cancer is constrained by living inside our bodies and its continued growth its spreading through our bodies and eating away at our tissues  
 leads to the death
 of the cancer patient
  and also to the death of the cancer itself  so cancer could be thought of as a strange
  life form an evolutionary dead end  
 but that is where the tasmanian devil cancer has acquired an absolutely amazing evolutionary adaptation 
 and the answer came from
 studying the tasmanian devil cancer 's dna this was work from many people but i 'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that i did a few years ago the
 next slide is going to be gruesome  
 this is jonas  he 's
 a tasmanian devil that we found with a large tumor on his face  
 and being a geneticist i 'm always interested to look at dna and mutations 
 so i took this opportunity to collect some samples from jonas ' tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body
 i took these back to the lab  i extracted dna from them  
 and when i looked at the sequence of the dna and compared the sequence of jonas ' tumor to that of the rest of his body 
 i discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile 
 in fact jonas and his tumor
 were as different from each other
 as you and the person sitting next to you
  what this told us was that jonas ' tumor did not arise from cells of his own body in fact more genetic profiling told us that this tumor
 in jonas actually probably first arose from the cells of a female tasmanian devil and jonas was clearly a male  
 so how come a tumor that that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on jonas ' face
 well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of tasmanian devil cancers from all around tasmania  
 we found that all of these cancers shared the same dna 
 think about that for a minute that means that all of these cancers actually are the same cancer that arose once from one individual devil 
 that have broken free of that first devil 's body and spread through the entire tasmanian
  devil population  
 but how can a cancer spread in a population  well the final piece of the puzzle came when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild 
 they tend to bite each other often quite ferociously and usually on the face  
 we think
 that cancer cells actually come off the tumor get into the saliva when the devil bites another devil it actually physically implants living
  cancer cells into the next devil so the tumor continues to grow so
 this tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer it 's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it it spreads through the population has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system 
 and it 's the only cancer that we know of that 's threatening an entire species with extinction
  but if this can happen in tasmanian devils why hasn 't it happened in other animals or even humans  well the answer is it has 
 this is kimbo he 's a dog that belongs to a family in mombasa in kenya  
 last year his owner noticed some blood trickling from his genital region  
 she took him to the vet and the vet discovered something quite disgusting  and if you
  're squeamish please look away now he discovered this a huge bleeding tumor at the base of kimbo 's penis 
 the vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs  
 and just as the tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells  so is this dog cancer
 but this dog cancer is quite remarkable  because it spread all around the world and in fact  these same cells that are affecting kimbo here
 are also found affecting dogs in new york city in mountain villages in the himalayas and in outback australia  
 we also believe this cancer might be very old in fact genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years
  old which means that this cancer may have first arisen
 from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the neanderthals this cancer is remarkable it 's the
 oldest mammalian derived life form that we know of it 's a living relic of the distant past 
 so we 've seen that this can happen in animals  could cancers be
  contagious between people well this is a question which fascinated chester southam a cancer doctor in the 
  he decided to put this to the test by actually deliberately inoculating people with cancer from somebody else  and this is a
  injecting cancer into a volunteer who in this case was an inmate in ohio state penitentiary  
 most of the people that dr southam injected did not go on to develop cancer from the injected cells  
 but a small number of them did and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill whose immune systems were probably compromised 
 what this tells us
  ethical issues aside is that it
 's probably extremely rare for cancers to be transferred between people 
 however  under some circumstances it can happen 
 and i think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future
  so just finally cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide
 and to adapt to their environments  
 but that does not mean that we should give up hope in the fight against cancer 
 in fact i believe given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer 's growth we can defeat cancer
  my personal aim is to defeat the tasmanian devil cancer  
 let 's prevent the tasmanian devil from being the first animal to go extinct from cancer
