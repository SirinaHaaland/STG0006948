  the kraken a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales  and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island 
 in assessing the merits of such
  's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor 's saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins once upon a time and a sea story begins this ain 't no shit 
 every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale  nevertheless there are giants in the ocean and we now have video 
  proof as those of you that saw the discovery channel documentary are no doubt aware 
  expedition that took place last summer off japan i 'm the short one 
 the other two are dr tsunemi kubodera and dr steve o 'shea 
 i owe my participation in this now historic event to ted in two
 thousand and ten there was a ted event called mission blue held aboard the lindblad explorer in the galapagos as part of the fulfillment of sylvia earle 's ted wish 
 i spoke about a
  new way of exploring the ocean one that focuses on
 attracting animals instead of scaring them away  
 mike degruy was also invited  and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean and he also talked to me about applying my approach to something he 's been involved with for a very long time  which is the hunt for the giant squid 
 it was mike that got me invited to the squid summit
 a gathering of squid experts at the discovery channel that summer during shark week 
 i gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which i emphasized the importance of using quiet  unobtrusive platforms for
  this came out of hundreds of dives i have made  farting around in the dark
 using these platforms and my impression that i saw more animals working from the submersible than i did with either of the  remote operated vehicles 
 but that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view but i also felt like i saw more animals working with the tiburon than the ventana two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems so my suspicion was
  that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make so i set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean and i had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made
 the johnson sea link which you can probably just barely hear here  uses electric thrusters very very quiet  the tiburon also uses
  these days use hydraulics and they sound like the ventana i think that 's got to be
 scaring a lot of animals away  
 so for the deep sea squid hunt i proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform
 with
  and the only illumination coming from red light that 's invisible to most deep sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue that 's visible to our eye  but it 's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea 
 so this camera platform which we called the medusa could just be thrown off the back of the ship 
 attached to a float at the surface with over two thousand feet of line it would just
  float around passively carried by the currents  and the only light visible to the animals in the deep
 would be the blue light of the optical lure which we called the electronic jellyfish or e jelly 
 because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish atolla 
 now this
  pinwheel of light that the atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense 
 the reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish but it 's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it 's being chewed on by a predator
 and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a
  larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape it 's a scream for help a  last ditch attempt for escape  and a common form of defense in the deep sea 
 the approach worked  
 whereas
 all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of
  it was like it was teasing us doing a kind of fan dance now you see me now you don 't and we had four
  and then on the fifth it came in and totally wowed us
  what really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it which i think it mistook for the predator on the e jelly 
 but even more incredible was the footage shot from the triton submersible 
 what was not mentioned in the discovery documentary was that the bait squid that
 had a light attached to it a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use  and i think it was this light that brought the giant in 
 now  what you 're seeing is
 the intensified camera 's view under red light and that 's all dr kubodera could see when the giant comes in here
  and then he got so excited 
 he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better  
 and the giant didn 't run away  so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible  bringing a creature of legend
 from the misty
 history into high resolution video it was absolutely breathtaking  and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended  it would have been as tall as a
 how could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now 
 we 've only explored about five percent of our ocean there are great discoveries yet to be made down there  
 fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can 't even yet imagine
 yet we have spent only a tiny fraction
 of the money on ocean exploration that we 've spent on space exploration we need a nasa like organization for ocean exploration
  because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on earth  we need
