  sat sri akal  greetings to all of you from pakistan  it is often said that we fear that which we do not know and pakistan in this
  very similar because it has provoked and does provoke a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many
 a western soul
 especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens of turbulence and turmoil 
 but there are many other dimensions to pakistan  and what follows is a stream of images a series of images captured by some of pakistan 's most dynamic and young photographers 
 that aims to give you an alternative glimpse a look inside the hearts and minds of some ordinary
  pakistani citizens  here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you 
 my name is abdul khan i come from peshawar 
 i hope that you will be able to see not just my taliban like beard but also the richness and color of my perceptions aspirations and dreams as rich and colorful as the satchels that i sell 
 my name is meher and this is my friend irim i hope to become a vet when i grow
  up so that i can take care of stray cats and dogs who wander around the streets of the village that i live near gilgit northern pakistan  
 my name is kailash and i like to enrich lives through technicolored glass 
 madame would you like some of those orange bangles with the pink polka dots 
  an internally displaced person from swat do you see me on the other side of this fence do i matter  or really exist for you 
 my name is iman i am a fashion model an up and coming model from lahore 
 do you see me simply smothered in cloth  or can you move beyond my veil and see me for who i truly am inside
  my name is ahmed i am an afghan refugee from the khyber agency i have come from a place of intense darkness and that is why i want to illuminate the world 
 my name is papusay my heart and drum beat as one 
 if religion is the opium of the masses then for me music is my one and only ganja 
 a rising tide lifts all boats and the rising tide of india 's spectacular
  economic growth has lifted over four hundred million
 indians into a buoyant middle class but there are still over six hundred and fifty million indians pakistanis sri lankans bangladeshis nepalese who remain washed up on the shores of poverty  
 therefore as india and pakistan as you and i it behooves us to transcend our differences to celebrate our diversity
 to leverage our common humanity 
 our collective vision at naya jeevan which for many of you as you all recognize means new life in urdu and hindi is to rejuvenate the lives of millions 
  of low income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care 
  urban working poor 
 why should we do this as indians and pakistanis we are but two threads cut from the same cloth 
 and if our fates are intertwined 
 then we believe that it is good karma it is good fortune and for many of us our fortunes do indeed lie at the bottom of the pyramid  thank you
