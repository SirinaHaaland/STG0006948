  growing up in taiwan
 as the daughter of a calligrapher  
 one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty the shape and the form of chinese characters 
 ever since then i was fascinated by this incredible language
  but to an outsider  it seems to be as impenetrable as the great wall of china  
 over the past few years  i 've been wondering if i can break down this wall so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so 
 i started thinking about how a new fast method of learning chinese might be useful 
  of five i started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence  
 i learned new characters every day during the course of the next fifteen years  
 since we only have five minutes it 's better that we have a fast and simpler way 
 a chinese scholar would understand twenty thousand characters you only need one thousand to understand
 the basic literacy  the top two hundred will allow you to comprehend forty percent of basic literature
 enough to read road signs  restaurant menus to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers  
 today i 'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works you are ready  
 open your mouth as
  wide as possible until it 's square you get a mouth  this is a person
 going for a walk person 
 if the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides as if she was yelling frantically
  originally from the shape of the flame but i like to think that way  whichever works for you this is a tree tree  
 this is a mountain  
 the sun 
  symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west 
 i call these eight characters radicals 
 they are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters 
 a person if someone walks behind that
  company  three is a crowd 
 if a person stretched their arms wide this person is saying it was this big 
 the person inside the mouth  the person is trapped  he 's a prisoner  just like jonah inside the whale  
 one tree is a tree  two trees together  we have the woods  three trees together
  we create the forest  
 put a plank underneath the tree  we have the foundation  put a mouth on the top of the tree that 's idiot 
 easy to remember since a talking tree is pretty idiotic
  remember fire two
  i get really hot  three fires together  that 's a lot of flames  set the fire underneath the two trees it 's burning 
 for us  the sun is the source of prosperity  two suns together  prosperous  three together  that 's sparkles  
 put the sun and the moon shining together  it 's brightness  it also means tomorrow after a day and a night  
 the sun is coming up above the horizon sunrise
  a door  put a plank inside the door it 's a door bolt  
 put a mouth inside the door  asking questions knock knock is anyone home 
 this person is sneaking out of a door  escaping  evading 
 on the left we have a woman two women together  they have an argument
  be careful it 's adultery 
 so we have gone through almost thirty characters  
 by using this method the first eight radicals will allow you to build thirty two the next group of eight characters will build an extra  thirty two 
 so with very little effort you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters which is the same as a chinese
  so after we know the characters we start building phrases for example  the mountain and the fire together  we have fire mountain  it 's a volcano 
 we know japan is the land of the rising sun this is a sun placed with the origin because japan lies to the east of china  
 so a sun 
  we build japan a person behind japan what do we get a
 japanese person  
 the character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other 
 in ancient china  that means in exile  because chinese emperors  they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains  
 nowadays exile has turned into
  getting out a mouth which tells you where to get out
 is an exit  this is a slide to remind me that i should stop talking and get off of the stage  thank you
