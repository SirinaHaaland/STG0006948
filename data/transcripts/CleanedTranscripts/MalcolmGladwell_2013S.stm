  so i wanted to tell a story that that really obsessed me when i was writing my new book and
 it 's a story of something that happened three thousand years ago when the kingdom of israel was in its
  it takes place in an area called the shephelah
 in what is now israel  and the reason the story obsessed me is that i thought i understood it and then
 i went back over it and i realized that i didn 't understand it at all ancient palestine had a
 along its eastern border  there 's a mountain range still same is true of israel today and in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities of that region
  and then there 's a coastal plain along the mediterranean where tel aviv is now 
 and connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the shephelah  
 which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west 
 and you can follow the shephelah go through the shephelah to get from the
 coastal plain to the mountains and the shephelah if you 've been to israel you 'll know it 's just about the most beautiful part of israel it 's gorgeous with
 forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards 
 but more importantly though in the history of that region  it 's served it 's had a a real strategic function 
 and that is it is the means by which hostile armies on the coastal plain find their way get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains 
 and three thousand years ago that 's exactly what
  happens  the philistines who are the the
 biggest of enemies of the kingdom of israel are living in the coastal plain they 're originally from crete they 're a seafaring people 
 and they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the shephelah up into the mountains because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by bethlehem and split the kingdom of israel in two 
 and the kingdom of israel
  is headed by king saul 
 obviously catches wind of this and saul brings his army down from the mountains and he confronts the philistines in the valley of elah 
 one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the shephelah  
 and the israelites dig in along the northern ridge  and
 the philistines dig in along the southern ridge  and the two armies just sit there for weeks and stare at each other because they 're deadlocked
  attack the other because to attack the other side you 've got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side and you 're completely exposed  
 so finally to break the deadlock the philistines send their mightiest warrior
 down into the valley floor and he calls out and he says to the israelites send your mightiest warrior down and we 'll
  have this out just the two of us this was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat  it was a way of settling disputes without
 incurring the bloodshed of a major battle  
 and the philistine who is sent down their mighty warrior is a giant  he 's six foot nine  
 he 's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor 
 and he 's got a sword and he 's got a javelin and he 's got his spear he is absolutely terrifying 
 and he 's so terrifying
 that none of the israelite soldiers want to fight him  it 's a death wish right there 's no way they think they can take him  
 and finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy  
 and he goes up to saul and he says i 'll fight him and saul says you can 't fight him that 's ridiculous you 're this kid this is this mighty
  't understand i have been defending my flock against
 lions and wolves for years i think i can do it 
 and saul has no choice he 's got no one else who 's come forward  so he says all right 
 and then he turns to the kid and he says but you 've got to wear this armor  you can 't go as you are so he tries to give the shepherd his armor  and the shepherd says
 meaning i 've never worn armor before you 've got to be crazy so he reaches down instead on the ground and picks up five stones and puts them in his shepherd 's bag
 and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant  
 and the giant sees this figure approaching and calls out come to me so i can feed your flesh to the
 to the birds of the heavens and the and the beasts of the field
  kind of taunt towards this person coming to fight him  
 and the shepherd draws closer and closer 
 and the giant sees that he 's carrying a staff that 's all he 's carrying instead of a weapon just this shepherd 's staff  and he says
 he 's insulted am i a dog that you would come to me with sticks 
 and the shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket  puts it in his
  sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes right here in his most vulnerable spot and he falls down
 either dead or unconscious  and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword
 and cuts off his head and the philistines see this and they turn and they just run and of course the name of the
 giant is goliath and
  the name of the shepherd boy is david and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that
 everything i thought i knew about that story turned out to be wrong  
 so david in that story is supposed to be the underdog right in fact that term david and goliath has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone
 far stronger  now why do we call david an underdog  
 well we call him an underdog because he 's a kid a
 little kid  and goliath is this big strong giant we also call him an underdog because
 goliath is an experienced warrior  and david is just a shepherd  but most importantly we call him an
  's that goliath is outfitted with all of this modern weaponry  this glittering coat of armor and a sword and a javelin and a spear  and all david has is this sling well 
 let 's start there with the phrase all david has is this sling because that 's the first mistake that we make 
 in ancient warfare there are three kinds of warriors  there 's cavalry  men on horseback and
  chariots  
 there 's heavy infantry  
 which are foot soldiers armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor 
 and there 's artillery and artillery are archers but more importantly  slingers 
 and a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it and they
 put a projectile either a rock or a lead ball  inside the pouch 
 and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go and the effect is to send the projectile forward
 towards its target 
 that 's what david has and it 's important to understand that that sling is not a slingshot  it 's not this right it 's not a child 's toy  it 's in fact an
  when david rolls it around like this  he 's turning the sling around probably at six or seven revolutions per second  and that means that 
 when the rock is released  it 's going forward really fast probably thirty five meters per second that 's substantially faster than
 a baseball thrown by even the finest
  more than that 
 the stones in the valley of elah were not normal rocks they were barium sulphate which are rocks twice the density of normal stones if you do the calculations on the 
  ballistics on the stopping power of the rock fired from david 's sling it 's roughly equal to the stopping power of a
  historical records that slingers experienced slingers could hit
 and maim or or even kill a target at distances of up to two hundred yards 
 from medieval tapestries we know that slingers were capable of hitting birds in flight they were incredibly accurate
  when david lines up and he 's not two hundred yards away from goliath he 's quite close to goliath
  he lines up and fires that thing at goliath
 he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes  
 if you go back over the history of ancient warfare you will find time and time again that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle
 goliath  he 's heavy infantry  and his expectation
 when he challenges the israelites to a duel is that he 's going to be fighting another heavy 
  he says come to me that i might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field the key phrase is come to me come up to me because we 're going to fight hand to hand like this 
 saul has the same expectation
 david says i want to fight goliath and saul tries to give him his armor because saul is thinking oh when you say ' fight goliath ' you mean ' fight him in hand to hand combat ' infantry on infantry 
 but david has absolutely no expectation  he 's not going to fight him that way why would he he 's a shepherd  he 's spent his entire career using a sling to defend his flock against lions and
  wolves that 's where his strength lies  
 so here he is this shepherd experienced in the use of a devastating weapon up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor 
 and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short range combat 
  so why do we keep calling david an underdog  and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable there
 's a second piece of this that 's important it 's not just that we
 misunderstand david and his choice of weaponry  it 's also that we profoundly misunderstand goliath 
 goliath is not what he seems to be 
 there 's all kinds of hints of this in the biblical text
 are in retrospect quite puzzling and don 't square with his image as this mighty warrior  so to begin with the bible says that
 goliath is led onto the valley floor by an attendant  now that
 is weird  right here is this mighty warrior challenging the israelites to one on one
  why is he being led by the hand by some
 young boy presumably to the point of combat  secondly the bible story
 makes special note of how slowly goliath moves 
 another odd thing to say when you 're describing the mightiest warrior known to man at that point  
 and then there 's this whole weird thing about how long it takes goliath
 to react to the to the sight of david so
  's coming down the mountain and he 's clearly not preparing for hand to hand combat  there is nothing about him that says i am about to fight you
 like this he 's not even carrying a sword why does goliath not react to that it 's as if he 's oblivious
 to what 's going on that day  and then there 's that strange comment he makes to david am i a dog that you should come
  to me with sticks sticks david only has one stick well
 it turns out that there 's been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about
 whether there is something fundamentally wrong with goliath an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies
  been many articles written the first one was in one thousand nine hundred and sixty in the indiana
 medical journal  and it started a chain of speculation that starts with an explanation for goliath 's height  
 so goliath is head and shoulders above all of his peers in that era  and usually when someone is that
 far out of the norm  there 's an explanation for it so the most common form of giantism
 is a condition called acromegaly  and acromegaly is caused by a benign
  tumor on your
 pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone
  and throughout history many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly  so the tallest person of all time was a guy named robert wadlow
 who was still growing when he died at the age of twenty four and he was eight foot eleven  
 he had acromegaly do you remember the wrestler andr the giant famous
  he had acromegaly  there 's even speculation that abraham lincoln had acromegaly  anyone who 's unusually tall that 's the first
 explanation we come up with and acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it principally having to do with
 vision the pituitary
  as it grows  often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain with the result that people with acromegaly have either
 double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted
  so when people have started to speculate about what might have been wrong with goliath they 've said wait a minute  he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly
  and that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day
  why does he move so slowly and have to be escorted down into the valley floor by an attendant  because he can 't make his way on his own
  why is he so strangely oblivious to david that he doesn 't understand that david 's not going to fight him until the very last moment  because he can 't see him
  come to me that i might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field the phrase come to me is a hint
 also of his vulnerability come to me because i can 't see you  
 and then there 's am i a dog that you should come to me with sticks he sees two sticks
 when david has only one so the israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this
 extraordinarily powerful foe 
 what they didn 't understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness  
 and there is i think in that a very important lesson for all of us  
 giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem  and sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket
