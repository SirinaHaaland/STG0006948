  what 's happening in genomics and how this revolution
 is about to change everything we know about the world life ourselves  and how we how we think
  if you saw two thousand and one a space odyssey and you heard the boom boom boom boom  and you saw the monolith you know that was arthur c clarke 's
 representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species in this case it was
 picking up bones and creating a tool using it as a tool which meant that apes just sort of running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things
 if they
  used a tool  and that moved us to the next level and you know we in the last
 thirty years in particular have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools and we 've seen many seminal moments we 've seen the creation of small computers
  and who would have thought back then that every single person would not have just one computer but probably twenty in your home and in not just your p c but in every device in your washing machine 
 your cell phone you 're walking around 
 your car has twelve microprocessors then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together we flatten the world we 've seen so much change and we 've given ourselves these tools now
  these high powered tools that are are allowing us to turn the lens inward into something that is common to all of us  and that is a genome 
 how 's your genome today have you thought about it lately heard about it at least you
 probably hear about genomes these days  i thought i 'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is
  like if you ask people well what is a megabyte or megabit and what is broadband people never want to say  i really don 't understand so i will tell you right off of the bat you 've heard of dna you probably studied a little bit in
 biology a
 genome is really a description for all of the dna that is in a living organism and one thing
 that is common to all of life is dna
 doesn 't matter whether you 're a yeast it doesn 't matter whether you 're a mouse doesn 't matter whether you 're a fly
  we all have dna the dna is organized in words  call them 
 genes and chromosomes  and when watson and crick in the ' 50s first decoded this
  double helix that we know as
 the
 dna molecule very long complicated molecule
 we then started on this journey to understand that inside of that dna is a language that determines the characteristics our traits what we inherit what diseases we may get 
 we 've also along the way
 discovered that
 this is a very old molecule that all of the dna in your body has been around
 forever  since the beginning of us of us as creatures there is a historical archive 
 living in your genome is the history of our species 
 and you as an individual human being where you 're from 
 going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years and that 's now starting to be understood
  but also the genome is really the instruction manual  it is the program  
 it is the code of life  it is what makes you function it is what makes
 every organism function 
 dna is a very elegant molecule  it 's long and it 's complicated really all you have to know about it is that there 's four letters a t
 c g they represent the name of a chemical and with these four letters  you can create a language a language that can describe anything  and very complicated things 
 you know they are generally put together in pairs
  creating a word or what we call base pairs  and you
  when you think about it four letters  or the representation of four things makes us work  
 and that may not sound very intuitive but let me flip over to something else you know about and that 's computers look at this screen here
 and you know you see pictures and you see words but really all there are are ones and zeros
  the language of technology is binary you 've probably heard that at some point in time  everything that
  happens in digital is converted or a representation of a one and a zero so when you 're listening to
 itunes and your favorite music that 's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly when you 're seeing these pictures  it 's all ones and zeros and when you 're talking on your telephone 
 your cell phone and it 's going over the network your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and
  magically whizzed around and look at all the complex things and wonderful things we 've been able to create with just a one and a zero well now you ramp that up to four and you have a lot of complexity
 a lot of ways to describe
 mechanisms  so let 's talk about what that means so if you look at a human
  they consist of three point two billion of these base pairs 
 that 's a lot and they mix up in all different fashions and that makes you a human being
  if you convert that to binary just to give you a little bit of sizing we 're actually smaller than the program microsoft office
  it 's not really all that much data  i will also tell you we 're at least as buggy
  this here is a bug in my genome
 that i have struggled with for a long long time  when you get sick  it is
 a bug in your genome  in fact many many diseases we have struggled with for for a long
  we haven 't been able to cure because we just don 't understand how it works at the genomic level  we are starting to understand that so up to this point we tried to fix it by using what i call shit against the wall pharmacology  which means
 well let 's just throw chemicals at it and maybe it 's going to make it work 
 but if you really understand why does a cell go from normal
 cell to cancer  what is the code what are the exact
  instructions that are making it do that then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out 
 so for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine here 's a few factoids for you we actually have about twenty four thousand genes that do things we have about a hundred one hundred and twenty thousand others
 that don 't appear to function every day but represent this archival
  history of how we used to work as a species going back tens of thousands of years  you might also be interested in knowing that a mouse has about the same amount 
  of genes they recently sequenced pinot noir and it also has about thirty thousand genes
 now look around 
 just look next to your neighbor look forward look backward we all look pretty different a lot of very handsome and pretty people here skinny chubby different races cultures 
  we are all ninety nine point nine % genetically equal  
 that 's a tiny amount of material but the way that ultimately expresses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species  so  
 we are now able to read genomes the first human genome took
 ten years three billion dollars it was done by
  craig venter and then james watson 's one of the
  of dna
 genome was done for two million dollars and in just two months and if you think about the computer industry and how we 've gone from big computers to little ones and how they get more powerful and faster
 all the time the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes for about five thousand dollars in about an hour or
  see that happen in the next five years  and what that means is you are going to walk around with your own personal genome on a smart card 
 it will be here 
 and when you buy medicine  you won 't be buying a drug that 's used for everybody you will give your genome to the pharmacist and your drug will be made for you 
  and it will work much better than the ones that were you won 't have side effects all those side effects you know
  oily residue and you know  whatever they say in those commercials  forget about that they 're going to make all that stuff go away
  what does a genome look like 
 well there it is it is a long long series of these base pairs  if you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this but what scientists are doing now is they 're understanding
  these do and what they mean  because what nature is doing is double clicking all the time  
 in other words  the first couple of sentences here  assuming this is a
 grape plant make a root 
 make a branch create a blossom in a human being down in here it could be make blood cells 
 start cancer
 for me it may be 
 every calorie you consume you conserve because i come from a very cold climate for my wife eat three times as much and you never put on any 
  weight  it 's all hidden in this code and it 's starting to be understood at breakneck pace 
 what can we do with genomes now that we can read them now that we 're starting to have the book of life well there 's many things some are exciting some people will find very 
  scary i will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me but that 's okay 
  functionality this is really important we can understand for example why we create plaque in our arteries
  what creates the starchiness inside of a grain  why does yeast
 metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide we can also look at at a grander scale what creates problems what creates disease 
 and how we may be able
  to fix them  because we can understand this we can fix them make better organisms most importantly what we 're learning is that nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox 
 the toolbox exists 
 an architect far better better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox and we now
  now have the ability to use it 
 we are now not just reading genomes  we are writing them this company synthetic genomics i 'm involved with created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug a very primitive creature called mycoplasma genitalium if
 you have a uti you 've probably or ever had a uti you
 you 've come in contact with this little bug very simple only has about two hundred
  we were able to
 completely synthesize that genome 
 now you have the genome and you say to yourself so if i plug this synthetic genome if i pull the old one out and plug it in
 does it just boot up and live well guess what it does 
 not only does it do that if you took the genome
 that synthetic genome and you plugged it into a different critter
 like yeast you now turn that yeast into mycoplasma it 's sort of like booting up a pc with
 a mac o s software well actually you could do it the other way so you know
 by being able to write a genome and plug it into an organism  the software if you will changes the hardware  
 and this is extremely
 profound  so  
 last year the french and italians announced they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced pinot noir the genomic sequence now exists for the entire pinot noir organism and
 they identified once again about twenty nine thousand genes  they have discovered pathways that
 create flavors 
 although it 's very important to understand that those compounds that it 's cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome in our tongue for us to understand and interpret those flavors  they 've also discovered that there 's a heck of a lot of
 activity going on producing aroma as well  
 they 've identified areas of vulnerability to disease they now are understanding and the work is going on 
 exactly how this plant works and we have the capability to know to read
  that entire code and understand how it ticks so then what do you do 
 knowing that we can read it knowing that we can write it change it maybe write its genome from scratch 
 so what do you do  well  one thing you could do is what some people might call franken noir 
 we can build a better vine by the way just so you know you
  get stressed out about genetically modified organisms there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified they 're not grown from seeds they 're grafted into root stock 
 they would not exist in nature on their own  so  don 't worry about don 't stress about that stuff we 've been doing this forever so we could you know  focus on disease
  we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it or costs  we could conceivably expand the climate window we could make pinot noir grow
 maybe in long island god forbid 
 we could produce better flavors flavors and aromas you want a little more raspberry a little more chocolate here or there 
 all of these things could conceivably be done and i will tell you i 'd pretty much bet
  that it will be done  but there 's an ecosystem here  in other words  we 're not sort of unique little organisms running around  we are part of a big ecosystem  in fact
 i 'm sorry to inform you that inside of your digestive tract is about ten pounds of microbes which you 're circulating through your body quite a bit 
 our ocean 's teaming with microbes in fact
 when craig venter
  venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet
 by discovering all new microbes in the first twenty feet of water we now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate and regulating co2 and oxygen than plants do which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere 
 we find microbial life in every part of the planet in ice
  coal in rocks in
 volcanic vents it 's an amazing thing 
 but we 've also discovered when it comes to plants in plants as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes  it is the ecosystem 
  around them it is the microbes that live in their root systems that have just as much impact on the character of
  those plants as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves  if you take a closer look at a root system you will find there are many many many 
  diverse microbial colonies this is not big news to viticulturists they have been you know 
  you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in 
 you don 't necessarily know with granularity exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and and what characteristics 
 we can start to figure that out we all talk about terroir we worship terroir we say  wow is
  my terroir great it 's so special i 've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn 't believe well you know we really 
 we argue and debate about it we say it 's climate it 's soil it 's this well guess what we can figure out what the heck terroir is it 's in there waiting to be sequenced there 
  are thousands of microbes there  they 're easy to sequence unlike a human they you know have a thousand two thousand genes
  we can figure out what they are all we have to do is go around and sample
 dig into the ground find those bugs  sequence them  correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don 't like that 's just a big database and then fertilize 
 and then we understand what is terroir 
 so some people will say oh my god are we playing god are we now if we engineer
  you know people would always ask james watson he 's not always the most politically correct guy 
 and they would say 
 are you know are you playing god and he had the best answer i ever heard to this question 
 well somebody has to 
 i consider myself a very spiritual
  the organized religion part and i will tell you i don 't believe there 's anything unnatural
  i don 't believe that chemicals are unnatural  i told you i 'm going to make some of you puke
 it 's very simple we don 't invent molecules compounds  they 're here  they 're in the universe we reorganize things we change them around  
 but we don 't make anything unnatural
  we can create bad impacts we can poison ourselves we can poison the earth
 but that 's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made
  so  what 's happening today is nature is presenting us with a toolbox  and we find that this toolbox is very extensive there are microbes out there that actually 
  make gasoline believe it or not there are microbes you know go back to yeast these are chemical factories the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by nature and
  we now can use those 
 there also is a set of rules nature will not allow you to we could engineer a grape plant but guess what we can 't make the grape plant produce babies 
 nature has put a set of rules out there
  we can work within the rules we can 't break the rules we 're just learning what the rules are i just ask the
  if you could cure all disease if you could make disease go away  because we understand how it actually works  
 if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious healthy plants that grow in in very hard to grow environments
  if we could create clean and plentiful energy we right in the labs at synthetic genomics have single celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide
 and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline
  carbon dioxide the stuff we want to get rid of not sugar not anything carbon dioxide a little bit of sunlight  you end up with a
 lipid that
 is highly refined we could solve our energy problems  we can reduce co2 we could clean up our oceans we could make better wine  if we
  you know i think the answer is very simple working with nature  working with this tool set that we now understand 
 is the next step in humankind 's evolution and all i can tell you is stay healthy for twenty years  if you can stay healthy for twenty years you 'll see one hundred and fifty maybe three hundred
