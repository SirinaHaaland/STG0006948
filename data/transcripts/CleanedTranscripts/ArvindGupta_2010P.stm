  it was a very revolutionary time it was a political ferment so to say students out in the streets of paris revolting against authority
  america was jolted by the
 the civil rights movement in india we had the
 naxalite movement  the [ unclear ] movement but you know when there is a political churning of society it unleashes a lot of energy 
 the national movement of india
 was testimony to that lots of people resigned from
  one of the great programs in india was to revitalize primary science in village schools there was a person anil sadgopal did a ph d from caltech
 and returned back as a molecular biologist in india 's cutting edge research institute  the 
  he was not able to relate the kind of [ unclear ] research which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people so he designed and went and started a village science program
 many people were inspired by this  the slogan of the early ' 70s was go to the people 
 live with them  love them  start from what they know build on what they have 
 this was kind of the defining slogan 
 well i took one year i joined telco made tata trucks  pretty close to pune i worked there for two years and i
 i realized that i was not born to make trucks  
 often one doesn 't know what one wants to do but it 's good enough to know what you don 't want to do  so i took one year off  and i went to this village science program 
 and it was a turning point  it was a very small village
 a weekly bazaar where people just
 once in a week they put in all the vats  so i said i 'm going to spend a year over here so i just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside 
 and one thing which i found was this black rubber  this is called
  a cycle valve tube  
 when you pump in air in a bicycle you use a bit of this and some of these models so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube you can put two matchsticks inside this and you make a flexible joint  
 it 's a joint of tubes you start by teaching angles an acute angle a right angle an obtuse angle a straight angle  it 's like its own little coupling  if you have three of them  and you loop them together  well you make a triangle with four you make a square you make a pentagon
 you make a hexagon  you make all these kind of polygons  
 and they have some wonderful properties if you look at the hexagon for instance it 's like an amoeba which is constantly changing its own profile  you can just pull this out this becomes a rectangle you give it a push this becomes a parallelogram 
  but this is very shaky  look at the pentagon for instance  pull this out it becomes a boat shape trapezium
  very square and prim give it a little push this becomes a rhombus it becomes kite shaped but give a child a triangle  he can 't do a thing to it 
 why use triangles because triangles are the only rigid structures  
 we can 't make a bridge with squares because the train would come  it would start doing a jig  ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in india
  not have gone to engineering college but no one makes a roof placed like this because if they put tiles on top
 it 's just going to crash  they always make a triangular roof  now this is people science and if you were to just poke
 a hole over here and put a third matchstick you 'll get a t joint  and if i were to poke all the three legs of this in the three vertices
  and once you make these you make a little house  
 put this on top you can make a joint of four you can make a joint of six you just need a ton now this was you make a joint of six you make an
  put four marbles inside you simulate the molecular structure of methane
  well since then i just thought that i 've been really privileged to
 go to over two thousand schools in my country village schools  government schools  municipal schools  ivy league schools i 've been invited by most of them and
 every time i go to a school i see a gleam in the eyes of the children i see hope  i see happiness in their faces children want to make things children want to do things
 we make lots and lots of pumps  now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon  
 it 's a real pump you could actually pop the balloon  
 and we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it so all you do is
 it 's a very kind of provocative statement this old bicycle tube and
  this filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube and this is how you make a valve you put a little sticky tape
  this is one way traffic
 well we make lots and lots of pumps  and this is the other one that you just take a straw  and you just put a stick inside and you make two half cuts now this is what you do is you bend both these legs into a triangle  and you
 just wrap some tape around  and this is the pump and
  now if you have this pump  it 's like a great great sprinkler it 's like a centrifuge
 if you spin something it tends to fly out 
 well in terms of if you were in andhra pradesh you would make this with the palmyra leaf many of our folk toys have great science principles  if
  it tends to fly out if i do it with both hands you can see this fun mr flying man 
 right  
 this is a toy which
 is made from paper it 's amazing there are four pictures you see insects you see frogs  snakes  eagles  butterflies frogs  snakes  eagles 
 here 's a paper which you could [ unclear ] designed by
  documented by martin gardner in many of his many books but this is great fun for children 
 they all study about the food chain the insects are eaten by the frogs the frogs are eaten by the snakes the snakes are eaten by the eagles  
 and this can be if you had a whole photocopy paper a4 size paper
 you could be in a municipal school you could be in a government school
 a paper a scale and a pencil no glue no scissors in
  three minutes you just fold this up 
 and what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination  if you take a smaller paper you make a smaller flexagon 
 with a bigger one you make a bigger one  
 now this is a
 pencil with a few slots over here and you put a little fan here  and this is a hundred year old toy there have been six major research papers on this
  there 's some grooves over here you can see  and if i take a reed if i rub this  something very amazing happens six major research papers on
  this as a matter of fact feynman as a child was very fascinated by this  he wrote a paper on this  and you don 't need the three billion dollar hadron collider for doing this 
 applause this is there for every child 
 and every child can enjoy this
 if you want to put
 a colored disk well all these seven colors coalesce  and this is what newton
 newton talked about four hundred years back that white light 's made of seven colors just by spinning this around
  this is a straw  
 what we 've done we 've just sealed both the ends with tape  nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner so there 's holes in the opposite corners there 's a little hole over here  this is a kind of a blowing straw i just put this inside this there 's
 a hole here  and i shut this and
  this costs very little money to make great fun for children to do 
 what we do is make a very simple electric motor  now this is the simplest motor on earth 
 the most expensive thing is the battery inside this  if you have a battery it costs five cents to make it 
 this is an old bicycle tube which gives you a broad rubber band two safety pins this is a permanent
  whenever current flows through the coil this becomes an electromagnet it 's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin we
 made thirty thousand teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years they just muck up the definition and they spit it out  
 when teachers make it children make it you can see a gleam in their eye
  get a thrill of what science is all about  and this science is not a rich man 's game in a democratic country
  must reach to our most oppressed to the most marginalized children 
 this program started with sixteen schools and spread to one thousand five hundred government schools 
 over one hundred thousand children learn science this way  and we 're just trying to see possibilities  look this is the tetrapak awful materials from the point of view of the
  are fused together so you can 't separate them now you can just make a little network like this and fold them and stick them together and make an icosahedron  
 so something which is trash which is choking all the seabirds
  you could just recycle this into a very very joyous all the platonic solids can be made with things like this  
 this is
 a little straw  and what you do is
  you just nip two corners here and this becomes like a baby crocodile 's mouth you put this in your mouth and you blow 
 children 's delight a teacher 's envy as they say you 're not able to see how the sound is produced  because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth  i 'm going to keep this
  muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations the other is that you keep blowing at it keep making the sound  and you keep cutting it and something very very nice happens
  what the kids teach you you
 can also do this 
 well before i go any further  
 this is something worth sharing  this is a touching slate meant for blind children this is strips of velcro  this is my drawing slate  and this is my drawing pen 
 which is basically a film box  it 's basically like a
  like a
 fisherman 's line a fishing line  and this is wool over here if i crank the handle all the wool goes inside and
 what a blind child can do is to just draw this  wool sticks on velcro  
 there are twelve million blind children
 come as a great boon to them 
 there 's a factory out there making our children blind  not able to provide them with food not able to provide them with vitamin a 
 but this has come as a great boon for them there are no patents  anyone can make it 
 this is very very simple  you can see this is the generator  it 's a crank generator these are two magnets  this is a large pulley
 made by sandwiching rubber between
  two old cds small pulley  and two strong magnets  and this fiber turns a wire attached to an led if i spin this pulley the small one 's going to spin much faster there will be a spinning magnetic field
  you can do is just  if you give it a twirl  well they just keep going on 
 and imagine a
 bunch of kids standing in a in a circle and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on and they 'd be absolutely joyous playing with this
  well in the end what we can also do we use a lot of old newspapers to make
 caps  this is worthy of sachin tendulkar it 's a great cricket cap when first
 you see nehru and gandhi  this is the the nehru cap just half a newspaper we make lots of toys with newspapers and this is one of them  and this is
 you can see this is
  this is a flapping bird all of our old newspapers we cut them into little squares  
 and if you have one of these birds children in japan have been making this bird for many many years  and
 you can see this is a little
 fantail bird  well in the end  i 'll just end with a story  this is called the captain 's hat story the captain was a captain of a
  wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance and i 'll provide you with good food and drinks and the captain would wear a cap everyday and join in the regalia  the first day it was a huge umbrella cap like a captain 's cap
 that night  when the passengers would be sleeping he would give it one more fold  and the second day  he would be wearing a fireman 's cap with a little shoot just like a designer cap  because it protects the spinal cord
  and the second second night he would take the same cap and give it another fold  and the third day it would be a shikari cap just like an
 adventurer 's cap 
 and the third night  he would give it two more folds and this is a very very famous cap  if you 've seen any of our bollywood films  
 this is what the policeman wears it 's called a zapalu cap
  and we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship  so that 's a ship and now the
 end everyone was enjoying the journey very much they were singing and dancing suddenly there was a storm
 and huge waves  and all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves a huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down  and another
  and knocks it down  and the ship sinks  and the captain has lost everything but for a life jacket
