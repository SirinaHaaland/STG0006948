  love theater i love the idea that you can transform become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective 
 i love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and
 listen the idea that in
  that room at that moment  everyone  
 regardless of their age their gender their race their color their religion  comes together at
 that moment we transcend space and time together 
 theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination 
 and our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers our ability to imagine makes us
  inventors and creators and unique  
 i was commissioned in two thousand and three to create an original show  and began developing upwake 
 upwake tells the story of zero a modern day business man going to work with his life in a suitcase 
 stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two 
 i wanted upwake to have the same audiovisual qualities
  as a movie would  and i wanted to let my imagination run wild so i began drawing the story that was moving in my head  
 if antoine de 
  saint exupery the author of the little prince were here he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you
 was inside 
 because if you look closely enough things will begin to appear 
 this is not a box these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life 
 in upwake buildings wear suits  zero tap dances on a giant keyboard  clones himself with a scanner tames and whips the computer mice  sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper
 and launches into space
  i wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist go from one world to another in a second 
 i wanted to have humor  beauty  simplicity and complexity
 and use metaphors to suggest ideas at the beginning of the show for example zero deejays dream and reality technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition 
  on stage so today i would like to talk to you about the relationship
 between theater
 and technology let 's start with technology 
 all right let 's start with theater
  all
  all the four surfaces of the stage
 which i interact with 
 the use of animation and projection was a process of discovery i didn 't use it as a special effect but as a partner on stage  
 there are no special effects in upwake no artifice it 's as lavish and intricate
 as it is simple and minimal three hundred and
 forty four frames four and a half years and commissions later  
 what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists  and here are some excerpts
  moon
  new show that we 're now beginning to tour and in
 austin texas  i was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon when i arrived at one of the schools i certainly did not expect this
  six hundred kids packed in a gymnasium waiting  i was a little nervous performing without animation costume really and make up 
 but the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn 't seen the kids that attentive and i think the reason why is that i was able to use their language and their reality
 in order to transport them into another something happened along the way zero became a person
  not just a character in a play zero does not speak 
 is neither man nor woman zero is zero a little hero of the 21st century  
 and zero can touch so many more people than i possibly could  
 it 's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box 
 as a street performer  i have learned that everybody wants to connect and that usually  if you 're a bit extraordinary
  you 're not exactly of human appearance then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud  
 it 's as though you made something resonate within them it 's as though the mystery of the person they 're interacting with and connecting
 allows them to be themselves just a bit more  because through your mask they let theirs go being
  is an art form i know theater can improve the quality of people 's lives and i know theater can heal i 've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years i have seen sick kids and sad parents
 and doctors be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy  i know theater unites us 
 zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow tell various stories through different
  quantum physics video games  and zero wants to go to the moon in two thousand and seven zero launched a green campaign suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity
 every sunday from seven  fifty three to eight zero p m the idea is simple basic it 's not original 
 but it 's important  and it 's important to participate
  there is a revolution  it 's a human and technological revolution  it 's
  and emotion it 's information 
 it 's visual  it 's musical  it 's sensorial  it 's conceptual it 's universal it 's beyond words and numbers  it 's happening 
 the natural progression of science and art finding each other to better touch and define the human experience  
 there is a revolution in the way that we think in the way that we share and the way that we express our stories 
 our evolution 
 this is a time of
  communication  connection and creative collaboration charlie chaplin
 innovated motion pictures and told stories through music silence humor
 and poetry  he was social  and his character the tramp spoke to millions  he gave entertainment
  and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most
