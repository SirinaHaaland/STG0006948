  your company launches a search for an open position the applications start rolling in and the qualified candidates are identified 
 now the choosing begins
  all the right stuff 
 person b  state school  
 fair amount of job hopping  and odd jobs like cashier and singing waitress 
 but remember both are qualified 
 so i ask you who are you going to pick 
 my colleagues and
  i created very official terms to describe two distinct categories of candidates 
 we call a the silver spoon the one who clearly had advantages and was destined for success 
 and we call b the scrapper the one who had to fight against tremendous odds to get to the same point
  you just heard a human resources director refer to people as silver spoons and scrappers which
 is not exactly politically correct and sounds a bit judgmental  but
 before my human resources certification gets revoked let me explain a resume tells
  and over the years i 've learned something about people whose experiences read like a patchwork quilt that makes me stop
 and fully consider them before tossing their resumes away 
 a series of odd jobs may indicate inconsistency  lack of focus  unpredictability or
 it may signal a committed struggle against obstacles at the very least the scrapper
 deserves an interview 
 to be clear  i don 't hold anything against the silver spoon  
 getting into and graduating from an elite university takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice  
 but if your whole life has been engineered toward success  how will you handle the tough
  one person i hired felt that because he attended an elite university there were certain assignments that were beneath him 
 like temporarily doing manual labor to better understand an operation  
 eventually  he quit  
 but
 on the flip side  what happens when your whole life is destined for failure
  i want to urge you to interview the scrapper  
 i know a lot about this because i am a scrapper  
 before i was born my father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia 
 and he couldn 't hold a job in spite of his brilliance  
 our lives were one part cuckoo
  i 'm the fourth of five children raised by a single mother in a rough neighborhood in brooklyn new york  
 we never owned a home a car a washing machine  and for most of my childhood  we didn 't even have a telephone 
 so i was highly motivated to understand the relationship between
 business success and
  scrappers because my life could easily have turned out very differently 
 as i met successful business people and read profiles of high powered leaders  i noticed some commonality 
 many of them had experienced early hardships anywhere from
  death of a parent while young to learning disabilities alcoholism and violence 
 the conventional thinking has been that trauma leads to distress  and there 's been a lot of focus on the resulting dysfunction  
 but during studies of dysfunction  data revealed an unexpected insight 
 that even the worst circumstances can result in growth and transformation 
 a remarkable and
  phenomenon has been discovered which scientists call post traumatic growth  
 in one study designed to measure the effects of adversity on children at risk  among a subset of six hundred and ninety eight children
 who experienced the most severe and extreme
  grew up to lead healthy successful and productive lives in spite of everything and against tremendous odds they succeeded
 take this resume this guy 's parents give him up for adoption he never finishes college 
 he job hops quite a bit
  goes on a sojourn to india for a year  and to top it off he has dyslexia  would you hire this guy 
 his name is steve jobs 
 in a study of the world 's most highly successful entrepreneurs it turns out a disproportionate number have dyslexia  
 in the us thirty five percent of the entrepreneurs studied had dyslexia  what 's remarkable
 among
  those entrepreneurs who experience post traumatic growth they now view their learning disability
 as a desirable difficulty which provided them an advantage because they became better listeners and paid greater attention to detail 
 they don 't think they are who they are in spite of adversity they know they are
  who they are because of adversity 
 they embrace their trauma and hardships as key elements of who they 've become and know that without those experiences they might not have developed the 
  muscle and grit required to become successful 
 at age thirteen his parents were relocated to the countryside the schools were closed
 and he was left alone in beijing to fend for himself until sixteen when he got a job in a clothing factory  
 but instead of accepting his fate he made a resolution that he would continue his formal education
  eleven years later when the political landscape changed  he heard about a highly selective university admissions test  
 he had three months to learn the entire curriculum
 of middle and high school  so every day he came home from the factory  took a nap  
  went back to work and repeated this cycle every day for three months  
 he did it he succeeded  
 his commitment to his education was unwavering and he never lost hope  
 today  he holds a master 's degree  and his daughters each have degrees from cornell and harvard 
 scrappers are propelled by the belief that the only person you have
  control over is yourself  
 when things don 't turn out well scrappers ask what can i do differently to create a better result 
 scrappers have a sense of purpose that prevents them from giving up on themselves  kind of like if you 've survived poverty a crazy
  and that reminds me humor scrappers know that humor gets you through the tough times and laughter helps you change your perspective  
 and finally there are relationships people who overcome adversity don 't do it alone 
 somewhere along the way they find
  people who bring out the best in them and who are invested in their success  
 having someone you can count on no matter what is essential to overcoming adversity 
 i was lucky  
 in my first job after college  i didn 't have a car  so i carpooled across two bridges with a woman who was the president 's assistant 
 she watched me work and
  encouraged me to focus on my future and not dwell on my past  
 along the way i 've met many people who 've provided me
 brutally honest feedback advice and mentorship  these people don 't mind that i once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for
  i 'll leave you with one final valuable insight  
 companies that are committed to diversity and inclusive practices tend to support scrappers and outperform their peers  
 according to 
 a study of their top fifty companies for diversity outperformed the s & p five
  back to my original question who are you going to bet on silver spoon or scrapper  i say
 choose the underestimated contender whose secret weapons are passion and purpose hire the scrapper
