  because this is my first time at ted  i 've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit  
 yes that
 's right this is barbie she 's fifty years old and she 's looking as young as ever 
 but i 'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face 
 this is fulla fulla is the arab world 's answer to barbie 
 now according to proponents of the clash of civilizations 
 barbie and fulla occupy these completely separate spheres they have different interests they have divergent values and should they ever come in contact
 've got to tell you it 's just not going to be pretty 
 my experience however in the islamic world is very different where i work in the arab region people are busy taking up western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally western nor are they traditionally islamic 
 i want to show you two examples 
 the first
  and it 's a new arab tv channel
  has been dubbed islamic mtv 
 its creator who is an egyptian tv producer called ahmed abu haba wants young people to be inspired by islam to lead better lives 
 he reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos
  was set up as an alternative to existing arab music channels and they look something like this 
 music that by the way is haifa wehbe she 's a lebanese pop star and 
  girl in the world of 4shbab it 's not about bump and grind but it 's not about fire and
  its videos are intended to show a kinder gentler face of islam for young people to deal with life 's challenges  
 now my second example is for a slightly younger crowd and it 's called the ninety nine 
 now these are the world 's first islamic superheroes 
 they were created by a kuwaiti psychologist called naif al mutawa and his desire is to rescue islam from
  the characters are meant to embody the ninety nine attributes of allah  justice  wisdom mercy among others 
 so for example there is the character of noora she is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone  
 another character called jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions
  now the ninety nine is not just a comic book it 's now a theme park there is an animated series in the works and by this time next year the likes of superman and wonder woman will 
  have joined forces with the ninety nine to beat injustice wherever they find it 
 the ninety nine and 4shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of islamic
 're not talking here about a clash of civilizations  nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash  
 i like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined
