  last year when i was here i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole 
 and while that swim took place three years ago i can remember it as if it was yesterday 
 i remember standing on the edge of the ice about to dive into the water 
 and thinking to myself i have never
 ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening the water is completely black  
 the water is minus one point seven degrees centigrade or twenty nine degrees fahrenheit 
 it 's flipping freezing in that water 
 and then a thought came across my mind if things
  on this swim how long will it take for my frozen body
 to sink the four and a half kilometers
 to the bottom of the ocean  and then i said to myself i 've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible 
 and the only way i can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer
 is by listening to my ipod and really revving myself up listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to puff daddy  
 and then committing myself a hundred percent
 there is nothing more powerful than the made up mind
 and then walking up to the edge of the ice
 and just diving into the water 
 and that swim took me eighteen minutes and fifty seconds and it felt like eighteen days  
 and i remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers 
 and my fingers were literally the size of sausages
 because
  partially of water when water freezes it expands and so the cells in my fingers
 had frozen and expanded and burst 
 and the most immediate thought when i came out of that water was the following  
 i 'm never ever going to do another cold water swim
 in my life again
  i heard about the himalayas and the melting of the and the melting
 of the glaciers because of climate change i heard about this lake 
 lake imja this lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier the glacier 's gone all the way up the mountain
 and left in its place this big lake  and i firmly believe that what we 're seeing in the himalayas is the next great big battleground on this
 nearly two billion people so one in three people on this earth rely on the water from the himalayas and with a population increasing as quickly as it is 
 and with the water supply from these glaciers because of climate change decreasing so much  i think we have a real risk of instability north
  decided to walk up to mt everest  the highest mountain on this earth and go and do a symbolic swim
 underneath the summit
 of mt everest  
 now i don 't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to mt everest but it 's quite an ordeal getting up there twenty eight great big powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain i don 't just have my speedo but there 's a big film
  crew who then send all the images around the world 
 the other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude  i wanted to do the swim at five thousand three hundred meters above sea level so it 's right up in the heavens it 's very very difficult to breath you get altitude sickness 
 i feels like you 've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time 
 that 's not the worst part of it the worst part was this year
  was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on mt everest  
 many many people have died on mt everest and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers
 and then bring them down the mountain and when you 're walking up the mountain to attempt
 to do something which no human has ever done
  in fact no fish
 there are no fish up there swimming at five thousand three hundred meters when you 're trying to do that and then the bodies are coming past you
 it humbles you and you also realize very very clearly that nature
 is so much more powerful than we are  
 and we walked up this pathway 
 all the way up and to the right hand side of us was this great khumbu glacier and all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice 
  then we got up to this
 small lake underneath the summit of mt everest  
 and i prepared myself the same way as i 've always prepared myself for this swim which was going to be so very difficult 
 i put on my ipod i listened to some music i got myself as aggressive as possible but controlled aggression
 and then i hurled myself
  i swam as quickly as i could for the first hundred meters  
 and then i realized very very quickly  i had a huge problem on my hands i could barely breathe  i was gasping for air  i then began to choke  
 and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water and it all happened so quickly  
 i then i don 't know how it happened but i went underwater and luckily the water was quite shallow  and i was able to
  push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air  and then i said  carry on carry on carry on i carried on for another five or six strokes  
 and then i had nothing in my body  
 and i went down to the bottom of the lake  and i don 't where i got it from but i was able to somehow pull myself up
 and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake
  heard it said
 that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have i have never ever heard such utter bollocks 
 it is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have 
 i got myself to the side of the lake my crew grabbed me  and then we walked as quickly as we could
 down over the rubble down to our
  camp  and there we sat down and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong
 there on mt everest 
 and my team just gave it to me straight  they said lewis you need to have a radical tactical shift
 if you want to do this swim every single thing which you have learned
  years of swimming you must forget  every single thing which you learned
 when you were serving in the british army about speed and aggression you put that to one side 
 we want you to walk up the hill in another two days ' time take some time to rest and think about things we want you to walk up the mountain in two days ' time  and instead of swimming fast 
 swim as slowly as
  instead of swimming crawl 
 swim breaststroke  
 and remember never ever swim with aggression this is the time to swim with real humility  and so we walked back up
 to the mountain two days later  and i stood there on the edge
 of the lake  and i looked up at mt everest and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth and i said to
  just do this slowly and i swam across the lake  
 and i can 't begin to tell you how good i felt when i came to the other side but i learned two very very important lessons there 
  on mt everest and i thank my team of sherpas who taught me this the first one is
  before i do anything i ask myself what type of mindset do i require to successfully complete a task 
 and taking that into the world of climate change which is frankly the mt  everest of all problems
 just because we 've lived the way we have lived for so long just because we have consumed the way we have for so long
  and populated the earth the way we have for so long  
 doesn 't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on 
 the warning signs are all there when i was born the world 's population was three point five billion people 
 we 're now six point eight billion people and we 're expected to be nine billion people by two thousand and fifty  
 and then the second lesson the radical tactical shift  and i 've come here to ask you today 
 what radical tactical
  shift
 can you take in your relationship to the environment which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world
 and a secure world 
 and most importantly in a sustainable world and i ask you please to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make which will make that big difference and then
  commit a hundred percent to doing it  
 blog about it tweet about it talk about it and commit a hundred percent because very very few things
 are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it so thank you very very much
