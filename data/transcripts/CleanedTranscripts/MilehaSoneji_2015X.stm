  in india we have these huge families i bet a lot of you all must have heard about it 
 which means that there are a lot of family events  so as a child  my parents used to drag me to these family
  but the one thing that i always looked forward to
 was playing around with my cousins 
 and there was always this one uncle who used to be there always ready jumping around with us  having games for us  making us kids have the time of our lives 
 this man was extremely successful  he was confident and powerful  
 but then i saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health  
 he was diagnosed with parkinson
 parkinson 's is a disease that causes degeneration of the nervous system  
 which means that this person who used to be independent suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee because of tremors much more difficult 
 my uncle started using a walker to walk and to take a turn he literally had to take one step at a time like this and it took forever
  so this person who used to be the center of attention in every family gathering was suddenly hiding behind people 
 he was hiding from the pitiful look in people 's eyes  and he 's not the only one in the world 
 every year  sixty thousand people are newly diagnosed with parkinson
  and this number is only rising 
 as designers we dream that our designs solve these multifaceted problems one solution that solves it all 
 but it need not always be like that 
 you can also target simple problems and create small solutions for them and eventually make a big impact  so my aim here was to not
  but to make their everyday tasks much more simple and then make an impact 
 well the first thing i targeted was tremors right  
 my uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public just out of embarrassment  
 so  well i designed the no spill cup 
 it works just purely on its form the curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors
 and this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup  
 but the key here is that it is not tagged as a parkinson 's patient product 
 it looks like a cup that could be used by you me any clumsy person 
 and that makes it much more comforting for them to use to blend in 
 so well one
  many more to go 
 all this while i was interviewing him  questioning him  
 and then i realized that i was getting very superficial information or just answers to my questions  
 but i really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective  
 so i thought  well  let 's observe him in his daily tasks while he 's eating while he 's watching tv  
 and then when i was actually observing him walking to his dining table it struck me
  this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land how does he climb a staircase 
 because in india we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase like in the developed countries one actually has to climb the stairs  
 so he told me well  let me show you how i do it let 's take a look at what
  so he took really long to reach this position  and then all this while i 'm thinking oh my god is he really going to do it is he really really going to do it without his walker and then 
 and the turns he took them so
  i was too  
 so this person who could not walk on flat land was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs 
 on researching this i realized that it 's because it 's a continuous motion
 there 's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms and uses a walker  but the moment he 's put on a cycle all his symptoms vanish because it is a
  continuous motion  so the key for me was to translate this feeling of walking on a staircase back to flat land 
 and a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him  but the one that finally worked was this one let 's take a look
  i call this the staircase illusion  and
 actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended he froze  
 and this is called freezing of gait  so it happens a lot so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms making them feel much more confident 
  technology is not always it
 what we need are human centered solutions  i could have easily made it into a projection or a google glass  or something like that but i stuck to simple print on the floor 
 this print could be taken into hospitals to make them feel much more welcome 
 what i wish to do is make every parkinson 's patient feel like my uncle felt that day he told me
  that i made him feel like his old self again 
 smart in today 's world has become synonymous to high tech  
 and the world is only getting smarter and smarter day by day  but why can 't smart be something that 's simple and yet effective 
 all we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity to go out there observe  but let 's not stop at that
 let 's find these complex problems don 't be scared of them  
 break them boil them down into much smaller problems and then find simple solutions for them  
 test these solutions   fail if needed  but with newer insights to make it better  
 imagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions  what would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions
  let 's make a smarter world but with simplicity
