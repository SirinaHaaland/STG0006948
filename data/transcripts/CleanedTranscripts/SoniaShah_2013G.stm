  over the long course of human history 
 the infectious disease that 's killed more humans than any other is malaria it
 's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos and it 's probably our oldest scourge we may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes
  and to this day malaria takes a huge toll on our species we 've got three hundred million cases a year
 and over half a million deaths 
 now this really makes no sense  
 we 've known how to cure malaria since the  1600s that 's when jesuit missionaries in peru discovered the bark of the cinchona tree 
 and inside that bark was quinine 
 still an effective cure
  for malaria to this day  so we 've known how to cure malaria for centuries  we 've known how to prevent malaria since 
 that 's when the british army surgeon ronald ross discovered
 that it was mosquitos that carried malaria  not bad air or miasmas as was previously thought so
 malaria should be a relatively simple disease to solve  and yet to this day
  hundreds of thousands of people are going to die from the bite of a mosquito why is that this is a question that 's
 personally intrigued me for a long time i grew up as the daughter of indian immigrants visiting my cousins in india every summer  
 and because i had no immunity to the local malarias i was made to sleep under
  sweaty mosquito net every night while my cousins they were allowed to sleep out on the terrace and have this nice cool night breeze wafting over them
  and i really hated the mosquitos for that 
 but at the same time i come from a jain family and jainism is a religion that espouses a very
 extreme form of nonviolence  so jains are not supposed to eat meat we 're not supposed to walk on grass because you could you
 know inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass
  not supposed to swat mosquitos  so
 the fearsome power of this little insect was apparent to me from a very young age and it 's one reason why i spent five years as a journalist trying to understand 
 why has malaria been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long 
 and i think there 's three main reasons
  those three reasons add up to the fourth reason which is probably the biggest reason of all 
 the first reason is certainly scientific 
 this little parasite that causes malaria it 's probably one of the most complex and wily pathogens known to humankind  it lives half its life inside the cold blooded mosquito and half its life inside
 the warm blooded human these two environments are totally different  but not only that they 're both utterly hostile
  so the insect is continually trying to fight off the parasite and so is the human body continually trying to fight it off this little creature survives under siege like that  but not only does it survive  
 it has thrived  it has spread  it has more ways to evade attack than we know 
 it 's a shape shifter for one thing just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly the malaria parasite transforms
  itself like that seven times in its life cycle  
 and each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other they have totally different physiology  
 so say you came up with some great drug that worked against one stage of the parasite 's life cycle it might do nothing at all to any of the other stages 
 it can hide in our bodies undetected unbeknownst to us for days for weeks
  for months for years in some cases even decades  
 so the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite 
 only about twelve species of mosquitos carry most of the world 's malaria  and we know quite a bit about the kinds of watery habitats that they
 specialize in so you might think then well why don 't we just avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live 
 right we could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live  
 but
 say you live in the tropics
 and you walk outside your hut one day
 and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt around your home or say your cow does or say your pig does 
  and then say it rains
 and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water that 's it you 've created the perfect malarial mosquito habitat that 's right outside your door 
 so it 's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects we kind of create places that they love to live just by living our own lives  
 so there 's a huge scientific challenge but there 's a huge economic challenge too malaria occurs in some of the poorest and most remote places on earth and there 's a reason for that 
 if you 're poor you 're more likely to get malaria
  you 're poor you 're more likely to live in rudimentary housing on marginal land that 's poorly drained these are places where mosquitos breed  
 you 're less likely to have door screens or window screens
  you 're less likely to have electricity and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible so you 're outside more you 're getting bitten by mosquitos more 
 so poverty causes malaria but what we also know now is that malaria itself
 causes poverty  
 for one thing it strikes hardest during harvest season so exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields collecting their crops they 're home sick with a fever  
 but it also predisposes people to death from all other causes so this has happened historically we 've been able to
 take malaria out of
  everything else stays the same so we still have bad food bad water bad sanitation all the things that make people sick  
 but just if you take malaria out deaths from everything else go down 
 and the economist jeff sachs has actually quantified what this means for a society  
 what it means is if you have malaria in your society your economic growth is depressed by one point three percent
  year after year after year just this one disease alone 
 so this poses a huge economic challenge  because say you do come up with your great drug or your great vaccine how do you deliver it
 in a place where there 's no roads 
 there 's no infrastructure there 's no electricity for refrigeration to keep things cold there 's no clinics there 's no clinicians to deliver these things where they 're needed  
 so there 's a huge economic challenge in taming malaria  
 but along with the scientific
  challenge and the economic challenge there 's also a cultural challenge and this is probably
 the part about malaria that people don 't like to talk about 
 and it 's the paradox that the people who have the most malaria in the world tend to care about it the least 
 this has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again  they ask people in malarious parts of the world what do you think about malaria and they don 't
  say it 's a killer disease we 're scared of it they say malaria is a normal problem of life 
 and that was certainly my personal experience when i told my relatives in india that i was writing a book about malaria they kind of
 looked at me like i told them i was writing a book about warts or something like why would you write about something so boring
  perception really a child in malawi for example she might have twelve episodes of malaria before the age of two  
 but if she survives she 'll continue to get malaria throughout her life  but she 's much less likely to die of it  
 and so in her lived experience malaria is something that comes and goes
  and that 's actually true for most of the world 's malaria most of the world 's malaria comes and goes on its own it 's just there 's so much malaria
 that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death
 add up to this big huge number 
 so i think people in malarious parts of the world must think of malaria the way those of us who live in the temperate world think of cold and flu  right cold and flu have
  huge burden on our societies
 and on our on our own lives but we don 't really even take the most rudimentary precautions against it because we consider it normal
 to get cold and flu during cold and flu season 
 and so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria because if people think it 's normal
 to have malaria  then how do you get them to run to the doctor to
  pick up their prescription to get it filled to take the drugs to put on the repellents to tuck in the bed nets 
 this is a huge cultural challenge in taming this disease  
 so take all that together  
 we 've got a disease it 's scientifically complicated  
 it 's economically challenging to deal with and it 's one for which the people who stand to benefit the most care about it the least and that adds up to the biggest problem of all which of course is the political problem
  do you get a political leader to do anything about a problem like this and the answer is historically  you don  't
 most malarious societies throughout history have simply lived with the disease  
 so the main attacks on malaria have come from outside of malarious societies from people who aren 't constrained by these rather paralyzing politics  but this i think introduces a whole host of other
  kinds of difficulties the first concerted attack against malaria started in the 1950s it was the brainchild of the u s state department  
 and this effort well understood the economic challenge they knew they had to focus on cheap easy to use tools and they focused on ddt  
 they understood the cultural challenge in fact their rather patronizing view was that people at risk of malaria shouldn 't be asked to do anything at all everything should be
  done to them and for them  but they greatly underestimated the scientific challenge  they had so much faith in their tools
 that they stopped doing malaria research  
 and so when those tools started to fail  and public opinion started to turn against those tools they had no scientific expertise
 to figure out what to do the whole campaign crashed malaria resurged back but now it was even worse
  than before because it was corralled into the hardest to reach places in the most
  forms one who official at the time actually called that whole campaign one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health 
 the latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s it 's similarly
 directed
  and financed primarily from outside of malarious societies  now this effort well understands the scientific challenge they are doing tons of malaria research  
 and they understand the economic challenge too  they 're focusing on very cheap very easy to use tools  
 but now i think the dilemma is the cultural challenge 
 the centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net  it 's treated with insecticides this thing has been distributed across the malarious world by the millions and
 when you think about the bed net
  sort of a surgical intervention you know it doesn 't really have any value to a family with malaria except that it helps prevent malaria  
 and yet we 're asking people to use these nets every night they have to sleep under them every night that 's the only way they are effective  
 and they have to do that even if the net blocks the breeze 
  even if
 they might have to get up in the middle of the night and relieve themselves even if they might have to move all their furnishings to put this thing up even if you know 
 they might live in a round hut in which it 's difficult to string up a square net  
 now
 that 's no big deal if you 're fighting a killer disease i mean
 these are minor inconveniences  but that 's not how people with malaria think of malaria so for them the calculus must be quite different
 imagine for example if a bunch of well meaning kenyans came up to those of us in the temperate world and said you know  you people have a lot of cold and flu  
 we 've designed this great easy to use cheap tool we 're going to give it to you for free it 's called a face mask 
 and
 all you need to do is wear it every day during cold and flu season when you go to school and when you go to work would we do that
 and i wonder if that 's how people in the malarious world thought of those nets when they first received them indeed 
 we know from from studies that only twenty percent of the bed nets that were first distributed were actually used  
 and even that 's probably an overestimate because the same people who distributed the nets went back and asked the recipients oh did you use that net i gave you
  is like your aunt jane asking you oh did you use that vase i gave you for christmas  so it 's probably an overestimate  but
 that 's not an insurmountable problem 
 we can do more education we can try to convince these people to use the nets and that 's what happening now we 're throwing a lot more time and money into workshops
 and trainings and musicals and plays and
  these things to convince people to use the nets we gave you 
 and that might work  
 but it takes time it takes money it
 takes resources it takes infrastructure it takes all the things that that cheap easy to use bed net was not supposed to be 
 so it 's difficult to attack malaria from inside
  malarious societies but it 's equally tricky
 when we try to attack it from outside of those societies  
 we end up imposing our own priorities on the people of the malarious world that 's exactly what we did in the 1950s and that effort backfired 
 i would argue today when we are distributing tools that we 've designed
 and that don 't necessarily make sense in people 's lives  we run the risk of making the same mistake again that 's not to say that malaria is unconquerable because i think it
 but what if we attacked this disease according to the priorities of the people who lived with it 
 take the example of england and the united states we had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years  
 and we got rid of it completely not because we attacked malaria we didn 't 
 we attacked bad roads and bad
 bad houses
 and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty  we attacked the malarious way of life  
 and by doing that we slowly built malaria out 
 now attacking the malarious way of life this is something these are things people care about today   and
 attacking the malarious way of life it 's not fast it
 's not cheap it 's not easy  but i think it 's the only lasting way forward  thank you so much
