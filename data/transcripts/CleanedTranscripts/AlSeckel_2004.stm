  we 're going to talk my a new lecture just for ted and i 'm going show you some illusions that we 've created for ted 
 and i 'm going to try to relate this to happiness what i was thinking about with happiness is what gives happiness
 or
 happiness which i equate with joy in my particular area
  there 's something very fundamental  and i was thinking about this  and it 's in terms of both illusions
 and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that
 there 's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way  you go see a movie
  has an unexpected twist something that you didn 't expect and you find a joyful experience you look at those sort of illusions in my book
 and it 's not as what you 'd expect and there 's something joyful about it and it 's the same thing with jokes and and all these sorts of things so what i 'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit
 further and see if i can violate your expectations in a
 pleasing way i mean sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant but i 'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way in a very primal way  so i can make the audience here happy  
 so i 'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations 
 first of all i want to show you the particular illusion here i want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other 
 these are all perceptual tricks 
 these are real objects that i 'm going to show you
 now i 'm going to show you how it is done i 've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience  i want you to see
 how this illusion is constructed and it 's going to rotate so you see that it 's inside out now watch as it rotates back how quickly your perception
  snaps
  ok now watch it as it rotates back again  and this is a very bright audience all right see if you can stop it from happening  even though you know one hundred percent it 's true that
 bam  you can 't undo it 
 what does that tell you about yourselves
  we 're going to do it again  no doubt about it see if you can stop it from happening  no  it 's difficult  
 and we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation about shape about color and 
  so forth and it 's very primal and it 's an interesting question to ponder  why these things
  that lionel did a while ago i like these sort of little things like this again
 this is not an optical trick this is what you would see
  not a camera cut it 's a perceptual trick 
 ok we can violate your expectations about shape
  we can violate your expectations on representation
 raise your hand if you see dolphins
  ok those people who raised their hands  afterwards the rest of the audience go talk to them all right 
 actually this is the best example of priming by experience that i know  
 if you are a child under the age of ten who haven 't been ruined yet
  you will look at this image and see dolphins  now  some of you adults here are saying what dolphins what dolphins but in fact 
 if you reversed the figure ground in other words the dark areas here i forgot to ask for a pointer but if you reverse it you 'll see a whole series of little dolphins by the way if you 're also a student at caltech they also
  something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design too this was done by saatchi and saatchi and they actually got away with this ad in australia so 
 if you look at this ad for beer all those people are in sort of
  how you can do these things  remember that sort of um 
 this is the joke i did
 when
 the florida ballot was going around you know count the dots for gore count the dots for bush  count ' em again  
 you can violate your expectations about experience here is
 an outside water fountain
 that i created with some friends of mine but you can stop the water in drops and actually make all the drops
 levitate
 this is something we 're building for you know amusement parks and that kind of stuff now let 's take a static image can you see this do you see the middle
  section moving down and the outer sections moving up it 's completely static it 's a static image how many people see this illusion 
 it 's completely static right now when
 it 's interesting that when we look at an image we see you know color depth
  and you can look at this whole scene and analyze it you can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth but the whole thing is actually flat it
 's painted it 's trompe l 'oeil 
 and it was such a good trompe l 'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman
 and she wouldn 't respond  
 now  you can make design
  like this building in new york so that when you
 see it from this side it looks like the balconies tilt up and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies
 go down so there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions or you take this particular
  enough i get a lot of emails from people who say is there any perceptual difference between males and females 
 and i really say no i mean women can navigate through the world just as well as males can and why wouldn 't they 
 however this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males in matching which head
 because they rely on fashion cues they can match the hat
  okay now getting to a part i want to show design in illusions  i believe that the first example of illusions 
 being used purposely was by da vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye  
  century and the 17th century to disguise hidden meanings where you could flip the image and see it from one little
 point of view like this but these are early
 incorporations of illusions brought to sort of high point with hans holbein 's ambassadors and hans holbein worked for henry viii 
  on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull all
 right now i 'm going to show you some
 designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise one of my favorites is scott kim  
 i worked with scott to create some illusions for ted
 that i hope you will enjoy  we
  hasn 't talked yet  but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his
  there 's analog and digital
 and figure goes to ground
 and for the musicians
  and of course since happiness we want joy to the world
  another great designer he 's very well known in japan
 shigeo fukuda  and he just builds some fantastic things  this is simply amazing  
 this is a pile of junk
 that when you view it from one particular angle
  you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano
  transforms to violinist  
 this is really wild  
 this assemblage of forks knives and spoons and various cutlery  welded together
  a shadow of a motorcycle  
 you learn something in the sort of thing that i do  
 which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands  
 ken knowlton does wonderful composite images
  but just by rearranging them he did einstein out of dice
 because after all  einstein said god does not play dice with the universe bert herzog out of
