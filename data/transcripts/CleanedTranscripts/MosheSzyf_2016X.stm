  so it all came to life
 in a dark bar in madrid 
 i encountered my colleague from mcgill  michael meaney and we were drinking a few beers  and like scientists do
  he told me about his work  and he told me that he is interested
 in how mother rats lick their pups
 after they were born 
 and i was sitting there and saying this is where my tax dollars are wasted 
 on this kind of soft science 
 and he started telling me
  the rats like humans  lick their pups in very different ways  some mothers do a lot of that 
 some mothers do very little and
 most are in between but what 's interesting about it is when he follows these pups when they become adults
 like years in human life long after their mother died  they are completely different animals the animals that were licked and groomed
  heavily the high licking and grooming are not stressed  they have different sexual behavior  they have a different
 way of living than those that were not treated
 as intensively by their mothers so then i was thinking to myself
  this magic 
 how does this work as geneticists would like you to think  perhaps the mother had the bad mother gene
 that caused her pups to be stressful  and then it was passed from generation to generation it 's all determined by genetics  
 or is it possible that something else is going on here
 in rats  we can ask this question and answer it  so what we did is a
 you essentially separate the litter the babies of this rat at birth to two kinds of fostering mothers not the real mothers  but mothers that will take care of them high licking mothers and low licking mothers and you can do the opposite with the 
 pups and the remarkable answer was 
  gene you got from your mother it was not the biological mother that defined this property of these rats  it is
 the mother that took care of the pups so how can this work  
 i am an a epigeneticist i am interested
 in how genes are marked by a chemical
  the womb of our mothers and decide which gene will be expressed in what tissue different genes are expressed in the brain than in the liver and the eye
 and we thought is it possible
 that the mother is somehow reprogramming the gene of her offspring
 through her
  and we spent ten years  and we found that there is a cascade of biochemical events
 by which the licking and grooming of the mother the care of the mother is translated to biochemical signals
 that go into the nucleus and into the dna and program it differently so now the animal can
 prepare itself for life is life going to be harsh is there going to be a lot of food are there going to be a lot of cats and snakes around
  or will i live in an upper class neighborhood where all i have to do is behave well and proper  and that will gain me social acceptance 
 and now one can think
 about how important that process can be for our lives we inherit our dna
 from our ancestors the dna
  it evolved during evolution  
 but it doesn 't tell us if you are going to be born in stockholm 
 where the days are long in the summer and short in the winter or in ecuador where there
 's an equal number of hours for day and night all year round  and that has such an enormous [ effect ]
 on our physiology  
 so what we suggest is perhaps what happens early in
  those signals that come through the mother tell the child
 what kind of social world you 're going to be living in it
 will be harsh  and you 'd better be anxious and be stressful or it 's going to be an easy world  and you have to be different is it going to be a world with a lot of light or little light 
 is it going to be a world with a lot of food or little food if there 's no food around  you 'd better develop your brain to binge
 whenever you see a meal or store every piece of food that you have as fat  
 so this is good  evolution has selected this to allow our fixed old dna to function in a dynamic way in new environments  
 but sometimes things can go wrong 
 for example if you 're born to a poor family
 and the signals are you better binge  you better eat
  every piece of food you 're going to encounter 
 but now we humans and our brain have evolved have changed evolution even faster now you can buy mcdonald 's for one dollar  
 and therefore  the preparation that we had
 by our mothers is turning out to be maladaptive the same preparation that was supposed to protect us from hunger and famine is going
  cause obesity cardiovascular problems and metabolic disease  
 so this concept that genes could be marked by our experience  and especially the early life experience can provide us a unifying explanation
 of both health and disease  
 but is true only for rats  the problem is we cannot test this in humans  because ethically we cannot administer child
  adversity in a random way  so if a poor child develops a certain property we don 't know whether this is caused by poverty
 or whether poor people have bad genes  
 so geneticists will try to tell you that poor people are poor because their genes make them poor 
 epigeneticists will tell you poor people are in a bad environment or an impoverished environment that creates that phenotype
 that property  so we moved to look
 into our cousins  the monkeys 
 my colleague stephen suomi has been rearing monkeys in two different ways  randomly separated the monkey from the mother
 and reared her with a nurse
  so these monkeys didn 't have a mother they had a nurse and other monkeys were reared with their normal natural mothers 
 and when they were old  they were completely different animals  
 the monkeys that had a mother did not care about alcohol they were not sexually aggressive the monkeys that didn 't have a mother were aggressive were stressed and were alcoholics  
 so we looked at their dna
 early after birth
 to see is it possible that the mother is marking is there a signature of the mother in the dna of the offspring 
 these are day 14 monkeys  
 and what you see here is the modern way by which we study epigenetics we can now map those chemical marks which we call methylation marks  
 on dna at a single nucleotide resolution  we can map the entire genome
  we can now compare the monkey that had a mother or not and here 's a visual presentation of this what you see is the genes that got more methylated are red the genes that got less methylated are green 
 you can see many genes are changing  because not having a mother is not just one thing it affects the whole way it sends signals about the whole way your world is going to look when you become an adult
 and you can see the two groups of monkeys extremely 
 from each other  
 how early does this develop 
 these monkeys already didn 't see their mothers so they had a social experience  do we sense our social status  even at the moment of birth  
 so in this experiment we took placentas of monkeys
 that had different social status
  interesting about social rank
 is that across all living beings  they will structure themselves by hierarchy  
 monkey number one is the boss 
 monkey number four is the peon  you put four monkeys in a cage there will always be a boss and always be a peon  
 and what 's interesting is that the monkey number one is much healthier than
  monkey number four and if you put them in a cage  monkey number one will
 will not eat as much monkey number four will eat [ a lot ] and what you see here in this
 methylation mapping a dramatic separation at birth
 of the animals that had a high social status versus the animals that did not have a high status  so we are
 born already knowing the social information  and that social information is not bad or good it just prepares us for life because we have to
 program our biology differently if we are in the high or the low social status  
 but how can you study this in humans  we can 't do experiments we
 can 't administer adversity to humans  but god does experiments with humans and it 's called natural disasters one of 
  the hardest natural disasters in canadian history happened in my province of quebec  it 's the ice storm of one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight 
 we lost our entire electrical grid because of an ice storm when the temperatures were in the dead of winter in quebec minus twenty to minus thirty and there were pregnant mothers during that time  
 and my colleague suzanne king
  followed
 the children of these mothers for fifteen years and what happened was that
 as the stress increased and here we had objective measures of stress 
 how long were you without power where did you spend your time was it in your mother in law 's apartment or in some
 posh country home  so all of these added up to a social
  stress scale and you can ask the question how did the children look and it appears that as stress increases  the children develop more autism  they 
  develop more metabolic diseases and they develop more autoimmune diseases
  green as stress increases an entire rearrangement of the genome in response to stress  
 so if
 we can program genes if we are not just the slaves of the history of our genes that they could be programmed can we deprogram them 
 because epigenetic
 causes can cause diseases like cancer
 metabolic disease
 and mental health diseases  let 's talk about cocaine addiction cocaine addiction is a terrible situation
 that can lead to death and to loss of human life  we asked the question can we reprogram the
  addicted brain to make that
 animal
 not addicted anymore  we used
 a cocaine addiction model
 that recapitulates what happens in humans in humans you 're in high school 
 some friends suggest you use some cocaine  you take cocaine nothing happens  months pass by something reminds you of what happened the first time a pusher
  and you become addicted and your life has changed 
 in rats we do the same thing my colleague gal yadid he trains the animals to get used to cocaine then for one month  
 no cocaine 
 then he reminds them of the party when they saw the cocaine the first time by cue the colors of the cage when they saw cocaine 
 and they go crazy  they will press the lever to get cocaine until they die  
 we first determined
 that the difference between these
  animals is that during that time when nothing happens there 's no cocaine around  
 their epigenome is rearranged their genes are re marked in a different way and when the cue comes  their genome is ready
 to develop this addictive phenotype  so we treated these animals with drugs that either increase
 dna methylation which was the epigenetic marker to look
  at or decrease epigenetic
 markings  and we found that if we increased methylation these animals go even crazier they become more craving for cocaine  
 but if we reduce the dna methylation the animals are not addicted anymore  we have reprogrammed them and a fundamental
 difference between an epigenetic drug and any other drug
 is that with epigenetic drugs we essentially remove the signs of experience  and once they 're gone 
 they will not come back unless you have the same experience 
 the animal now is reprogrammed so when we visited the animals thirty days  sixty days later which is in human terms many years of life  
 they were still not addicted
 by a single epigenetic treatment
 so
 what did we learn about dna dna is not just a sequence of letters  it 's not just a script 
 dna is a dynamic movie 
 our experiences are being written into this movie which is interactive you 're
 like watching a movie of your life with the dna with your remote control 
 you can remove an actor
 and add an actor 
 and so you have 
 in spite of the deterministic nature of genetics you have control of the way your genes look  
 and this has a tremendous optimistic message
 for the ability to now encounter some of the deadly diseases like cancer
  reverse the movie by removing an actor
 and setting up
 a new narrative  so what i told you today is our dna is really combined of two components
  two layers of information 
 one layer of information is old  evolved from millions of years of evolution  it is fixed
 and very hard to change  the other layer of information is the epigenetic layer which is
 open and dynamic
 and sets up a narrative that is
  to control to a large extent our destiny to help the destiny of our children
 and to hopefully conquer conquer disease
  and
 serious health challenges that have plagued humankind
 for a long time  so even though we are determined by our genes
 we have a degree of freedom that can set up our life to a life of responsibility  thank you
