  so what the hell was that well you don 't know
 because you couldn 't understand it  it wasn 't clear  but hopefully it was said with enough conviction
 that it was at least alluringly mysterious clarity
 or mystery i 'm balancing these two things in my daily work as a graphic designer as well as my daily life
  as a as a new yorker
 every day  and there are two elements that absolutely fascinate me  here 's an example 
 now how many people know what this is  
 okay  now how many people know what
  thanks to two more deft strokes by the genius charles m schulz 
 we now have seven deft strokes that in and of themselves create an entire emotional life 
 one that has enthralled hundreds of millions of fans for over fifty years
  this is actually a cover of a book that i designed about the work of schulz and his art  which will be coming out this fall and that is the
  entire cover there is no other typographic information or visual information on the front  and the name of the book is only what 's necessary 
 so
 this is sort of symbolic about the decisions i have to make every day about the design that i 'm perceiving  
  whether we can read it or not needs to be really really clear is it
  this is a rather recent example of urban clarity that i just love  mainly because i 'm always late
 and i am always in a hurry  so when these
 meters started showing up a couple of years ago on street corners 
 i was thrilled because now i finally knew how many seconds i had to get across the street before i got run over by a car
 six i can do that 
 laughter so let 's look at the yin to the clarity yang  and that is mystery 
 mystery is a lot more complicated by its very definition 
 mystery demands to
  in world war ii the germans really really wanted to decode this and they couldn 't 
 here 's an example of a design that i 've done recently for a novel by haruki murakami who i 've done design work for for over twenty years now 
 and this is a novel about a young man who has four dear friends who all of
  sudden after their freshman year of college completely cut him off
 with no explanation and he is devastated and the friends ' names each have
 a connotation in japanese to a color so there 's mr red there 's mr blue there 's ms white and ms black  tsukuru tazaki
  his name does not correspond to a color so his nickname is colorless and as he 's looking back on their friendship he recalls that they were like five fingers on a hand  
 so i created this sort of abstract representation of this but there 's a lot more going on underneath the surface of the story  and there 's more going on underneath the surface of the jacket 
 the four fingers
 are now four train lines in the tokyo subway system  which has
  significance within the story  
 and then you have the colorless subway line intersecting with each of the other colors which basically he does later on in the story  he catches up with each of these people to find out why they treated him the way they did 
 and so this is the
  sitting on my desk in my office and
 what i was hoping for here is that you 'll simply be allured by the mystery of what
 this looks like 
 and will want to read it to decode and find out and make more clear why it looks the way it does [ the visual vernacular ]
 this is a way to use a more familiar kind
  the visual vernacular is the way we are used to seeing a certain thing applied to something else so that we see it in a different way this is an approach 
  i wanted to take to a book of essays by david sedaris that had this title at the time [ all the beauty you will ever need ] now the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing it 's not connected to any of the essays in the book
 came to the author 's boyfriend in a dream  thank you very much so 
 so usually i am creating a design that is in some way based on the text but this is all the text there is so you 've got this mysterious
 title that really doesn 't mean anything so i was trying to think where might i see a bit of mysterious
  text that seems to mean something but doesn 't and sure enough not long after one evening after a chinese meal 
 this arrived and i thought 
 i 've always loved the hilariously mysterious tropes
 of fortune cookies that seem to mean something extremely deep but
 think about them if you think about them they really don 't this says hardly anyone knows how much
 is gained by ignoring the future thank you 
 but we can take this visual vernacular and apply it to mr sedaris 
 and we are so familiar with how fortune cookie fortunes look that we don 't even need the
  of the cookie anymore we 're just seeing this strange thing and we know we love david sedaris and so we 're hoping that we 're in for a good time [ ' fraud ' essays by
 david rakoff ] david rakoff was a wonderful writer and he called his first book fraud because he was getting sent on assignments 
  by magazines to do things that he was not equipped to do so he was this skinny little urban guy
  and gq magazine would send him down the colorado river whitewater rafting to see if he would survive
  and then he would write about it and he felt that he was a fraud and that he was misrepresenting himself  and so i wanted the cover of this book to also misrepresent itself
 and and then somehow show a reader reacting to it this
  led me to graffiti  i 'm fascinated by graffiti i think anybody who lives in an urban environment
 encounters graffiti all the time and there 's all different sorts of it  this is a picture i took on the lower east side of just a transformer box on the sidewalk and it 's been tagged like crazy  now
 whether you look at this and think oh that 's a charming urban affectation
 or you look at it and say that 's illegal
 abuse of property the one thing i think we can all agree on is that you cannot read it
  right  there is no clear message here there is another kind of graffiti that i find far more interesting  
 which i call editorial
  this is a picture i took recently in the subway and sometimes you see lots of prurient stupid stuff but i thought this was interesting and  this is a poster that is
 saying rah rah airbnb and someone has taken a magic marker and has editorialized about what they think about it and it
  got my attention so i was thinking how do we apply this to this book  so i get the book
 by this person and i start reading it and i 'm thinking  
 this guy is not who he says he is 
 he 's a fraud and i get out a red magic marker and out of frustration just scribble this across the front 
 design done
  author liked it  publisher liked it and that is how the book went out into the world and it was really fun to see
 people reading this on the subway and walking around with it and what have you and they all sort of looked like they were crazy
  i 've worked with him for many years he is probably best known as the author of the black dahlia and l a confidential 
 his most recent novel was called this  which is a very
 mysterious name that i 'm sure a lot of people know what it means but a lot of people don 't  and it 's a a story about a
  pearl harbor happens  and as if his life wasn 't difficult enough now the race relations have really
 ratcheted up  and then the japanese american internment camps are quickly created  and there 's lots of of tension and
 horrible stuff as he 's still trying to
  i did
 at first think very literally about this in terms of
 all right we 'll take pearl harbor and we 'll add it to los angeles and we 'll make this apocalyptic
 dawn on the horizon of the city  
 and so that 's that 's a picture from pearl harbor just grafted onto onto los angeles my editor in chief
  you know it 's interesting but
 i think you can do better and i think you can
 make it simpler and so i went back to the drawing board as i often do but
 also being alive to my surroundings  
 i work in a high rise in midtown  and every night before i leave the office i have to push this button
 to get out and the big heavy glass doors open and i can get onto the elevator and
 one night  all of a sudden i looked at this and i saw it in a way that i hadn 't really noticed it before
 big red circle danger  and
 i thought this was so obvious that it had to have been done a zillion times and so i did a google image search and i couldn 't
 find another book cover that looked quite like this and so this is really
  what solved the problem and graphically it 's more interesting
 and creates a bigger tension between the idea of a certain kind of sunrise coming up over
  so in this particular case it 's about the human digestive system  
 so i 'm trying to figure out what is the cover of this book going to be 
 this is 
 every morning i look at myself in the medicine cabinet
 mirror to see if my tongue is black  and if it 's not
  i 'm good to go 
 i recommend you all do this
  but i also started thinking here 's our introduction right  into the human digestive system
 but i think what we can all agree on is that actual photographs of human mouths at least based on this
 so for the cover then i had this illustration done
 which is literally more palatable and reminds us that it 's best to approach the digestive system from this end 
 i don 't even have to complete
  clarity and mystery get mixed up 
 and we see this all the time
  this is what i call unuseful mystery  i go down into the subway i take the subway a lot and this piece of paper is taped to a girder
  right  and
 now i 'm thinking  uh oh and the train 's about to come and i 'm trying to figure out what this means
  part of the problem here is that they 've compartmentalized the information in a way they think is helpful and frankly i don 't think it is at all 
 so this is mystery we do not need 
 what we need is useful clarity so just for fun
  i redesigned this  
 this is using all the same elements
  thank you i am still waiting for a call from the mta 
 you know i 'm actually not even using more colors than they use they just didn 't even bother to make the four and the five green  those idiots 
 so the first thing we see is that there is a service change  and
  in two complete sentences with a beginning a middle and an end  it tells us what the change is and what 's going to be happening call me crazy
  truly a piece of art it 's a work of art it 's beautiful but part of what makes it so heartening to me as a designer is that
 he 's taken the visual vernacular of diet coke the typefaces the colors the silver background
 and he 's reduced them to their most essential parts  so it 's like going back to the charlie brown face
 how can you give them just enough information so they know what it is but giving them the credit for the knowledge that they already have about this thing 
 it looks great and you you would go into a delicatessen and all of a sudden see that on on the shelf and it 's wonderful
  which makes the next thing
 so okay  again going back down into the subway
 after this came out these are pictures that i took 
 times square subway station coca cola has bought out the entire thing for advertising okay  and maybe some of you know where this is going ahem 
  you moved to new york with the clothes on your back the cash in your pocket and your eyes on the prize you 're on coke 
 you moved to new york with an mba one clean suit and an extremely firm handshake
  campaign was a huge misstep it was
  that 's not a period that 's a trademark
  so thanks a lot 
 so
 to me this was just so bizarre about how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect and the message so
  unbearably clearly wrong  it was just incredible to me  so
 i just hope that i 've been able to share with you some of my insights on
 the uses of of clarity and mystery in my work and maybe how you might decide to be more clear
  blah blah blah blah blah
