  wondered what this would feel like  
 so eight years ago i got the worst career advice of my life i
 had a friend tell me don 't worry about how much you like the work you 're doing now it 's all about just building
  all these ideas 
 and within about two months i noticed at about 10am every morning i had this strange urge to want to slam my head through the monitor of my computer i don 't
 know if anyone 's ever felt that  
 and i noticed
 pretty soon after that that all the competitors in our space had already
  as i 'm trying to figure out what two story window i 'm going to jump out of and change things up i read some altogether different advice from warren buffett and he said 
 taking jobs to build up your resume
 is the same as saving up sex for old age 
 and i heard that and that was all i needed within two weeks i was out of
  and i left with one intention to find something that i could screw up that 's how tough it was i wanted to have some type of impact it didn 't matter what it was  
 and i found pretty quickly that that i wasn 't alone it turns out that over eighty percent of the people
 around don 't enjoy their work  i 'm guessing this room is different but that 's the average that deloitte has done with their studies  
 so i wanted to find out what is it that sets these people apart the people who do the passionate
  inspired every day  and then these people the other eighty percent who lead these lives of quiet desperation so i started to interview all these people doing this inspiring work and i
 i read books and and did case studies three hundred books altogether on purpose and career and all this  totally just self immersion 
 really for the selfish reason of
 i wanted to find the
 work that i couldn 't not do what that was for me  but as i was doing this more and more people started to ask me 
 you 're into this career thing i don 't like my job can we sit down for lunch i 'd say sure but
 i would have to warn them because at this point my quit rate was also eighty percent of the people i 'd sit down with for lunch eighty percent would quit their job within two months
  i was proud of this  and it wasn 't that i had any special magic it was that i would ask one simple question it was why are you doing the work that you 're doing 
 and so often their answer would be
 because somebody told me i 'm supposed to and i realized that so many people around us
 are climbing their way up this ladder that someone tells them to climb and it ends up being leaned up against the wrong wall or no wall at all
 the more time i spent around these people and saw this problem i thought what if we could create a community a place where people could feel
 like they belonged and that it was ok
  to do things differently to take the road less traveled where that was encouraged and inspire people to change 
 and that later became what i now call live your legend which i 'll explain in a little bit  but
 as i 've made these discoveries i noticed a framework of really three simple things that all these different passionate world changers have in common whether you 're a steve jobs or if you 're just you know the person that has the bakery down the street but you
 you 're doing work that embodies who you are i want to share those three with you so we can use them as a lens for the rest of today and
  the rest of our life the first part of this three step passionate work framework is
 becoming a self expert and understanding yourself because if you don 't know what you 're looking for you 're never going to find it 
 and the thing is that no one is going to do this for us  there 's no major in university on passion and purpose and career  i don 't know how that 's not a required
  don 't even get me started on that i mean you spend more time picking out a dorm room tv set than you do you picking your major and your area of study  
 but the point is it 's on us to figure that out and we need a framework we need a way to navigate through this  
 and so the first step of our compass is finding out what our unique strengths are what are the things that that we wake up loving to do no matter what whether we 're paid or we 're not paid the things that people thank us for 
 and the strengths finder two point zero is a book and also an online tool i highly recommend it for sorting out what
  is that you 're naturally good at and next what 's our framework or our hierarchy for making decisions
 do we care about the people our family health or is it achievement success all this stuff we have to figure out what it is to make these decisions so we know what our soul is made of 
 so that we don 't go selling it to some cause we don 't
  these experiences we learn things every day every minute about what we love what we hate what we 're good at what we 're terrible at  
 and if we don 't spend time paying attention to that and assimilating that that learning and applying it to the rest of our lives it 's all for nothing
  every day every week every month of every year i spend some time just reflecting on what went right what went
  and what do i want to repeat what can i apply more to my life and even more so than that 
 as you see people especially today who inspire you  who are doing things where you say oh god what jeff is doing i want to be like him why are you saying that open up a journal write down what it is about them that inspires you it 's not going to be everything about their life
 but whatever it is take note on that so over time we 'll have this repository of things that
 we can use to to apply to our life and have a more passionate existence and make a better impact because when we start to put these things together
  we can then define what success actually means to us  
 and without these different parts of the compass it 's impossible we end up in the situation we have that scripted life that everybody seems to be living going up this ladder to nowhere it 's kind of like in wall street two if anybody saw that the
 peon employee asks the big wall street banker ceo what 's your number
  it 's the sad state of most of the people that haven 't spent time understanding what matters for them who keep reaching for something that
 doesn 't mean anything to us but we 're doing it because everyone said we 're supposed to but once we have this framework together we can start to identify the things that make us come alive you know
 before this a passion could come and hit you in the face 
 or maybe in your possible line of work you might throw it away because you don 't have a way of identifying it
 but once you do you can see something that 's congruent with my strengths my values who i am as a person  so i 'm going to grab ahold of this i 'm going to do something with it 
 and i 'm going to pursue it and try to make an impact with it
 and live your legend and the movement we 've built
 wouldn 't exist if i didn 't have this compass to identify wow this is something i want to pursue and and make a difference
  if we don 't know what we 're looking for we 're never going to find it  but once we have this this framework this compass then we can move on to what 's next
 and that 's not me up there 
 doing the impossible and pushing our limits there 's two reasons why people don 't do things one is they tell themselves they can 't do them
  or people around them tell them they can 't do them either way we start to believe it  either we give up or we never start in the first place the
 things is everyone was impossible until somebody did it every invention every new thing in the world people thought were crazy at first
  roger bannister and the four minute mile it was a physical impossibility to break the four minute mile
 in a foot race until roger bannister stood up and did it and then what happened two months later sixteen people broke the four minute mile 
 the things that we have in our head that we think are impossible are often just just milestones waiting to be accomplished if we can push those limits a bit and i think this starts
 with
 probably your physical body and fitness more than anything because we can control that if you
 think you can run a mile you show yourself you can run a mile or two or a marathon or lose five pounds or whatever it is  
 you realize that confidence compounds and can be transferred into the rest of your world and i 've
 actually gotten into the habit of this a little bit with my friends we have this little group we go on physical adventures and recently  i found myself in a kind
  i 'm terrified of deep dark blue water i don 't
 know if anyone 's ever had that same fear ever since they watched jaws one two three and four like six times when i was a kid  but anything above here if it 's murky
  i can already feel it right now
  i swear there 's something in there even if it 's lake tahoe it 's fresh water totally unfounded fear ridiculous but it 's there 
 anyway three years ago i find myself on this tugboat right down here in the san francisco bay  it 's a rainy stormy windy day  and people are getting sick on the boat and i 'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit
 and i 'm looking out the window in pure terror
 thinking i 'm about to swim to my death i 'm going to try to swim across the golden gate  and
 my guess is some people in this room might have done that before  i 'm sitting there and my buddy jonathan who had talked me into it he comes up to me and he could see
 the state i was in and he says scott hey man what 's the worst that could happen  you 're wearing a
  if you can 't make it just hop on one of the twenty kayaks plus if there 's a shark attack why are they going to pick you over the eighty people in the water 
 so thanks that helps he 's like but really just have fun with this  good luck and he dives in swims off  
 ok  turns out the pep talk totally worked and i felt this total feeling of calm  
 and i think it was because jonathan was thirteen years old 
 and of the eighty people swimming that day sixty five of them were between the ages of nine and thirteen
  think how you would have approached your world differently if at nine years old you found out you could swim
 a mile and a half in 56 degree water from alcatraz to san francisco  what would you have said yes to what would you have not given up on what would you have tried 
 as i 'm finishing this swim i get to aquatic park and i 'm getting out of the water and of course half the kids are already finished  so they 're cheering me on and they 're all excited
  i got total popsicle head if anyone 's ever swam in the bay  and i 'm trying to
 just thaw my face out and i 'm watching people finish  and i see this one kid  something didn 't look right and he 's just flailing like this  
 and he 's barely able to sip some air before he slams his head back down  
 and i notice other parents were watching too and i swear they were thinking the same thing i was this is why you don
  're dragging him like this totally limp  
 and then all of a sudden they walk a few more feet and they plop him down in his wheelchair  
 and he puts his fists up in the most insane show of victory i 've ever seen i can still feel the warmth and the energy on this guy when he when he made this accomplishment i had seen him earlier that day in his wheelchair i just had no idea he was going to swim  
 i mean  
 where is he going to be in twenty years
  told him he couldn 't do that that he would die if tried that 
 you prove people wrong you prove yourself wrong that you can make little incremental pushes of what you believe is possible you don 't have to be the fastest marathoner in the world just your own impossibilities to accomplish those and it starts with little bitty steps 
 and the best way to do this
 is to surround yourself with passionate people the fastest things to do things you don 't think can be done is to surround yourself with people already doing them

 jim rohn
 and it says you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with 
 and there is no bigger lifehack in the history of the world from getting where you are today to where you want to be
 than the people you choose to put in your corner they change everything and it 's a proven fact in one thousand eight hundred and ninety eight norman triplett did this study with
 a bunch of cyclists and he would measure their times around the track in a group and also
  individually  and he found that every time the cyclists in the group would cycle faster  
 and it 's been repeated in all kinds of walks of life since then and it proves the same thing over again that the people around you matter and environment is everything  
 but it 's on you to control it because it can go both ways with eighty percent of people
 who don 't like the work they do that means most people around us not in this room but everywhere else are encouraging complacency and keeping us from pursuing the things that matter to
  surroundings i found myself in this situation personal example 
  a couple years ago has anyone ever had a hobby or a passion they poured their heart and soul into unbelievable amount of time and they so badly want to call it a business  but
 no one 's paying attention and it doesn 't make a dime 
  i was there for four years trying to build this live your legend movement to help people do work that they genuinely cared about and that inspired them and
 i was doing all i could and there were only three people paying attention and they 're all right there my mother father and my wife chelsea thank you guys for the support 
 and this
 is how badly i wanted it it grew at zero percent for for four years  and i was about to shut it down and right
  i moved to san francisco and started to meet some pretty interesting people who had these crazy lifestyles of adventure of businesses and websites and blogs that surrounded their passions and helped people in a meaningful way and
 one of my friends now he has a family of eight  and he supports his whole family
 with a blog that he writes for twice a week they just came back from a month in europe all of them together this blew my mind  how does this even exist  and
 i got unbelievably inspired by seeing this  and instead of shutting it
  down i decided let 's take it seriously and i did everything i could to spend my time every waking hour possible trying to hound these guys hanging out and having beers and workouts whatever it was 
 and after four years of zero growth within six months
 of hanging around these people the community at live your legend grew by ten times in another twelve months  it grew by one hundred and sixty times 
 and today over thirty thousand people from one hundred and fifty eight countries use our career and connection tools
  on a monthly basis and those people have made up that community of passionate folks who inspired that possibility that i dreamed of for live your legend
 so many years back the people change everything and this is why you know you ask what
 what was going on well for four years i knew nobody in this space  and
 i didn 't even know it existed that people could do this stuff that you could have movements like this  and then
 everyone around me was doing it  it became normal  so my thinking went from how could i possibly do this
 to how could i possibly not and right then when that happens that switch goes on in your head  
 it ripples across your whole world and without even trying your standards go from here to here you don 't need
 to change your goals  you just need to change your surroundings  
  and that 's why i love being around this whole group of people why i go to every ted event i can and watch them on my ipad on the way to work whatever it is because
 this is the group of people that that inspires possibility we have a whole day to spend together and plenty more to
 sum things up in terms of these these three pillars they all have
 one thing in common more than anything else they are one hundred percent in our control no one can tell you you can 't learn about yourself no one can tell you you can 't push
  your limits and learn your own impossible and push that no one can tell you you can 't surround yourself with inspiring people or get away from the people who bring you down you can 't control a recession you can 't
 control getting fired or getting in a car accident most things are totally out of our hands these three things are totally on us  
 and they can change our whole world
 if we decide to do something about it and the thing is it 's starting to
  happen on a widespread level i just read in forbes the us government reported for the first time in a month where more people had quit their jobs
 than had been laid off they thought this was an anomaly but it 's happened three months straight in a time where people claim it 's kind of a tough environment people are giving a middle finger to this scripted life 
 the things that people say you 're supposed to do in exchange for things that
  matter to them and do the things that inspire them and the thing is people are waking up to this possibility that
 really the only thing that limits possibility now is imagination that 's not a clich anymore  
 i don 't care what it is that you 're into what passion what hobby 
 if you 're into knitting you can find someone who is killing it knitting  and you can you can learn from them  it 's wild and that 's what this whole day is about
  we profile these people on live your legend every day  because when ordinary people are doing the extraordinary and we can be around that 
 it becomes normal  and this isn 't about being
 gandhi or steve jobs doing something crazy it 's just about doing something that matters to you and makes an impact that only you can make
 speaking of gandhi he was a
  as i 've heard the term  and he was called to a greater cause something that mattered to him he couldn 't not do  and he has this quote that i absolutely live by first they ignore you  
 then they laugh at you  then they fight you then you win 
 everything was impossible until somebody did it you can either hang around the people
 who tell you it can 't be done and tell you you 're stupid for trying  or surround yourself with the people who inspire possibility
  the people who are in this room because i see it as our responsibility to show the world that
 what 's seen as impossible can become that new normal and that 's already starting to happen 
 first do the things that inspire us so we can inspire other people to do the things that inspire them  
 but we can 't find that
 unless we know what we 're looking for we have to do our
 work on ourself be intentional about that and make those discoveries  because i imagine a world where eighty percent of people love the work they do  what would that look like
 what would the innovation be like how would you treat the people around you 
 things would start to change
 and as we finish up i have just one question to ask you guys and i think it 's the only question that matters and
 it 's what is the work you can 't not do  
  not just for you but for everybody around you  because that is what starts to change the world  what is the work you can 't not do  
 thank you guys
