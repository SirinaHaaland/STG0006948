  i want you to imagine what a breakthrough this was for women who were victims of violence in the 1980s 
 they would come into the emergency room with
  the police would call a lovers ' quarrel and i would see a woman who was beaten  i would see a broken nose
 and a fractured wrist
 and swollen eyes  and as activists  we would take our polaroid camera  we would take her picture  
 we would wait ninety seconds  and we would give her the photograph  
 and she would then have the evidence she needed to go to court
 we were making what was invisible visible  
 i 've been doing this for thirty years i 've been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children 
 and for all those years  i 've had
 an absolutely passionate
 and sometimes not popular belief
  belief that this violence is not inevitable 
 that it is learned  and if it 's learned it can be un learned and it can be prevented 
 applause why do i believe this
  and two thousand and ten domestic violence among adult women in the united states has gone down by
  were beaten they were stalked they were raped and no one talked about it 
 there was no justice  and as an activist 
 that was not good enough  and so step one on this journey is we organized and we created this extraordinary underground 
  network of amazing women who opened shelters and if they didn
 open a shelter they opened their home so that women and children could be safe 
 and you know what else we did we had bake sales we had car washes  and we did everything we could do to fundraise  and then at one point we said  you 
  know it 's time that we went to the federal government and asked them to pay for these extraordinary services that are saving people 's lives
 and so 
 step number two we knew we needed to change the laws and so we went to washington and we lobbied for the first
 piece of legislation  and i remember walking through the halls of the u s capitol
  and i was in my 30s and my life had purpose  and
 i couldn 't imagine that anybody would ever challenge this important piece of legislation  i was probably thirty and naive  
 but i heard about a congressman who had a very very different point of view do you know what he called this important piece of legislation
  he called it the take the fun out of
  take the fun out of marriage act ladies and gentlemen that was in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four in the united states  and i wish i had twitter 
 ten years later after lots of hard work we finally passed the violence against women act  which is a 
 act that has saved so many lives thank you 
 i was proud to be part of that work and it changed the
  laws and it put millions of dollars into local communities and you know what else it did it collected data and i have to tell you i 'm passionate about data in fact  i am a data nerd  
 i 'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here i am a data nerd and the reason for that is i want to make sure that if we spend a dollar that the program
  and if it doesn 't work  we should change the plan
  and i also want to say one other thing  we are not going to solve this problem by building more jails
 or by even building more shelters 
 it is about economic empowerment for women it is about healing kids who are hurt  and it is about prevention with a capital p 
 and so step number three on this journey
  we know if we 're going to keep making this progress we 're going to have to turn up the volume we 're going to have to increase the visibility  and we 're going to have to engage the public 
  and so knowing that we went to the advertising council  and we asked them to help us build a public education campaign  and we looked around the world to canada and australia and brazil and parts of africa  and we took this
  knowledge and we built the first national public education campaign called there 's no excuse for domestic violence take a look at one of our spots
  as we were in the process of releasing this campaign o j simpson was arrested for the murder of his
  we learned that he had a long history of domestic violence the media became fixated 
 the story of domestic violence went from the back page but actually from the no page to the front page  our ads blanketed the airwaves and women for the first time started to tell their stories  
 movements are about moments  
 and we seized this moment and let me just put this in context
 before one thousand nine hundred and eighty do you have any idea how many articles
 were in the new york times on domestic violence i 'll tell you one hundred and 
 and in the 
 over seven thousand we were obviously making a
  but we were still missing a critical element so step
 four we needed to engage men 
 we couldn 't solve this problem with fifty percent of the population on the sidelines  
 and i already told you i 'm a data nerd national polling told us that men felt indicted and not invited into this conversation 
 so we wondered  how can we include
  how can we get men to talk about violence against women and girls and a male friend of mine pulled me aside and he said 
 you want men to talk about violence against women and girls men don 't
 talk 
 i apologize to the men in the audience i know you do  but he said do you know what they do do they do talk to their kids they talk
  to their kids
 as parents as coaches and that 's what we did we met men where they were at and we built a program and then we had this one event that stays in my heart forever where a basketball coach
 was talking to a room filled with male athletes
 and men from all walks of life  and he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the
 culture of the locker room and giving men the tools to have healthy relationships and all of a sudden he looked at the back of the room 
 and he saw his daughter and he called out his daughter 's name michaela and he said michaela come up here and she 's nine years old and she was kind of shy and she got up there  and he said sit down next to me 
 she sat right down next to him he
 gave her this big hug  and he said people ask me why i do this work  
 i do this work because i 'm her dad
  and i don 't want anyone ever to hurt her and as a parent  i get it  i get it
  knowing that there are so many sexual assaults on college campuses that are so widespread and so
 we 've done a lot for adult women  we 've got to do a better job for our kids
  have to we 've come a long way
 since the days of the polaroid technology has been our friend 
 the mobile phone is a global game changer for the empowerment of women and facebook and twitter and google and youtube and all the social media helps us organize
 and tell our
  story in a powerful way  and so those of you in this audience who have helped build those applications and those platforms as an organizer  i say thank you very much  really  i clap for you 
 i 'm the daughter of a man who joined one club in his life the optimist club
  can 't make that one up 
 and it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my dna i have been doing this work for over thirty years  
 and i am convinced now more than ever in the capacity of human beings to change 
 i believe we can bend the arc of human history toward compassion and equality
 and i also fundamentally believe and passionately believe that this violence does not have to be part of the human condition  and i ask you stand with us
 as we create futures without violence for women and girls and men and
  thank you very much
