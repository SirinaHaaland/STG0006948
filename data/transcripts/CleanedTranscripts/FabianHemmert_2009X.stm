  i am a phd student  and that means i have a question  how can we make
 digital content graspable  because you see on the one hand there is the digital world and
  many things are happening there right now  and for us humans it 's not quite material it 's not really there it 's virtual 
 on the other hand  we 're humans  we live in a in a physical world it 's rich  it tastes good it feels good it smells good  
 so the question is how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical that 's my question 
 if you look at the iphone with its touch and the wii with its bodily activity you can see the tendency it 's getting physical the question is what 's next
  now i have three options that i would like to show you the first one is mass 
 as humans we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy  so could we use that in mobile phones 
 let me show you the weight shifting mobile  it is a mobile phone shaped box that has an iron weight inside which we can move around
  can feel where it 's heavy  we shift the gravitational center of it 
 for example we can augment digital content with physical mass  so you move around the content on the display but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device 
 another thing it 's good for is navigation  it can guide you around in a city it can tell you by its weight ok move right walk ahead 
  make a left here and the good thing about that is you don 't have to look at the device all the time you have your eyes free to see the city  now mass is the first thing the second thing 
 that 's shape we 're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in our hands  
 so if i download an e book and it has twenty pages well they could be thin right but if it has five hundred pages i want to feel that harry potter it 's thick 
 so let me show you
  it 's a mobile phone shaped box and this one can change its shape 
 we can play with the shape itself for example it can be thin in your pocket  which we of course want it to be but then if you hold it in your hand it can 
  lean towards you be thick  it 's like tapered to the downside if you change the grasp it can adjust to that it
 another thing is  sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone that are bigger than the phone itself  in that case like here there 's an app that 's bigger than the phone 's screen
 the shape of the phone could tell you ok  off the screen right here  there is more content you can 't see it but it 's there and you can feel it because it 's thicker at that edge the
 shape is the second thing the third thing operates on a different level
 as humans we are social we are empathic  and that 's great wouldn
 't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive  think of a hamster in the pocket well i can feel it it 's doing all right i don 't have to check it 
 let me show you the living mobile phone  so once again a mobile phone shaped box  
 but this one
  how do we calm it down you give it a pat behind the ears and
 everything is all right again  that 's very intuitive and that 's what we want 
 so what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us and i think making it physical
 is a good way to do that 
 what 's behind that is a postulation namely not that humans should get much more technical in the future  rather than that technology a bit more human
