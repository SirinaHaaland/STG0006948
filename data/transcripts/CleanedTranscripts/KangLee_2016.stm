  let me ask the audience a question did you ever lie as a child  if you did could you please raise your hand  
 wow this is the most honest group of people i 've ever met 
 laughter so for the last twenty years
 i 've been studying how children learn to tell lies  and today  i 'm going to share with you some of the discoveries we have made 
 but to begin i 'm going to tell you a story from mr richard messina who is my friend and an elementary school principal 
 he got a phone call one day 
  my son johnny will not come to school today because he 's sick mr 
 messina asks who am i speaking to please 
 and the caller says i am my father 
 so
 this story sums up very nicely three common beliefs we have about children and lying
  one children only come to
 tell lies after entering elementary school 
 two children are poor liars we adults can easily detect their lies  and three if children lie at a very young age  
 there must be some character flaws with them and they are going to become pathological liars for life
  well it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong
 we have been playing guessing games with children all over the world here is an example  
 so in this game  we asked children to guess the numbers on the cards  
 and we tell them if they win the game they are going to get a big prize but in the middle of the game  we make an excuse
 and leave the room 
 and before we leave the room we tell them not to peek at the cards 
 of course  we have hidden cameras in the room
 to watch their every move  
 because the desire to win the game is so strong more than ninety percent  of children will peek
 as soon as we leave the room
 the crucial question is when we return and ask the children
 whether or not they have peeked will the children who peeked
 confess or lie about their transgression  
 we found that that regardless of gender country
  at two years of age  thirty percent lie  
 seventy percent tell the truth about their transgression  at three years of age  fifty percent lie
 and fifty percent tell the truth at four years of age  more than eighty percent lie
  and after four years of age  most children lie  so as you can see lying is really a typical part of
  development  and some children begin to tell lies as young as two years of age 
 so now let 's take a closer look at the younger children 
 why do
 some but not all young children lie in cooking you need good ingredients to cook good food
 two key ingredients 
 the first key ingredient is theory of mind or the mind reading ability 
 mind reading is the ability to know that different people have different knowledge about the situation
 and the ability to differentiate between what i know
  and what you know  
 mind reading is important for lying because the basis of lying is that i know you don 't know what i know  
 therefore i can lie to you 
 the second key ingredient for good lying is self control 
 it is the ability to control your speech your facial expression and your body language so that you can tell a convincing lie 
 and we found
 that those young children
 who have more advanced 
 and self control abilities tell lies earlier
 and are more sophisticated liars 
 as it turns out these two abilities are also essential for all of us to function well in our society
  is telling his or her first lie  instead of being alarmed you should celebrate because
  has arrived
 at a new milestone of typical development  
 now are children poor liars  do you think you can easily detect their lies  
 would you like to give it a try yes  ok  so i 'm going to show you two videos  in the videos  the children are going to respond to a
  so try to tell me which child is lying and which child is telling the truth
  if you think child number two is lying  please raise your hand  
 ok so as a matter of fact  child number one is telling the truth  child number two is lying  
 looks like many of you are terrible detectors of children 's lies 
  we have played similar kinds of games with many many adults
 from all walks of life  
 and we show them many videos  
 in half of the videos  the children lied in the other half of the videos the children told the truth  
 and let 's find out how these adults performed because there are as many liars as
  if you guess randomly  
 there 's a fifty percent chance you 're going to get it right  
 so if your accuracy is around fifty percent it means you are a terrible detector of children 's lies
 so let 's start with
 undergrads and law school students who typically have limited experience with children no
  they cannot detect children 's lies  their performance is around chance now how about social workers and 
  lawyers  who work with children on a daily basis can they detect children 's lies  
 no they cannot what about judges  customs officers
 and police officers who deal with liars on a daily
  can they detect children 's lies  
 no they cannot  what about parents can parents detect other children 's lies  
 no they cannot  what about can parents detect their own children 's lies  
 no they cannot 
 so now you may ask why children 's lies are so difficult to detect
 let me illustrate this with my own son nathan this is his facial expression when he lies 
 laughter so when children lie their facial expression is typically neutral  
 however  behind this neutral expression the child is actually experiencing a lot of
  and maybe a little bit of liar 's delight 
 laughter unfortunately  such emotions are either fleeting
 or hidden therefore it 's mostly invisible to us  so in the last five years  we have been trying to figure out a way to reveal these hidden emotions  
 then we made a discovery
  we know that underneath our facial skin  there 's a rich network of blood vessels 
 when we experience different emotions our facial blood flow changes subtly  
 and these changes are regulated by the autonomic system that is beyond our conscious control
 by looking at facial blood flow changes  we can reveal
  facial blood flow changes are too subtle to detect by our naked eye  
 so to help us reveal people 's facial emotions  we have developed a new imaging technology we call transdermal optical imaging 
 to do so we use a regular video camera to record people when they experience various hidden emotions  and then
 using our image processing technology we can extract transdermal images of facial blood flow changes
 by looking at transdermal video images now we can easily see
 facial blood flow changes associated with the various hidden emotions
  and using this technology we can now reveal the hidden emotions associated with lying and therefore detect people 's lies  we can do so noninvasively  remotely  inexpensively 
 with an accuracy at about eighty five percent which is far better than chance level  
 and in addition  we discovered a pinocchio effect
 not this pinocchio effect 
 laughter this is the real pinocchio effect  
 when people lie  
 the facial blood flow on the cheeks decreases  and the facial blood flow on the nose increases 
 of course lying is not the only situation that will evoke our hidden emotions  so then we asked ourselves in
  addition to detecting lies  how can our technology be used one application is in
 education  for example  using this technology we can help this mathematics teacher to identify the student in his classroom who may experience
 high anxiety
 about the topic he 's teaching so that he can help him  and also we can use this in
  health care for example  every day i skype my parents  who live thousands of miles away  
 and using this technology 
 i can not only find out what 's going on in their lives but also simultaneously monitor their heart rate 
 their stress level their mood and whether or not they are experiencing pain  
 and perhaps in the future
  risks for heart attack or hypertension  
 and you may ask can we use this also to reveal politicians ' emotions laughter
 for example during a debate well
 the answer is yes  using tv footage we could detect the politicians ' heart rate  
 mood and stress
 and perhaps in the future whether or not they are lying to us  
 we can also use this in marketing research for example to find out whether or not people like certain consumer products  
 we can even use it in dating  so for example  if your date is smiling at you
  this technology can help you to determine whether she actually likes you
 or she is just trying to be nice to you 
 and in this case she is just trying to be nice to you 
 so transdermal optical imaging technology is at a very early stage of development  
 many new applications will come about that we don 't know today  
 however  one thing i know for sure
  is that lying will never be the same again thank you very much
