  as a boy i loved cars  when i turned eighteen i lost my best friend to a car accident  
 like this and then i
  dedicate my life
 to saving one million people
 every year  
 now i haven 't succeeded so this is just a progress report  but i 'm here to tell you a little bit about self driving cars 
 i saw the concept first in the darpa grand challenges
 where the u s government issued a prize to build a self driving car that could navigate a desert  
 and even though a hundred teams were there these cars went nowhere 
 so we decided at stanford to build a different
 we built the hardware and the software we made it learn from us 
 and we set it free in the desert  
 and the unimaginable happened it became the first car to ever return from a darpa grand challenge  winning stanford
 two million dollars  yet i still hadn 't saved a single life  since our work has focused
 on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves
 any street in california we 've driven one hundred and forty thousand miles  our cars have sensors
 by which they magically can see
 everything around them and make decisions about every
  's the perfect
 driving mechanism 
 we 've driven in cities  like in san francisco here  
 we 've driven from san francisco to los angeles on highway one we 've encountered joggers  
 busy highways  toll booths  
 and this is without a person in the loop the car just drives itself in fact while we drove one hundred and forty thousand miles 
 people didn 't even notice
  mountain roads day and night  and even crooked lombard street in san francisco
  now i can 't get my friend harold back to life but i can do something for all the people who died do you know that
 driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people and do you realize that almost all of those are due to human
 error
 and not machine error and can therefore be prevented
 by machines do
 you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of of two or three
 if we didn 't rely on human precision on staying in the lane
 improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes  and do away with all traffic jams on highways
  do you realize that you 
 ted users  spend an average of fifty two minutes per day in traffic  wasting your time
 on your daily commute 
 you could regain this time this is four billion hours wasted in this country alone and it 's two point four billion gallons of
 now i think there 's a vision here a new technology  and i 'm really looking forward to a time when
 generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars thank you
