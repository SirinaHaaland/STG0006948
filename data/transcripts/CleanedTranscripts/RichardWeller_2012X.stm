  before i became a dermatologist  i started in general medicine as most dermatologists do in britain 
 at the end of that time i went off to australia about twenty years ago  
 what you learn when you go to australia is the australians are very competitive and they are not magnanimous
  victory and that happened a lot you pommies you can 't play cricket rugby i could accept that  but
 moving into work and we have each week what 's called a journal club when you 'd sit down
 with the other doctors and you 'd study a scientific paper in relation to medicine  
 and after week one it was about cardiovascular mortality a dry subject
 how many people die of heart disease
  what the rates are 
 and they were competitive about this you pommies your rates of heart disease are shocking 
 and of course they were right australians have about a third less heart disease than we do less deaths from heart attacks heart failure less strokes they 're generally a healthier bunch and of course they said this was because of their
 fine moral standing their exercise because they 're australians and we 're
 weedy pommies and so on  
 but it 's not just australia that has better health than britain  within britain
  there is a gradient of health and this is what 's called standardized mortality  basically your chances of dying 
 this is looking at data from the paper about twenty years ago but it 's true today  
 comparing your rates of dying fifty degrees north that 's the south that 's london and places
 by
  latitude and fifty five degrees the bad news is that 's here glasgow  i 'm from edinburgh  worse news that 's even edinburgh 
 so what accounts for this horrible space here between us up here in southern scotland and the south  now  we know about smoking deep fried mars bars chips the glasgow diet all of these things 
 but this graph is after
  taking into account all of these known risk factors 
 this is after accounting for smoking social class diet  all those other known risk factors  we are left with this missing space of increased deaths the further north you go  
 now sunlight of course comes into this and vitamin d has had a great deal of press
  a lot of people get concerned about it and we need vitamin d it 's now a requirement that children have a certain amount my grandmother grew up in glasgow back in the 
  when rickets was a real problem and cod liver oil was brought in and that really prevented the rickets that used to be common in this city  and i as a child was fed cod liver oil by my grandmother i distinctly nobody forgets cod liver oil  
  an association the higher people 's blood levels of vitamin d are the less heart disease they have the less cancer there seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin d is very good for you and it is to prevent rickets and so on 
 but if you give people vitamin d supplements you don 't change that high rate of heart disease  and the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great  
 so what i 'm going to suggest
  that vitamin d is not the only story in town it 's not the only reason preventing heart disease high vitamin d levels i think are a marker for 
  sunlight exposure  and sunlight exposure in methods i 'm going to show is good for heart disease
 laughter now in aberdeen i started my dermatology training but i also became interested in research
  and in particular i became interested in this substance nitric oxide  now these three guys up here furchgott ignarro and murad  won the nobel prize for medicine back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight 
 and they were the first people to describe this new chemical transmitter nitric oxide  what nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels so it lowers your blood pressure  it also dilates the coronary arteries so it stops angina  
 and what was remarkable
  about it was in the past when we think of chemical messengers within the body we thought of complicated things like estrogen and insulin or nerve transmission very complex processes with very complex chemicals that fit into very complex receptors  
 and here 's this incredibly simple molecule a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck
  and yet these are hugely important for [ unclear ] our low blood pressure for neurotransmission for many many things  but particularly cardiovascular health 
 and i started doing research  and we found very excitingly that the skin produces nitric oxide  so it 's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises it arises in the skin 
 well having found that and published that 
 i thought well what
  it doing how do you have low blood pressure in your skin it 's not the heart what do you do  so
 i went off to the states as many people do if they 're going to do research  and i spent a few years in pittsburgh
  this is pittsburgh  and i was interested in these really complex systems we thought that maybe nitric oxide
 affected cell death and how cells survive and their resistance to other things and i first off started work in in cell culture growing cells and then i was using knockout mouse models mice that couldn 't make the gene
  mechanism which no was helping cells survive  
 and i then moved back to edinburgh  
 and in edinburgh the experimental animal we use is the medical student  it 's a species close to human with several advantages over mice they 're free 
 you don 't shave them they feed themselves and nobody pickets your office saying save the
  but what we found was that we couldn 't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice  
 it seemed we couldn 't turn off the production of nitric oxide in the skin of humans we put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it 
 we injected things we couldn 't turn off the the nitric oxide  and the reason for this it turned out after two or three years ' work was that in the skin
  we have huge stores not of nitric oxide because nitric oxide is a gas  and it 's released 
 and in a few seconds it 's away  
 but it can be turned into these forms of nitric oxide nitrate no3 nitrite no2 nitrosothiols and these are more stable 
 and your skin has got really large stores of no 
 and we then thought to ourselves with those big stores i wonder if sunlight might
 activate those stores and release them from the skin  where the stores are about ten times as big as what 's in the circulation could the sun activate those stores into the circulation  
 and there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system  
 well  i 'm an experimental dermatologist so what we did was we thought we 'd have to expose our experimental animals
 to sunlight and so what we did was we took a bunch
  of of volunteers and we exposed them to ultraviolet light so these are kind of sunlamps now what we were careful to do
 was vitamin d is made by ultraviolet b rays and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin d story  so we used ultraviolet a which doesn 't make vitamin d 
 when we put people under a lamp for the equivalent of about thirty minutes of sunshine in summer
 in edinburgh  what we produced was we produced a rise in circulating nitric oxide  so we put patients with these subjects under the uv 
 and their no levels do go up  
 and their blood pressure goes down not by much as an individual level 
 but enough at a population level to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population 
 and when we shone
  when we warmed them up to the same level as the lamps but didn 't actually let the rays hit the skin  this didn 't happen so this seems to be a feature of ultraviolet rays hitting the skin  
 now we 're still collecting data a few good things here this appeared to be more marked in older people  
 i 'm not sure exactly how much one of the subjects here was my
  and clearly i do not know her age  but certainly
 in people older than my wife
  this appears to be a more marked effect 
 and the other thing i should mention was there was no change in vitamin d this is separate from vitamin d so vitamin d is good for you it stops rickets it prevents calcium metabolism important stuff but this is a separate mechanism from vitamin d 
 now one of the problems with looking at blood pressure is your body does everything it can to keep your blood pressure at the same place if your leg is chopped off and you lose blood your body
  will clamp down increase the heart rate do everything it can to keep your blood pressure up that is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle  so what we 've next done
 is we 've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation so we 've measured this is again notice no tail
 and and hairless this is a medical student  in the arm
  you can measure blood flow in the arm by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it 
 and what we 've shown is that doing a sham irradiation this is the thick line here this is shining uv on the arm so it warms up but keeping it covered so the rays don 't hit the skin  
 there is no change in blood flow in dilatation of the blood vessels  but the active irradiation during the uv and for an hour after it there is dilation of the blood vessels this is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure by which
  you dilate the coronary arteries also to let the blood be supplied with the heart 
 so here  further data that ultraviolet that 's sunlight has benefits on the blood flow and and the cardiovascular system  
 so we thought we 'd just kind of model
 different amounts of uv
 hit different parts of the earth at different times of year  so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide
  the nitrates nitrites nitrosothiols in the skin
 cleave to release no different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that so you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that 
 and you can look so if you live on the equator the sun comes straight overhead it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere in winter or summer it 's the same amount of light if you live up here 
 in summer
 the sun is coming fairly directly down
 but in winter it 's coming through a huge amount of atmosphere  and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out  and the range of wavelengths that hit the earth
 are different from summer to winter  
 so what you can do is you can multiply those data by the no that 's released and you can calculate how much nitric oxide would be released from the skin into
  if you 're on the equator here that 's these two lines here the red line and the purple line
 the amount of nitric oxide  that 's released is the area under the curve it 's the area in this space here 
 so if you 're on the equator  december or june you 've got masses of no being released from the skin  
 so ventura is in southern california in summer you might as well be at the equator it 's great lots of no is released ventura
  edinburgh
 in summer the area beneath the curve is pretty good but edinburgh in winter the amount of no that can be released is
 next to nothing  tiny amounts  
 so what do we think we 're still working at this story we 're still developing it we 're still expanding it we think it 's very important we think it probably accounts
  a lot of the north south health divide within britain it 's of relevance to us 
 we think that the skin well we know that the skin has got very large stores of nitric oxide as these various other forms we suspect a lot of these come from diet green leafy vegetables beetroot  lettuce has a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin 
 we think they 're then stored in the skin  and we think the sunlight releases this where it has generally beneficial effects
  and this is ongoing work but dermatologists i mean i 'm a dermatologist my day job is saying to people you 've got skin cancer it 's caused by sunlight don 't go in the sun 
 i actually think a far more important message is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight yes sunlight is the is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer  
 but deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher than deaths from skin cancer  
 and i think that we need to be more aware of and we need to find the
  ratio how much sunlight is safe and how can we finesse this best for our general health
