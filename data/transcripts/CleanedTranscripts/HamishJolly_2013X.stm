  the kind that can potentially save lives can sometimes be lying right out in the open for us to discover 
 in the evolved accumulated body of human anecdote for example
  or in the time tested adaptations that we observe in the natural world around us 
 science starts with observation but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence  
 isolate them and test them with scientific rigor  
 and when we do the results will often surprise 
 western australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last three years
  tragically culminating in five fatal shark attacks in a 10 month period during that time  but western australia is not alone in this the incident of
 shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide  
 and so it 's not surprising perhaps that in july of this year shark attack mitigation systems in collaboration with the university of western australia oceans institute
 made an announcement which captured the
  attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users worldwide  
 and that was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see  
 and i have for you today the story of that journey but also the notion
 that science can be as powerful as a translator as it can be for invention when we began this process
  we were looking it was about three years ago and
 we 'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks in in western australia 
 and by chance in a previous role i happened to be having dinner with harry butler  now harry butler  who
 most australians would know is a famous naturalist had spent a lot of time in the marine environment harry butler is a precursor if you like to the late steve irwin when i asked him about
  what the solution to the problem might be the answer was quite surprising  he said take a black wetsuit  band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee  and you 'll be mimicking the warning systems of most marine species 
 i didn 't think about that much at the time  and it wasn 't until the next three fatal shark attacks happened and it caused
  maybe there 's some merit to this idea  and i turned to the web to see if there might be some clues  and it turns out the web is awash with
 this sort of evidence that supports this sort of thinking  
 so biologically there are plenty of species that display banding or patterns warning patterns to either be cryptical in the water or warn against being attacked 
 not the least of which is the pilot fish which spends a big slab of its life around the business end of a shark 
 on the human side
  walter starck an oceanographer has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s and
 pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands in a sea snake ceremony to ward off the shark god  
 so what 's going on here is this an idea lying wide out in the open for us to to consider
  we know that
 sharks use a range of sensors when they engage
  particularly for attack  but the sight sensor is the one that they use to identify the target and particularly in the last number of meters before the attack 
 it makes sense to pay attention to the biological anecdote because that 's time tested evolution over many millennia  
 but isn 't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts  the idea that there 's a kernel of truth thought to be
  important passed down from generation to generation
 so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior  i wanted to test this idea  i wanted to put some science to this
 anecdotal evidence  because if science could support this concept then we might have at least part of the solution to shark attack
 right under our very nose to do that i needed some experts in shark vision and shark neurology and a worldwide search again
  to the university of  w a on the doorstep here with the oceans institute  and professor nathan hart
 and his team had just written a paper
 which tells us  confirms that predatory sharks see in black and white or grayscale  
 so i called up nathan a
 little bit sheepishly actually about this idea that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes to produce a wetsuit to try and mitigate the risk of shark attack  and fortunately he thought that was a good
  idea  so what ensued is a collaborative bit of research supported by the west australian state government and we did three key things the first is that we
 mapped the characteristics the physical characteristics of the eyes of the three main predatory sharks so the great white  tiger and bull shark 
 we did that genetically and we did that anatomically  
 the next thing we did was to understand
  complex computer modeling what that eye can see
 at different depths  distances  light conditions  and water clarity
 in the ocean  
 and from there we were able to pinpoint two key characteristics what patterns and shapes would present the wearer as hidden or hard to make out in the water cryptic  
 and what patterns and shapes might provide the greatest contrast but provide the greatest breakup of profile so that
  that person wasn 't confused for shark prey or shark food  
 the next thing we needed to do was to convert this into wetsuits that people might actually wear  and to that end i invited ray smith a surfer
  industrial designer wetsuit designer and in fact the guy that designed the original quiksilver logo to come over and sit with the science team
 and
 interpret that science into
  aesthetic wetsuits that people might actually wear  
 and here 's an example of one of the first drawings  
 so this is what i call a don 't eat me wetsuit so this takes that banding idea  
 takes that banding idea it 's highly visible provides a highly disruptive profile and is intended to prevent the shark from considering that you would be ordinary food  and potentially even create confusion for the shark
  and this one 's configured to go with a a surfboard you can see that dark opaque panel on the front 
 and it 's particularly better for the surface where being backlit and providing a silhouette
 is problematic  
 second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit or the one which attempts to hide the wearer in the water column 
 there are three panels on this suit  and in any given conditions one or more of those panels will match the
  reflective spectra of the water so as to disappear fully or partially  leaving the last panel or panels to create a disruptive profile in the water column  and this one 's particularly
 well suited to
 the dive configuration so when you 're deeper under the water 
 so we knew that we had some really solid science here we knew if you wanted to stand out you needed to look stripy and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic
  to look like this  
 but the acid test is always going to be how would sharks really behave in the context of these patterns and shapes 
 and testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think 
 laughter so
 we have to bait the rig  because we need to get the statistical number of samples through to get the scientific evidence  and by baiting the rig we 're obviously changing shark behavior  
 we can 't put humans in the water  we 're ethically precluded from
 even using humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water  but nevertheless we started the testing process in january of this year  initially with tiger sharks and subsequently with great white sharks
  the way we did that was to get a
 perforated
 drum which is full of bait  wrap it in a neoprene skin  and then run two stereo underwater cameras to watch how the shark actually engages with that rig  
 and because we use stereo we can capture all the statistics on how big the shark is what angle it comes in at how quickly it leaves  and what its behavior is in an empirical rather than a subjective way 
 because we needed to preserve the scientific method  we ran a control rig which
  black neoprene rig just like a normal black wetsuit against the what we call sams technology rig  
 and the results were not just exciting  but very encouraging and today i would like to just
 give you a snapshot of two of those engagements so here we 've got
  engaging the black control rig which it had encountered about a minute and 
  now that exact same shark had engaged
 this sams rig which is the elude sams rig  about eight minutes before and spent six minutes circling it hunting for it looking for what it could smell and sense but not see  
 and this was the final engagement 
 great white sharks are more confident than the tigers  and
 here you see great white shark engaging a control rig so a black neoprene wetsuit  and going straight to the bottom  coming up
 and engaging 
 in contrast to the sams technology rig this is the banded one
 where it 's more tactile it 's more investigative it 's more apprehensive and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go
  's important for us that all the testing is done independently and the university of w a is doing the testing it 'll be an ongoing process it 's subject to peer review and subject to publication
  important that this
 concept is is led with the science 
 from the perspective of shark attack mitigation systems we 're a biotechnology licensing company so we don 't make wetsuits ourselves we 'll license others to do that but i thought you might be interested in seeing what sams technology looks like
 embedded in a wetsuit and to that end  for the first time  
  i can show you what biological adaptation science and design looks like in real life so i can welcome sam  the surfer from this side
  what have we done here  well to my mind rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention  
 we 've paid attention to the biological evidence  we 've put importance to the human anecdotal evidence  and we 've used science
 as a tool for translation translation of something that was already there into something that we can use for the benefit of
  mankind  and it strikes me that this idea of science as a tool for translation rather than invention
 is one that we can apply much more widely than this in the pursuit of innovation  
 after all did the wright brothers discover manned flight or did they observe the biological fact of flight and translate that mechanically
  replicate it in a way that humans could use 
 as for the humble wetsuit  
 who knows what oceanwear will look like in two years ' time in five years ' time or in fifty years ' time but with this new thinking  i 'm guessing there 's a fair chance it won 't be pure black
