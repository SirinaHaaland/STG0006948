  a scientist and engineer  i 've focused on efficiency
 for many years but efficiency can be a cult and today
 i 'd like to tell you about a journey that moved me out of the cult and back
 to a far richer reality 
 a few years ago  after finishing my ph d in london  i moved to boston i lived in boston
 and worked in cambridge  i bought a racing bicycle that summer  and i bicycled every day to work
 to find my way  i used my phone it sent me over mass ave massachusetts avenue  the shortest route
 from boston
 to cambridge  but
 after a month that i was cycling every day on the car packed mass ave i took a different route one day
  not entirely sure why i took a different route that day a detour  i just remember a feeling of
 surprise surprise at finding
 a street with no cars  as opposed to the nearby mass ave full of cars  
 surprise at finding a street draped by leaves and surrounded by trees  
 but after the feeling of
  i felt shame  how could i have been so blind for an entire month i was so trapped in my mobile app
 that a journey to work became one thing only 
 the shortest path  in this single journey there was no thought of enjoying the road  
 no pleasure in connecting with nature  no possibility of looking people in the eyes and why
 because i was saving a minute
 out of my commute 
 now let me ask you am i alone here  
 how many of you have never used a mapping app for finding directions 
 most of you if not all have and don 't get me wrong
  for encouraging people to explore the city you take your phone out and you know immediately where to go  
 however  the app also assumes there are only a handful of directions to the destination  
 it has the power
 to make those handful of directions the definitive direction to that destination
  to understanding how people experience the city  
 i used computer science tools to replicate social science experiments at scale  at web scale  
 i became
 captivated by the beauty and genius of traditional social science experiments done by jane jacobs
  milgram  kevin lynch  the result of that research has been the creation of
 new maps maps
 where you don 't only find the shortest path  the blue one but also the most enjoyable path  the red one  
 how was that possible  
  will get you from a to b imagination will take you everywhere so with a bit of imagination we needed to understand
 which parts of the city people find beautiful 
 at the university of cambridge with colleagues we thought about this simple experiment if i were to show you these two urban
  ask you which one is more beautiful which one would you say 
 don 't be shy  
 who says a  who says b brilliant  
 based on that idea  we built a crowdsourcing platform a web game  players are shown pairs of urban scenes and they 're asked to choose which one is more beautiful quiet
 and happy
  based on thousands of user votes then we are able to see where consensus emerges we are able to see which are the urban scenes that make people happy  
 after that work  i joined yahoo labs  and i teamed up with luca and rossano 
 and together we aggregated those winning locations in london to build a new map of the city 
 a cartography
 weighted for human emotions on this cartography you 're not only able to see and connect from point a to point b
 the shortest segments  but you 're also able to see the happy
 segment  the beautiful path  the quiet path in tests  participants found
 the happy the beautiful the quiet path far more enjoyable than
  the shortest one  and that just by adding a few minutes to travel time  participants also love to attach
 memories to places  shared memories that 's where the old bbc building was and personal memories
 that 's where i gave my first
  they also recalled how some paths smelled and sounded  
 so what if we had a mapping tool that would return the most enjoyable routes based not only on aesthetics but also based on smell  
 sound  and memories that 's where our research is going right now 
 more generally my research  what it tries to do is avoid the danger of the single path to avoid robbing people
 of fully experiencing the city in which they live  walk the path through the park not through the car park  and you have an entirely different path  
 walk the path full of people you love and not full of cars  and you have an entirely different path  it 's that simple 
 i would like to end with this thought do you remember the truman show it 's a media satire
  in which a real person doesn 't know he 's living in a fabricated world  perhaps
 we live in a world fabricated for efficiency 
 look at some of your daily habits  and as truman did in the movie  escape
 the fabricated world why well if you think that
 adventure is dangerous try routine it 's deadly  thank you
