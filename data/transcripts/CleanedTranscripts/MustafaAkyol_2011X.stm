  a few weeks ago i had a chance to go to saudi arabia  
 and the first thing i wanted to do as a muslim was to go to mecca and visit the kaaba the holiest shrine of islam 
 and i did that i put on my ritualistic dress i went to the holy mosque i did my prayers
  i observed all the rituals 
 and meanwhile besides all the spirituality  there was one mundane detail in the kaaba that was pretty interesting for me  there was no separation of sexes  
 in other words  men and women were worshiping all together  
 they were together while doing tawf the circular walk around the kaaba  they were together while praying  and if you wonder why
  this is interesting at all you have to see the rest of saudi arabia  because this a country
 which is strictly divided between the sexes  
 in other words  as men you are simply not supposed to be in the same physical space with women  and i noticed this in a very funny way 
 i left the kaaba to eat something in
 downtown mecca i headed to the nearest burger king restaurant  and i went there
 i noticed that there was a male section  which is carefully separated from the female section  i had to pay order and eat in the male section 
 it 's funny i said to myself you can mingle with the opposite sex at the holy kaaba but not at the burger king 
 laughter quite quite ironic ironic and it 's also i think quite telling  because the kaaba
 and the rituals around it are relics from the
  earliest phase of islam that of prophet muhammad  
 and if there was a big emphasis at the time to separate men from women the rituals around the kaaba could have been designed accordingly  but apparently that was not an issue at the time so the rituals 
  came that way this is also i think confirmed by the fact that the seclusion of women in creating a divided society is something that you also do not find in the koran the very core of
  islam  the divine core of islam that all muslims equally myself believe  
 and i think it 's not an accident that you don 't find this idea in the very origin of islam  
 because many scholars who study the history of islamic thought muslim scholars or westerners think that actually the practice of dividing men and women physically
 came as a later development in islam
 adopted some preexisting cultures and traditions of the middle east seclusion of women was actually
 a byzantine and persian practice and muslims adopted it and made it a part of their religion 
 actually this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon 
 what we call today islamic law and especially islamic culture and there are many islamic cultures actually the one in saudi arabia is much different from
 where i come from in istanbul or turkey  
 but still   if you 're going to speak about a muslim culture 
 this has a core  the divine message which began the religion  but then many traditions perceptions practices were added on top of it and these were traditions of the middle east medieval traditions
  or two lessons to take from that reality
 first of all muslims pious conservative believing muslims who want to be loyal to their religion should not cling onto everything in their culture thinking that that 's divinely mandated 
 maybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed 
 on the other hand the westerners
 who look at islamic culture and see some troubling aspects should not readily conclude that this is what islam ordains maybe it 's a
  middle eastern culture that became confused with islam  
 there is a practice called female circumcision 
 it 's something terrible horrible it is basically an operation to deprive women of sexual pleasure 
 and
 westerners europeans or americans who didn 't know about this before [ saw ] this practice
 within some of the muslim communities who migrated from north africa  and they 've thought
 what a horrible religion that is which
 ordains something like that but when you look at female circumcision you see that it has nothing to do with islam it 's just a north african practice
 which predates islam  it was there for thousands of years 
 and quite tellingly some muslims do practice it the muslims in north africa not in other places  but also the non muslim communities
 of north africa the animists
  some christians and even a jewish tribe in north africa are known to practice female circumcision  so what might look like a problem within islamic
 faith might turn out to be a tradition
 that muslims have subscribed to the same thing can be said for honor killings which is a recurrent theme in the western media and which is of course
  in some muslim communities that tradition  but in the non muslim communities of the middle east  such as some christian communities eastern communities you see the same practice we had a tragic case of an honor killing within turkey 's armenian community just a few months ago  
 now these are things about general culture but i 'm also very much interested in political culture
 and whether liberty and
 democracy is appreciated or whether there 's an authoritarian political culture culture in which the state is supposed to impose things on the citizens  
 and it is no secret that
 many islamic movements in the middle east tend to be authoritarian and some of the so called islamic regimes 
 such as saudi arabia iran and the worst case the taliban
 in afghanistan  they are pretty authoritarian no doubt about that for example in saudi arabia  there
  a phenomenon called the religious police and the religious police imposes the supposed islamic way of life on every citizen by force
 like women are forced to cover their heads wear the hijab the islamic
 head cover now that is pretty authoritarian and that 's something i 'm very much critical of but
 when i realized that the
  problem maybe lies in the political culture of the whole region not just islam  let me give you an example in turkey where i come from which is a very hyper secular republic  
 until very recently we used to have what i call secularism police which would guard the universities against veiled
 students  in other
  they would force students to uncover their heads  and i think forcing people to uncover their head is
 as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it it should be the citizen 's decision  but when i saw that i said maybe the problem is just an authoritarian culture in the region and
 some muslims have been influenced by that but the secular minded people can be influenced by that maybe it 's a problem of the political culture and
  we have to think about how to change that political culture 
 now these are some of the questions i had in mind a few years ago when i sat down to write a book  
 i said well i will do research about how islam actually
 came to be what it is today  and what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken 
 the name of the book is islam without extremes a muslim case for liberty 
  as the subtitle suggests  
 i looked at islamic tradition and the history of islamic thought from the perspective of individual liberty and i tried to find what are the strengths with regard to individual liberty and there are strengths in islamic tradition 
 islam actually as a monotheistic religion which defined man as a responsible agent by itself created the idea of the individual in the middle east  and saved it from the communitarianism the collectivism of the tribe  
 you can derive many ideas from that  but besides that
  saw problems within islamic tradition  
 but one thing was curious most of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later not from the very divine core of islam the koran  but from  again traditions 
  and mentalities or the interpretations of the koran that muslims made in the middle ages  
  personal sins like drinking  these things which make islamic law  the troubling aspects of islamic law were 
  later interpretations of islam which means that muslims can today look at those things and say well 
 the core of our religion is is here to stay with us  it 's our faith and we will be loyal to it but we can change how it was interpreted because it was interpreted according to the time
  and milieu in the middle ages now we 're living in a different world with different values and political systems that interpretation is quite possible and feasible 
 now  if i were the only person thinking that way we would be in trouble  
 but that 's not the case at all actually from the 19th century
  a whole revisionist reformist whatever you call it
 tradition  a trend in islamic thinking these were intellectuals or statesmen
 of the 19th century and later 20th century  which looked at europe basically and saw that europe has many things to admire like science and technology  but not just that also democracy  parliament  the idea of representation the idea of
  and they looked back at islamic tradition and saw that there are problematic aspects but they 're not the core of the religion so maybe they can be re understood and the koran can be reread
 in the modern world  that trend is generally called islamic
  it was advanced by intellectuals and statesmen not just as an intellectual idea though  but also as a political program and that 's why actually in the  19th century  the ottoman empire  which then covered the whole middle east 
 made very important reforms
 reforms like giving christians and jews an equal citizenship status  accepting a constitution accepting a representative parliament  advancing the
  idea of freedom of religion 
 that 's why the ottoman empire in its last decades turned into a proto democracy a constitutional monarchy 
 and freedom was a very important political value at the time 
 similarly in the arab world  there was what the great arab historian albert hourani defines as the liberal age  he has a book arabic thought in the liberal age and the liberal age he defines as 19th century and early
  quite notably this was the dominant trend in the early 20th century among islamic thinkers and statesmen and theologians  
 but there is a very curious pattern in the rest of the 20th century because we see a sharp decline in this islamic modernist line and in place of that what happens is that
 islamism grows
 as an ideology
  and which wants to shape society based on a utopian vision  so islamism is the problematic idea that that really
 created a lot of problems in the 20th century islamic world  and even the very extreme forms of islamism
 led to terrorism in the name of islam
 which is actually a practice that
  did not think that way  but there is a curious question if islamic modernism was so popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries why
  so popular in the rest of the 20th century 
 and this is a question i think which needs to be discussed carefully in my book i went into that question as well  and actually you don 't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that 
  look at the political history of the 20th century and you see things have changed a lot the contexts have changed 
 in the 19th century when muslims were looking at europe as an example  
 they were independent  they were more self confident in the early 20th century with the fall of the ottoman empire the whole middle east was colonized  
 and when you have colonialization what do you have you have
 so europe is not just an example now to emulate it 's an enemy to fight and to resist so
  there 's a very sharp decline in liberal ideas in the muslim world  and what you see is more more of a defensive  rigid reactionary strain which led to arab socialism arab nationalism and ultimately to the islamist ideology  
 and when the colonial period ended what you had in
 in place of that was
  but did not bring democracy to the country and established their own dictatorship  
 and i think the west
  at least some powers in the west particularly the united states made the mistake of supporting those secular dictators thinking that they were more helpful for their interests 
 but the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country and suppressed islamic groups in their country actually made
  much more strident so in the 20th century you had this vicious cycle in the arab world  where you have a dictatorship suppressing its own people
  including the islamic pious  and they 're reacting in reactionary ways  
 there was one country though  which was able to escape or stay away from that vicious cycle and that 's the country where i come from turkey 
 turkey has never been
  so it remained as an independent nation after the fall of the ottoman empire that 's one thing to remember 
 it did not share the same anti colonial hype that you can find in some other countries in the region  secondly and most importantly  
 turkey became a democracy earlier than any of the countries we are talking about in one thousand nine hundred and fifty turkey had the first free and fair elections  which ended the more autocratic secular regime  which was in 
  the beginning of turkey and the pious muslims in turkey saw that they could change the political system by voting
  and they realized that democracy is something compatible with islam compatible with their values and they 've been supportive of democracy
 that 's an experience that not every other muslim nation in the middle east had until very recently  secondly in the past two decades  thanks to globalization thanks to the market economy  thanks to the rise of a middle class
  we in turkey see what i define as a rebirth of islamic modernism 
 now there 's the more urban middle class pious muslims who  again look at their tradition and see that there are some problems in the tradition 
 and understand that they need to be changed and questioned and reformed  and they look at europe and see an example  again to follow  they see an example at least to take some inspiration from that 's why the eu process turkey 's effort to join the eu 
 has been supported
  inside turkey by the islamic pious while some secular nationalists were against it well
 that process has been a little bit blurred by the fact that not all europeans are that welcoming but that 's
 another discussion
 but the pro eu sentiment in turkey in the past decade has become almost an islamic cause and supported by the islamic liberals and the secular liberals as well of course  
 and thanks to that  turkey has been able to reasonably create
  reasonably create a success story in which islam and the most pious
 understandings of islam have become part of the democratic game and even contributes to the democratic and economic
 advance of the country and this has been an inspiring example right now
 for some of the islamic movements or some of the countries in
  you must have all seen the arab spring which began in tunis and in egypt arab masses just revolted against their dictators  
 they were asking for democracy they were asking for freedom and they did not turn out to be the islamist boogeyman that the dictators were always using to
 justify their regime  they said we want freedom we want democracy we are muslim believers  but we want to be
 living as free people in free societies
 of course this is a long road democracy is not an overnight
 achievement it 's a process  
 but this is a promising era in the muslim world  and i believe that the islamic modernism which began in the 19th century but which had a setback in the 20th century because of the political troubles of the muslim world 
 is having a rebirth  
 and i think the takeaway message from that would be that islam
  some of the skeptics in the west has the potential in itself to create its own way to democracy create its own way to liberalism create its own way to freedom  they just should be allowed to work for that  
 thanks so much
