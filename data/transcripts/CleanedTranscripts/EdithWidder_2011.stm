  i want to take you on a trip to an alien world  and it 's not a trip that requires
 light years of travel  but it 's to a place where
  of the animals in our ocean
 make light  
 i 've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence  
 i study it because i think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs  
 i also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution  
 but mostly
 i 'm entranced by it  
 since my my first dive in a deep diving submersible when i went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays  i 've been a bioluminescence junky  
 but i would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words  and they were totally
  totally inadequate to the task  
 i needed some way to share the experience directly and the first time i figured out that way was in this little single person submersible called deep rover 
 this next video clip you 're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence and the first thing you 're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across
  switched off it is possible to see their bioluminescence the light produced when they collide with the mesh
  this is the first time it has ever been recorded
  so i recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark adapted human eye  which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible  
 but just to try to prove that fact to you i 've brought along some bioluminescent plankton
 in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration
 if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible i have a flask
 that has bioluminescent plankton in it
  and you 'll note there 's no light coming from them right now either because they 're dead 
 or because i need to stir them up in some way for you to
  spend most of my time working in the dark i 'm used to that okay  
 so that
  alga need to be able to produce light  
 well it uses it to defend itself from its predators the flash is like a scream for help it 's what 's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and just like the alarm on your car or your house  
 it 's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder  thereby either leading
  to his capture or scaring him away there 's
 a lot of animals that use this trick for example this black dragonfish  it 's got a light organ under its eye it 's got a chin barbel  it 's got a lot of other light organs you can 't see but you 'll see in here in a minute  
 so
 we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime because the top speed of this fish is one knot which was the top speed of the submersible  but it was worth
  because we caught it in a special capture device brought it up into the lab on the ship  and then
 everything on this fish lights up it 's unbelievable the light organs under the eyes are flashing that chin barbel is flashing it 's got light organs on its belly that are flashing fin lights
 it 's a scream for help it 's meant to attract attention  it 's phenomenal
  and you normally don 't get to see this because we 've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets 
 there 's other ways you can
  yourself with light  for example this shrimp
 releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud  this blinds or distracts the predator  
 this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this now it may look like a tasty morsel or a pig 's head with wings
  but if it 's attacked  it
 puts out a barrage of light in fact a barrage of photon torpedoes i
 just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing  
 it 's
  there 's a lot of animals in the open ocean most of them that make light and we have a pretty good idea for most of them why they use it for finding food for attracting mates for defending against predators  
 but when you get down to the bottom of the ocean that 's where things get really strange and some of these animals
 are probably inspiration for the things you saw in avatar but you don 't have to travel to pandora to see them 
 they 're things like this this is a golden coral a bush
 grows very slowly in fact it 's thought that some of these are as much as three thousand years old  which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed 
 the other reason is this amazing bush glows  
 so if you brush up against it  any place you brushed against it you get this twinkling
  that 's just
 breathtaking  
 and you see things like this this looks like something out of a dr seuss book just all manner of creatures all over this thing and
 these are flytrap anemones  now if you poke it  it pulls in its tentacles  but if you keep poking it it starts to produce light  
 and it actually ends up looking like
  it produces these strings of light presumably as some form of defense 
 there are starfish that can make light  and there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms  
 this looks like a plant  but it 's actually an animal  and it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock  
  it can actually hold itself in very strong currents as you see here  but if we collect it very gently and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock  it produces 
  this light that propagates from stem to the plume  changing color as it goes from green to blue 
 colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure 
 but we have no idea why it does that here
  another one this is also a sea pen it 's got a brittle star hitching a ride  it 's a green saber of light  and like the one you just saw it can produce these as bands of light so if i squeeze the base 
 the bands go from base to tip 
 if i squeeze the tip they go from tip to base
 so what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle
 i 'd be very interested in your theories about what that 's about 
 so there 's a language of light in the deep ocean  and we 're just beginning to understand it  and one way we 're going about that is we 're imitating a lot of these displays  
 this is an optical lure that i 've used
  we call it the electronic jellyfish it 's just sixteen blue leds that we can program to do different types of displays  and we view it with a camera system i developed called eye in the sea that uses far red 
  light that 's invisible to most animals so it 's unobtrusive so i just want to show you some of the responses we 've elicited from animals in the deep sea  
  it  and right in the front is the electronic jellyfish  and when it starts flashing it 's just going to be one of the leds that 's flashing very fast  but as soon as it starts 
  to flash and it 's going to look big because it blooms on the camera i want you to look right here there 's something small there that responds we 're talking to something
  looks like a little of string pearls basically in fact three strings of pearls and
 this was very consistent this was in the bahamas at about two thousand feet we basically have a chat room going on here because once it gets started everybody 
  's talking  and i think this is actually a shrimp that 's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water but the cool thing is we 're talking to it we don 't know what we 're saying  
 and then finally i want to show you
 some responses that we recorded with the world 's first deep sea webcam which we had installed in monterey canyon last year we 've only just begun to analyze all of this data  
 this is going to be a glowing source first which is like bioluminescent bacteria  and it is an optical cue that there 's carrion on the bottom of the ocean  so this scavenger
  comes in 
 which is a giant sixgill shark  and i can 't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in because there 's bait right there but if it had been following the odor plume it would have come in from the other direction  and it does actually seem to be trying to eat
 the
 electronic jellyfish that 's a
 it 's going to be this pinwheel display  and this is a burglar alarm  
 and that was a humboldt squid a juvenile humboldt squid about three feet long this is at three thousand feet in monterey canyon  but if it 's a burglar alarm you wouldn 't expect it to attack 
  the jellyfish directly it 's supposed to be attacking what 's attacking the jellyfish  but we did see a bunch of responses like this this guy is a little more contemplative
  hey  wait a minute 
 there 's supposed to be something else there he 's thinking about it 
 but he 's persistent he keeps coming back  
 and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more and thinks maybe if i come in
 from a different angle
  we are starting to get a handle on this but only just the beginnings we need more eyes on the process so if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible by all means climb 
  in and take the plunge  this is something that should be on everybody 's bucket list  
  more than ninety percent ninety nine percent of the living space on our planet is ocean  
 it 's a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows
 and bizarre and wondrous creatures 
 alien life forms that you don 't have to travel to another planet to see
  if you do take the plunge  please remember to turn out the lights  but i warn you 
 it 's addictive  
 thank you
