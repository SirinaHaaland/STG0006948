  working mother look like if you ask the internet  this is what you 'll be told never mind that this is what you 'll actually produce
 if you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap
 'll notice a theme in these photos we 'll look at a lot of them that theme is amazing natural lighting  which 
 as we all know is the hallmark of every american workplace 
 there are thousands of images like these just put the term working mother into any google image search
  all over the internet they 're topping blog posts and news pieces  and i 've become kind of obsessed with them
 and the lie that they tell us and the comfort that they give us that when it comes to new working motherhood in america everything 's fine  
 but it 's not fine  as a country we are sending millions of women back to work
 every year incredibly and kind of horrifically
  after they give birth  that 's a moral problem but today i 'm also going to tell you why it 's an economic problem  
 i got so annoyed and obsessed with the unreality of these images which look nothing like my life that i recently decided to shoot
 and star in a parody series of stock photos that i hoped the world would start to use
 just showing the really awkward reality of going back to work when your baby 's food source is attached to your body
  i 'm just going to show you two of them 
 nothing says give that girl a promotion like leaking breast milk through your dress during a presentation you
 'll notice that there 's no baby in this photo because that 's not how this works not for most working mothers  
 did you know  and this will ruin your day that every time a toilet is flushed its contents are aerosolized and they 'll stay airborne for hours
  and yet for many new working mothers this is the only place during the day that they can find to make food for their newborn babies  
 i put these things a whole dozen of them into the world i wanted to make a point
 i didn 't know what i was also doing was opening a door because now  total strangers from all walks
  of life write to me all the time
 just to tell me
 what it 's like for them to go back to work within days or weeks of having a baby  
 i 'm going to share ten of their stories with you today they are totally real some of them are very raw  
 and not one of them looks anything like this here
 's the first i was an active duty service member at a federal prison  i returned to work after the maximum allowed eight weeks for my
  a male coworker was annoyed that i had been out on ' vacation '
 so he intentionally opened the door on me while i was pumping breast milk and stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway 
 most of the stories that these women total strangers send to me now are not actually even about breastfeeding 
 a woman wrote to me to say i gave birth to twins and went back to work after seven unpaid weeks emotionally
  a wreck  physically  i had a severe hemorrhage during labor and major tearing  
 so i could barely get up sit or walk my employer told me i wasn 't allowed to use my available vacation days because it was budget season 
 i 've come to believe that we can 't look situations like these in the eye
 because then we
 be horrified and if we get horrified then we have to do something about it so we choose to look at and believe this image 
 i don 't really know what 's going on in this picture because i find it
 weird and slightly creepy like what is she doing  but
 i know what it tells us it tells us that everything 's fine  this working mother all working mothers and all of their
  there 's nothing to see here 
 and anyway women have made a choice so none of it 's even our problem  
 i want to break this choice thing down into two parts the first choice says that women have chosen to work 
 so that 's not true today in america women make up forty seven percent of the workforce  
 and in forty percent of american households a woman is the sole or primary breadwinner our paid work is
  part a huge part of the engine of this economy and it is essential for the engines of our families on a national level our paid work is not optional 
 choice number two says that women are choosing to have babies  so women alone should bear the consequences of those choices 
 you know that 's one of those things that when you hear it in passing can sound correct i didn 't make you have a baby  i certainly wasn 't there when
  that happened but
 that stance
 ignores a fundamental truth  which is that our procreation on a national scale is not optional 
 the babies that women many of them working women are having today will one day fill our workforce  protect our shores make up our tax base 
 our procreation on a national scale
 is not optional
 these aren 't choices  we need women to work  we need working women to have babies  
 so we should make doing those things at the same time at least palatable right  
 ok  this is pop quiz time what percentage of working women in america do you think have no access to paid maternity leave
  mothers will not get one minute of paid leave after they have a baby  so now now you 're thinking about unpaid leave  
 it exists in america it 's called fmla it does not work 
 because of the way it 's structured all kinds of exceptions half of new mothers are ineligible for it 
 here 's what that looks like 
  adopted our son when i got the call the day he was born  i had to take off work 
 i had not been there long enough to qualify for fmla so i wasn 't eligible for unpaid leave 
 when i took time off to meet my newborn son  i lost my job 
 these corporate stock photos hide another reality 
 another layer of those who do have access to just that unpaid leave most women can 't afford to take much of it at all
 a nurse told me i didn 't qualify for short term disability because my pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition 
 we used up all of our tax returns and half of our savings during my six unpaid weeks we just couldn 't manage any longer physically it was hard but emotionally it was worse  i struggled for months being away from my son 
 so this decision to go back to work so early it 's a rational economic decision
 driven by family finances  but it 's often physically horrific because putting a human into the world
 is messy 
 a waitress told me with my first baby  i was back at work five weeks postpartum 
 with my second i had to have major surgery after giving birth  so i waited until six weeks to go back 
  of new working mothers in america will be back on the job within two weeks of giving birth 
 i worked as a bartender and cook  average of seventy five hours a week while pregnant  
 i had to return to work before my baby was a month old working sixty hours a week 
 one of my coworkers was only able to afford ten days off with
  this isn 't just a scenario with economic and physical implications  childbirth is and always will be an enormous psychological event 
 a teacher told me 
 i returned to work eight weeks after my son was born i already suffer from anxiety  but the panic attacks i had prior to returning to work
 were unbearable statistically speaking the shorter a woman 's leave after having a baby the more likely she will be to suffer from
  postpartum mood disorders like depression and anxiety  
 and among many potential consequences of those disorders 
 suicide is the second most common cause of death in a woman 's first year postpartum  
 heads up that this next story i 've never met this woman but
 i find it hard to get through i feel tremendous grief and rage that i lost an essential
  irreplaceable and formative time with my son  
 labor and delivery left me feeling absolutely broken 
 for months all i remember is the screaming  colic they said on the inside i was drowning 
 every morning i asked myself how much longer i could do it i
 was allowed
 to bring my baby to work
  i closed my office door while i rocked
 and shushed and begged him to stop screaming so i wouldn 't get in trouble 
 i hid behind that office door every damn day and cried while he screamed  i cried in the bathroom while i washed out the pump equipment 
 every day i cried all the way to work and all the way home again 
 i promised my boss that the work i didn 't get done during the day i 'd make up at night from home 
 i thought there 's just something wrong with me that i can 't swing this 
 so those are the mothers
 what of the babies  as a country do we care about the millions of babies born every year to working mothers  i say we don 't 
 not until they 're of working and tax paying and military serving age  we tell them we 'll see them in eighteen years and getting there is kind of on them 
 one of the reasons i know this is that
 babies whose mothers have twelve or more weeks weeks at home with them are more likely to get their vaccinations and their well checks in their first year  so those babies
 are more protected from deadly and disabling diseases  
 but those things are hidden behind images like this 
 america has a message for new mothers who work and for their babies  whatever time you get together
  you should be grateful for it  and you 're an inconvenience
 to the economy and to your employers 
 that narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories i hear 
 a woman told me i went back at eight weeks after my c section because my husband was out of work 
 without me my daughter had failure to thrive she wouldn 't take a bottle she started losing weight  
 thankfully my
  manager was very understanding he let my mom bring my baby who was on oxygen and a monitor  four times a shift so i could nurse her 
 there 's a little club of countries in the world
 that offer no national paid leave to new mothers care to guess who they are 
 the first eight make up eight million in total population 
 they are papua new guinea  suriname and the tiny island nations of micronesia  marshall islands
 niue palau and tonga number nine is the united states of america with three hundred and twenty million people 
 oh  that 's it that 's the end of the list 
 every other economy on the planet has found a way to make some level of national paid leave work
 for the people doing the work of the future of those countries but we say we couldn 't possibly
  do that 
 we say that the market will solve this problem  and then we cheer when corporations offer even more paid leave to the women who are already the highest educated and highest paid among us 
 remember that eighty eight percent 
 those middle and low income women are not going to participate in that 
 we know that there are staggering economic financial  physical and emotional
  costs to this approach  we have decided
 decided not an accident to pass these costs directly on to working mothers and their babies  
 we know the price tag is higher for low income women therefore disproportionately for women of color  we pass them on anyway  
 all of this is to america 's shame  but it 's also to america 's risk
 what would happen if all of these individual so called choices to have babies
 started to turn into individual choices
 not to have babies  
 one woman told me new motherhood is hard  it shouldn 't be traumatic 
 when we talk about expanding our family now  we focus on how much time i would have to care for myself and a new baby  
 if we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first
  we might stick with one kid 
 the birthrate needed in america to keep the population stable is two point one live births per woman 
 in america today  we are at one point eight six  
 we need women to have babies  and we are actively disincentivizing working women from doing that what would
  happen to work force to innovation to gdp 
 if one by one the working mothers of this country were to decide that they can 't bear to do this thing more than once  
 i 'm here today
 with only one idea worth spreading  and you 've guessed what it is it is long since time for the most powerful country on earth
 to offer national paid leave to the people doing the work of the future of this country and to the babies who represent that future  childbirth is a public good
  good  this leave should be 
 it should have no exceptions for small businesses length of employment or entrepreneurs  
 it should be able to be shared between partners  i 've talked today a lot about mothers but co parents matter on so many levels 
 not one more woman should have to go back to
  while she is hobbling and bleeding not one more family should have to drain their savings account
 to buy a few days of rest and recovery and bonding 
 not one more fragile infant should have to go directly from the incubator to day care because his parents have used up all of their meager time sitting in the nicu 
 not one more working family should be told that the collision of their work their needed work and their needed parenthood is their problem alone
 the catch is that when this is happening to a new family it is consuming 
 and a family with a new baby is more financially vulnerable than they 've ever been before so that new mother cannot afford to speak up on her own behalf  
 but all of us have voices  i am done 
 done having babies  and you
  you might be no baby  it should not matter we have to stop framing this as a mother 's issue or even a women 's issue  this is an american issue
 we need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us  we need to stop being comforted by them 
 we need to question why we 're told that this can 't work when we see it work everywhere all over the world  
 we need to recognize that this american reality
  to our dishonor
 and to our peril because this is not this is not and this is not what a working mother looks like
