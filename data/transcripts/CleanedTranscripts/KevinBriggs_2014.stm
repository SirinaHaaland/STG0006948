  i recently retired from the california highway patrol after twenty three years of service the
 majority of those twenty three years was spent patrolling the southern end
 of marin county which includes the golden gate bridge the bridge is an iconic structure
  known worldwide for its beautiful views of san francisco  the pacific ocean  and its inspiring architecture  
 unfortunately it is also a magnet for suicide being one of the most utilized sites in the world 
 the golden gate bridge opened in one thousand nine hundred and
  chief engineer in charge of building the bridge was quoted as saying the bridge is practically 
 suicide from the bridge is neither practical nor probable but
 since its opening over one thousand six hundred people have leapt to their death from that bridge  some believe that traveling
 between the two towers will lead you to another dimension this bridge
  has been romanticized as such
 that the fall from that frees you from all your worries and grief and the waters below
 will cleanse your soul  but let me tell you what actually occurs when the bridge is used as a means of suicide 
 after a free fall of four to five seconds  the body strikes the water
 at about
  miles an hour 
 that impact shatters bones  some of which then puncture vital organs 
 most die on impact those that don 't
 generally flail in the water helplessly  and then drown  i don 't think that those who contemplate this method of suicide
 realize how grisly a death that they will face
 this is the cord  
 except for around the two towers there is thirty two inches of steel paralleling the bridge 
 this is where most folks stand before taking their lives  
 i can tell you from experience
 that once the person is on that cord  and at their darkest time
  it is very difficult to bring them back 
 i took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an officer contemplating her life  
 i want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day
 in getting her back over the rail  
 when i first began working on the bridge  we had no formal training you struggled to funnel your way through these calls 
 this was not only a disservice
 to those contemplating suicide
  but to the officers as well 
 we 've come a long long way since then now veteran officers and psychologists train new officers 
 this is jason garber  
 i met jason on july twenty two of last year when i get received a call of a possible suicidal subject sitting on the cord near
  when i arrived  i observed jason
 speaking to a golden gate bridge officer 
 jason was just thirty two years old and had flown out here from new jersey 
 as a matter of fact  he had flown out here on two other occasions from new jersey
 to attempt suicide on this bridge after about an hour of speaking with jason he asked us if
  knew the story of pandora 's box  recalling your greek mythology  zeus created pandora  and sent her down to earth
 with a box and told her never ever open that box well
 one day curiosity got the better of pandora  and she did open the box 
  all sorts of evils against man the only good thing in the box
 was hope jason then asked us what happens when you open the box
 and hope isn 't there 
 he paused a few moments leaned to his right  and was gone
  young man from new jersey had just committed suicide 
 i spoke with jason 's parents that evening  
 and i suppose that when i was speaking with them that i didn 't sound as if i was doing very well  
 because that very next day their family rabbi called to check on me jason 's
  had asked him to do so the collateral damage of suicide affects so many people  
 i pose these questions to you 
 what would you do if your family member friend or loved one was suicidal what would you say  
 would you know what to say 
  's not just the talking that you do but the listening  listen to understand 
 don 't argue  blame  or tell the person you know how they feel  
 because you probably don 't by just being there 
 you may just be the turning point that they need 
 if you think someone is suicidal
  't be afraid to confront them and ask the question one way of asking them the question is like this 
 others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life have you had these thoughts 
 confronting the person head on may just save their life and be the turning point for
  some other signs to look for hopelessness  believing that things are terrible and never going to get better 
 helplessness  believing that there is nothing that you can do about it  
 recent social withdrawal and a loss of interest in life  
  this talk just a couple of days ago  and i received an email from a lady
 that i 'd like to read you her letter she lost her son on
 january nineteen
 of this year  
 and she wrote this me this email just a couple of days ago and it 's with her permission and blessing that i read this to you
  kevin  i imagine you 're at the ted conference 
 that must be quite the experience to be there  i 'm thinking i should go walk the bridge this weekend 
 just wanted to drop you a note hope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends  
  i 'm still pretty numb  but noticing more moments of really realizing mike isn 't coming home 
 mike was driving from petaluma to san francisco to watch the 49ers game with his father on january nineteen  
 he never made it there  
 i called petaluma police and reported him missing that evening  the next
  came to my home and reported that mike 's car was down at the bridge a witness had observed him jumping off the bridge at one 
 the previous day  thanks so much
 for standing up for those who may be only temporarily too weak to stand for themselves 
 who hasn 't been low before without suffering from a true mental illness
 it shouldn 't be so easy to end it 
 my prayers are with you for your fight the ggb golden gate bridge 
 is supposed to be a passage across
 our beautiful bay not a graveyard  good luck this week 
  i can 't imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the path that her son took that day 
 and also the courage just to carry on i 'd
 like to introduce you to
 a man i refer to as hope and courage on march eleven of two thousand and five i
  responded to a radio call of a possible suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk near the north tower  
 i rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk and observed this man kevin berthia standing on the sidewalk 
 when he saw me  he immediately traversed that pedestrian rail 
 and stood on that small pipe which goes around the tower 
 for the next hour and a half
  i listened
 as kevin spoke about his depression and hopelessness  
 kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that rail and give life another chance  
 when kevin came back over  i congratulated him this is a new beginning a new life 
  was it that made you come back
 and give hope and life another chance and you know what he told me  
 he said you listened you let me speak  and you just listened 
 shortly after this incident i received a letter from kevin 's mother  
 and i have that letter with me and i 'd
 like to read it to you
  briggs  nothing will erase the events of march eleven but you are one of the reasons kevin is still with us  
 i truly believe kevin was crying out for help  
 he has been diagnosed with a mental illness for which he has been properly medicated  i adopted kevin when he was only six months old
  of any hereditary traits but thank god  now we know 
 kevin is straight as he says  we truly thank god for you sincerely indebted to you
 and on the bottom she writes p s 
 when i visited san francisco general hospital that evening you were listed as the patient
  that one out 
 today  
 kevin is a loving father and contributing member of society  he speaks openly about the events that day and his depression
 in the hopes that his story will inspire others suicide is not just something i 've encountered on the job it 's personal
  grandfather committed suicide by poisoning 
 that act  although ending his own pain robbed me from ever getting to know him 
 this is what suicide does for most
 suicidal folks or those contemplating suicide they wouldn 't think of hurting another person they just want their own pain to end
  typically this is accomplished in just three ways  sleep  drugs or alcohol or death 
 in my career  i 've responded to and been involved in hundreds
 of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge of those incidents i 've been directly involved with
 but that 's two too many 
 one was jason the other was a man i spoke to for about an hour  
 during that time  he shook my hand on three occasions 
 on that final handshake  he looked at me  and he said kevin i 'm sorry
  i do want to tell you though  the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge
 do not commit suicide  
 additionally that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived
 and can talk about it that one to two percent most of those
  folks have said that the second
 that they let go of that rail they knew that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live  
 i tell people the bridge
 not only connects marin to san francisco  but people together also 
  that we make is something that each and every one of us should strive to do 
 suicide is preventable there is help  there is hope  thank you very much
