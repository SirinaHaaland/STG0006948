  i 'm not at all a cook  so don 't fear this is not going to be a cooking demonstration  but i do want to talk to you about something that i think is dear to all of us and that is bread something which is as simple
  as our basic  most fundamental human staple  and i think few of us
 spend the day without eating bread in some form
  unless you 're on one of these californian  low carb diets 
 bread is standard bread is not only standard in the western diet as i will show to you it is actually the mainstay of modern life  so i 'm going to bake bread
  in the meantime i 'm also talking to you so my life is going to be complicated  bear with me first of all a little bit of audience
 participation i have two loaves of bread here  
 one is a supermarket standard white bread pre packaged which i 'm told is called a wonderbread 
 laughter i didn 't know this word until i arrived  and this
  loaf of bread here we go i want to see a show of hands who prefers the whole meal bread  
 okay let me do this differently is anybody preferring the wonderbread at all i have two tentative male hands
  this so and i think
 it is because we feel that this kind of bread really is about authenticity  it 's about
 a traditional way of living a way that is perhaps more real more honest this is an image from tuscany where we feel agriculture is still
  and this is about good taste good traditions  why do we have this image  why do we
 feel that this is more true than than this  
 well i think it has a lot to do with our history  in the ten thousand years since agriculture evolved most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists or they 
  were closely related to food production  and we have this mythical image of how
 life was in rural areas in the past art has helped us to maintain that kind of image 
 it was a mythical past of course the reality is quite different these poor farmers working the land by hand or with their animals had yield levels 
  that are comparable to the poorest farmers today in west africa  but we have somehow in the course of the last few
  centuries or even decades  started to cultivate an image of a mythical rural agricultural past it
 was only two hundred years ago that we had the advent of the industrial revolution and while i 'm starting to make some bread for you here  
 it 's very important to understand what that revolution
  and it actually drove up our yields and even sort of horrible things like picking beans by hand can now be done
 automatically 
 all that is is a real  great improvement as we shall see of course we also particularly in the last decade 
  the world in a dense chain of supermarkets in a chain of global trade  
 and it means that you now eat products which can come from all around the world that is the reality of our modern life 
 now
 you may prefer this loaf of bread excuse my hands but this is how it is but actually the
  is this white wonder loaf and don 't despise the white bread
 because it really i think symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become
 plentiful and affordable to all  and that is a feat that we are not really conscious of that much but it has changed the
  this tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world  
 so what is happening  well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics 
 with the advent of the industrial revolution with modernization of agriculture in the last
 few decades since the
  world population in the meantime has has doubled that means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history  and that is the result directly 
 of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production  
  what happened to our bread in the meantime as food became plentiful here  it also meant that we were able to decrease the number of people
 working in agriculture
 to something like on average in the high income countries five percent or less of of the population in the u s only one percent of the people 
  are actually farmers and it frees us all up to do other things to sit at ted meetings and not to worry about our food
 that is historically a really unique situation  never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people 
 and never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact 
  and as it became cheaper bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things we added in more sugar  we add in raisins
 and oil and milk and all kinds of things to make bread from a simple food into kind of a support for calories  
 and today bread now is associated with obesity which is very strange
  it is the basic most fundamental food that we 've had in the last ten thousand years wheat is the most important crop the first crop we domesticated and the most important crop we still grow 
  today  but this is now this strange concoction of high calories  
  find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava so bread has become from a main staple 
 a source of calories associated with obesity and also a source of modernity of modern life  
 and the whiter the bread in many countries the better it is so this is the story of bread as we know it now but of course the price of
  mass production has been that we moved  large scale and large scale has meant
 destruction of many of our landscapes  destruction of biodiversity still a lonely emu here in the brazilian cerrado soybean fields the costs have been tremendous water pollution all the things you know about destruction of our
  what we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about  and this is where i have to query all of you how many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals 
 how many of you actually can make a bread in this way without starting with a bread machine or just
 which again evolutionarily speaking is very strange  
 in fact not many of you know that our bread of course was not a european invention it was invented by farmers in iraq and syria in particular the
 tiny spike on the left to the center is actually the forefather of wheat this is where it all comes from and where these farmers who actually ten thousand years ago  put us on the road of bread
 now it is not surprising that with this massification and large scale production there is a counter movement that emerged very much also here in california 
 let 's go back to this let 's go back to traditional farming let 's go back to small scale to farmers ' markets small bakeries
  don 't we all agree  i certainly agree  i would love to go back to tuscany to this kind of traditional setting gastronomy  good food 
 but this is a fallacy  and the fallacy comes from idealizing a past that we have forgotten about 
 if we do this if we want to stay with traditional small scale farming we are going actually to relegate these poor farmers and their husbands among whom i have lived for many
  years working without electricity and water to try to improve their food production we relegate them to poverty 
 what they want are implements to increase their production something to fertilize the soil something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market  
 we cannot just think that 
 is the solution to the world food problem  it 's a luxury solution for us who can afford it if you want to afford it
  in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this if we say just small scale production as is the tendency here to go back to local food means that a poor man 
  like hans rosling cannot even eat oranges anymore because in scandinavia we don 't have oranges 
  relegate the urban poor to starvation  so we must find other solutions 
 one of our problems is that world food production needs to increase very rapidly doubling by about two thousand and thirty 
 the main driver of that is actually meat  and meat consumption in southeast asia and china in particular is what
  need for animal protein is going to continue we can discuss alternatives in another talk perhaps one day  but this is our driving force  so what can we do 
 can we find a solution to produce more 
 yes  
 but we need mechanization  and i 'm making a real plea here  
 i feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer to work the land
 and bend over to grow a hectare of rice  one hundred and fifty thousand times just to
 plant a crop and weed it you cannot ask people to work under these conditions we need clever low key mechanization that avoids the problems of the large scale mechanization that we 've had  
 so what can we do we must feed three billion people
  in cities we will not do that through small farmers ' markets because these people have no small farmers ' markets at their disposal 
 they have low incomes  and they benefit from cheap  affordable  safe and diverse food that 's what we must aim for in the next twenty to thirty years  but yes 
  there are some solutions  and let me just do one simple conceptual thing if i plot science as a proxy for control of the production process and scale what you see is
  that we 've started in the left hand corner with traditional agriculture which was sort of 
 we 've moved towards  large scale and very high control what i want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional 
  scale not just in terms of the scale of the fields but in terms of the entire food network that 's where we should move
  and the ultimate may be but it doesn 't apply to cereals that we have entirely closed ecosystems
 the horticultural systems right at the top left hand corner  
 so we need to think differently about agriculture science agriculture science for most people and there are not many farmers among you here
 has this name of being bad of being about pollution about large scale about the destruction of the
  environment that is not necessary we need more science and not less  and we need good science  so what kind of science can we have  well first of all i think we can do 
  much better on the existing technologies use biotechnology where where useful particularly in pest and disease resistance 
  with a resolution of half an inch we have much cleverer irrigation we do not need to spill the water if we don 't want to  
 and we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of
 we need to think that land is multi functional it has different functions there are different ways in which we
 must use it for residential for nature for agriculture purposes  and we also need to
 re examine livestock 
 go regional and go to urban food systems i want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements  i want to have horticulture and greenhouses 
  on top of residential areas  and i want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses and from the fermentation of crops to heat our residential areas 
  using biological agriculture but we can do a lot more 
 and the main thing that i would really ask all of you as you go back to your countries or as you stay here 
 ask your government for an integrated food policy food is as important
 as energy as security as the environment  everything is linked
  we can do that in fact in a densely populated country like the river delta where i live in the netherlands we have combined these functions  so this is not science fiction we can combine 
  things even in a social sense of making the rural areas more accessible to people to house for example the chronically sick there is all kinds of things we can do 
  about your own food chain talk to farmers when was the last time you went to a farm and talked to a farmer  talk to people in restaurants understand where you are in the food chain where your food 
  comes from understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events  and that frees you up to do other things  
  that there are also many people who are still in this situation  who are still struggling for their daily food  
 and the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution 
 is really not morally justified we need to help to lift them out of poverty  we need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive
 never before as i said has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few and never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap  
 and i think there is nobody else who has expressed better to me the idea that food in the end  in our own
  it 's not about nutrients and calories  it 's about sharing  it 's about honesty it 's about identity who said this so beautifully was mahatma gandhi seventy five
  years ago when he spoke about bread he did not speak about rice  in india  he said to those who have to go without two meals a day  god can only appear as bread
  evolutionarily speaking is
