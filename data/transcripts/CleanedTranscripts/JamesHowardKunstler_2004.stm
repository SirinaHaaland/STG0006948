  of our everyday environments in america is entropy made visible
  you can describe this you know  i like to call it the national automobile slum you can call it suburban sprawl 
 i think it 's appropriate to call it the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world  you can call it a
 technosis externality clusterfuck
  and it 's a tremendous problem for us 
 the outstanding the salient problem about this for us is that these are places that are not worth caring about we 're
 going to talk about that some more 
 a sense of place your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings and to employ
  employ the vocabularies grammars syntaxes rhythms and patterns of architecture
 in order to inform us who we are the public realm
 in america
 has two roles it is the dwelling place of our civilization
  and our civic life and it is the physical manifestation of the common good 
 and when you degrade the public realm you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life and the character of all the enactments
 of your public life and communal life that take place
 there  the public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in america because we don 't have the 
  cathedral plazas and
  market squares of older cultures  and
 your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about
 all comes from a body of culture that we call the the culture of civic design this is a body of knowledge method
  and principle that we
 threw in the garbage
 after world war ii and decided we don 't need that anymore we 're not going to use it  
 and consequently  we can see the result all around us  
 the public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically  
 but it has to inform us where we are in our culture where we 've come from what kind of people we are  and it needs to by doing that
 it needs to afford us a glimpse
 to where we 're going
 in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present  
 and if there is one tremendous if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we 've built the human environments we 've made for ourselves in the last fifty years it is that it has deprived us
 of the ability to live
  hopeful present
  the environments we are living in more typically are like these you know 
 this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town and
 remember to create a place of character and quality you have to be able to define space so how is that being
  over here and try to look at the target store over here you can 't see it because of the curvature of the earth 
 that 's nature 's way of telling you that you 're doing a poor job of defining space consequently these will be places that nobody
 wants to be in these will be places that are not worth caring about
  thousand places that are not worth caring about in the united states today when we have enough of them we 're going to have a nation that 's not worth defending  
 and i want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like iraq spilling their blood in the sand 
 and ask yourself what is their last thought of home i hope it 's not the curb cut between the chuck e cheese and the target store because that 's not good enough
  for americans
 to be spilling their blood for we need better places in this country 
 public space this is a good public space it
 's a place worth caring about it 's well defined it is emphatically an outdoor public room it has something that is terribly important it has what 's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge that 's a fancy way of saying it 's got shops
  destinations things go in and out of it  it 's permeable the beer goes in and out the waitresses go in and out  and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in you know 
 in these places in other cultures
  people just go there voluntarily because they like them we don 't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here
  kwanzaa festival people just go
 because it 's pleasurable to be there  but this is how we do it in the united states 
 probably the most significant public space failure in america designed by the leading architects of the day harry cobb and i m pei boston city hall plaza a public place so dismal that the winos don 't even want to go there
  and we can 't fix it because i m pei 's still alive and every year harvard and m i t have a joint committee to repair it  and every year they fail to because they don 't want to hurt i m pei 's feelings  
 this is the other side of the building this was the winner of an international design award in 
 something like that it wasn 't pei and cobb another firm designed this but there 's not enough prozac in the world to make people
  feel ok
 about going down this block  
 this is the back of boston city hall the most important you know significant civic building in albany
 excuse me in in boston and
 what is the message that is coming what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming from this building and how is it informing us about who we are this
  fact would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of josef stalin pol pot 
 saddam hussein  
 and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building  because then we 'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us you know that it 's a despotic building it wants us to feel like termites
  this is it on a smaller scale the back of  the civic center in my town saratoga springs new york by the way when i showed this
 slide to a group of kiwanians in my town  they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken and
 they shouted at me and said it was raining that day when you took that picture
  because this was perceived to be a weather problem you know 
 this is a building
 designed like a dvd player audio jack power supply
  you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms right you know we hire firms to design these things you can see exactly what went on three o 'clock in the morning at the design meeting you know
  eight hours before deadline four architects trying to get this building in on time right 
 and they 're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings and the renderings  and all the chinese food caskets are lying on the table  
 and i mean what was the conversation that was going on there
 because you know what the last word was what the last sentence was of that meeting it was fuck it 
 that
 that is the message of this form
 of architecture the message is we don 't give a fuck  we don 't give a fuck
  so i went back on the nicest day of the year just to you know do some reality testing  and in fact  he will not even go down there because 
 it 's not interesting enough for his clients  you know the burglars the muggers it
 's not civically rich enough for them to go down there  
  the pattern of main street usa in fact  this pattern of building downtown blocks all over the world is fairly universal it 's not that complicated buildings 
  more than one story high built out to the sidewalk edge  so that
  and so on you make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor they haven 't learned that in monterey if you go out to the the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center you 'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner it 's
 really incredible anyway  this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building and this is what happened when in glens falls new york when we tried to do it again where it was missing right so the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story
  above grade to make it sporty  
 ok that completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk where the theoretical pedestrians are of course they
 'll never be there 
 as long as this is in that condition 
 then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed we pop a handicapped ramp on that and then to make ourselves feel better we put a nature
 band aid in front of it  and that 's how we do it  i call them nature band aids because there 's a general
 idea in america that the the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature
 and in fact the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism good buildings not just flower beds not just cartoons of the sierra nevada mountains
  know that 's not good enough we have to do good buildings the street trees have really four jobs to do and that 's it to spatially denote the pedestrian realm to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway 
 to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk and to soften the hardscape of the buildings and to
 create a ceiling a vaulted ceiling over the street at its best  and that that 's it  those are the four jobs of the the
 street trees they 're not supposed to be a cartoon of the north woods they 're not supposed to be a set for the
 last of the mohicans you know  one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our
 understanding of the distinction between the country and the town between the urban and the rural they 're not the same thing and we 're not going to cure the
  problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city  which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time  here you see it on a small scale the mothership has landed
 have stepped out to test the bark mulch to see if they can inhabit this planet 
 a lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in america was such a trauma
 that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city city life and everything connected with it  and so what you see fairly early 
 in the mid 19th century is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city  which is going to be life in the country for everybody  
 and that starts to be delivered in the form of the the railroad suburb the country villa along the railroad line
 which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city  but to return to the countryside every night and believe me there were no wal marts or convenience stores out there then  so it really was a form 
  of country living but what happens is of course it mutates over the next eighty years and it turns into something rather insidious it becomes a cartoon of a country house in a cartoon of the country and that 's the great
 of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule because it hasn 't delivered what it 's been promising for half a century now
 and these are
 these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there you know  basically a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state emphatically 
 i 'm a little cabin in the woods there 's nothing on either
 side of me i don 't have any eyes on the side of my head i can 't see 
 so you have this one last facade of the house the front which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house because
 notice the porch here  unless the people that live here are munchkins
  nobody 's going to be using that  this is really in fact a television
 broadcasting a show twenty four seven called we 're normal we 're normal
  we 're normal please respect us we 're normal we 're normal we 're normal  but we know what 's going on in these houses you know we know that little skippy is loading his uzi down here 
 getting ready for homeroom 
 we know that heather his sister heather fourteen years old is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit 
 because these places these habitats are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children  and they don 't have a lot of
  experience with medication so they take the first one that comes along often these are not good enough for americans 
 these are the schools we are sending them to the hannibal lecter central school  
 las vegas nevada this is
 a real school  you know but there 's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver
 so every effort is made to keep them within the the building notice that nature is present 
 we 're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not we are entering an epochal period of change in the world and certainly in america
  change absolutely everything 
 chris asked me not to go on too long about this and i won 't except to say there 's not going to be a hydrogen economy  forget it it 's not going to happen
  we 're going to have to do something else instead  we 're going to have to 
 and re size virtually everything we do in this country and we can 't start soon enough to do it  we 're going to have we 're going to have to
  live closer to where we work we 're going to have to live closer to each other we 're going have to grow more food closer to where we live the
 age of the three thousand mile caesar salad is coming to an end  
 we 're going to have to we have a railroad system that the bulgarians would be ashamed of 
 we gotta do better than that and we should have started two days before yesterday 
 we are fortunate that the new urbanists were
  there for the last ten years excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage by our parents ' generation after world war ii because we 're going to need it if we 're going 
  to learn how to reconstruct towns we 're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill in order to re learn how to compose meaningful places places that are integral that allow that are
  living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life and our communal life deployed in an integral fashion  
 so that you know  the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business of culture and of governance
  what the building blocks of these things are the street  the block how to compose public space that 's both large and small the courtyard the civic square
 and how to really make use of of this property 
 we can see some of the first ideas for retro fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in america  the dead malls what are we going to do with them well in point of fact  most of them are not going to make it they 're not going to be
  salvage yards of the future some of them we 're going to fix though and we 're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development  
 and if we 're lucky the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers in our existing towns and cities and by the way 
 our towns and cities are where they are and
  grew where they were because they occupy all the important sites  and most of them are still going to be there although the scale of them is probably going to be
 diminished 
 we 've got a lot of work to do  we 're not going to be rescued by the hyper car we 're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels no amount or combination
  of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we 're running the way we 're running it we 're going to have to do everything very differently
  and america 's not prepared we are sleepwalking into the future  we 're not ready for what 's coming at us  
 so i urge you all to do what you can life in the
 the 
  century is going to be about living
  be prepared to be good neighbors be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens
