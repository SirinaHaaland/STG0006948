  so what does it mean for a machine to
  we will demonstrate the concept of machine athleticism and the research to achieve it with the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters or quads for short
 quads have been around for a long time they 're so popular these days because they 're mechanically simple 
 by controlling the speeds of these four propellers  these machines can roll  pitch  yaw and accelerate along their common orientation 
 on board are also a battery a computer
 various sensors and wireless radios 
 quads are extremely agile but this agility comes at a cost  
 they are inherently unstable and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly  
  how did it just do that 
 cameras on the ceiling and a laptop serve as an indoor global positioning system  it 's used to locate objects in the space that have these reflective markers on them 
 this data is then sent to another laptop that is running estimation and control algorithms which in turn sends commands to the quad  which is also running estimation and control algorithms
  the bulk of our research is algorithms  it 's the magic that brings these machines to life  
 so how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete we use something broadly called model based design 
 we first capture the physics with a mathematical model
 of how the machines behave  
 we then use a branch of mathematics called control theory to analyze these models and also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them
  example that 's how we can make the quad hover  we first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations  we then manipulate these equations
 with the help of control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad  let me demonstrate the strength of this approach
 suppose that we want this quad to not only hover but to also balance this pole with a little bit
  of practice it 's pretty straightforward for a human being to do this although we do have the advantage of having two feet on the ground and the use of our very versatile hands  
 it becomes a little bit more difficult
 when i only have one foot on the ground and when i don 't use my hands  
 notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top
  you can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments to keep the pole balanced 
 how did we design the algorithms to do this we added the mathematical model of the pole to that of the quad  once we have a model of the combined
  system  we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it here you see that it 's stable and
 even if i give it little nudges  it goes back
 to the nice  balanced position we can also augment the model to include where we want the quad to be in space  using this
  made out of reflective markers i can point to where i want the quad to be in space a fixed distance away from me 
 the key to these acrobatic maneuvers is
  designed with the help of mathematical models and control theory let 's tell the quad to come back here and let the pole drop and i will next demonstrate the importance
 of understanding physical models and the workings of the physical world
  notice how the quad lost altitude when i put this glass of water on it 
 unlike the balancing pole i did not include the mathematical model of the glass in the system in fact the system doesn 't even know that the glass is there 
 like before i could use the pointer
 to tell the quad where i want it to be in space
  you should be asking yourself  why doesn 't the water fall out of the glass 
 two facts  the first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way 
 the second is that the propellers are all pointing in the same direction of the glass pointing up 
 you put these two things together  the net result is that all side forces on the glass are small and are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects which at these speeds are negligible
 that 's why you don 't need to model the glass it naturally doesn 't spill no matter what the quad does
  the lesson here is that some  high performance
 tasks are easier than others and that understanding the physics of the problem tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard 
 in this instance carrying a glass of water is easy balancing a pole is hard 
 we 've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured can a machine also perform
  with extreme physical damage  
 conventional wisdom says that you need at least four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly  because there are four degrees of freedom to control 
 roll  pitch  yaw and acceleration  
 hexacopters and octocopters with six and eight propellers can provide redundancy  but quadrocopters are much more popular
 because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs
 if we analyze the mathematical model of this machine with only two working
  we discover that there 's an unconventional way to fly it
 we relinquish control of yaw  but roll 
  pitch and acceleration can still be controlled with algorithms that exploit this new configuration 
 mathematical models tell
  us exactly when and why this is possible in this instance this knowledge allows us to design novel machine architectures
 or to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage  just like human athletes do instead of building machines with redundancy  
 we can 't help but hold our breath when we watch a diver
 diver somersaulting into the water or when a vaulter is twisting in the air the ground fast approaching 
 will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry will the vaulter stick the landing  
 suppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip and finish off at the exact same spot that it started 
 this maneuver is going to happen so quickly that we can 't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution there simply isn 't enough time  
 instead what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly observe how it finishes
  maneuver and then use that information to modify its behavior so that the next flip is better  
 similar to the diver and the vaulter it is only through repeated practice that the maneuver can be learned and executed to the highest standard
  striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports how do we make a machine do what an athlete does seemingly without effort
  this quad has a racket strapped onto its head
 with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple so not too large  the following calculations are made every twenty milliseconds or fifty times per second  we first figure out where the ball
  we then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball so that it flies to where it was thrown from third a trajectory is planned
 that carries the quad from its current state to the impact point with the ball fourth  
 we only execute twenty milliseconds ' worth of that strategy twenty milliseconds later  the whole process is repeated until the quad strikes the ball
  machines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own  they can do it collectively these three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net
  an extremely dynamic and
 collective maneuver to launch the ball back to me  
 notice that at full extension these quads are vertical 
  in fact when fully extended 
 this is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels at the end of their launch 
 the algorithms to do this are very similar to what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me 
 mathematical models are used to continuously re plan a cooperative strategy fifty times per second 
 everything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities
  what happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being what i have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor
 mainly used in gaming it can recognize what my various body parts are doing in real time  
 similar to the pointer that i used earlier  we can use this as inputs to the system  we now have
  a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures
  doesn 't have to be virtual  it can be physical take this quad for example  it 's trying to stay at a fixed point in space 
 if i try to move it out of the way  it fights me  and moves back to where it wants to be 
 we can change this behavior however  we can use mathematical models to estimate the force that i 'm applying to the quad
  once we know this force we can also change the laws of physics as far as the quad is concerned of course 
 here the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid  
 we now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine 
 i will use this new capability to position this camera carrying quad to the appropriate location for filming the remainder of this
  demonstration 
  so we can physically interact with these quads and we can change the laws of physics 
  gravity will be increased until we 're all back on planet earth but i assure you we won 't get there  okay here goes
  you 're all thinking now these guys are having way too much fun and you 're probably also asking yourself  why exactly are they building machine athletes 
 some conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom is to hone skills and develop capabilities  others think that it has more of a social role that it 's used to bind the group
 similarly  we use the analogy of sports and athleticism to create new algorithms for machines to push them to their limits 
 what impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life like all our past creations and innovations they may be used to improve the human condition
 or they may be misused and abused this is not a technical choice we are faced with it 's a social one let 's make the right choice
  that brings out the best in the future of machines just like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us 
 let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain they 're the current members of the flying machine arena research team
