  we are drowning in news  
 reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year that 's just one source 
 my question is how many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run 
 that 's the idea behind the
  long news it 's a project by the long now foundation which was founded by tedsters including kevin kelly and stewart brand 
 and what we 're looking for is news stories that might still matter fifty or one hundred or ten thousand years from now
 and when you look at the news through that filter a lot falls by the wayside to take the top stories from
  this last year is this going to matter in a decade or this or this 
 really 
 is this going to matter in fifty or one hundred years 
 okay that was kind of cool 
 laughter but the top story of this past year was the economy and i 'm just betting that sooner or later this particular recession is going to be old news  
 so what kind of stories
  might make a difference for the future  
 well let 's take science
  someday little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things 
 that someday is already here if you 're a mouse some recent stories nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom 
 they 're sending genes into the brain a robot they built that can crawl through the human body  what about resources
  how are we going to feed nine billion people we 're having trouble feeding six billion today as we heard yesterday there 's over a billion people hungry  
 britain will starve without genetically modified crops  
 bill gates fortunately has bet a billion on [ agricultural ] research  
 what about global politics the world 's going to be very different when and if china sets the agenda and they may they 've overtaken the
 u s as the world 's biggest car market 
 they 've overtaken germany as the largest exporter  and they 've started doing dna tests on kids to choose their careers 
 we 're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know some recent discoveries  there 's an ant colony from argentina that has now spread to every continent but
  robot scientist that 's made a discovery soon science may no longer need us  
 and life may no longer need us either a microbe wakes up after one hundred and twenty thousand years it seems that with or without us life will go on 
 but my pick for the top long news story of this past year was this one water found on the moon makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there 
  and if nasa doesn 't do it china might or somebody in this room might write a big check
