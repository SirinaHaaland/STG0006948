  our ability to create
 and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time 
 of course there are other challenges health care disease burdens and pandemics environmental challenges
 and of course
  radicalized terrorism  
 however to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that i 've just elucidated 
 more importantly  unless and until we solve economic growth and
  to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today  
 whether it 's health care  education or economic development  
 the fundamental question is this 
 how are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the united states and across europe
 at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth
  after the financial crisis 
 they continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth  
 capital labor and productivity  
 in particular  these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits
  the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor
 and they also see productivity stalling  
 in a similar vein 
 how are we going to create economic growth in the emerging markets where ninety percent of the world 's population lives and where on average  seventy percent of the population is under the age of twenty five 
 in these countries it is essential that they grow at a minimum of seven percent a year in order to put a dent in poverty
 and to double per capita incomes in one generation  
 and yet today the largest emerging economies countries with at least fifty million people continue to struggle to reach that seven percent magic mark  
 worse than that countries like india  russia south africa brazil and even china are falling below that seven percent number and in many cases
 actually regressing 
 economic growth matters with economic growth countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle
 of upward mobility  opportunity and improved living standards 
 without growth countries contract and atrophy not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of
  life and how lives are lived economic growth matters powerfully for the individual if
 growth wanes  the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises 
 and societies become dimmer  
 coarser
 and smaller  the context matters  and countries in emerging markets do not need to grow
 at the same rates as developed countries now i know some of you in this room
 find this to be a risky proposition 
 there are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what 's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth 
 you worry about the overpopulation of the planet  and looking at the un 's recent statistics and
  projections that the world will have eleven billion people on the planet before it plateaus in two thousand one hundred you 're concerned about what that does to natural resources arable land potable water  energy and minerals 
 you are also concerned about the degradation of the environment  
 and you worry
  about how man embodied in the corporate globalist has become greedy and corrupt  
 but i 'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world 
 and more importantly it 's not just economic growth that has been driven
 by capitalism  
  the definition of capitalism  very simply put 
 is that the factors of production such as trade and industry  capital and labor are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state 
 it 's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se
 but what has happened to capitalism and to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term  we 're going to have to pursue
  it with a better form of economic stance 
 economic growth needs capitalism but it needs it to work properly  
 and as i mentioned a moment ago  the core of the capitalist system
 has been defined by private actors and even this however
  when in practical experience capitalism is much more of a spectrum  
 and we have countries such as china which have practiced more state capitalism  and we have countries like the unites states which are more market capitalist 
 our efforts to critique the capitalist system however have tended to focus on countries like china that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism
 however  there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism  particularly those embodied by the united states 
 this is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption
 and worse still  it 's increasing
  income inequality the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many 
 the two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social
  in order to think about that framing we have to ask ourselves how does capitalism work today 
 very simplistically capitalism is set on the basis of an individual utility 
  selfish individual who goes after what he or she wants and only after they 've maximized their utility do they then decide it 's important to provide support to other social contracts 
  course  in this system governments do tax and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs  recognizing that government 's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods  
 but nevertheless this framework this two stage framework
 is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model  i would argue that
  there are two sides to this challenge  
 first of all we can draw on the right wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism  
 in particular right leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth for example
  sending children to school parents could earn money for that or getting their children inoculated or immunized  parents could get paid for doing that 
 now quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway  the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like mexico
  brazil and also in pilot programs in new york 
 but there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left leaning policies 
 arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it 's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of china 
 but also
 we 've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs things 
  like the corporate social responsibility programs  albeit small in scale are moving in that right direction 
  tended to blur the lines between government ngos and private sector two very good examples of this are the 
  united states  when the infrastructure rollout was really about public private partnerships more recently of course  the advent of the internet has also proven 
  to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society  
  continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic
 and being unnecessarily ideological  
 in order to create sustainable long term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today  we 're going to have to be more
  one could react to your last sentence by saying growth is also an ideology it 's possibly the dominant ideology of our our times what do you say to those
  i think that that 's completely legitimate  and i think that that we 're already having that discussion there 's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring 
  people 's success and improvements in living standards and so i think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people 's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world bg so you 're basically pleading for rehabilitating growth but the only way for that happen without
  is for economic growth somehow to decouple from the underlying use of resources do you see that happening dm well i think that i 'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity 
  i think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite scarce and depleting resources that we know today we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world
  we 've seen the club of rome we 've seen
 previous claims that the world would be running out of resources and it 's not to argue that those things are not valid  but i think with ingenuity we could see desalination i think we could reinvest 
  in energy so that we can actually get better outcomes and so in that sense i 'm much more optimistic about what humans can do bg the thing that
  growth and taking a different direction is that you 're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism
 with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or
 developing a bigger role for business in social issues is that what you 're suggesting dm i 'm suggesting we have to be  open minded i think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them
  it 's no accident that today the largest economy in the world the united states has democracy liberal democracy as it 's core political stance and it has free market capitalism to the extent that it is free
 free market capitalism as its economic stance the second largest economy is china it has  deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism which is a completely different model these two 
  countries completely different political models and completely different economic models and yet they have the same income
  inequality number measured as a gini coefficient i think those are the debates we should have because it 's not clear at all what model we should be adopting  and i think there needs to be much more discourse and much more humility about what we know and what we don 't know bg 
 one last question the cop21 is going on in paris if you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there what would you say
  be very much about being open minded as you 're aware the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now in copenhagen ' seventy two in stockholm
 and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement in fact there 's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want
 what emerging market countries want emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we don 't have political uncertainty in the those countries developed countries recognize 
  that they have a real important responsibility not only just to manage their co2 emissions and some of the degradation that they 're contributing to the world but also as trendsetters in r & d 
  and so they have to come to the table as well  but in essence it cannot be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets
  without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they 're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets
