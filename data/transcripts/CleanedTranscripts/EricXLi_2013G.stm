  my name is eric li and i was born here
 but no i wasn 't born there this was where i was born
 shanghai at the height of the cultural revolution my grandmother tells me that she heard
  the sound of gunfire along with my first cries when i was growing up i was told a story
 that explained all i ever needed to know about humanity it went like this all human societies develop in linear progression
 beginning with primitive society then slave society feudalism capitalism socialism and finally guess where we end up communism
 sooner or later all of humanity
 regardless of culture language nationality will arrive at this final stage of political and social development
 the entire world 's peoples will be unified in this paradise on earth and live happily ever after
 but before we get there we 're engaged in a struggle between good and
  evil the good of socialism against the evil of capitalism and the good shall triumph
 that of course was the meta narrative distilled from the theories of karl marx
 and the chinese bought it
 we were taught that grand story day in and day out it became part of us and we believed in it the story was a bestseller
 about one third of the entire world 's population lived under that
  narrative
 then the world changed overnight
 as for me disillusioned by the failed religion of my youth i went to america and became a berkeley hippie laughter
 now as i was coming of age something else happened
 as if one big story wasn 't enough i was told another one
 this one was just as grand
 it also claims that all human societies develop in a linear progression towards a singular end this one went as follows
 all societies regardless of culture be it christian muslim confucian
 must progress from traditional societies in which groups are the basic units to modern societies in which atomized individuals are the sovereign units
  these individuals are by definition rational and they all want one thing the vote
 because they are all rational once given the vote they produce good government and live happily ever after
 paradise on earth again
 sooner or later electoral democracy will be the only political system for all countries and all peoples with a free market to
  make them all rich
 but before we get there
 we 're engaged in a struggle between good and evil laughter
 the good belongs to those who are democracies and are charged with a mission of spreading it around the globe
 sometimes by force
 against the evil of those who do not hold elections
  all who would hold power eric x li
 now laughter applause
 this story also became a bestseller
 according to freedom house the number of democracies went from forty five in
  the last twenty years western elites tirelessly trotted around the globe selling this prospectus
 multiple parties fight for political power and everyone voting on them is the only path to salvation to the long suffering developing world
 those who buy the prospectus are destined for success those who do not are doomed to fail
 but this time the chinese didn 't buy it
  me once laughter
 the rest is history
 in just thirty years china went from one of the poorest agricultural countries in the world to its second largest economy
 six hundred fifty million people were lifted out of poverty eighty percent of the entire world 's poverty alleviation during that period happened in china in other words
  all the new and old democracies put together amounted to a mere fraction of what a single one party state did without voting
 see i grew up on this stuff food stamps meat was rationed to a few hundred grams per person per month at one point
 needless to say i ate all my grandmother 's portions
 so i asked myself what 's wrong with this picture
 here i am in my hometown my business growing leaps and bounds entrepreneurs are starting companies every day middle class is expanding in speed and scale unprecedented in human history yet
 according to the grand story none of this should be happening
 so i went and did the only thing i could i studied it
  one party state run by the chinese communist party the party
 and they don 't hold elections
 three assumptions are made
 by the dominant political theories of our time such a system is operationally rigid politically closed and morally illegitimate
 well the assumptions are wrong the opposites are true
 adaptability meritocracy and legitimacy are the three defining
  characteristics of china 's one party system now most political scientists will tell us that
 a one party system is inherently incapable of self correction it won 't last long because it cannot adapt now here are the facts
 in sixty four years of running the largest country in the world the range of the party 's policies has been wider than any other country in recent memory
 from radical land
  collectivization to the great leap forward then privatization of farmland
 then the cultural revolution
 then deng xiaoping 's market reform
 then successor jiang zemin took the giant political step of opening up party membership to private businesspeople something unimaginable during mao 's rule
 so the party self corrects in rather dramatic fashions
 institutionally new
  rules get enacted to correct previous dysfunctions for example term limits
 political leaders used to retain their positions for life and they used that to accumulate power and perpetuate their rules
 mao was the father of modern china yet his prolonged rule led to disastrous mistakes
 so the party instituted term limits with mandatory retirement age of sixty eight to seventy
 one thing we often hear is
  political reforms have lagged far behind economic reforms and and china is in dire need of political reform
 but this claim
 is a rhetorical trap hidden behind a political bias
 see some have decided a priori what kinds of changes they want to see and only such changes can be called political reform
 the truth is political reforms have never stopped compared with thirty years ago twenty years
  even ten years ago every aspect of chinese society how the country is governed from the most local level to the highest center are unrecognizable today
 now such changes are simply not possible without political reforms of the most fundamental kind
 now i would venture to suggest the party is the world 's leading expert in political reform
 the second assumption is that in a one party
  state power gets concentrated in the hands of the few and bad governance and corruption follow
 indeed corruption is a big problem but let 's first look at the larger context
 now this may be counterintuitive to you the party happens to be one of the most meritocratic political institutions in the world today
 china 's highest ruling body the politburo has twenty five members in the most recent one only five of them came from
  from a background of privilege so called princelings
 the other twenty including the president and the premier came from entirely ordinary backgrounds
 in the larger central committee of three hundred or more the percentage of those who were born into power and wealth was even smaller
 the vast majority of senior chinese leaders worked and competed their way to the top
 compare that with the ruling elites in both developed and developing countries i think you
 'll find the party being near the top in upward mobility
 the question then is how could that be possible in a system run by one party
 now we come to a powerful political institution little known to westerners the party 's organization department
 the department functions like a giant human resource engine that would be the envy of even some of the most successful corporations
 it operates a rotating pyramid made up of three components civil service state owned enterprises and social organizations like a university or a community program
 they form separate yet integrated career paths for chinese officials
 they recruit college grads into entry level positions in all three tracks and they start from the bottom called keyuan clerk then they could get promoted through four
  increasingly elite ranks
 fuke deputy section manager ke section manager fuchu deputy division manager and chu division manger now these are not moves from karate kid okay it 's serious business
 the
 the range of positions is wide from running health care in a village to foreign investment in a city district to manager in a company
 once a year the department reviews their performance they interview their
  superiors their peers their subordinates they vet their personal conduct they conduct public opinion surveys then they promote the winners
 throughout their careers these cadres can move through and out of all three tracks
 over time the good ones move beyond the four base levels to the fuju deputy bureau chief and ju bureau chief levels
 there they enter high officialdom by that point a typical assignment will be to manage a district with
  population in the millions or a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue just to show you how competitive the system is
 in two thousand and twelve there were nine hundred thousand fuke and ke levels
 six hundred thousand fuchu and chu levels and only forty thousand fuju and ju levels
 after the ju levels the best few move further up several more ranks and eventually make it to the
  central committee
 the process takes two to three decades does patronage play a role yes of course
 but merit remains the fundamental driver
 in essence the organization department runs a modernized version of china 's centuries old mentoring system china 's new president xi jinping
  son of a former leader which is very unusual first of his kind to make the top job even for him the career took thirty years
 he started as a village manager and by the time he entered the politburo he had managed areas with a total population of one hundred and fifty million people and combined gdps of one point five trillion u s dollars
 now please don 't get me wrong okay this is not a put down of anyone it 's just a statement of fact
 george w bush remember him
 this is not a put
 before becoming governor of texas
 or barack obama before running for president could not make even a small county manager in china 's system
 winston churchill once said that democracy is a terrible system except for all the rest well apparently he hadn 't heard of the organization department
 now westerners always assume that multi party
  election with universal suffrage is the only source of political legitimacy
 i was asked once the party wasn 't voted in by election where is the source of legitimacy
 i said how about competency
 we all know the facts in one thousand nine hundred and forty nine when the party took power china was mired in civil wars dismembered by foreign aggression
 average life expectancy at that time forty one years old
  today it 's the second largest economy in the world an industrial powerhouse and its people live in increasing prosperity
 pew research polls chinese public attitudes and here are the numbers in recent years
 satisfaction with the direction of the country eighty five percent
 those who think they 're better off than five years ago seventy percent
 those who expect the future to be better a
  whopping eighty two percent
 financial times polls global youth attitudes and these numbers brand new just came from last week
 ninety three percent of china 's generation y are optimistic about their country 's future now if this is not legitimacy
 i 'm not sure what is
 in contrast most electoral democracies around the world are suffering from dismal
  performance i don 't need to elaborate for this audience how dysfunctional it is from washington to european capitals
 with a few exceptions the vast number of developing countries that have adopted electoral regimes are still suffering from poverty and civil strife
 governments get elected and then they fall below fifty percent approval in a few months and stay there and get worse until the next election
  democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle of elect and regret
 at this rate i 'm afraid it is democracy not china 's one party system that is in danger of losing legitimacy
 now i don 't want to create the misimpression that china 's hunky dory on the way to some kind of superpowerdom
 the country faces enormous challenges the social and economic problems that come
  with wrenching change like this
 are mind boggling pollution is one food safety population issues on the political front the worst problem is corruption
 corruption is widespread and undermines the system and its moral legitimacy but most analysts misdiagnose the disease they say that corruption
  is the result of the one party system and therefore in order to cure it you have to do away with the entire system but a more careful look would tell us otherwise
 transparency international ranks china between seventy and eighty in recent years among one hundred and seventy countries and it 's been moving up
 india the largest democracy in the world ninety four and dropping
 for the hundred or so countries that are ranked below china more than half of them are electoral democracies so if election is the panacea for corruption
 how come these countries can 't fix it
 now i 'm a venture capitalist
 i make bets it wouldn 't be fair to end this talk without putting myself on the line and making some predictions so here they are
 in the next ten years china will surpass the u s and become the largest economy in the world income per capita will be near the top of all developing countries
 corruption will be curbed but not
  eliminated and china will move up ten to twenty notches to above sixty in t i ranking
 economic reform will accelerate political reform will continue and the one party system will hold firm
 we live in the dusk of an era
 meta narratives that make universal claims failed us in the twenty th century and are failing us in the twenty one st meta narrative is
  cancer that is killing democracy from the inside
 now i want to clarify something i 'm not here to make an indictment of democracy
 on the contrary i think democracy contributed to the rise of the west and the creation of the modern world
 it is the universal claim that many western elites are making about their political system the hubris
  that is at the heart of the west 's current ills
 if they would spend just a little less time on trying to force their way onto others and a little bit more on political reform at home
 they might give their democracy a better chance
 china 's political model will never supplant electoral democracy because unlike the latter it doesn 't pretend to be universal it cannot be exported
 but that is the point precisely
 the significance of china 's example is not that it provides an alternative
 but the demonstration that alternatives exist
 let us draw to a close this era of meta narratives
 communism and democracy may both be laudable ideals but the era of their dogmatic universalism is over
 let us stop telling people and our children there 's only one way to govern ourselves and a singular future towards which all societies must evolve it
  is wrong it is irresponsible and worst of all it is boring
 let universality make way for plurality
 perhaps a more interesting age is upon us are we brave enough to welcome it thank you
 western countries would agree with your
 statement about analysis of democratic systems becoming
 dysfunctional but at the same time many would kind of find unsettling the thought that there is an unelected
 authority that without any form of oversight or or consultation decides what the national interest is
 what is the mechanism in the chinese model that allows people to say actually the national interest as you defined it is wrong exl you know
 frank fukuyama the political scientist
 called the chinese system responsive authoritarianism it
 's not exactly right but i think it it comes close so i know the largest public opinion survey company in china okay
 do you know who their biggest client is the chinese government not just from the central government the city government the provincial government to the
  most local neighborhood districts they conduct surveys all the time are you happy with the garbage collection
 are you happy with the general direction of the country so there is in china there is a different kind of mechanism to be responsive to to the demands and the thinking of the people my point is
 i think we should get unstuck
 from the thinking that there 's only
 one political system election election election that could make it responsive
 i 'm not sure actually elections produce responsive government anymore in the in the world
 many seem to agree
 one of the features of a democratic system is a space for civil society to express itself
 and you have shown figures about the support that the government and the authorities have in china but then you 've just mentioned other elements like you know
 big challenges and there are of course a lot of other data that go in a different direction tens of thousands of unrests and protests and environmental
 protests etc so
 you seem to suggest the chinese model doesn 't have a space outside of the party for civil society to express itself exl there 's a vibrant
  what have you but it 's different you wouldn 't recognize it because by western definitions a so called civil society has to be separate or even in opposition
 to the political system but that concept is alien
 for chinese culture
 for thousands of years you have civil society yet they are consistent and coherent and part of a political order and i think
 it 's a big cultural difference bg eric thank you for sharing
