  i 'd like to invite you to close your eyes  imagine yourself standing
 outside the front door of your home i 'd like you to notice the color of the door  the material that it 's made out of
 now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles 
 they are competing in a naked bicycle race  and they are headed straight for your front door  
 i need you to actually see this they are pedaling really hard they 're sweaty
  they 're bouncing around a lot  and they crash straight into the front door of your home  
 bicycles fly everywhere  wheels roll past you spokes end up in awkward places  
 step over the threshold of your door
 into your foyer your hallway whatever 's on the other side  and appreciate the quality of the light the light
  cookie monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse it 's a talking horse you can
 practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose you can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he 's about to shovel into his mouth  walk past him  
 walk past him into your living room 
 in your living room in full imaginative broadband picture britney
  spears  she is scantily clad she 's dancing
 on your coffee table and she 's singing hit me baby one more time 
 and then  follow me into your kitchen  in your kitchen  the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road  and out of your oven
 are coming towards you dorothy the tin man  the scarecrow and the lion from the wizard of oz
 hand in hand skipping straight towards you okay  open your eyes 
 i want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in new york city it
 's called the united states memory championship and i had gone to cover this contest a few years back as a science
  i guess that this was going to be like the superbowl of savants 
 this was a bunch of guys and a few ladies  
 widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep 
 they were memorizing hundreds of random numbers  looking at them just once  they were memorizing the names of
 dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers 
 they were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes they were competing to see who could memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest 
 i was like this is unbelievable these people must be freaks of nature  
 and i started talking to a few of the competitors this is a guy called ed cook who had come over from england where he had one of the best trained
  and i said to him ed when did you realize that you were a savant 
 and ed was like i 'm not a savant  in fact i have just an average memory 
 everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory we 've all trained ourselves
 to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory
 using a set of ancient
  five hundred years ago in greece  the same techniques that cicero had used to memorize his speeches 
 that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books 
 how come i never heard of this before 
 and we were standing outside the competition hall and ed who is a wonderful brilliant  but somewhat eccentric
  because i really want to teach britney spears how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards on u s national television it will prove to the world that anybody can do this
  'm not britney spears  but maybe you could teach me 
 i mean you 've got to start somewhere right 
 and that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me  
 i ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory  but also investigating it trying to understand how it works  why it sometimes doesn 't work  and what its potential might be  and i met a host of really
  interesting people this is a guy called e p 
 he 's an amnesic who had very possibly  the worst memory in the world 
 his memory was so bad that he didn 't even remember he had a memory problem which is amazing 
 and he was this incredibly tragic figure but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are at
 the other end of the spectrum
  i met this guy this is kim peek he was the basis for dustin hoffman 's character in the movie rain man we spent an afternoon together
 in the salt lake city public library memorizing phone books  which was
 scintillating 
 and i went back and i read a whole host of memory treatises
 latin in antiquity  and then later in the middle ages  and i learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff one of the really interesting things that i learned
 is that once upon a time this idea of having a trained  disciplined  cultivated memory
 was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today once upon a time
  people invested in their memories in laboriously furnishing their minds 
 over the last few millenia  we 've invented a series of technologies from the alphabet to the scroll to the codex the printing press  photography the computer the smartphone
  that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories 
 for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity 
 these technologies have made our modern world possible but they 've also changed us 
 they 've changed us culturally  and i would argue that they 've changed us cognitively  
 having little need to remember anymore it sometimes seems like we 've forgotten how 
 one of the last places on earth where you still
  find people passionate about this idea of a trained  disciplined  cultivated memory is at this totally singular memory contest it 's actually not that singular 
 there are contests held all over the world and i was fascinated i wanted to know how do these guys do it a
  do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally anatomically different from the rest of ours the answer was
 no 
 are they smarter than the rest of us they gave them a bunch of cognitive tests and the answer was not really 
 there was however one really interesting and telling difference between the brains of the memory champions and the control subjects that they were comparing them to 
  these guys in an fmri machine  scanned their brains while they were memorizing
 numbers and people 's faces and pictures of snowflakes  they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain
 than everyone else of note they were using or they seemed to be using a part of the brain that 's involved in spatial memory and navigation 
 why and
  there something that the rest of us can learn from this the sport of competitive memorizing
 is driven by a kind of arms race
 where every year somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly and then the rest of the field has to play catch up this is my friend ben
  world memory champion on his desk in front of him are thirty six shuffled packs of playing cards
 that he is about to try to memorize in one hour  
 using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered 
 he used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of four thousand one hundred and forty random binary digits
  and while there are
 a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competitions  
 everything all of the techniques that are being used ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding 
 and it 's well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the baker
 baker paradox which goes like this if i tell two people
 to remember the same word if i say to you remember that there is a guy named baker that 's his name  
 and i say to you remember that there is a guy who is a baker okay  
 and i come back to you at some point later on  and i say do you remember that word that i told you a while
  you remember what it was 
 the person who was told his name is baker is less likely to remember the same word 
 than the person was told his job is a baker 
 same word different amount of remembering  that 's weird  what 's going on here  
 well  the name baker doesn 't actually mean anything to you it is entirely untethered from all of the other memories
 floating around in your skull but the common noun
  we know bakers bakers wear funny white hats bakers have flour on their hands bakers smell good when they come home from work  maybe we even know a baker  
 and when we first hear that word we start putting these associational hooks into it that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date 
 the entire art
 of what is going on in these memory contests and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday
  life is figuring out ways to transform capital b bakers into lower case b bakers
 to take information that is lacking in context in significance in meaning  and transform it in some way so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind 
 one of the more elaborate techniques for doing this
  dates back two thousand five hundred years to ancient greece it came to be known as the memory palace the story behind its creation goes like this 
 there was a poet called simonides who was attending a banquet 
 he was actually the hired entertainment because back then if you wanted to throw a really slamming party you didn 't hire
  you hired a poet and he stands up delivers his poem from memory  walks out the door  and at the moment he does 
 the banquet hall collapses  
 kills
 everybody inside it doesn 't just kill everybody it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition 
 nobody can say who was inside  nobody can
  where they were sitting the bodies can 't be properly buried it 's one tragedy compounding another
 simonides standing outside the sole survivor amid the wreckage  closes his eyes
 and has this realization 
 which is that in his mind 's eye he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting 
 and he takes the relatives by the hand and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage
 what simonides figured out at that moment 
 is something that i think we all kind of intuitively know which is that as bad as we are at remembering
 names and phone numbers and word for word instructions from our colleagues  we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories 
  if i asked you
 to recount the first ten words of the story that i just told you about simonides chances are you would have a tough time with it 
 but i would wager that if i asked you to recall
 who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse
 in your foyer right now you would be able to see that the idea behind the memory palace
 is to create this imagined edifice in your mind 's eye
 and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember the crazier  weirder more bizarre  funnier  raunchier  stinkier 
 the image is the more unforgettable it 's likely to be  this is advice that goes back 2 000 plus years to the earliest latin memory treatises 
  's say that you 've been invited
 to ted center stage to give a speech  and you want to do it from memory and you want to do it the way that cicero
 would have done it if he had been invited to tedxrome two thousand years ago what you might do
 is picture yourself at the front door of your house  and you 'd come up with some sort of
 crazy ridiculous unforgettable image to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about
 is this totally bizarre contest 
 and then you 'd go inside your house  and you would see an image of cookie monster on top of mister ed  
 and that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend ed cook
  and then you 'd see an image of britney spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell and
 you 'd go into your kitchen  
 and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year and you 'd have some friends to help you remember that 
 this is how roman orators memorized their speeches not word for word which is just going to screw you up 
  that 's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric in these sorts of spatial terms  the phrase in the first place 
 that 's like in the first place of your memory palace 
 i thought this was just fascinating  and i got really into
  i went to a few more of these memory contests  and i had this notion that i might write something longer about this subculture of competitive memorizers  but there was a problem  
 the problem was that a memory contest
 is a pathologically boring event 
 truly  it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the  sats i mean the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples and i 'm a journalist
  need something to write about  i know that there 's incredible stuff happening in these people 's minds  but i don 't have access to it  
 and i realized if i was going to tell this story 
 i needed to walk in their shoes a little bit 
 and so i started trying to spend fifteen or twenty minutes every morning before i sat down with my new york times just trying to remember something 
 maybe it was a poem  maybe it was names
  from an old yearbook that i bought at a flea market  and i found that this was shockingly
 fun i
 never would have expected that it was fun because this is actually not about training your memory  
 what you 're doing is you 're trying to get better and better and better at creating at dreaming up these utterly
  and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind 's eye  and i got pretty into it  this is
 me wearing my standard competitive memorizer 's training kit 
 it 's a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over
 except for two small pinholes because distraction is the competitive
  i ended up coming back to that same contest that i had covered a year earlier and
 i had this notion that i might enter it sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism it
 'd make i thought maybe a nice epilogue to all my research problem was 
 the experiment went haywire i won the contest 
 laughter which really wasn 't supposed to happen
 now  
 it is nice to be able to memorize speeches and
 phone numbers and shopping lists 
 but it 's actually kind of beside the point 
 these are just tricks  
 they work because they 're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work  and you don 't have
  to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works we often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift  but that is not the case  
 great memories
 are learned at the most basic level we remember when we pay attention  we remember when we are deeply
  engaged we remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience  and figure out why it is meaningful to us why it is significant why it 's colorful when we 're able 
 to transform it in some way that makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds when we 're able to transform bakers
  the memory palace these memory techniques they 're just shortcuts  in fact  they 're not even really shortcuts  they work because they make you work  
 they force a kind of
 depth of processing a kind of mindfulness that most of us don 't normally walk around exercising  but there actually are no shortcuts  
 this is how stuff is made memorable  and i think if there 's one thing that i want to leave you with
 it 's what e p the amnesic who couldn 't even remember he had a memory problem  left me with which is
 the notion that our lives
 are the sum of our memories how much
 are we willing to lose from our already short lives
  by losing ourselves in our blackberries our iphones  by
 not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us by being so lazy that we 're not willing to process
 deeply 
 i learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities
  latent in all of us but if you want to live a memorable life you have to be the kind of person
 who remembers to remember thank you
