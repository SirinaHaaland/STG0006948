  when chris first approached me to speak at ted i said no because i felt like i wasn 't going to be able to make that personal connection you know that i wanted to it 's such a large conference 
 but he explained to me that he was in a bind  and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for  
 so i said fine ted i mean chris i 'll come on two
 conditions one i want to speak as early in the morning as possible and two i want to
 pick the theme for ted two thousand and six and luckily he
  the theme in two years is going to be cute pictures of puppies
  dear sir good day  compliments of the day and my best wishes to you and family i know this letter will come to you
  but let it not be a surprise to you for nature has a way of arriving unannounced and as an adage says originals are very hard to find but their echoes sound ouder 
 so i decided to contact you myself for you to assure me of safety and honesty 
 if i have to entrust any amount of money under your custody
  i am mr micheal bangura the son of late mr thaimu bangura
 who was the minister of finance in sierra leone but was killed
  during the civil war 
 knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business on which premise i write you 
 before my father death he had the sum of
 twenty three million united states dollars which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war 
 this fund was supposed to be used
  for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country  
 before the outbreak of war  when the war broke out 
 the rebel leader demanded the fund be given to him my father insisted it was not in his possession 
 and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund meanwhile my mother and i is the only person who knows about it because my father
  made an arrangement with a red cross relief worker who used his official van to transport the money to lungi airport freetown although he did not know the real contents of the box 
 the fund was deposited as a family reasure in a safe reliable security company in dakar senegal 
 where i was only given temporary asylum i do not wish to invest the money in senegal
 due to unfavorable economic climate and so close to my country 
 the only assistance i need from you which i know you would do for me 
 are the following one be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust two 
 provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted three receive the funds into your account in trust
  take out your commission and leave the rest of the money until i arrive after the transfer is complete sincerely
  mr micheal bangura 
 this is really embarrassing  i was told backstage that i have eighteen minutes  i only prepared fifteen 
 so if it 's cool i 'd
  like to just wait for three
  i mean no i mean like in the ted sense
  eight hundred and sixty am i good and that
 's nothing to be ashamed of that 's nothing to be ashamed of 
  i was hanging out with some google guys last night really cool we were getting wasted 
 and they were telling me that google software has gotten so advanced that based on your interaction with google over your lifetime they can actually predict
 what you are going to say next  and i was
  don 't show anyone but they slipped up  and they said
 that i could just type in what was i going to say next 
 and my name  and it would tell me and i have to tell you this is an unadulterated piece of software this is a real internet browser and this is the actual google site and we 're going to test it out live today
  that 's me am i feeling lucky
  of two thousand and one 
 i filmed myself dancing to madonna 's justify my love 
 on a thursday i sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to seventeen of my closest friends as part of
 an invitation to my
 an invitation to my
  by monday over a million people were coming to this site a day 
 within a week i received a call from earthlink that said due to a ten cents per megabyte overage charge i owed them thirty thousand dollars 
  but some people refer to me more as like an internet guru or [ jackass ] swami 
 laughter i knew i
  it 's
 unfortunate that i don 't have more time maybe i can come back next year or something like that 
 i 'm obsessed with email i get a lot of it
  four years later i still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people i don 't know  and
 it 's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know
 different cultures  you know it 's like a microscope to the rest of the world you can kind of peer into
 other people 's lives and i also feel like i get a lot of inspiration
 from the average
  user for example somebody wrote 
 if you ever come to boulder you should rock out with us and i said why wait [ rocking out ] 
 and they said hey ze thanks for rocking out but i meant the kind of rocking out where we 'd be naked 
 laughter and that was embarrassing
  i hear a lot of you whispering 
 and i know what you 're saying holy crap how is his presentation so smooth 
 and i have to say that it 's not all me this year i guess chris has to take some credit
  here because
 in years past i guess there 's been some sort of subpar speakers at ted i don 't know 
 and so this year chris sent us a ted conference simulator 
 which really allowed us as speakers to get there in the trenches and practice at home so that we would be ready
  i 've got to say that  you know it 's really really great to be here i 'd
 like to tell all of you a little joke 
 not just the good stuff though  
 you can do heckler mode
  just one last thing i 'd like to say
  the first time that i made love to a rock shrimp
  all aware of this but the the video game market kids are playing these video games 
  there 's tons of money i mean like i think one hundred thousand dollars or so a year is being spent on these things  so
 i decided to try my hand i came up with a few games 
 this is called atheist i figured it would be popular with the young kids
  really understand why you 're laughing should have done this before i tried to pitch it
  and this is great because you know for a quarter you can play this for a long time 
 and chris had said in an email that we should really bring something new to ted something that we haven 't shown anyone so
 i made this for ted it 's christian it 's the third in the series i 'm hoping it 's going to do
  so you can wait for the second coming which is a random number between one and five hundred million 
 laughter so really what are we talking about here
 tech joy to me means something because i get a lot of joy out of tech 
 and in fact  making things using technology and i 'm being serious here even though i 'm using my sarcastic voice
 i won 't hold on 
 making things you know making
  things actually does give me a lot of joy  it 's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life  
 and it 's that feeling of being about eighty percent complete on a project where you know you still have something to do but it 's not finished and you 're not starting something
 that really
 fills my entire life and so what i 've done is i started getting interested in creating online social spaces
 to share that feeling with people who don 't consider themselves artists
  culture of guru ship it 's so hard to use some software because  you know  it 's unapproachable people feel like they have to read the manual  so
 i try to create these
 these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves and hopefully
  try to create meaningful environments
 for people to express themselves 
 here i created a contest called when office supplies attack which i think really resonated with the
 working population
  hundred entries in three weeks toilet paper fashion 
 laughter again people from all over the country the watch is particularly incredible 
 online drawing tools you 've probably seen a lot of them i think they 're wonderful it 's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff but i 'm interested in the process
 as the real event that i 'm interested in and the problem is is that a lot of people suck at drawing 
 and they get bummed out at this sort of you know  stick figure  awful little thing that they created and
 eventually it just makes them stop playing with it or they draw penises and things like that
  the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool in other words
 it 's a helping tool you can draw your simple stick figure  and it collaborates with you to create sort of a post war german etching
 in fact  it 's tuned to be
 better at drawing things that look worse so we go ahead and we start scribbling
  really  you know  partake in this process  but watch something really crappy look beautiful 
 and here are some of my favorites this is the little trap marionette
 that was submitted to me
  it 's a really fun and wonderful thing so this is called the fiction project this is
  is basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing these are haikus  none of the haikus were written by the same person in fact 
  each line is contributed by a different person at a different time i think that the 
 now tied up tied down mistress cruel approaches me now tied down it 's up 
 it 's an
  chills you to the very core 
 but it 's peripheral activities like these that allow people to get together doing fun things they actually get to know each other and it 's sort of
  peripheral activities that i think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we 're lacking and very very quickly
 i love puppets  here 's a puppet it dances to music  lotte reiniger
 an amazing shadow puppeteer in the 20s that started doing more elaborate things i became interested in puppets and i just want to show one last thing to you oh 
 this is how you make puppets
