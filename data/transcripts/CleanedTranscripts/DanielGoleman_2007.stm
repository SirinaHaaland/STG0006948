  you know i 'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of ted is compassion these very moving demonstrations we 've just seen  
 hiv in africa  
 president clinton last night  and i 'd like to do a little
 collateral thinking if you will
  about compassion and bring it from the
 global level to the personal i 'm a psychologist but rest assured i will not bring it to the scrotal 
 there was a very important study done a while ago at princeton theological seminary that speaks to why it is
 that
 when all of us have so many opportunities to help we do
  sometimes and we don 't other times a group of divinity students at the princeton theological seminary
 were told that they were going to
 give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic  
 half of those students were given as a topic the parable of the good samaritan the man who stopped the stranger in
 to help the stranger in need by the side of the road  half were
  given random bible topics then one by one they were told they had to go to another building
 and give their sermon 
 as they went from the first building to the second each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning  clearly in need 
 the question is did they stop to help 
 the more interesting question is  did it matter they were contemplating the parable of the good samaritan
 what turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry
 they thought they were in were they feeling they were late or were they absorbed
 in what they were going to talk about and this is i think the predicament of our lives 
 that we don 't take every opportunity to help because our
  focus is in the wrong direction there 's a new field in brain science social neuroscience this studies the circuitry
 in two people 's brains that activates while they interact and the new thinking about compassion
 from social neuroscience is that our default wiring
 is to
  that is to say if we attend to the other person we automatically empathize we automatically feel with them there are
 these newly identified neurons mirror neurons that act like a neuro wi fi 
 activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs we feel with automatically 
 and if that person is in need if that person is suffering 
 we 're automatically prepared to help at least that 's the argument but then the question is
 why don 't we and i think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete 
 to noticing to empathy and to compassion and the simple fact is if we are focused on ourselves if we 're preoccupied as we so often are throughout the day 
 we don 't really fully notice the other
  and this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle i was doing my
 taxes the other day  and i got to the point where i was listing all of the donations i gave  and i had an epiphany it was
 i came to my check to the seva foundation and i noticed that i thought boy my friend larry brilliant would really be happy that i gave money to seva 
 then i realized that what i was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit
 that i felt good about myself then i started to think about the people
 in the himalayas whose cataracts would be helped and i realized that i went from this kind of narcissistic self focus to altruistic joy 
 to feeling good for the people that were being helped  
 i think that 's a motivator but this distinction between focusing on ourselves and focusing on others is one that i encourage us all to pay attention to you can see it
 at a gross level in
  the world of dating
 i was at a sushi restaurant
 a while back and i overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman who was in the singles scene  
 and this woman says my brother is having trouble getting dates so he 's trying speed dating i don 't know if you know speed dating women sit at tables
 and men go from table to table and there 's
  a clock and a bell and at five minutes  bingo  the conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card
 or her email address to the man for follow up and this woman says my brother 's never gotten a card and i know exactly why 
 the moment he sits down he starts talking non stop about himself he never asks about the woman and i was doing some
 research in the
 sunday styles section of the new york times  looking at the back
  stories of marriages because they 're very interesting and
 i came to the marriage of alice charney epstein and she said that when she was in the dating scene  
 she had a simple test she put people to 
 the test was from the moment they got together how long it would take the guy to ask her a question with the word you in it 
 and apparently epstein aced the test therefore the article
 this is a it 's a little test i encourage you to try out at a party here at ted there are great opportunities  the
 harvard business review recently had an article called the human moment about how to make real contact with a person at work and they said well the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your
  close your laptop end your daydream and pay full attention to the person 
 there is a newly coined word in the english language
 for the moment when the person we 're with whips out their blackberry or answers that cell phone and all of a sudden we don 't exist 
 the word is pizzled it 's a combination of puzzled and pissed off 
  it 's our tuning in which separates us from machiavellians or sociopaths i have a
 brother in law who 's an expert on horror and terror he wrote the annotated dracula the essential frankenstein he was trained as a chaucer scholar but
 he was born in transylvania and i think it affected him a little bit at any rate at one point
 my brother in law leonard  decided to write
  a book about a serial killer this is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we 're in many years ago he was known as the santa cruz strangler and before he was arrested he had murdered
 his
 grandparents his mother and five  co eds at uc santa cruz so my brother in law goes to interview this killer
 and he realizes when he meets him that this guy is absolutely terrifying for one thing he 's almost seven feet tall
 but that 's not the most terrifying thing about him the scariest thing is that his iq is one hundred and sixty a
 certified genius  
 but there is zero correlation between iq and emotional empathy feeling with the other person 
 they 're controlled by different parts of the brain so at one point my brother in law gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to and that
  you have done it didn 't you feel any pity for your victims these were very intimate murders he strangled his victims 
 and the strangler says very matter of factly 
 oh no if i 'd felt the distress i could not have done it  i had to turn that part of me off  
 i had to turn that part of
  and i think that
 that is very troubling 
 and in a sense  i 've been reflecting on turning that part of us off when we focus on ourselves in any activity  we do turn that part of ourselves off if there 's another person 
 think about going shopping
 and think about the possibilities of a compassionate consumerism  
  bill mcdonough has pointed out 
 the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences we 're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot we don 't notice and don 't notice that we don 't notice
 the toxic molecules
 emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats or we don 't know if that fabric is a
 technological or
 manufacturing nutrient it can be
 reused or does it just end up at landfill in other words we 're oblivious to the ecological and public health
 and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use 
 in a sense  the room itself is the elephant in the
  but we don 't see it and we 've
 become victims of a system that points us elsewhere consider this there 's a wonderful book called stuff
  the hidden life of everyday objects  and it talks about the back story of something like a t shirt and it talks about
 where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer
  and it mentions for instance that cotton is very resistant to textile dye 
 about sixty percent washes off into wastewater and it 's well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works
 tend to have high rates of leukemia there 's a company
 bennett and company that supplies polo com victoria 's secret
 they because of their ceo who 's aware of this in china formed a joint venture
 with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater  
 right now we don 't have the option to choose the virtuous t shirt over the non virtuous one 
 so what would it take to do that
 well i 've been thinking for one thing there 's a new electronic
  tagging
 technology that allows any store to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store you
 can track it back to the factory once you can track it back to the factory 
 you can look at the manufacturing processes that were used to make it 
 and
 if it 's virtuous you can label it that way or if it 's not so virtuous you can go into today go into
 any store put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode which will take you to a website they have it for people with
 allergies to peanuts that website could tell you things about that object in other words at point of purchase we might be able to make
 a compassionate choice there 's a saying
 in the world
  ultimately everybody will know everything and the question is will it make a difference 
 some time ago when i was working for the new york times  
 it was in the ' 80s i did an article on what was then a new problem in new york it was homeless people on the streets  
 and i spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless
  and i realized seeing the homeless through their eyes
 that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go
 they had a diagnosis it made me what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where 
 when we see when we 're passing someone who 's homeless in the periphery of our vision it stays on the periphery 
 we don 't notice and
  one day soon after that it was a friday
 at the end of the day i went down i was going down to the subway it was rush hour and
 thousands of people were streaming down the stairs and all of a sudden as i was going down the stairs i noticed that there was a man
 slumped to the side shirtless not moving 
 and people were just stepping over him hundreds and hundreds of people and because my urban trance had been somehow weakened i
 found myself stopping to find out what was wrong the moment i stopped  half a dozen other people immediately ringed the same guy  
 and we found out that he was hispanic he didn 't speak any english he had no money he 'd been wandering the streets
 for days  
 starving and he 'd fainted from hunger immediately someone went to get orange juice someone brought a hotdog someone brought a subway cop this guy was back on his feet immediately but all it took
 was that simple act of noticing  and so i 'm optimistic  thank you very much
