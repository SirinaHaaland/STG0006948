  over the past ten years  i 've been researching the way
 people organize and visualize information  
 and i 've noticed an interesting shift 
 for a long period of time  we believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us also known as the great chain
  of being or scala naturae in latin 
 a top down structure that normally starts with god at the very top followed by angels  noblemen common people animals and so on 
 this idea was actually based on aristotle 's ontology  which classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories like the ones you see behind me
 but over time  interestingly enough  this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree
 in what became known as the porphyrian tree also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge 
 the branching scheme of the tree was in fact such a powerful metaphor for conveying information that it became over time an important communication tool to map
  a variety of systems of knowledge  
 we can see trees being used to map morality with the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices as you can see here with these beautiful illustrations from medieval europe  
 we can see trees being used to map consanguinity the various blood ties between people  
 we can also see trees being used to map genealogy perhaps the most famous archetype of the tree diagram
 i think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees many of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way 
 we can see trees even mapping systems of law  the various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers  
 and finally of course also a very popular scientific metaphor we can see trees being used to map all species known to man
 and trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor because in many ways they really embody this human desire for order for balance for unity for symmetry 
 however nowadays we are really facing new complex intricate challenges that cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree
  and a new metaphor is currently emerging  and it 's currently replacing the tree in visualizing various systems of knowledge 
 it 's really providing us with a new lens to understand the world around us  
 and this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network 
 and we can see this shift from trees into networks in many domains of knowledge  we can see this shift
 in the way we try to understand the brain
  while before we used to think of the brain as a modular centralized organ where a given area was responsible for a set of actions and behaviors  
 the more we know about the brain  the more we think of it as a large music symphony played by hundreds and thousands of instruments  
 this is a beautiful snapshot created by the blue brain project where
  you can see ten thousand neurons and thirty million connections  and this is only mapping ten percent of a mammalian neocortex  
 we can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge 
 these are some remarkable trees of knowledge or trees of science by spanish scholar ramon llull 
 and llull was actually the precursor the very first one who created the metaphor of science as a tree a metaphor we use every single day  when we
  say biology is a branch of science when we say genetics is a branch of science 
 but perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge at least for me was created for the french encyclopedia by 
  in one thousand seven hundred and fifty one this was really the bastion of the french enlightenment  and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents for the encyclopedia  
 and it actually
 all domains of knowledge as separate branches of a tree 
 but knowledge is much more intricate than this 
 these are two maps of wikipedia showing the inter linkage of articles related to history on the left and mathematics on the right  
 and i think by looking at these maps and other ones that have been created of wikipedia arguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man we can
  really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate and interdependent just like a network  we can also see this interesting shift
 in the way we map social ties between people  
 this is the typical organization chart i 'm assuming many of you have seen a similar chart as well in your own corporations or others 
  that normally starts with the ceo at the very top and where you can drill down all the way to the individual workmen on the bottom  
 but humans sometimes are well actually all humans are unique in their own way and sometimes you really don 't
 play well under this really rigid structure i
 think the internet is really changing this paradigm quite a lot  this is a fantastic map of online social collaboration between perl developers perl is a famous
 programming language and here you can see how different programmers are actually exchanging files and working together on a given project  
 and here you can notice that this is a completely decentralized process there 's no leader in this organization  it 's a network
 we can also see this interesting shift when we
  look at terrorism one of the main challenges of understanding terrorism nowadays is that we are dealing with decentralized independent cells where there 's no leader
 leading the whole process 
 and here you can actually see how visualization is being used the diagram that you see behind me shows all the terrorists involved in the madrid attack in two thousand and four 
 and what they did here is they actually segmented the network into three different years  represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me and the blue
  lines tie together the people that were present in that network year after year 
 so even though there 's no leader per se these people are probably the most influential ones in that organization the ones that know more about the past and the future plans and goals of this particular cell  
 we can also see this shift from trees into networks in the way we classify and organize species
  the image on the right is the only illustration that darwin included in the origin of species which darwin called the tree of life 
 there 's actually a letter from darwin to the publisher expanding on the importance of this particular diagram  it was critical for darwin 's theory of evolution  
 but recently scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life is a dense network of bacteria and
 are actually tying together species that were completely separated before to what scientists are now calling
 not the tree of life  but the web of life the network of life 
 and finally we can really see this shift  again when we look at ecosystems around our planet no more do we have these simplified predator versus prey
 diagrams we have all learned at school 
 this is a much more accurate depiction of an ecosystem  
 this is a diagram created by professor david lavigne  
 mapping close to one hundred species that interact with the codfish off the coast of newfoundland in canada and
 i think here we can really understand the intricate and interdependent nature of most ecosystems that abound on our planet  
 but even though
  metaphor of the network is really already adopting various shapes and forms  and it 's almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy it 's almost becoming the syntax of a new language  and this is one aspect that truly fascinates me  
 and these are actually fifteen different typologies i 've been collecting over time  and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor  
 and here is an example
  on the very top band  you have radial convergence a visualization model that has become really popular over the last five years  
 at the top left the very first project is a gene network 
 followed by a network of ip addresses machines servers followed by a network of facebook friends 
 you probably couldn 't find more disparate topics yet they are using the same metaphor the same visual model to map the
  own subject  and here are a few more examples of the many i 've been collecting of this growing visual taxonomy of networks  
 but networks are not just a scientific metaphor 
 as designers researchers and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems they are in
  many ways influencing traditional art fields like painting and sculpture and influencing many different artists 
 and perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them they 're immensely gorgeous
 they are really becoming a cultural meme and driving a new art movement  which i 've called networkism 
 and we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways this is just one of many
  where you can see this influence from science into art  
 the example on your left side is ip mapping a computer generated map of ip addresses again servers machines  
 and on your right side  you have transient structures and unstable networks 
 by sharon molloy using oil and enamel on canvas  
 and here are a few more paintings by sharon molloy  some gorgeous intricate paintings  
 and here 's another example of that interesting
 on your left side you have operation smile it is a computer generated map of a social network  and on your right side  you have field four by emma mcnally  
 using only graphite on paper 
 emma mcnally is one of the main leaders of this movement  
 and she creates these striking imaginary landscapes where you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization
  but networkism doesn 't happen only in two dimensions  this is perhaps one of my favorite projects of this new movement  and i think the title really says it all
 it 's called galaxies forming along filaments like droplets along the strands of a spider 's web 
 and i just find this particular project to be immensely powerful it was created
  and he occupies these large spaces creates these massive installations using only elastic ropes as you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes the entire network kind of shifts 
 almost like a real organic network would  
 and here 's yet another example of networkism taken to a whole different level  this was created by japanese artist
  with this dense network this dense web of elastic ropes and black wool and thread  sometimes including objects as you can see here  sometimes even including people in many of her installations 
 but networks are also not just a new trend  and it 's too easy for us to dismiss it as such
  networks really embody notions of decentralization of interconnectedness of interdependence  
 and this new way of thinking is critical for us to solve many of the complex problems we are facing nowadays 
 from decoding the human brain to understanding the vast universe out there 
 on your left side  you have a snapshot of a neural network of a mouse very similar to our own at this particular scale  
 and on your right side you have the millennium simulation
 it was the largest and most realistic simulation of the growth of cosmic structure it was able to recreate
 the history of twenty million galaxies in approximately twenty five terabytes of output  
 and coincidentally or not i just find this particular comparison between the smallest scale of knowledge the brain and the largest scale of knowledge the universe itself to be really really quite striking and fascinating
 because as bruce mau once said when everything is connected to everything else for better or for worse everything matters thank you so much
