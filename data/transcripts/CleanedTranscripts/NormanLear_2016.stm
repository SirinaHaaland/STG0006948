  so i assume that norman doesn 't need much of an introduction but ted 's audience is global it 's diverse  so i 've been tasked with
 starting with his bio which could easily take up the entire eighteen minutes so instead we 're
  born in new haven connecticut your father was a con man i got that right 
 he was taken away to prison when you were nine years old you flew fifty two missions as a fighter pilot in world war ii you came back to
  operator eh 
 you came to la to break into hollywood  
 first in publicity then in tv you had no training as a writer formally  but you hustled your way in your breakthrough your debut was a little show called all in the family 
 you followed that up with a string of hits that to this day is unmatched in hollywood sanford and son
  all commercially 
 not only are they all commercially
 successful but many of them push our culture forward by giving the underrepresented members of society their first prime time voice  you have seven shows in the top ten at one time 
 at one point you aggregate an audience of one hundred and twenty million people per week watching your content that 's more
  than the audience for super bowl fifty which happens once a year nl holy shit eh 
 and we 're not even to the holy shit part 
 you land yourself on richard nixon 's enemies list he had one that 's an applause line too 
 applause you 're inducted into the tv hall of fame on the first day that it exists then came the movies
 fried green tomatoes the princess bride stand by me this is spinal tap again just to name a fraction 
 then you wipe the slate clean start a third act as a political activist focusing on protecting the first amendment and the separation of church and state you start people for the american way you 
  buy the declaration of independence and give it back to the people you stay active in both entertainment and politics until the ripe old of age of
 ninety three when you write a book and make a documentary about your life story and after all that they finally think you 're ready for a ted talk
 my mother what a place
 to start let me put it this way when i came back from the war 
 she showed me the letters that i had written her from overseas 
 and they were absolute love letters 
  this really sums up my mother they were love letters as if i had written them to they were love letters 
 a year later i asked my mother
 if i could have them because i 'd like to keep them all the years of my life  she had thrown them away
  the best way i can sum it up in more recent times is
 this is also more recent times a number of years ago when they started the hall of fame to which you referred 
 it was a sunday morning when i got a call from the fellow who ran
 the tv academy of arts & sciences he was calling me to tell me
  had met all day yesterday and he was confidentially telling me they  were going to start a hall of fame and these were the inductees
  greatest of the
 foreign correspondents  paddy chayefsky i think the best writer that ever came out of television milton berle lucille ball and me eh 
 not bad nl i call my mother immediately in hartford connecticut mom this is what 's happened they 're starting a hall of fame i tell her the list of names and me and
  of a laugh because everybody has a piece of that mother eh and the sitcom jewish mother is born right there so your father also
 played a
 large role in your
  tell us what happened when you were nine years old nl he was
 flying to oklahoma
 with three guys that my mother said i don 't want you to have anything to do with them i don 't trust those men 
 that 's when i heard  maybe not for the first time stifle yourself jeanette i 'm going and
 he went it turns out he was picking up some fake bonds
 which he was flying across the country to sell  but
 the fact that he was going to oklahoma in a plane  and he was going to bring me back a 10 gallon hat just like ken maynard my favorite
 cowboy
 wore  you know this was a few years after lindbergh crossed the atlantic
 mean it was exotic that my father was going there but when he came back they arrested him as he got off the plane that night
 newspapers were all over the house my father was with his hat in front of his face  manacled to a detective and
 my mother was selling the furniture because we were leaving she didn
  didn 't want to stay in that state of shame in chelsea massachusetts 
 and selling the furniture the house was loaded with people and in the middle of all of that some strange horse 's ass
 put his hand on my shoulder and said well you 're the man of the house now 
  the man of the house now and i think that was the moment
 i began to understand the foolishness of the human condition so it
 took a lot of years to look back at it and feel it was a was a benefit  but eh it 's interesting you
  benefit in that it gave me that springboard i mean that i could think
 how foolish it was to say to this crying nine year old boy you 're the man of the house now 
 and then then i was crying and then he said and men of the house don
  foolishness of the human condition  and it 's been that
 gift that i 've used eh so you have a father who 's absent you have a mother
 for whom apparently nothing is good enough do you think that starting out as a kid who maybe never felt heard
 started you down a journey that ended with you being an adult with a weekly audience of one hundred and twenty million people nl i love the
  way you put that question because i guess i 've spent my life
 wanting to be heard 
 i think
 it 's a simple answer yes that was what sparked
  when my father was away  i was fooling with a crystal radio set
 that we had made together  and i caught a signal
 that turned out to be father coughlin yeah 
 somebody laughed but not funny this was
  who was very vocal about hating the new deal and roosevelt and jews the first time i ran into
 an understanding that there were people in this world that hated me because i was born to jewish parents  and that had an enormous
 effect on my life eh so you had a childhood with
 little in the way of of strong male role models  except for your grandfather tell us about
 him nl oh my grandfather well here 's the way i always talked about that
 grandfather  there were parades  lots of parades when i was a kid there were parades on veteran 's day there 
  was abraham lincoln 's birthday george washington 's birthday
  and lots of little parades my grandfather used to take me and we 'd stand on the street corner he 'd hold my hand  
 and i 'd look up and i 'd see a tear running down his eye  
 and he meant a great deal to me and he used to write presidents
 of the united states every letter
  and i would run down the stairs every now and then and pick up the mail we were three flights up
  story i have told about my grandfather eh they wrote him back on the envelopes nl they wrote back
  but i i have shown them
  going way back to
 phil donahue and and others before him literally dozens of interviews in which i told that story 
 this will be the second time
 i have said the whole story was a lie  
 the truth was my grandfather took me to parades we had lots of those  the truth is a tear came down his eye
  the truth is he would write an occasional letter and i did pick up those little envelopes but my dearest darling
 mr president 
  a story i borrowed from a good friend whose grandfather was that
  when i started to write my memoir even this how about that even this i get to experience 
 when i started to write the memoir and i started to think about it
 i
 i i did a reasonable amount of crying  and i realized how much i needed the father  
 so much so that i appropriated arthur marshall 's grandfather  
 so much so the word father i have six kids by the way my favorite role in life
 it and husband to my wife lyn  
 but i stole the man 's identity because i needed the father 
 now i 've gone through a whole lot of shit
 and come out on the other side and i forgive my father the best thing i the worst thing i the
 word i
  use about him and think about him is he was a rascal the fact that he lied and stole and cheated
 and went to prison  
 i submerge that in the word rascal eh well there 's a saying that amateurs
  quote is widely attributed to john lennon but it turns out he stole it from t s eliot so you 're in good company 
 i want to talk about your work obviously the impact of your work has been written about and i 'm sure you 've heard about it all your life what it meant to people what it meant to our culture you heard the applause when i just named the names of the shows
  raised half the people in the room
 through your work but have there ever been any stories about the impact of your work that surprised you nl oh god
 surprised me and delighted me from head to toe  there was an evening with norman
  and the world of hip hop have in common  russell simmons was among seven on the stage
  the show that was a number five show he was talking about
 a simple thing that made a big eh 
  an impact on him i was hesitating over the word change it 's hard for me to imagine you
 know changing somebody 's life but that 's the way he put it he saw george jefferson write a check
 on the jeffersons and
 he never knew that a black man could write a check and he says  it just impacted his life so
 it changed his life
 and
 when i hear things like that little things
 because i i know that there isn 't anybody in this audience that wasn 't likely responsible today
 for some little thing they did for somebody 
 whether it 's as little as a smile or an unexpected hello that 's how little this thing was  
 it could have been
  been the the dresser of the set who put the checkbook on the thing and george
 had nothing to do while he was speaking so he wrote it i don 't know but eh so in addition to the long list i shared in the beginning i should have also mentioned that you invented
  you 've lead a life of accomplishment but you 've also built a life of meaning  and all of us strive to do both of those things not all of us manage to 
 but even those of us who do manage to accomplish both of those very rarely do we figure out how to do them together  you managed to push culture forward
  through your art while also achieving world beating commercial success how did you do both
 nl here 's where my mind goes when i hear that recitation of all i accomplished
  in a universe of which there are billions
 billions of universes billions of planets
  which we 're trying to save and it requires saving 
 but anything i may have accomplished is
  my sister once asked me
 what she does about something that was going on in
 newington connecticut and i said write your alderman or your mayor or something she said well i 'm not
 norman lear i 'm claire lear and that was the first time i
 said what i 'm saying i said claire with everything you think about what i may have done and everything you 've done she never left newington
 can you get your fingers close enough when you consider
 the size of the planet and
 so forth to measure anything i may have done to anything you may have done so 
 i am convinced we 're all responsible
 for doing as much as i may have accomplished
  to really buy into the size and scope of the creator 's enterprise here eh but here on this planet you have really really mattered nl i 'm a son of a gun 
 eh so i have one more question for you how old do you feel
  years old but i hope to one day feel as young as the person i 'm sitting across from ladies and gentlemen the incomparable norman lear
