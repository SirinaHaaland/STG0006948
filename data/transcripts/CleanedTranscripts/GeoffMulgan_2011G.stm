  what i want to talk about today is one idea it 's an idea for a new kind of school which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking about what schools are for and how they work and it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you
  where it comes from is an organization called the young foundation which over many decades has come up with many innovations in education like the open university
 and things like extended schools schools for social entrepreneurs  
 summer universities and the school of everything and about five years ago we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the u k 
 and we felt the most important priority was to bring together two sets of problems one was
 large numbers of bored teenagers
  who just didn 't like school couldn 't see any relationship between what they learned in school and future jobs and employers who kept complaining that the kids coming out of school weren 't actually ready for real work 
 didn 't have the right attitudes and experience and so we try to ask what kind of school would have the teenagers fighting to get in not fighting to stay out  
  from paraguay to australia  and looking at some of the academic research which showed
 the importance of what 's now called non cognitive skills the skills of motivation resilience and that these are as important as the cognitive skills formal academic skills we came up with an answer a very simple answer in a way which we called the studio
  and we called it a studio school to go back to the original idea of a studio in the renaissance where work and learning are integrated you work by learning and you learn by working 
 and the design we came up with had the following characteristics first of all we wanted small schools about three hundred four hundred pupils
 fourteen to nineteen year olds 
 and critically about eighty percent of the curriculum done not through sitting in classrooms but through real life practical projects working on commission to
  businesses ngo 's and others 
 that every pupil would have a coach as well as teachers who would have timetables much more like a work environment in a business  
 and all of this will be done within the public system  funded by public money but independently run  
 and all at no extra cost no selection and allowing the pupils the route into university even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs and have
  manual jobs as well 
 underlying it was some very simple ideas that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things 
 they learn best in teams and they learn best by doing things for real all the opposite of what mainstream schooling actually does 
 now that was a nice idea so we moved into the rapid
  we tried it out  first in luton famous for its airport and not much else i fear and in blackpool famous for its beaches and leisure  
 and what we found and we got quite a lot of things wrong and then improved them but we found that the young people loved it they found it much more motivational much more exciting than traditional education  
 and perhaps most important of all two years later when the exam results came through the pupils who had been put on these field trials who were in the lowest
  performing groups had jumped right to the top in fact pretty much at the top decile of performance in terms of gcse 's which is the british
 marking system  
 now not surprisingly  that influenced some people to think we were onto something the minister of education down south in london described himself
  and the business organizations thought we were onto something in terms of a way of preparing children much better for real life work today and indeed the head of the chambers of commerce is now the chairman 
  of the studio schools trust and helping it not just with big businesses but small businesses all over the country 
  and another forty areas want to have their own schools opening a pretty rapid spread of this idea  
 interestingly it 's happened almost entirely without media coverage it 's happened almost entirely without big money behind it it spread
 almost entirely through word of mouth  virally  across
  people involved in education and it spread because of the power of an idea
 so the very very simple idea about turning education on its head and putting the things which were marginal things like working in teams doing practical projects and 
  putting them right at the heart of learning rather than on the edges 
  this is one from yorkshire where in fact my nephew i hope will be able to attend it 
 and this one is focused on creative and media industries other ones have a focus on health care  
 tourism engineering and other fields 
 we think we 're onto something it 's not perfect yet  but we think this is one idea which can transform the lives of thousands possibly millions of teenagers who are really bored by schooling 
 it doesn 't animate them they 're not like all of you
  who can sit in rows and hear things said to you
 for hour after hour  they want to do things they want to get their hands dirty they want education to be for real 
 and my hope is that some of you out there may be able to help us we feel we 're on the beginning of a journey
 of experiment and improvement
 to turn the studio school idea into something which is present not
  as a universal answer for every child but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world and i hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen thank you very much
