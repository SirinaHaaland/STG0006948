  i 'm very very lucky  my talk essentially got written by three historic events that happened within days of each other in the last two months
 seemingly unrelated  but as you will see actually all having to do with the story i want to tell you today the
  first one was actually a funeral to be more precise a reburial on may 
 there was a hero 's reburial in frombork poland
 of the 16th century astronomer who actually changed the world he did that  literally  by replacing
 the earth with the sun in the center of the solar system and then with this
  he actually launched a scientific and technological revolution which
 many call the copernican revolution 
 now that was ironically and very befittingly the way we found his grave 
 as it was the custom of the time  copernicus was actually simply buried in an unmarked grave
  together with fourteen others
 in that cathedral
 dna analysis one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last four hundred years that he started 
 was the way we found which set of bones
 actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with
  leftover hair that was copernicus  ' hair obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on 
 that match was unambiguous  the dna matched  and we know that this was indeed nicolaus copernicus 
 now the connection between biology and dna and life
 is very tantalizing when you talk about copernicus because  even back then his followers very quickly made the logical step
 to ask
 if the earth is just a planet then what about planets around other stars  what about the idea of the plurality of the worlds about life on other planets in fact i 'm borrowing here from one of those very popular books of the time  
 and at the time  people actually answered that question positively yes 
 but there was no evidence and here begins four hundred years of
  frustration of unfulfilled dreams the dreams of galileo giordano bruno many others
 which never led to the answer of those very basic questions which humanity has asked all the time what is life what is the origin of life 
 are we alone 
 and that especially happened in the
  the end of the 20th century when the beautiful developments due to molecular biology understanding the code of life dna 
 all of that seemed to actually put us not closer  but further apart from answering those basic questions 
 now the good news a lot has happened in the last few years  and let 's start with the planets  let 's start with the old copernican question  are there earths around other stars
  and as we already heard there is a way in which we are trying  and now able to answer that question it 's a new telescope 
 our team befittingly i think named it after one of those dreamers of the copernican time johannes kepler  
 and that telescope 's sole purpose is to go out find the planets that orbit other stars in our
  galaxy  and tell us how often do planets like our own earth
 happen to be out there 
 the telescope is actually built similarly to the well known to you hubble space telescope  except it does have an additional lens a
 wide field lens as you would call it as a photographer  and
  in the next couple of months you walk out in the early evening and look straight up
 and place you palm like this you will actually be looking at the field of the sky
 where this telescope is searching for planets
 day and night  without any interruption for the next four years  
 the way we do that actually is with a method which we call the transit method it 's actually
  that occur when a planet passes in front of its star not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented for us to be able do that 
 but if you have a million stars  you 'll find enough planets  
 and
 as you see on this animation what kepler is going to detect is just the dimming of the light from the star we are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this all the stars for kepler are just points of light  
 but we learn a lot from that not only that there is a planet
  there  but we also learn its size how much of the light is being dimmed depends on how big the
 planet
 is we learn about its orbit the period of its orbit and so on so what have we learned 
 well let me try to walk you through what we actually see and so you understand
 the news that i 'm here to tell you today
 is discover a lot of candidates which we then follow up and find as planets  confirm as planets
 it basically tells us this is the distribution of planets in size there are small planets there are bigger planets there are big planets  okay  so we count many many such planets and they have different sizes we do that in our solar
  during the ancients the solar system in that sense would look on a diagram like this 
 there will be the smaller planets  and there will be the big planets  even back to the time of epicurus and then of course copernicus
 and his followers up until recently that was the solar system four earth like planets with small radius smaller than about two
 times the size
  of the earth and that was of course mercury 
 venus  mars and of course the earth and then the two big giant planets  then the copernican revolution brought in telescopes and
 of course
 three more planets were discovered now the total planet number in our solar system was nine 
 the small planets dominated and there was a certain harmony to that which actually copernicus was very happy to note and
 kepler was one of the big proponents of 
 so now we have pluto to join the numbers of small planets 
 but up until  literally fifteen years ago that was all we knew about planets  and that 's what the frustration was the copernican dream was unfulfilled 
 finally fifteen years ago  the technology came to the point where we could discover a planet around another star and
 we actually did
 pretty well in the next fifteen years almost five hundred planets were discovered orbiting other stars with different methods  
 unfortunately as you can see there was a very different picture  
 there was of course an explanation for it  we only see the big planets so that 's why most of those planets are really in the category of like jupiter 
 but you see  we haven 't gone very
  we were still back where copernicus was we didn 't have any evidence whether planets like the earth are out there and we do care about planets like the earth because
 by now we understood that life as a chemical system
 really needs a smaller planet with water and with rocks and with a lot of complex chemistry to originate to emerge to survive  
 and we didn 't have the evidence
  so today i 'm here to actually give you a first glimpse of what the new telescope kepler has been able to tell us in the last few weeks 
 and lo and behold we are back to the harmony and to fulfilling the dreams of copernicus you can see here  the small planets dominate the picture 
 the planets which are marked like earth [
 are ] definitely more
  that we see and now for the first time we can say that there is a lot more work we need to do with this most of these are candidates in the next few years we will confirm them  
 but the statistical result is loud and clear  and the statistical result is that planets like our own earth
 are out there our own milky way galaxy is rich in this kind of planets  so the question is what do we do next well
  first of all we can study them now that we know where they are 
 and we can find those that we would call habitable meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions
 that we experience here on earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen 
  so we can even put a number to how many of those planets now do we expect our own milky way galaxy
  harbors  and the number as you might expect is pretty staggering it 's about one hundred million such planets 
 that 's great news why because with our own little telescope just in the next two years we 'll be able to identify at least sixty of them  
 so that 's great because then we can go and study them
 remotely of course with all the techniques that we already
  have tested in the past five years we can find what they 're made of would their atmospheres have water carbon dioxide methane we know and expect that we 'll see that 
 that 's great  but that is not the whole news that 's not why i 'm here why i 'm here is to tell you that the next step
  really the exciting part the one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next  and here comes biology
 biology with its basic question which still stands unanswered which is essentially if
 there is life on other planets  do we expect it to be like life on earth and let me immediately tell you here when i say life i
  good life human life i really mean life
 on earth  past and present from microbes to us humans in its rich molecular diversity the way we now understand life
 on earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions and we call that  collectively biochemistry 
 life as a chemical process as a chemical phenomenon  so the question is is that chemical
  phenomenon universal  or
 is it something which depends on the planet 
 is it like gravity which is the same everywhere in the universe  or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them 
 we need to know what we are looking for when we try to do that  and
  that 's a very basic question which we
 don 't know the answer to but which we can try and we are trying to answer in the lab  we don 't need to go to space to answer that question 
 and so that 's what we are trying to do and that 's what many people now are trying to do and a lot of the good news comes from that part
 of the bridge that we are trying to build as well  so this is one example that i want to show you here
  when we think of what is necessary for the phenomenon that we call life we think of compartmentalization 
 keeping the molecules which are important for life
 in a membrane isolated from the rest of the environment but yet in an environment in which they actually could originate together 
 and
 in one of our labs jack szostak 's labs it was a series of experiments in the last four years that showed
  that the environments which are very common on planets  on certain types of planets like the earth  where you have some liquid water and some clays you actually end up with
 naturally available molecules
 which spontaneously form bubbles but those bubbles have membranes very similar to the membrane of every cell of every living
  earth looks like like this and they really help
 molecules like nucleic acids like rna and dna  stay inside  develop 
 change divide and do some of the processes that we call life now this is just an example to tell you the pathway in which we are trying to answer that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon
 in a sense you can think of that work that people are starting to do now around the world
 as building a bridge 
 building a bridge from two sides of the river 
 on one hand on the left bank of the river are the people like me who study those planets and try to define the environments  we don 't want to go blind because there 's too
  and there is not too much lab  and there is not enough human
 time to actually to do all the experiments so that 's what we are building from the left side of the river from the right bank of the river are the experiments in the lab that i just showed 
  you where we actually tried that and it feeds back and forth  and we hope to meet in the middle one day 
 well  there are many reasons and you heard some of them in the short talk today  this
 understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives  but there is something more profound here something deeper  
 and that deeper  
 underlying
 point is that science is in the
  of redefining life as we know it  and that is going to change our worldview in a profound way
 not in a dissimilar way as four hundred years ago copernicus  ' act did 
 by changing the way we view space and time  
 now it 's about something else  but it 's equally profound and half the time
  what 's happened is it 's related this kind of sense of insignificance to
 humankind to the earth in a bigger space and the more we learn the more
 that was reinforced you 've all learned that in school how small the earth is compared
  to the immense universe and the bigger the telescope the bigger that universe becomes  
 and look at this image of the tiny  blue dot this pixel is the earth  
 it is the earth as we know it  it is seen from in this case from outside the orbit of saturn  
 but it 's really tiny  we know that let 's think of life
 as that entire planet because
  in a sense it is the biosphere is the size of the earth  life on earth is the size of the earth 
 and let 's compare it to the rest of the world in
 spatial terms what if that copernican
 insignificance was actually all wrong  
 would that make us more responsible for what is happening today  let 's actually try that  so in space the earth is very small 
 can you imagine how small it is
 let me try it okay  let 's say this is the size
 of the observable universe with all the galaxies with all the stars  okay from here to here 
 do you know what the size of life in this
 necktie will be it will be the size of a single small atom
  small we can 't imagine it i mean look you can see the necktie but you can 't even imagine seeing the size of a little small atom  
 but that 's not the whole story you see the universe and life are both in space and time  if that
 was
 the age of the universe then this is the age of life
  on earth  
 think about those oldest living things on earth  but in a cosmic proportion this is not insignificant 
 this is very significant  so life might be insignificant in size  but it is not insignificant in time  
 life and the universe compare to each other like a child and a parent parent and offspring
  so what does this tell us this tells us that that insignificance paradigm that we somehow got
 to learn from the copernican principle it 's all wrong  
 there is immense 
 powerful potential in life in this universe especially now that we know that places like the earth are common 
 and that potential
  that powerful potential is also our potential of you and me and if we are to be stewards of our planet earth
 and its biosphere we 'd better understand
 the cosmic significance and do something about it and the good news is we can actually
  let 's do it  
 let 's start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one 
 with synthetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future  
 and let 's hope that we can build this bridge together and meet in the middle thank you very much
