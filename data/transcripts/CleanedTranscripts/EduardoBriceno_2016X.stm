  most of us go through life trying to do our best at whatever we do whether it 's our job  family school or anything else 
 i feel that way i try my best but some time ago
  i came to a realization that i wasn 't getting much better at the things i cared most about  whether it was being a husband or a friend
 or a professional or teammate  and i wasn 't improving much at those things even though i was spending a lot of time working hard at them  
 i 've since realized from conversations i 've had and from research that this stagnation despite hard work turns out to be
  like to share with you some insights into why that is and what we can all do about it 
 what i 've learned is that the most effective people and teams in any domain do something we can all emulate 
 they go through life deliberately alternating between two zones 
 the learning zone and the performance zone  
 the learning zone is when our goal is to improve  then we do activities designed for
  on what we haven 't mastered yet  which means we have to expect to make mistakes  knowing that we will learn from them 
 that is very different from what we do when we 're in our performance zone which is when our goal is to do something as best as we can to execute 
 then we concentrate on what we have already mastered and we try to minimize mistakes  
 both of these zones should be part of our lives but being clear about when we want to be in each of them with what goal focus and expectations
  helps us better perform and better improve  the performance zone maximizes our immediate performance while the learning zone maximizes our growth and our future performance  
 the reason many of us don 't improve much despite our hard work is that we tend to spend almost all of our time in the performance zone  
 this hinders our growth and ironically over the long term also our performance
  so what does the learning zone look like 
 take demosthenes a political leader and the greatest orator and lawyer in ancient greece 
 to become great he didn 't spend all his time just being an orator or a lawyer which would be his performance zone  
 but instead he did activities designed for improvement 
  he studied a lot he studied law and philosophy with guidance from mentors  but he also realized that being a lawyer involved persuading other people  so he also studied great speeches and acting 
 to get rid of an odd habit he had of involuntarily lifting his shoulder  he practiced his speeches in front of a mirror  and he suspended a sword from the ceiling so that if he raised his shoulder  it would hurt
  to speak more clearly despite a lisp  he went through his speeches with stones in his mouth  
 he built an underground room where he could practice without interruptions and not disturb other people and since courts at the time were very noisy  he also practiced by the ocean  projecting his voice above the roar of the waves 
 his activities in the learning zone were very different from his activities in court his
  in the learning zone he did what dr anders ericsson calls deliberate practice  
 this involves breaking down abilities into component skills being clear about what subskill we 're working to improve  like keeping our shoulders down  
 giving full concentration to a high level of challenge outside our comfort zone just beyond what we can currently do  
 using frequent feedback with repetition and adjustments  and ideally engaging the guidance of a skilled coach  because activities designed for improvement are
 domain specific and great teachers and coaches know what those activities are and can also give us expert feedback 
 it is this type of practice in the learning zone which leads to substantial improvement not just time on task performing 
 for example  research shows that after the first couple of years working in a profession performance usually plateaus
  this has been shown to be true in teaching  general medicine  nursing and other fields  and it happens because once we think we have become good enough  adequate  
 then we stop spending time in the learning zone we focus all our time on just doing our job  performing  which turns out not to be a great way to improve  
 but the people who continue to spend time in the learning zone do continue to always improve  
 the best salespeople at least once a week do activities with the goal of improvement they read
  to extend their knowledge  consult with colleagues or domain experts try out new strategies  solicit feedback and reflect  
 the best chess players spend a lot of time not playing games of chess which would be their performance zone  but trying to predict the moves grand masters made and analyzing them 
 each of us has probably spent many many many hours
 typing on a computer without
  getting faster  
 but if we spent ten to twenty minutes each day fully concentrating on typing ten to twenty percent faster than our current reliable speed we would get faster especially 
  if we also identified what mistakes we 're making and practiced typing those words 
  much because we 're always in the performance zone  
 now this is not to say that the performance zone has no value  it very much does 
 when i needed a knee surgery i didn 't tell the surgeon poke around in there and focus on what you don 't know we
 'll learn from your mistakes i looked for a surgeon who i
 would do a good job and i wanted her to do a good job  
 being in the performance zone allows us to get things done as best as we can 
 it can also be motivating and it provides us with information to identify what to focus on next when we go back to the learning zone  
 so the way to high performance is to alternate between the learning zone and the performance zone  purposefully building our skills in the learning zone  then applying those skills in the performance zone
  is on tour during the concert she 's in her performance zone  but every night when she gets back to the hotel room she goes right back into her learning zone  
 she watches a video of the show that just ended  she identifies opportunities for improvement for herself her dancers and her camera staff and the next morning everyone receives pages of notes with what to adjust which they then work on during the
  but we need to know when we seek to learn and when we seek to perform and while we want to spend time doing both the more time we spend in the learning zone  the more we 'll improve  
 so how can we spend more time in the learning zone  
 first  we must believe and understand that we can improve  what we call a growth mindset 
  we must want to improve at that particular skill there has to be a purpose we care about because it takes time and effort  
 third  we must have an idea about how to improve what we can do to improve  
 not how i used to practice the guitar as a teenager  performing songs over and over again  but doing deliberate practice  
 and fourth  we must be in a low stakes situation  
 because if mistakes are to be expected  then the consequence of making them must not be catastrophic or even very
  significant a tightrope walker doesn 't practice new tricks without a net underneath  and an athlete wouldn 't set out to first try a new move during a championship match 
 one reason that in our lives we spend so much time in the performance zone is that our environments often are unnecessarily high stakes  
 we create social
 social risks for one another even in schools which are supposed to be all about learning and i 'm not talking about standardized tests 
 i mean that every minute of every day many students in elementary schools through colleges feel that if they make a mistake  others will think less of them  
 no wonder they 're always stressed out and not taking the risks necessary for learning  
 but they learn that mistakes are undesirable inadvertently when teachers or parents are eager to hear just correct answers and reject mistakes rather than welcome and examine them to learn from
  them or when we look for narrow responses rather than encourage more exploratory thinking that we can all learn from 
 when all homework or student work has a number or a letter on it and counts towards a final grade rather than being used for practice mistakes feedback and revision we send the message that school is a performance zone  
 the same is true in
  in the companies i consult with i often see flawless execution cultures which leaders foster to encourage great work but that leads employees to stay within what they know and not try new things so companies struggle to innovate and improve  and they fall behind 
 we can create more spaces for growth by starting conversations with one another about when we want to be in each zone 
 what do we want to get better at and how and when do we want to execute and minimize mistakes
 that way we gain clarity about what success is when and how to best support one another  
 but what if we find ourselves in a chronic high stakes setting and we feel we can 't start those conversations yet  
 then here are three things that we can still do as individuals first we can create low stakes islands in an otherwise
  these are spaces where mistakes have little consequence 
 for example  we might find a mentor or a trusted colleague with whom we can exchange ideas or have vulnerable conversations or even role play 
 or we can ask for  feedback oriented meetings as projects progress 
 or we can set aside time to read or watch videos or take online courses those are just some examples  
 second  we can execute and perform as we 're expected  but then reflect on what we could do better next time like
 and we can observe and emulate experts  the observation reflection and adjustment is a learning zone and finally  we can lead
 and lower the stakes for others by sharing what we want to get better at by asking questions about what we don 't know by soliciting feedback and by sharing our mistakes and what we 've learned from them  so that others can feel safe to do the same 
 real confidence is about modeling
 ongoing learning what if instead of spending our lives doing doing doing
 we were working to improve  what if we created more low stakes islands
 and waters 
 and what if we got clear within ourselves and with our teammates 
 about when we seek to learn and when we seek to perform  so that our efforts can become more consequential 
 our improvement never ending and
 our best
 even better
