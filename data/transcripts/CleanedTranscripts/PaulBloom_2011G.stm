  i 'm going to talk today about the pleasures of everyday life  but i want to begin with a story of an unusual and terrible man  this is hermann goering 
 goering was hitler 's second in command in world war ii his designated successor and like hitler goering fancied himself a
  collector of art  he went through europe  through world war ii stealing extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection 
 and what he really wanted was something by vermeer 
 hitler had two of them  and he didn 't have any  so he finally found an art dealer a dutch art dealer named han van meegeren 
 who sold him a wonderful vermeer for the cost of what would now be ten million dollars 
  was his favorite artwork ever 
 world war ii came to an end and goering was captured  tried at nuremberg and ultimately sentenced to death
  then the allied forces went through his collections and found the paintings and went after the people who sold it to him 
 and at some point the dutch police came into amsterdam and arrested van meegeren 
 van meegeren was charged with the crime of treason  which is itself
  punishable by death  
 six weeks into his prison sentence van meegeren confessed  
 but he didn 't confess to treason he said i did not sell a great masterpiece to that nazi  
 i painted it myself i 'm a forger 
 now nobody believed him  and he said i
  bring me a canvas and some paint and i will paint a vermeer much better than i sold that disgusting nazi  i also need alcohol and morphine because it 's the only way i can work 
 so
 they brought him in he painted a beautiful vermeer  and then the charges of treason were dropped 
 he had a lesser charge of forgery got a year
 sentence and died a hero to the dutch people there 's a lot more to be said
  about van meegeren  but i want to turn now to goering who 's pictured here being interrogated at nuremberg now goering was by all accounts a terrible man even for a nazi  he was a terrible man
  his american interrogators described him as an amicable psychopath  
 but you could feel sympathy for the reaction he had when he was told that his favorite painting was actually a forgery
  to his biographer he looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world 
 and he killed himself soon afterwards  
 he had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually
 that it looked the same but it had a different origin it was a different artwork  it wasn 't just him who was in for a shock once van
  meegeren was on trial he couldn 't stop talking  and he boasted about all the great masterpieces that he himself had painted that were attributed to other artists in particular the supper at
 emmaus which was viewed as vermeer 's finest masterpiece his best work people would come [ from ] all over the world to see it
  that painting and when that was discovered  it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum 
 why does this matter i 'm a
 psychologists why do origins matter so much why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from well there 's an answer that many people would give many sociologists like veblen and wolfe
 would argue that the reason why we we take origins so seriously is because we 're snobs because we 're focused on status  among other things if you want to show off how rich you are how powerful you are
  it 's always better to own an original than a forgery because there 's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries  
 i don 't doubt that that plays some role  but what i want to convince you of today is that there 's something else going on 
 i want to convince you that humans are to some extent natural born essentialists what i mean by this is we don 't just respond to things as we see them or feel them or hear them  rather our response is
  conditioned on our beliefs about what they really are what they came from what they 're made of 
 what their hidden nature is 
 i want to suggest that this is true not just for how we think about things  but how we react to things  so i want to suggest that pleasure is deep and that this isn 't true just for
 higher level pleasures like
  even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences  so take food 
 would you eat this 
 well a good answer is it depends what is it 
 some of you would eat it if it 's pork but not beef some of you would eat it if it 's beef but not pork  few of you would eat it if it 's a rat or a human some of you would eat it only if it 's a strangely colored piece of tofu 
 that 's not so surprising  but what 's more interesting
  is how it tastes to you
 will depend critically on what you think you 're eating  
 so one demonstration of this was done with young children how do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk to think they taste better it 's simple  
  they believe mcdonald 's food is tastier and it leads them to experience it as tastier  
 how do you get adults to really enjoy wine  
 it 's very simple  
 pour it from an expensive bottle there are now dozens perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you 're drinking the expensive stuff  it tastes better to you 
 this was recently done with a neuroscientific twist  they get people into a fmri scanner and while they 're lying there through a tube  they get to sip wine 
 in front of them on a screen
  is information about the wine  everybody of course drinks exactly the same wine  but if you believe you 're drinking expensive stuff  
 parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a christmas tree 
 it 's not just that you say it 's more pleasurable you say you like it more you really experience it in a different way 
 or take sex these are stimuli i 've used in some of my studies
  and if you simply show people these pictures they 'll say these are fairly attractive people  but how attractive you find them how
 sexually or romantically moved you are by them  rests critically on who you think you 're looking at 
 you probably think the picture on the left is male the one on the right is female if that belief turns out to be mistaken it will make a difference
  make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are  it will make a difference if you were to discover that the person you 're looking at with lust is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter your mother or father knowing somebody 's your kin typically kills the libido  
 maybe one of the most heartening findings from the psychology of pleasure is there 's more to looking good than your physical appearance  if you like somebody they look better to you
 this is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do 
 a particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as capgras syndrome 
 so capgras syndrome is a disorder where
 you get a specific delusion sufferers of capgras syndrome believe that the people they love most in the world
  have been replaced by perfect duplicates 
 now often a result of capgras syndrome is tragic people have murdered those that they loved believing that they were murdering an imposter  
 but there 's at least one case where capgras syndrome had a happy ending 
 research described a woman with capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover but that was before she got capgras syndrome
 after she got it she was happy to report that she has discovered that he possessed a double who was rich virile handsome and aristocratic of course it was the same man but she was seeing him in different ways 
 as a third example consider consumer products  
 so one reason why you might like something is its utility  you can put shoes on your feet you can play golf with golf clubs and chewed up bubble gum doesn 't do anything at all for you 
 but each of
  these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history  
 the golf clubs were owned by john  f kennedy and sold for three quarters of a million dollars at auction 
 the bubble gum was chewed up by pop star britney spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars and in fact there 's a thriving market in the partially eaten
  the shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all according to an unconfirmed report a saudi millionaire offered ten million dollars for this pair of shoes 
 they were the ones thrown at george bush
 at an iraqi press conference several years ago 
 applause now this attraction to objects doesn 't just work for celebrity objects each one of us most
  have something in our life that 's literally irreplaceable in that it has value because of its history maybe your wedding ring maybe your child 's baby shoes
 so that if it was lost you couldn 't get it back you could get something that looked like it or felt like it but you couldn 't get the same object back 
 with my colleagues george newman and gil diesendruck we 've looked to see what sort of factors what sort of history matters for the objects that people like so in one of our experiments we asked people to name a famous person who
  who they adored a living person they adored  so one answer was george clooney then we asked them how much would you pay for george clooney 's sweater and
 the answer is a fair amount more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn 't adore  
 then we asked other groups of subjects
 we gave them different restrictions
 and different conditions so for instance we told some people
  sweater  but you can 't tell anybody you own it and you can 't resell it 
 that drops the value of it  suggesting that that 's one reason why we like it  
 but what really causes an effect is you tell people look you could resell it you could boast about it  but before it gets to you it 's thoroughly washed 
 that causes a huge drop in the value 
 as my wife put it you 've washed away the clooney
  cooties 
 so let 's go back to art  
 i would love a chagall i love the work of chagall if people want to get me something at the end of the conference you could buy me a chagall but i don 't want a duplicate  
 even if i can 't tell the difference that 's not because or it 's not simply because i 'm a snob and want to boast about having an original  rather it 's because i want something that has a specific history 
 in the case of artwork the
  history is special indeed the philosopher denis dutton in his wonderful book the art instinct 
 makes the case that the value of an artwork is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation and that could explain the difference between an original and a forgery  they may look alike  
 but they have a different history the original is typically the product of a creative act
  the forgery isn 't 
 i think this approach can explain differences in people 's taste in art 
 this is a work by jackson pollock  who here likes the work of jackson pollock  
 okay who here it does nothing for them they just don 't like it
  i 'm not going to make a claim about about who 's right but i will make an empirical claim about people 's intuitions  which is that if you like the work of
  you 'll tend more so than the people who don 't like it to believe that these works are difficult to create 
 that they require a lot of time and energy and creative energy  
 i use jackson pollock on purpose as an example because there 's a young american artist who paints very much in the style of jackson pollock  and her work was worth many tens of thousands of dollars 
 in large part because she 's a very young artist this is marla olmstead who did most of her work when she was three years old
  is her family made the mistake of inviting the television program sixty minutes ii into their house to film her painting  
 and they then reported that her father was coaching her 
 when this came out on television the value of her art dropped to nothing 
 it was the same art physically  but the history had changed 
  i 've been focusing now on the visual arts but i want to give two examples from music this is joshua bell a very famous violinist and the washington post reporter gene weingarten decided to enlist him 
  for an audacious experiment the question is how much would people like joshua bell  the music of joshua bell  if they didn 't know they were listening to joshua bell  
  subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make and here 's a brief clip of this 
 after being there for three quarters of an hour he made thirty two dollars 
 not bad it 's also not good apparently to really enjoy the music of joshua bell  you have to know you 're listening
 to joshua bell  he actually made twenty dollars more than that but he didn 't count it
 because this woman comes up you see at the end of the video she comes up she had heard him at the library of congress a few weeks before at this
 extravagant   black tie affair so she 's stunned that he 's standing in a subway station
 so she 's struck with pity she reaches into her purse and hands him a twenty 
 the second example from music is from john cage 's modernist composition
 as many of you know this is the composition where
 the pianist sits at a bench  opens up the piano and sits and does nothing for four minutes and thirty three seconds that period of silence  and people have different views on this but what i want to point out is
 you can buy this from itunes 
  listen to that silence which is different than other forms of silence now
 i 've been talking so far about pleasure  but what i want to suggest is that everything i 've said applies as well to pain 
 and how you think about what you 're experiencing your beliefs about the essence of it  affect how it hurts one lovely experiment was
 by kurt gray and dan wegner what they did was they hooked up harvard undergraduates to an electric shock machine  and they gave them a series of painful electric shocks  so it was a series of five painful shocks  
 half of them are told that they 're being given the shocks by somebody in another room 
 but the person in the other room doesn 't know they 're giving them shocks there 's no malevolence they 're just pressing a button  the first shock is recorded as very painful  
 the second shock feels less painful because you get a bit used to it the third drops the fourth the fifth
 the pain
 gets less 
 in the other condition they 're told that the person in the next room is shocking them on purpose knows they 're shocking them  
 the first shock hurts like hell  the second shock hurts just as much  and the third and the fourth and the fifth  it hurts more if you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose 
 the most extreme example of this is that in some cases
 pain under the right circumstances can transform into pleasure 
 humans have this extraordinarily interesting property that will often seek out low level doses of pain in controlled circumstances and take pleasure from it as in the eating of hot chili peppers
 and roller coaster rides  the point was nicely summarized by the poet john milton
 who wrote the mind is its own place
  in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven and i 'll end with that thank you
