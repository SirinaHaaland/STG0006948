  my name is golan levin i 'm an artist and an engineer which is increasingly a more common kind of hybrid  but i still fall into this weird crack where
 people don 't seem to understand me and
  we can 't imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art and they still haven 't 
 and lest you think that you all as the digerati are more enlightened i went to the apple
 iphone app store the other day  where 's art  i got productivity i got sports and somehow the
  that one would want to make art for the iphone 
 which my friends and i are doing now is still not reflected in our understanding of what computers are for so from both directions there is kind of i think a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day or her own day  
 which i think artists are obliged to do is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have in my own case i 'm an artist and i 'm really
  expanding the vocabulary of human action and
 basically empowering people through interactivity i want people to discover themselves as actors as creative actors by having interactive experiences
 a lot of my work is about trying to get away from this this a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine and when i say desktop i don 't just mean the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface 
  of the desk if you look carefully you can even see a hint of the apple menu up here in the upper left where the virtual world has literally
 punched through to the physical  so
 this is as joy mountford once said the mouse is probably the narrowest straw you could try to suck all of human expression through and
 the thing i 'm really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich kinds of of interactive experiences how can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies as a way of of exploring aesthetic experiences  not necessarily utilitarian
  ones so i write software and that 's how i do it and a lot of my experiences
 resemble mirrors in some way  because this is in some sense the first way that people discover their own potential as actors and discover their own agency by saying who is that person in the mirror oh it 's actually me 
 and so to give an example 
 this is a project from last year which is called the interstitial fragment processor  and it allows people to explore the negative shapes
  that they create when they 're just going about their everyday business  
  so as people make shapes with their hands or their heads and so forth or with each other 
  air basically taking what 's often this kind of  unseen space or this this undetected space  and making it something real that people then can appreciate and become creative with  
 so again people discover
 their creative agency in this way  and their own personalities come out in totally unique ways  so
 in addition
  something that i 've explored now for a while has been the use of the voice  which is an immensely expressive
 system for us vocalizing song is one of our oldest
 ways of of making ourselves
 heard and understood  and i came across this fantastic research by wolfgang khler the so called father of gestalt psychology from one thousand nine hundred and twenty seven who submitted to an audience like yourselves the following two shapes  and he said one of them is called
  anyone want to hazard a guess  maluma is on
 top  yeah so as he says here most people answer without any hesitation so what we 're really seeing here is a phenomenon called phonaesthesia  which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have 
 and so whereas dr oliver sacks has talked about how perhaps one person in a million actually has true synesthesia where they hear colors or taste shapes and things like this phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent it 's about mappings
  different perceptual domains like hardness sharpness brightness and darkness  and the phonemes that we 're able to speak with so seventy years on there 's been some research where cognitive psychologists have actually sussed 
  out the extent to which you know l m and b are more associated with shapes that look like this and p t and k are perhaps more associated with shapes like this and here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature that we can exploit numerically a relative mapping between
  curvature and and shape  
 so it occurred to me  what happens if we could run these backwards and thus was born the project called remark  which is a collaboration with zachary lieberman and the ars electronica futurelab  
 and this is an interactive installation which presents the fiction that speech casts visible shadows  so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light  and as you do you see the shadows of your own speech and they sort of fly away out of your head
  speech recognition system is able to recognize what you 're saying 
 then it spells it out and if it isn 't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made  so let 's bring up a video of that
  okay
  this project here i was working with the great abstract vocalist jaap blonk  and he is a world expert in performing the ursonate which is
  which is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense  and  it 's almost impossible to perform but jaap is one of the world experts in performing it and in this
 project we 've developed a form of intelligent real time subtitles so these are our live subtitles that are being produced by a computer that knows the text of the ursonate fortunately jaap does
  very well and it is delivering that text at the same time as jaap is
 all the text you 're going to see is real time generated by the computer visualizing what he 's doing with his voice
  here you can see the set up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him
  the full videos are online if you are interested i got a split reaction to that during the live performance because there is some people who understand live subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron  because usually
  someone making them afterwards and then a bunch of people who were
  what 's the big deal i see subtitles all the time on television you know 
 they don 't imagine the person in the booth typing it all  
 so in addition to the full body  and in addition to the voice  
 another thing that i 've been really interested in most recently is the use of the the eyes or the gaze in terms of how people relate to each other 
 it 's a really profound amount of nonverbal information that 's communicated with the eyes
 's one of the most interesting technical challenges that 's very currently active in the computer sciences being able to have a camera that can understand from a fairly big distance away how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another to reveal what you 're interested in and where your attention is directed  
 so
 there is a lot of
 emotional communication that happens there and so i 've been
  with a variety of different projects to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes and basically to ask the questions what if
 art was aware that we were looking at it 
 how could it respond in a way to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we 're looking at it and what could it do if it could look back at us  and so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects  in the first one which i 'm going to show you
  it 's a piece of interactive software in which if we read this little circle 
 the trace left by the looking of the previous observer looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer the idea is that it 's an image wholly constructed from its own history of being viewed
 by different people in an installation  so let me just switch over so we can do the live demo so let 's run this and see if it works
  there is lots of nice bright video there is just a little test screen that shows that it 's working and what i 'm just going to do is i 'm going to hide that and you can see here that what it 's doing is it 's recording my eyes every time i blink  
 hello  and i can hello 
 okay and no matter where i am what 's really going on here is that it 's an eye tracking system that tries to locate my eyes and if i get really far away
 to have these kind of blurry spots like this that maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way  but if i come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this this laptop then you 'll see these nice crisp eyes you 
  can think of it as a way of sort of typing with your eyes and what you 're typing are recordings of your eyes as you 're looking at other peoples ' eyes  so each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them  
  where there are thousands and thousands of eyes that people could be
 staring at as you see who 's looking at the people looking at the people looking before them  
 so i 'll just add a couple more blink  blink  and you can see just once again how it 's sort of finding my eyes and and doing its best to
 estimate when it 's blinking alright let 's leave that so that 's this
  last couple pieces i 'm going to show are basically in the new realm of robotics for me new for me it 's called
 and i 'm going to show a video of the older version of it which is just a minute long 
  in response to one 's own blinks so it blinks one second after you do
  this is a device which is intended to reduce the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials just
 one eye looking at you and eliminating everything else about a face but just to consider gaze in an isolated way as a kind of as an element
  and at the same time it attempts to engage in what you might call familiar
  away if you look at it too long because it gets shy or things like that 
 okay  so the last project i 'm going to show is this new one called snout 
 it 's an eight foot snout with a googly eye and inside it 's got an 800 pound robot arm that i borrowed
  a friend 
 it helps to have good friends i 'm at carnegie mellon we 've got a great robotics institute there i 'd like to show you thing called snout which is
 the the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it 's continually surprised to see you
  its other name is doubletaker taker of doubles it 's always kind of doing a double take what and the idea is basically can it look at you and and make you feel as if like
  and
  got a computer vision system and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most
  those are its targets  up there is the skeleton which is actually what it 's trying to do
 it 's really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature  hollywood does this all the time of course  but also have the
 body language communicate something to the person who is looking at it this language is communicating that it is surprised to see you and it 's interested in looking at you 
 thank you very much that 's all i 've got for today and i 'm really happy to be here
