  i 'd like to talk today about a powerful and fundamental aspect of who we are our voice
  each one of us has a unique voiceprint that reflects our age
  our size even our lifestyle and personality 
 in the words of the poet longfellow 
 the human voice is the organ of the soul 
 as a speech scientist  i 'm fascinated by how the voice is produced and i have an idea
 for how it can be engineered that 's what i 'd like to share with you i 'm going to start by playing you a sample of a voice that you may recognize
  professor stephen hawking what you may not know is that same voice may also be used by this little girl
 who is unable to speak because of a neurological condition 
 in fact all of these individuals may be using the same voice  and that 's because there 's only a few options available 
  there are two point five million americans
 who are unable to speak  and many of whom use computerized devices to communicate  now that 's millions of people worldwide
 who are using generic voices  including professor hawking who uses an american accented voice 
 this lack of individuation of the synthetic voice really hit home when i was at an assistive technology conference a few years ago
 and i recall walking into an exhibit hall
 and seeing a little girl and a grown man having a conversation using their devices 
 different devices but the same voice and
 i looked around and i saw this happening all around me  literally hundreds of individuals
  a handful of voices voices that didn 't fit their bodies
 or their personalities  
 we wouldn 't dream of fitting a little girl with the prosthetic limb of a grown man
  so why then the same prosthetic voice  
 it really struck me  and i wanted to do something about this  
 i 'm going to play you now a sample of someone who has two people actually who have severe speech
  listen to how they sound they 're saying the same utterance
 you probably didn 't understand what they said but i hope that you heard their unique vocal identities  
 so what i wanted to do next is i wanted to find out how we could harness these residual
 vocal abilities
 and build a technology that could be customized for them  voices that could be customized for them  
 so i reached out to my collaborator tim bunnell dr bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis  
 and what he 'd been doing is building personalized voices for people
 by putting together
  samples of their voice and reconstructing a voice for them  these are people who had lost their voice later in life 
 we didn 't have the luxury of pre recorded samples of speech for those born with speech disorder  
 but i thought there had to be a way to reverse engineer a voice from whatever little is left over  so we decided to do exactly that 
 we set out with a little bit of funding from the national science foundation to create
 their unique vocal identities  we call this project vocalid or vocal i d for vocal identity  
 now before i get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it i need to give you a real quick speech science lesson 
 okay so first we know that the voice is changing dramatically over the course of development 
 children sound different from teens who sound different from adults
  've all experienced this 
 fact number two is that speech is a combination of the source 
 which is the vibrations generated by your voice box  which are then pushed through the rest of the vocal tract 
 these are the chambers of your head and neck
 that vibrate  and
  actually filter that source sound to produce consonants and vowels so the combination
 of source and filter is how we produce speech and that happens in one individual now
 i told you earlier that i 'd spent a good part of my career
 understanding and studying the source characteristics of people with severe speech disorder  
 and what i 've found is that even though their filters were impaired
  they were able to modulate their source the pitch the loudness the tempo of their voice  these are called prosody  and i 've been documenting for years
 that the prosodic abilities of these individuals are preserved  so
 when i realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity
  i had this idea
  why don 't we take the source from the person we want the voice to sound like because it 's preserved  and borrow the filter
 from someone about the same age and size  because they can articulate speech  and then mix them  
 because when we mix them  we can get a voice that 's as clear as our surrogate talker
 that 's the person we borrowed the
  similar in identity to our target talker  it 's that simple that 's the science behind what we 're doing  
 so once you have that in mind how do you go about building this voice  
 well you have to find someone who is willing to be a surrogate 
 it 's not such an ominous thing being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances the process goes something like
  this voice things happen in pairs  i love to sleep the sky is blue without clouds 
 rp now she 's going to go on like this for about three to four hours  and the idea is not for her to say everything that the target is going to want to say 
 but the idea is to cover all the different combinations of the sounds that occur in the language 
  speech you have the better sounding voice you 're going to have once you have those recordings what we need to do is we have to parse these
 recordings into little snippets of speech one or two sound combinations sometimes even whole words
 that start populating a dataset or a database we 're
  going to call this database a voice bank 
 now the power of the voice bank is that from this voice bank  we can now say any new utterance like i love chocolate everyone needs to be able to say that
 fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance voice 
 i love chocolate rp 
 so that 's speech synthesis it 's called concatenative synthesis and that 's what we 're using that 's not the novel part what 's novel is how we make it sound like this young woman
  this is samantha  i met her when she was nine
  and since then my team and i have been trying to build her a personalized voice  
 we first had to find a surrogate donor  and then we had to have samantha produce some utterances 
 what she can produce are mostly vowel like sounds but that 's enough for us to extract her source characteristics 
 what happens next is best
  described by my daughter 's analogy  she 's six she calls it mixing colors to paint voices it
 's beautiful it 's exactly that samantha 's voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate
  this voice is only for me  i can 't wait to use my new voice with my friends
  across her face when she heard that voice for the first time 
 now there 's millions of people around the world like samantha millions  
 and we 've only begun to scratch the surface  what we 've done so far is we have a few surrogate talkers from around the u s who have donated their voices  and we have been using those to build our first few personalized voices
 but there 's so much more work to be done for samantha her surrogate came from somewhere in the midwest a stranger who gave her the gift of voice 
 and as a scientist  i 'm so excited to take this work out of the laboratory and finally into the real world so it can have 
  i want to share with you next is how i envision taking this work to that next level  i imagine
 a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life different sizes different ages coming together
 in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities to do that as a
  as a way to bring together those who want to join us as voice donors as expertise donors in whatever way to make this vision a reality 
 they say that giving blood
 can save lives well giving your voice can change lives all we need
 is a few hours of speech from our surrogate talker  and as
  little as a vowel
 from our target talker to create a unique vocal identity  
 so that 's the science behind what we 're doing  i want to end by circling back to the human side
 that is really the inspiration for this work about five
  we built our very first voice for a little boy named william 
 when his mom first heard this voice  she said this is what william would have sounded like
 had he been able to speak and then i saw william
 typing a message on his device  i wondered what was he thinking  imagine
 carrying around someone else 's voice for nine years
 and finally finding your own voice
  voice  imagine that this is what william said
