  it 's wonderful to be back i love this wonderful gathering and you must be wondering what on earth have they put up the wrong slide
  ask the question  who designed it  
 this is ted this is technology entertainment design and there 's a dairy cow it 's a
 quite wonderfully designed animal  and i was thinking how do i introduce this and i thought well maybe
 that old doggerel by joyce kilmer  you know poems are made by fools like me
  only god can make a tree and you might say well god designed the cow but of course god got a lot of help  
 this is the ancestor of cattle this is the aurochs  and
 it was designed by natural selection the process of natural selection over many millions of years  and then it became domesticated 
 thousands of years ago and
 human beings
 became its stewards and without even knowing what they were doing they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it and then more recently 
  they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were how they worked and how they might be optimized how they might be made better  
  talking about cows  
 because i want to say that much the same thing is true of religions 
 religions are natural phenomena they 're just as natural as cows  they have evolved over
 millennia  they have a biological
  just like the aurochs
 they have become domesticated  and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years  
 this is ted  and i want to talk about design  because what i 've been doing for the last four years
 really since the first time you saw me some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion and in the in the last four years i 've been working
  on this topic  and you might say it 's about the reverse engineering
 of religions  now
 that very idea i think strikes terror in many people or anger or
 anxiety of one sort or another  and that is the spell that i want to break i want to say no religions are an important natural
  we should study them
 with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena like global warming as we heard so eloquently last night from al gore 
 today 's religions are brilliantly designed brilliantly designed 
 they are immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering
 and as with the cow  there 's a mixture of evolutionary design designed by natural selection itself and
 intelligent design
 more or less intelligent design and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions
  i 'm going to have just one slide about my book because
 there is one message in it which i think this group really needs to hear and i would be very interested to get your responses to this
  it 's the one policy proposal that i make in the book at this time when i claim not to know enough about religion
  to know what other policy proposals to make and it 's one that echoes
 remarks that you 've heard already today  here 's my proposal i 'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it education 
  on world religions for all of our children
 in primary school in high school in public schools in private schools and in home schooling 
 so what i 'm proposing is just as we require
  american history so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world
 about their history 
 about their creeds about their texts their music their symbolisms their prohibitions their requirements  
 and this should be
  with no particular spin to all of the children in the country and
 as long as you teach them that you can teach them anything else you like that i think is
 maximal tolerance for religious freedom as long as you
 inform your children about other religions then you may and as early as you like and whatever you like teach them
  whatever creed you want them to learn but also let them know about other religions now  why do i say that 
 because democracy depends
 on an informed citizenship informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy
  consent
 is not worth it  it 's like a coin flip it doesn 't count really democracy depends on informed consent  this is the way we treat people
 as responsible adults  now  children
 below the age of consent are a special
  i 'm going to use a word that pastor rick just used
 parents are stewards of their children they don 't own them you can 't own your children you have a responsibility
 to the world to the state to them to take care of them right 
 you may teach them whatever creed you think is most important
 but i say you have a responsibility
 to let them be informed about all the other creeds in the world too the reason i 've taken this time is i 've been
 fascinated to hear some of the reactions to this  one reviewer
 for a roman catholic newspaper
  it strikes me as
 practically libertarian is it totalitarian to require reading writing and arithmetic  i don 't think so all i 'm saying is
 and facts facts only no values just facts
 about all the world 's religions another reviewer called it
  i 'm really bothered by the fact
 that anybody would think that was hilarious  it seems to me to be such a
 plausible natural extension of the democratic principles we already have
 that i 'm shocked to think anybody would find that just
 ridiculous i know many religions
 are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith
  among their among their children that they are intent
 on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths  
 i don 't think that 's defensible  
 but i 'd really be pleased to get your answers on that any reactions to that later but now i 'm going to move on back to the cow  
  this picture which i pulled off the web
 the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture  that 's the steward cows couldn 't live
 without human stewards they 're domesticated they 're a sort of
 ectosymbiont  they depend on us for their for their survival  and
 pastor rick was
  talking about sheep i 'm going to talk about sheep too there 's a lot of
 serendipitous convergence here how clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds 
 laughter think of what this got them  they could outsource all their problems  
 protection from predators food finding 
 health maintenance 
 the only cost in most flocks not even this a loss of free mating
 what a deal 
 how clever of sheep you might say except of course it wasn 't the sheep 's cleverness we all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists they 're not very smart  
 it wasn 't the cleverness of the sheep at all they were clueless  
 but it was a very clever move
  whose clever move was it it was the clever move of natural selection itself francis crick the
  of the structure of dna with jim watson once joked about what he called orgel 's second rule  leslie orgel
  a molecular biologist brilliant guy and orgel 's second rule is evolution is cleverer than you are
  intelligent design
 not from francis crick  
 evolution is cleverer than you are if you understand orgel 's second rule  then you understand why the intelligent design
 movement is basically a hoax the designs discovered by the process of natural selection are
  unbelievably brilliant again and again biologists
 are fascinated with the brilliance of what 's discovered but the process itself is without purpose without foresight without design  
 when i was here four years ago i told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass  and why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected with a lancet 
  fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to
  spooky story  and i think some people may have misunderstood  lancet flukes aren 't smart  
 i submit that the the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there somewhere between petunia and carrot  they 're not really bright they don 't have to be the lesson we learn from this is you don 't have to have a mind
 to be a beneficiary the design is there in nature but it 's not in anybody 's head
  doesn 't have to be that 's the way evolution works  
 question was domestication good for sheep it was great for their genetic fitness and here i want to remind you of a wonderful
 point that paul maccready made at ted three years ago  here 's what he said ten thousand years ago at the dawn of agriculture human
  plus livestock and pets was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass that was just ten thousand years ago  
 yesterday in biological terms what is it today does anybody remember what he told us
 percent that is what we have done on this planet now i talked to paul afterwards i wanted to check to find out how he 'd calculated
  get the sources and so forth and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this and there was a passage in it which he did not present here and i think it is so good i 'm going to read it to you 
 over billions of years on a unique sphere 
 chance has painted a thin covering of life  complex improbable wonderful and fragile 
 suddenly we humans a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature
 have grown in population technology and intelligence to a position of
  terrible power we now wield the paintbrush 
 we heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet 
 and we 're the ones that hold the paintbrush  and how can we do that the key to our domination of the planet is culture 
 and the key to culture is religion 
 suppose martian
  scientists came to earth  they would be puzzled by many things
  anybody know what this is i 'll tell you what it is 
 this is a million people gathering on the banks of the ganges in two in two thousand and one  perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever 
 as seen from satellite photograph here 's a big crowd here 's another crowd in
 would be amazed by this they 'd want to know how it originated what it was for and how it perpetuates itself actually i 'm going to pass over this this 
 the ant isn 't alone there 's all sorts of wonderful cases of
 species
 which in that case
 a parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat and it turns the mouse into mighty mouse makes it fearless
  out in the open where it 'll be eaten by a cat true story in other words we have these hijackers you 've seen this slide before from four years ago
 a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior on behalf of a cause other than one 's own genetic fitness  
 does that ever happen to us  yes it
  to the will of allah 
 but i 'm not just talking about islam i 'm talking also about christianity  this is a parchment music page that i found in a paris bookstall fifty years ago  
 and on it it says in latin 
  the word of god is the seed and the sower of the seed is christ same idea well not
  quite  but in fact  christians too 
 glory in the fact that they have surrendered to god i 'll give you a few quotes the heart of worship is surrender 
 surrendered people obey god 's words even if it doesn 't make sense those words
  those are from the purpose driven life 
 and i want to turn now  briefly to talk about that book which i 've read you 've all got a copy and you 've just heard the man  
 and what i want to do now is say a bit about this book
 from the design standpoint because i think it 's actually a brilliant book
 first of all the goal and you heard just now what the goal is it 's to bring purpose to the lives of millions and he has succeeded 
 is it a good goal in itself i 'm sure we all agree it is a
  wonderful goal he 's absolutely right there are lots of people out there who
 don 't have purpose in their life and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal  i give him an a + on this 
 is the goal achieved  
 yes  thirty million copies of this book  al gore eat your heart out
 just exactly what al is trying to do 
 rick is doing  this is a fantastic achievement 
 and
 the means how does he do it it 's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes updating them quietly dropping obsolete features
  putting new interpretations on other features  this is the evolution of religion that 's been going on for thousands of years and he 's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it 
 i don 't have to tell you this you just heard the man  excellent insights into human psychology  wise advice on every page 
 moreover 
 he invites us to look under the hood i really appreciated that for instance he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different bible verses
  the book is clear  vivid accessible beautifully formatted 
 just enough repetition  that 's really important  
 every time you read it or say it  you make another copy in your brain  
 every time you read it or say it  you make another copy in your brain
  make another copy in your brain  thank you 
 and now we come to my problem  because i 'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that i said about this book
  but i wish it were better  i have some problems with the book  and it would it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems  
 i wish
 he could do this with a revision a mark two version of his
  book 
 the truth will set you free that 's what it says in the bible and it 's something that i want to live by too my problem is 
 some of the bits in it i don 't think are true now some of this is a difference of opinion  
 and that 's not my main complaint that 's worth mentioning here 's a passage it 's very much what he said anyway
 if there was no god we would all be accidents the result of astronomical random chance in the universe you could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or 
  significance there would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on earth now i just do not believe that by the way i find homer groening 's film
  yes  there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong we don 't need
 a belief in god to be good or to have meaning in us but that as i said is just
 a difference of opinion that 's not what i 'm really worried about how about this god designed this planet 's environment just so we could live in it 
 i 'm afraid that a lot of people take that
  sentiment
 to mean that we don 't have to do the sorts of things that al gore is trying so hard to get us to do i am not happy with that sentiment at all  and then i find this 
 all the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact
 well that 's michael denton he 's a creationist  and here i think wait a minute i read this again i read it three or four times and i think is he really
 endorsing intelligent design is he endorsing creationism here and you can 't tell so i 'm sort of thinking well i don 't know i don 't know if i want to get upset with this yet 
 but then i read
  and i read this first noah had never seen rain because prior to the flood god irrigated the earth from the ground up 
 i wish that sentence weren 't in there because i think it is false  
 and i think that thinking this way about the history of the planet after we 've just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years 
 discourages people from scientific understanding
  warren
 uses scientific terms and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way here 's one god deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him 
  in a way that makes your ministry unique he carefully mixed the dna cocktail that created you 
 i think that 's false now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical
 here 's another one for instance your brain can store one hundred trillion facts your mind can handle fifteen thousand decisions a second 
 well it would be interesting to find the interpretation where i would accept that there might be some way of of treating that as true 
 anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge hardwired by god into the very fiber of our being an inbuilt need to connect with god
  well the sense of which i agree with him except i think it has an evolutionary explanation and what i find deeply troubling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral if you want to have meaning in your life  
 you have to be an intelligent designer you have to deny the theory of evolution by
  natural selection and i think on the contrary that it is very important to solving the world 's problems
 that we take evolutionary biology seriously  whose truth are we going to listen to 
 well this is from the
 purpose driven life the bible must become the authoritative standard for my life  the compass i rely on for direction the counsel i listen to for making wise decisions and the benchmark i use for evaluating
  what 's going to follow from this  and here 's one that does concern me
 remember i quoted him before with this line surrendered people obey god 's word even if it doesn 't make sense 
 and  that 's a problem 
 don 't ever argue with the devil he 's better at arguing than you are having had thousands of years to practice
  rick warren didn 't invent this clever move  it 's an old move  
 it 's a very clever adaptation of religions it 's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism 
 you don 't like my interpretation you 've got a reasonable objection to it don 't listen don 't listen  that 's the devil speaking 
 this discourages the sort of reasoning
 citizenship it seems to me that we want to have i 've got one more problem then i 'm through and i 'd really like to get a response if if
 rick is is able to do it 
 in the great commission jesus said ' go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples  baptize them in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit and teach them to do
 everything i 've told you ' the bible says jesus is the only one
  who can save the world
 we 've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so 
 here 's one not as beautiful as the others it simply shows the religions of the world 
 here 's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions 
 do we really want to commit ourselves to
  engulfing all the other religions  
 when their holy books are telling them don 't listen to the other side 
 that 's just satan talking it seems to me that that 's
 a very problematic
 ship to get on for the future i found this sign as i was driving to maine recently
  in front of a church good without god becomes zero sort of cute a very clever little meme  
 i don 't believe it
 and i think this idea  popular as it is not in this guise but in general is itself one of the main problems that we face if you are
  who are being very good without god and you also know many religious people who
 hide behind their sanctity instead of doing good works 
 so i wish we could drop this meme  i wish this meme would go extinct  thanks very much
