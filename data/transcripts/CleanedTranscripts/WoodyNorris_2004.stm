  was working at the university of washington and i came up with an idea
  from reading a magazine article for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm now that was before cassette tapes c d s dvds any of the cool stuff we 've got now  
 and it was an arm that instead of hinging
 and pivoting as it went across the record went straight a radial linear tracking tone arm  
 and it was the hardest invention i ever made  but it got me started  and
 i got really lucky after that and without giving you too much of a tirade i want to talk to you about an invention i brought with me today
  my 44th invention no that 's not true either  golly i 'm just totally losing it my 44th patent about the 15th invention i call this
 hypersonic sound i 'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes but i want to make an analogy before i do to
 this  i usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say that 's really cool but what 's it good for
 and i say  what is the light bulb good for sound light i 'm going to draw the analogy 
 when edison invented the light bulb pretty much looked like this hasn 't changed that much 
 light came out of it in every direction 
 before the light bulb was invented people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it  
 focus it a little bit put lenses in front of it  focus it a little bit better
  ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused  now think about where the world would be today
 if we had the light bulb  
 but you couldn 't focus light  if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to 
 that 's the way loudspeakers pretty much are you turn on the loudspeaker  and after almost eighty years
  of having those gadgets 
 the sound just kind of goes where it wants even when you 're standing in front of a megaphone it 's pretty much every direction a little bit of differential but not much 
 if the light bulb was the way the speaker is and you couldn 't focus or sharpen the edges or define it  we wouldn 't have that 
 or movies in general
  sets  or c d s or dvds and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light  
 now  after almost eighty years of having sound  
 i thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to  i have a couple of units
  that guy there was made for a demo i did yesterday early in the day
 for a big car maker in detroit who wants to put them in a car small version over your head so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car 
 what if i could aim sound the way i aim light  
 i got this waterfall i recorded in my back yard now you 're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you maybe if i hit
  sound is being made right next to your ears is that cool 
 applause because i have some limited time i 'll cut it off for a second and tell you about how it works and what it 's good for 
 course like light it 's great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack or the cornflakes or the toothpaste or
 a talking plaque in a
  movie theater lobby  sony 's got an idea sony 's our biggest customers right now  they tried this back in the ' 60s and were too smart and so they gave up but
 they want to use it
 seriously there 's a mix an inventor has to have you have to be kind of smart  
 and though i did not graduate from college doesn 't mean i 'm stupid because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today too many other smart people out there so
  just happened to get my education in a little different way i 'm not at all against education i think it 's wonderful i think
 sometimes people when they get educated lose it  they get so smart they 're unwilling to look at things that they know better than 
 and we 're living in a great time right now because almost everything 's being explored anew  
 i have this little slogan that i use a lot which is
 and i mean this honestly has been invented yet  
 we 're just starting we 're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics and this is i hope a little piece of it  
 sony 's got this vision back to get myself on track that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket you 're going to watch a
  they know that when you watch t v at home because there are so many choices you can change channels  miss their commercials 
 a hundred and fifty one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket  
 now they 've tried this a couple years ago and it failed because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every twenty minutes  
 and reaches out turns off the sound and you know if the sound isn 't there the sale typically isn 't made 
  're on an airplane they show the movie you get to watch it for free when you want to hear the sound you pay  
 and so abc and sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket initially it 'll be safeways  it is safeways they 're trying this in three parts of the country right now
 you 'll be watching tv  
 and hopefully they 'll be sensitive that they don 't want to offend you with just one more outlet but what 's great about it  from the tests that have been done is if you don 't want to hear it you take about
  one step to the side and you don 't hear it so we create silence as much as we create sound
 atms that talk to you nobody else hears it  
 sit in bed two in the morning watch tv your spouse  or someone is next to you asleep doesn 't hear it doesn 't wake up we
 're also working on noise canceling canceling things like snoring noise from automobiles
 been really lucky with this technology all of a sudden as it is ready the world is ready to accept it  
 they have literally beat a path to our door we 've been selling it since about last september october  
 and it 's been immensely gratifying if you 're interested in what it costs i 'm not selling them today but this unit with the electronics and everything if you buy one is around a thousand bucks  
 we expect by this time next year
  hundred bucks to buy it  it 's not any more pricey than regular electronics
 now when i played it for you you didn 't hear the thunderous bass 
 this unit that i played goes from about two hundred hertz to above the range of hearing 
 it 's actually emitting ultrasound low level ultrasound that 's about one hundred thousand vibrations per second  
 and the sound that you 're hearing unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is
  made on the face is made out in front of it in the air 
 the air is not linear as we 've always been taught  you turn up the volume just a little bit i 'm talking about a little over eighty decibels
 and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate here 's why  
 the speed of sound is not a constant it 's fairly slow  it changes with temperature
 and with barometric pressure  now imagine if you will without getting too technical  i 'm making a little sine wave here in the air well
 if i turn up the amplitude too much  i 'm having an effect on the pressure  
 which means during the making of that sine wave the speed at which it is propagating is shifting all of audio as we know it
 is an attempt to be more and more
  perfectly linear  linearity means higher quality sound 
 hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite  it 's one hundred percent based on
 an effect happens in the air  it 's a corrupting effect of the sound the ultrasound in this case that 's emitted 
 but it 's so predictable that you can produce very
 precise audio out of that effect now  the question is where 's the sound made instead of being made on the face of the cone  it 's made at literally billions
 of little independent points along this narrow column in the air  and so when i aim it towards you what you hear is made right next to
  i said we can shorten the column we can spread it out to cover the couch  
 i can put it so that one ear hears one speaker the other ear hears the other 
 that 's true binaural sound  when you listen to stereo on your home system 
 your both ears hear both speakers  turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you 're hearing it also in your right ear so the stage is more restricted
  the sound stage that 's supposed to spread out in front of you 
 because the sound is made in the air along this column  it does not follow the inverse square law which says it drops off
 about two thirds every time you double the distance
 every time you go from one meter for instance to two meters  
 that means you go to a rock concert or a symphony  and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row now
  we 've been as i say very successful very lucky in having
 companies catch the vision of this from cars car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids and a separate system in the back oh no
 the kids aren 't driving today 
 i was seeing if you were listening actually i haven 't had breakfast yet 
 a stereo system in the front for mom and dad  and maybe there 's a little dvd player in the back for the kids
  don 't want to be bothered with that or their rap music or whatever so again this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on 
 it also works for transmitting and communicating data  
 it also works five times better underwater  
 we 've got the military have just deployed some of these into iraq where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside
 or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some biblical verse 
 and they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance  
 and see a fraction of a degree kelvin in temperature shift
 from one hundred yards away when they play this thing
  so another way of hopefully determining who 's friendly and who isn 't 
 we make a version with this which puts out one hundred and fifty five decibels  pain is one hundred and twenty 
 so it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people and there can be a public beach just off to the side and they don 't even know it 's turned on
  we sell those to the military presently for about seventy thousand dollars  and they 're buying them as fast as we can make them
  we put it on a turret
 with a camera so that when they shoot at you you 're over there and it 's there  
 i have a bunch of other inventions i invented a plasma antenna to shift gears  
 looked up at the ceiling of my office one day i was working on a ground penetrating radar
 project and my physicist
 ceo came in and said we have a real problem we 're using very short wavelengths
 we 've got a problem with the antenna ringing 
 when you run very short wavelengths like a tuning fork the antenna resonates  and there 's more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the backscatter from the ground that we 're trying to analyze taking too much processing 
 i says why
 don 't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it  
 turn it on turn it off that 's a fluorescent tube
  refined 
 i just sold that for a million and a half dollars cash
  i took it back to the pentagon after it got declassified when the patent issued 
 and told the people back there about it and they laughed and then i took them back a demo and they bought 
 any of you ever wore a jabber headphone the little cell headphones
  that 's my invention i sold that for seven million dollars big mistake it just sold for eighty million dollars two years ago
  i actually drew that up on a little crummy mac computer in my
 attic at my house and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design i drew way back when 
 so i 've been really lucky as an inventor  i 'm the happiest guy you 're ever going to meet 
 and my dad died before he realized anybody in the
  would maybe hopefully make something out of themselves  you 've been a great audience i know i 've jumped all over the place i usually figure out what my talk is when i get up in front of a group
