  we can tap
 a really underutilized resource in health care  which is the patient  or as i like to use the the scientific term people
  because we are all patients we are all people even doctors are patients at some point 
 so i want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have have failed to engage with very well in this country
 and in fact worldwide if you want to get at the big part i mean from a public health level where my training is you 're looking at
 behavioral issues  you 're looking at things where people are actually given information and they 're not following through with
  it 's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes
 obesity many forms of heart disease even some forms of cancer when you think of smoking 
 those are all behaviors where people know what they 're supposed to do they know what they 're supposed to be doing but they 're not doing it  
 now behavior change is something that that is a long standing problem in in medicine it goes all the way back to aristotle
  and doctors hate it right i mean they complain about it all the time we talk about it in terms of engagement or
  when people don 't take their pills when people don 't follow doctors ' orders these are behavior problems but for as much as clinical medicine
 agonizes over behavior change there 's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem 
 so the crux of it comes down to this notion of  decision making giving information to people in a form that doesn 't just
  actually leads them to make better decisions better choices in their lives one part of medicine though has faced
 the problem of behavior change pretty well and that 's dentistry 
 dentistry might seem and i think it is many dentists would have to acknowledge it 's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine not a lot of cool sexy stuff happening in dentistry  
 but
 they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it it 's
  one great preventive health success we have in our health care system people brush and floss their teeth  they don 't do it as much as they should  but they do it  
 so i 'm going to talk about one experiment that
 a few dentists in connecticut cooked up
 about thirty years ago so this is an old experiment but it 's a really good one because it was very simple  so it 's an easy story to tell 
 so these connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush
  their teeth and floss their teeth more often  and they were going to use one variable  they wanted to scare them  
 they wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didn 't brush and floss their teeth  they had a big
 patient population they divided them up into two groups they had a low fear population where they basically gave them a 13 minute presentation
  all based in science but told them that if you didn 't brush and floss your teeth you could get gum disease if you get gum disease  you will lose your teeth
 but you 'll get dentures and it won 't be that bad so
 that was the low fear group the high fear group  they laid it on really thick  they showed bloody gums they showed puss
 oozing out from between their teeth they told them that their teeth were going to fall out 
 they said that they could have infections that would spread from their their jaws to other parts of their bodies and ultimately yes they would lose their teeth they would get dentures
  if you got dentures  you weren 't going to be able to eat 
  to eat apples you weren 't going to be able to eat steak you 'll eat mush for the rest of your life  so go brush and floss your teeth 
 that was the message that was the experiment now they measured one other variable they wanted to capture one other variable  which was the patients ' sense of efficacy  
 this was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their
  teeth so they asked them at the beginning do you think you 'll actually be able to stick with this program and the people who said yeah yeah i 'm pretty good about that they were characterized as high efficacy  and the people who said 
 eh i never get around to brushing and flossing as much as i should they were characterized as low efficacy  so the upshot
 was this the upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all the people who
  brushed and flossed their teeth
 were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen it 's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior
  so fear showed up as as not really the driver it was the sense of efficacy  
 so i want to isolate this because it was a great observation
  and it 's one that 's laid fallow in research it was a notion that really came out of albert bandura 's work  who studied whether
 people could get a sense of empowerment the notion of efficacy basically boils down to one that
 if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior in health care terms  you could characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards better health that they can actually see their way towards getting better health
 's a very important notion it 's an amazing notion 
 we don 't really know how to manipulate it though that well  
 except  maybe we do  so fear doesn 't work right fear doesn 't work  and this is a great
 example of how we haven 't learned that lesson at all this is a campaign from the american diabetes association this is still the way we 're communicating messages about health
 i mean  i showed my three year old this slide last night
  's like papa why is an ambulance in these people 's homes and i had to explain  they 're trying to scare people  and i don 't know if it works  
 now here 's what does work personalized information works  again bandura recognized this years ago decades ago  
 when you give people specific information about their health
  and where they want to get to where they might get to that path that notion of a path that tends to work for behavior change  so let me just spool it out a little bit  
 so you start with personalized data personalized information that comes from an individual  
 and then you need to connect it to their lives  you need to connect it to their lives  hopefully not in a fear based way but one that they understand okay i know where i sit i know where i 'm situated  
 and that doesn 't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers this overload of health information that
  're inundated with but it actually hits home it 's not just hitting us in our heads it 's hitting us in our hearts there 's an emotional connection to information because it 's from us 
 that information then needs to be connected to choices needs to be connected to a range of options  directions that we might go to trade offs benefits finally we need to be presented with a clear point of action  
 we need to connect the information always with the action
  and then that action feeds back into different information and it creates of course a feedback loop  now this is a very 
  notion for behavior change but the problem is that things
  corner there personalized data it 's been pretty hard to come by it 's a difficult and expensive commodity  until
  so i 'm going to give you an example a very simple example of how this works so we 've all seen these these are the your speed limit signs you 've seen them all around especially these days as radars are cheaper  
 and here 's how they work in the feedback loop  so you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is twenty five and of course you 're going faster than that we always are we 're always going above the speed limit  
 the choice in this case is pretty simple we either keep going fast or we slow down we should probably slow down
 and that point of action is probably now we should take our foot off the pedal right now 
 and generally we do these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down they reduce speeds by about five to ten percent  they last for about five miles 
 in which case we put our foot back on the pedal  but it works and it even has some health repercussions your blood pressure might drop a little bit maybe there 's fewer accidents so there 's public health benefits but by and large
 feedback loop that 's so nifty and too rare  because in health care most health care the data is very removed from the action  it 's very difficult to
 line things up so neatly  
 but we have an opportunity so i want to talk about i want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country how we actually get information  
  this is a pharmaceutical ad  actually it 's a spoof it 's not a real pharmaceutical ad  nobody 's had the brilliant idea of calling
 their drug havidol quite yet  
 but it looks completely right right so it 's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information 
 and it just sounds perfect and then we turn the page of the magazine and 
 we see this now this is the page the fda requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads
  to follow their ads and to me this is one of the most cynical exercises in medicine 
 because we know who among us would actually say that people read this and who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of 
 it this is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information  
 there is no good faith in this  
 so this is a different approach this is an approach
 that has been developed by a couple researchers at dartmouth
 medical school lisa schwartz and steven woloshin  and they created this thing called the drug facts box they took inspiration from of all things cap 'n crunch 
 they went to the nutritional information box
 and saw that what works for cereal works for our
  helps people understand what 's in their food  god forbid we should use that same standard that we make cap 'n crunch live by and bring it to drug companies  
 so let me just walk through this quickly  it says very clearly what the drug is for specifically who it is good for so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you 
 you can understand exactly what the benefits are 
  this kind of
 vague promise that it 's going to work no matter what but you get the statistics for how effective it is 
 and finally you understand what those choices are you can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects every time you take a drug  you 're walking into a possible side effect 
 so it spells those out in very clean terms  and that works  
 so i love this i love that drug facts box and so i was thinking about what 's an opportunity
  i could have to help people understand
 information what 's another latent
 body of information that 's out there that people are really not putting to use  and so i came up with this lab test results 
 blood test results are this great source of information they 're packed with information  
 they 're just not for us they 're not for people  they 're not for patients  they go right to doctors and god forbid i think many doctors if you really asked them they don 't really understand all this stuff either
  this is the worst presented information 
 you ask tufte  and he would say yes this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible what we did at wired was we we went and i got our graphic design department to re imagine
 these lab reports  so that 's what i want to walk you through so this is the general blood work before  and this is the
  this is what we came up with 
 the after takes what was four pages that previous slide was was actually the first of four pages of data that 's just the general blood work it goes on and on and on all these values all these numbers you don 't know this is our one page summary
 we use the notion of color  it 's an amazing notion that color could be used  so on the top level you have your your overall results  the things that might jump out at you from the
 fine print  then you can drill down and
  how actually we put your level in context and we use color to illustrate
 exactly where your value falls in this case this patient is is slightly at risk of diabetes because of their
 glucose level likewise you can go over your lipids and again understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then
 break down into the hdl and the ldl if you so choose but again always using color and personalized proximity to that
 all those other values all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing  we summarize 
 we tell you that you 're okay you 're normal but you don 't have to wade through it you don 't have to go through the junk  
 and then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate 
 and then we go a further step we tell them what they can do  we give them some insight into what
  choices they can make what actions they can take 
 so that 's our general blood work test 
 then we went to crp test  in this case it 's a sin of omission 
 they have this huge amount of space and they don 't use it for anything so we do now the crp test is often done following a cholesterol test 
 or in conjunction with a cholesterol test so we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page
  the way the doctor is going to evaluate it so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well
 it 's a protein that shows up when your your blood vessels might be inflamed which might be a risk for heart disease
  what you 're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language
  then we use the information that 's already in the lab report  we use the the person 's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks so we start to use the
 the the data we have to run a very simple calculation that 's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is 
 the last one i 'll show you is a psa test here 's the before  and here 's the after now a lot of our effort on this one
 as many of you probably know a psa test is a very controversial test it 's used to test for prostate cancer but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged
  and so we we spent a good deal of our time indicating that 
 we again personalized the risks so this patient is in their  50s so we can actually give them a very precise
 estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is in this case it 's about twenty five percent based on that and then again the follow up actions so our cost for this was less than
  why is wired magazine doing this 
 quest diagnostics and labcorp the two largest lab testing companies
 last year  they made profits of over seven hundred million dollars and over five hundred million dollars respectively 
 now this is not a problem of resources  this is a problem of incentives  we need to recognize that the target of this information should not be the doctor
 should not be the insurance company it should be the patient it 's the person who actually in the end is going to be having having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors 
 this is information that is incredibly powerful it 's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change but we 're not using it it 's just sitting there it
 's being lost 
 so i want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask  because i don 't actually expect people to start developing these
  these lab test reports  
 but you can create your own feedback loop  anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions can i have my results  and the only acceptable answer is audience 
 yes yes what does this mean help me understand what the data is what are my options what choices are now on the table  and then what 's next 
 how do i integrate this information into the longer course of my life
  so i want to wind up by just showing that people have the capacity to understand this information  this is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people you do not need to have the education level of people in this room  
 ordinary people are capable of understanding this information if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them in a form
 that they can engage with  and engagement is essential here because it 's not just giving them information  it 's giving them an opportunity to act that 's what engagement is
  different from compliance it works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today  
 and this information is out there 
 i 've been talking today about latent information  
 all this information that that exists in the system that we 're not putting to use  but there are all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online and we need to recognize the capacity of this information to engage people to help people and to change the course of their lives  
 thank you very much
