  'm here to talk to you about the economic invisibility of nature  
 the bad news is that mother nature 's back office isn 't working yet so those invoices don 't get issued  but we need to do something about this problem 
 i
 began my life as as a markets professional and
  continued to take an interest  
 but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature and which doesn 't get priced by the markets 
 a project called teeb was started in two thousand and seven and it was launched by a group of environment ministers of the g8 + five  
 and their basic inspiration was a stern review of lord stern they asked themselves a question if economics
  could make such a convincing case for early action on climate change well why can 't the same be done for conservation why can 't an equivalent case be made for nature 
 and the answer is yeah it can but it 's not that straightforward  
 biodiversity  the living fabric of this planet is not a gas  
 it exists in many layers  ecosystems species and genes across many scales international national local community
 and
  doing for nature what lord stern and his team did for nature is not that easy  
 and yet we began we began the project with an interim report  which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject
 by many many researchers and amongst our compiled results was the startling revelation
  we were losing natural capital the benefits that flow from nature to us we were losing it at an extraordinary rate
 in fact of the order of two to four trillion dollars worth of natural capital  
 this came out in two thousand and eight which was of course around the time that the banking crisis had shown that we had lost financial capital of the order of
 two and a half trillion dollars so this was comparable in size to that kind of loss we then have gone on
  local governments and for business and for people for you and me a whole slew of reports which were presented at the u n last year 
 which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it 
 what is this about 
 a picture that you 're familiar with
 the amazon rainforests  it 's a massive store of carbon it 's an amazing store of biodiversity but what people don 't really know is this also is a rain factory
 because the northeastern trade winds as they go over the amazonas effectively gather the water vapor 
 something like twenty billion tons per day of water vapor
 is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds and eventually precipitates in the form of rain across the la plata basin  
 this rainfall cycle this rainfall factory effectively feeds an agricultural economy of the order of two hundred and forty billion
 dollars worth in latin america  but the question arises okay so how much
 do uruguay paraguay argentina and indeed the state of mato grosso in brazil pay for that vital input to that economy
 to the state of amazonas  which produces that rainfall and the answer is zilch  exactly zero  
 that 's the economic invisibility of nature that can 't keep going on because economic incentives and
 are very powerful economics has become the currency of policy  and unless
 we address
 this invisibility we are going to get the results that we are seeing  which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset it
 's not just about the amazonas or indeed about rainforests no matter what level you look at whether it 's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level  we see the same problem again and again
 so rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests at an ecosystem level  
 at the species level  it 's been estimated that insect based pollination bees pollinating
 fruit and so on is something like one hundred and ninety billion dollars worth that 's something like eight percent of the total agricultural output
  completely passes below the radar screen but when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice 
 or for that matter  if you look at the genetic level  sixty percent of medicines were prospected were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef  once again 
 most of that doesn 't get paid and that brings me to another aspect of this  which is to whom should this get paid
  if it could belong to anyone to a local community of poor people
 who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule which then became the medicine they were the ones that didn 't get paid  and if you look at the species level 
 you saw about fish  today  the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant
 that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor  the artisanal fisher folk and those who fish for their own livelihoods to feed their families 
 something like a
  people depend on fish the quantity of fish in the oceans a billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein and at this rate at which we are losing fish 
 it is a human problem of enormous dimensions a health problem
 of a kind we haven 't seen before  
 and finally at the ecosystem level  whether it 's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests or whether it is the ability of poor farmers to go out
 and gather leaf litter for their cattle and goats or whether it 's the ability of their wives to go and and collect fuel wood from the forest 
 it is actually the poor who depend most on these ecosystem services 
 we did estimates in our in our study that for countries like brazil india and indonesia  even though ecosystem services
 these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free they 're not very big in percentage terms of gdp two
  in these countries if we measure how much they 're worth to the poor the answers are more like forty five percent seventy five percent ninety percent  that 's the difference because these are important
 benefits for the poor and you can 't really have a proper model for development if at the same time you 're destroying or allowing the degradation of the very asset the most important asset  which is your development asset  that is ecological infrastructure
 how bad can things get well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance it
 's basically a measure of how many tigers toads ticks or whatever on average of biomass of various species are around the green represents the percentage  if you 
 start green it 's like eighty to one hundred percent if it 's yellow it 's forty to sixty percent and these are percentages versus the original state so to speak the
  now i 'm going to show you how business as usual will affect this and just watch the change in colors in india  china  
 europe sub saharan africa as we move on and consume
 global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us see that again  
 the only places that remain green and that 's not good news is in fact  places like the gobi desert like the tundra and like the sahara
 but that doesn 't help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place  this is the challenge  the reason this is happening
 boils down in my mind to one basic problem which is our inability to perceive the difference
 between public benefits and private profits  
 we tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth it 's common goods
 and here 's an example from thailand where we found that because the value of a mangrove is not that much it 's about $ six hundred over the life of nine years that this has been measured
 compared to its value as a shrimp farm  which is more like $ nine thousand six hundred there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves and convert them to shrimp farms  but of
  if you look at exactly what those profits are almost eight thousand of those dollars are in fact subsidies  
 so you compare the two sides of the coin and you find that it 's more like one thousand two hundred to six hundred that 's not that hard  but on the other hand if you start measuring how much would it actually cost to restore the land of the shrimp farm back to productive use  
 once salt deposition and chemical deposition has had its effects that answer is more like  $ twelve thousand of cost and
  you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries the fish nurseries that provide fish for the poor  that answer is more like $
  eleven thousand so now look at the different lens  if you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits you get a completely different answer which is clearly
 conservation makes more sense  and not destruction  
 so is this just a story from south thailand sorry  this is a global story  and here 's what the same calculation looks like which was done recently
 well i say recently over the last ten years by a group called trucost 
 and they calculated for the top three thousand corporations what are the externalities in other words what are the costs of doing business as usual  this is not illegal stuff  this is basically business as usual which causes
  which have an economic cost  it causes pollutants being issued which have an economic cost health cost and so on 
 use of freshwater  if you drill water to make coke near a village farm that 's not illegal but yes it costs the community 
 can we stop this and how i think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital basically the stuff of life is natural capital  and we need to recognize and build that into our systems  
 when we measure gdp as a measure of economic performance at the national level  we don 't include our biggest asset
  at the country level  
 when we measure corporate performances we don 't include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society 
 that has to stop in fact this was what really inspired my interest in this phase i began a project way back called the green accounting project  that was in the
 early 2000s when india was going gung ho about gdp growth
  as the means forward looking at china with its stellar growths of eight nine ten percent and wondering why can we do the same and
 a few friends of mine and i decided this doesn 't make sense  this is going to create more cost to society and more losses  so we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for india and its states  
 that 's how
 my interests began and went to the teeb project 
 calculating this at the national level is one thing and it has begun  and the world bank has acknowledged this and they 've started a project called waves wealth accounting and valuation of ecosystem
  services  
 but calculating this at the next level that means at the business sector level is important  and actually we 've done this with the teeb project we 've done this for a very difficult case 
 which was for deforestation in china  this is important because in china in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the yellow river actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society 
 just a year later the yangtze flooded causing something like
  five thousand five hundred deaths  
 so clearly there was a problem with deforestation it was associated largely with the construction industry  and the chinese government responded sensibly and placed a ban on felling 
 a retrospective on forty years shows
 that if we had accounted for these costs the cost of loss of topsoil the cost of loss of
  the lost productivity  the loss to local communities as a result of all these factors desertification and so on those costs
 are almost twice as much as the market price of timber so in fact  the price of timber in the beijing marketplace ought to have been three times what it was
 had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within china 
 of course after the event one can be wise the way to do this is to do it on a company basis to take leadership forward and to do it for as many important
  sectors which have a cost and to disclose these answers 
 someone once asked me 
 who is better or worse is it unilever or is it p & g when it comes to their impact on rainforests in indonesia and i couldn 't answer because neither of these companies good though they are and professional though they are do not calculate or disclose their externalities  
 but if we look at companies like puma jochen
  ceo and chairman  once challenged me at a function saying that he 's going to implement my project before i finish it 
 well i think we kind of did it at the same time but he 's done it he 's basically worked the cost to puma puma has two point seven billion dollars of turnover three hundred million dollars of profits 
 two hundred million dollars after tax  ninety four million dollars of externalities cost to business now that 's not a happy situation for them but they have the confidence and the courage to come
  here 's what we are measuring we are measuring it because we know
 that you cannot manage what you do not measure 
 that 's an example i think for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from if more companies did this and if more sectors engaged this as sectors you could have analysts business analysts 
  and you could have people like us and consumers and and ngos actually look and compare the social performance of companies today we can 't yet do that but i think the path is laid out this can be done and i 'm delighted that the institute of chartered accountants in the
  already set up a coalition to do this an international coalition 
 the other favorite if you like solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets and by the way these are my favorites externalities calculation and green carbon markets 
 teeb has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions including protected area evaluation and payments for ecosystem
  and you name it but these are the favorites 
 what 's green carbon  
 today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace it 's about energy emissions  the european union ets is the main marketplace it 's not doing too well we 've over issued a bit like inflation  you over issue currency you get what you see
 declining prices  but that 's all about energy and industry but what we 're missing is also some other emissions like black carbon that
  what we 're also missing is blue carbon which by the way is the largest store of carbon more than fifty five percent  thankfully  the flux in other words the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa is more or less balanced in fact what 's being absorbed is something like
 twenty five percent of our emissions  
 which then leads to acidification or lower alkalinity in oceans more of that in a minute  and finally  there 's deforestation and there 's emission of methane from
 agriculture
  green carbon which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions  
 and blue carbon together comprise twenty five percent of our emissions we have the means already in our hands  through a structure through a mechanism called redd plus a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation 
 and already norway has contributed a billion dollars each towards indonesia and brazil to implement this red plus scheme  so we actually have some movement
 forward but the thing is to do a lot more of that will this solve
 the problem will economics solve everything  well i 'm afraid not there is an area that is the oceans  coral reefs as you can see 
 they cut across the entire globe all the way from micronesia across indonesia malaysia  india  madagascar and to the west of the caribbean 
 these red dots these red areas basically provide the
  food and livelihood for more than half a billion people so that 's almost an eighth of society and the sad thing is that as these coral reefs are lost and scientists tell us that any level of
 carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above three hundred and fifty parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs
 we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species the warm water corals we 're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans but we are
  risking the very lives and livelihoods of more than
 five hundred million people who live in the developing world in poor countries  
 so in selecting targets of four hundred and fifty parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations 
 what we have done is we 've made an ethical choice we 've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not
  have coral reefs well what i will say to you in parting is that
 we may have done that let 's think about it and what it means but please let 's not do more of that because mother nature only has that much in ecological
 infrastructure and that much natural capital  i don 't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices  thank you
