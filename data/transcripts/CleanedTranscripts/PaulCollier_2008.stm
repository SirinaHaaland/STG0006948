  can we dare to be optimistic  well the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living
 in economies that have been stagnant for forty years  and hence diverging from the rest of mankind
 and so the real question to pose is not can we be optimistic it 's how can we give credible hope to that billion people 
 that to my mind is the fundamental challenge now of development  
 what i 'm going to offer you
 is a recipe a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good  which is the alliance
 of compassion and enlightened 
 compassion because a billion people
 are living in societies that have not offered credible hope
 that is a human tragedy  enlightened 
 because if that economic divergence continues for another forty
  years  
 combined with social integration globally  it will build a nightmare for our children 
 we need compassion to get ourselves started and enlightened 
 to get ourselves serious  that 's the alliance that changes the world
  mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion  what can we actually do  
 well a good guide
 is to think what did we do last time
 the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world that gives us it turns out quite a good clue
 except you have to go back quite a long time the last time the rich world got serious about developing another region
 was in the late 
 the rich world was you america  and the region that needed to be developed was my
  why did america get serious  it wasn 't just compassion for europe  though there was that it
 was that you knew you had to because in the late 
 country after country in central europe was falling into the soviet bloc  
 and so you knew you 'd no choice europe had to be dragged into economic development  so what did you do
 last time you got serious  
 well  yes  you had a big aid program  thank you very much  that was marshall aid we need to do it again 
 aid is part of the solution  but what else did you do 
 well  you tore up your trade policy  and totally reversed
  before the war  america had been highly protectionist  after the war  
 you opened your markets to europe you dragged europe into the then global economy which was your economy  and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
 so total reversal of trade policy 
 did you do anything else  yes  you totally reversed your security policy  before the war your security policy had
  been isolationist  after the war  you tear that up you put one hundred thousand troops in europe for over forty years  
 so  total reversal of security policy  anything else  yes  you tear up the eleventh commandment
 national sovereignty  
 before the war  you treated national sovereignty as so
  sacrosanct
 that you weren 't even willing to join the league of nations  
 after the war  you found the united nations  you found the organization for economic cooperation and development  you found the imf you encouraged europe
 to create the european community all systems for mutual government support 
 that is still the waterfront of effective
  policies 
 aid trade security governments 
 of course the details of policy are going to be different  because the challenge is different  it 's not rebuilding europe  
 it 's
 reversing the divergence for the bottom billion  so that they actually catch up is that easier or harder 
 we need to be at least as
  serious as we were then  now today i 'm going to take
 just one of those four i 'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest the one that 's just motherhood and apple pie
 governments mutual systems of support for governments and i 'm going to show you one idea
 in how we could do something to strengthen governance
 and i 'm going to show you that that is enormously important now  
 the opportunity we 're going to look to
 is
 is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion  and that is the commodity booms the commodity booms
  are pumping unprecedented amounts of money
 into many  though not all of the countries of the bottom billion  
 partly they 're pumping money in because commodity prices are high  but it 's not just that there 's also
 a range of new discoveries  uganda has just discovered oil in about the most disastrous location on earth
 ghana has discovered oil  
 guinea has got a huge new exploitation exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground so a mass of new discoveries  
 between them 
 these new revenue flows dwarf aid 
 just to give you one example angola alone is getting fifty billion dollars a year in oil revenue
 aid flows to the sixty countries of the bottom billion last year were thirty four billion 
 so the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent
  so there 's the optimism the
 question is how is it going to help their development it 's a huge opportunity for transformational
 development
  will it be taken so  here comes a bit of science and this is a bit of science i 've done since the bottom billion so it 's new 
 i 've looked to see what is the relationship between
 higher commodity prices of exports  and the growth of commodity exporting countries 
 and i 've looked globally  i 've taken all the countries in the world for the last forty years  and looked to see what the relationship
  is  and the the short run  say the first five to seven years
 is just great in fact it 's hunky dory  everything goes up you
 get more money because your terms of trade have improved but also that drives up output across the board so
 gdp goes up a lot
 fantastic  that 's the short run
 and how about the long run  come back fifteen years later  
 well  the short run  it 's hunky dory  but the long run  it 's humpty dumpty
 you go up in the short run  but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they 'd had no booms at all 
 that is not a forecast about how commodity
  prices go  it 's a forecast of the consequences the long term consequences for growth of an increase in prices 
 so what goes wrong why is there this resource curse as it 's called 
 and again i 've looked at that and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance  the initial level of economic governance
  resource booms accrue 
 in fact if you 've got good enough governance there is no resource boom  you go up in the short term  
 and then you go up even more in the long term  that 's norway the richest country in europe  it 's australia it 's canada 
 the resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a
  threshold of governance they still go up in the short run  that 's what we 're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment  the best growth rates they 've had
 ever and the question is whether the short run will persist and
 with bad governance historically over the last forty years it hasn 't it 's countries like nigeria which are worse off than if they 'd never had oil 
  there 's a threshold level
 above which you go up in the long term and below which you go down 
 just to benchmark that threshold it 's about the governance level of portugal in the mid 1980s 
 so the question is are the bottom billion above or below that threshold now there 's one big change
 since the commodity booms of
  is the spread of democracy  
 so i thought well maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy 
 so i looked 
 democracy does have significant effects
 and unfortunately they 're adverse  democracies make even more
  two distinct aspects of democracy 
 there 's electoral competition which determines how you acquire power  and there are checks and balances which determine how you use power 
  it turns out that electoral competition is the thing that 's doing the damage with democracy  whereas strong checks and balances
 make resource booms good  and so  what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances  
 they haven 't got them  they got instant democracy in the 
 elections without checks and balances how can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances
 in all the societies of the bottom billion  there are intense struggles to do just that 
 the simple proposal is that we should have some international standards  which will be voluntary  but which would spell out the key decision points
 that need to be taken in order to harness these resource revenues we know these international standards
  work because we 've already got one it 's called the extractive industries transparency initiative 
 that is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have 
 no sooner was it proposed than reformers in nigeria adopted it 
 pushed it and published the revenues in the paper  nigerian newspapers circulations spiked people wanted
  to know
 what their government was getting in terms of revenue  so we know it works what would the content be
 of these international standards i can 't go through all of them  but i 'll give you
 an example  the first is
 how to take the resources out of the ground the economic processes taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top
  of the ground 
 and the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction 
 you know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment how they 've been sold over the last forty years 
 a company flies in does a deal with a minister  and that 's great for the company  and it 's quite often great for the minister
  technology which can transform that and it 's called verified auctions  
 the
 public agency with the greatest expertise on earth is of course the treasury that is the british treasury  
 and the british treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth
  they worked out they were worth two billion pounds just in time a set of economists got there and said why not try an auction  it 'll reveal the value 
 it went for twenty billion pounds through auction  if the british treasury can be out by a factor of ten 
 think what the ministry of finance in sierra leone is going to be like 
  when i put that to the president of sierra leone the next day he asked the world bank to send him a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions  
 there are five such decision points each one needs an international standard  if we could do it 
 we would
 change the world we would be helping the reformers in these societies who are
  for change 
 that 's our modest role 
 we cannot change these societies  but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing  
 because the odds are so stacked against them  
 and yet we 've not got these rules if you think about it  the cost of promulgating international rules
  why on earth are they not there 
 i realized that the reason they 're not there
 is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies politicians
 will get away with gestures that unless we have an informed society
  what politicians do especially in relation to africa is gestures  things that look good  but don 't work 
 and so i realized
 we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry
