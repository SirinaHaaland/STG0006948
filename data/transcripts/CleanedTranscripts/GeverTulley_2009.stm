  this is the exact moment that i started creating something called tinkering school 
 tinkering school is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects  and be
  trusted trusted not to hurt themselves  and trusted not to hurt others 
 tinkering school doesn 't follow a set curriculum and there are no tests we
 're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing  
 when the kids arrive
 they 're confronted with lots of stuff  wood and nails and rope and wheels
  and lots of tools real tools  
 it 's a
 immersive experience for the kids  and within that context we can offer the kids time something that seems
 in short supply in their  over scheduled lives  our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make
  things than when they arrived  and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around 
 nothing ever turns out as planned ever 
 and the kids soon learn that all
  and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project
 is a step closer to sweet success or gleeful calamity  
 we start from doodles and sketches  
 and sometimes we make real plans  and sometimes we just start building 
 building is at the heart of the experience
  hands on  deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand  
 robin and i  acting as collaborators keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion 
 success is in the doing  and failures are celebrated and analyzed 
 problems become puzzles and
  obstacles disappear 
 when faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities a really interesting behavior emerges  
 decoration 
 decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation
  from these interludes come
 deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before 
 all materials
 are available for use even those mundane  hateful  
 plastic grocery bags can become a bridge
 stronger than anyone imagined  and the things that they
  build amaze even themselves
  for
