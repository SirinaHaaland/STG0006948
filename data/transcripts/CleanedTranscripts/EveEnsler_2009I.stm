  i 'm very happy to be here in india  
 and i 've been thinking a lot about what i have learned over these last particularly eleven years with v day and the vagina monologues
  traveling the world essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women 
 what i want to talk about today is this particular cell  or grouping of cells that is in each and every one of us and i want to call it the girl cell  
 and it 's in men as well as in women  i want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race
  and i want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell  the
 oppression of these cells  the reinterpretation of these cells the undermining of these cells  getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the
 crushing eradicating destroying  reducing these cells
  basically began the process of killing off the girl cell which was by the way patriarchy  
 i want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness  and it is essential to balance to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us 
 and then i want you to imagine that this girl cell is
 compassion and
  's empathy  
 and it 's passion itself and it 's vulnerability and it 's openness  and it 's intensity  and it 's association and it 's relationship  and it is intuitive  
 and then let 's think how compassion informs wisdom and that vulnerability is our greatest strength  and that emotions have inherent logic which lead to radical appropriate saving action  
 and then let 's remember that we 've been
  taught the exact opposite by the powers that be that compassion clouds your thinking that it gets in the way that vulnerability is weakness that emotions are not to be trusted and you 're not supposed to take things personally  
 which is one of my favorites 
 i think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl  
 how do we bring up boys what does it mean to be a boy to be a boy really means not to be a girl
 to be a man means not to be a girl  to be a woman means not to be a girl to be strong means not to be a girl to be a leader means not to be a girl  
 i actually think that being a girl is so powerful
 that we 've had to train everyone not to be that
  also like to say that the irony of course is that denying girl  suppressing girl suppressing emotion refusing feeling has lead thus here 
 where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence 
 the most horrific poverty  
 genocide mass rapes  the destruction of the earth is completely out of control and because we have suppressed our girl cells and suppressed our
 we do not feel what is going on so we are not being
 charged with the adequate response to what is happening i want to talk a little bit about the democratic republic of congo 
 for me it was the turning point of my life i have spent a lot of time there in the last three years  
 i feel up to that point i had seen a lot in the world a lot of violence i essentially lived in the rape mines
  world for the last twelve years but the democratic republic of congo really
 was the turning point in my soul  
 i went and i spent time in a place called bukavu in a hospital called the panzi hospital with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person i 've ever met his name is dr denis mukwege 
  the congo for those of you who don 't know there has been a war raging for the last twelve years a war that has killed nearly six million people it
 is estimated that somewhere between three hundred thousand and five hundred thousand women have been raped there
  when i spent my first weeks at panzi hospital i sat with women
 who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories their stories were so horrific
  and so on the other side of human existence that to be perfectly honest with you i was shattered
 and i will tell you that what happened is through that shattering listening to the stories of eight year old girls who had their insides eviscerated who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside 
  them so they had holes literally inside them where their pee and poop came out of them  listening to the story of 80 year old women who were tied to
 all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the west can have it and profit from them 
 my mind was so shattered  but what happened for me
 is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way i have never been emboldened that shattering that opening of
  that kind of massive
 breakthrough of my heart
 allowed me to become more courageous and braver and actually more clever than i had been in the past in my life  i want to say that i think the powers that be know that 
 is actually that feelings get in the way of empire building feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the earth and excavating the earth and destroying things i remember for example when my father
  who was very very violent  used to beat me  and he would actually say while he was beating me don 't you cry don 't you dare cry 
 because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him and even in the moment he didn 't want to be reminded of what he was doing  
 i know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell and i want to say we 've annihilated
  it in men as well as in women and i think in some ways we 've been much harsher to men in the annihilation of their girl cell 
 i see how boys have been brought up and i see this across the planet 
 to be tough to be hardened 
 to distance themselves from their tenderness to not cry  i actually realized once in kosovo when i watched a man break down that bullets are actually hardened tears that when we don 't allow men to have their
  girl self and have their vulnerability and have their compassion and have their hearts that they become hardened and hurtful and violent  
 and i think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure  to pretend they know things when they don 't know things or why would we be where we are to
 pretend they 're not a mess when they are a mess and i will tell you a very funny story on my way here on the airplane i was walking up and down the aisle of the plane
  all these men literally at least ten men were in their little
 seats watching chick flicks and they were all alone and i thought this is the secret life of men 
 laughter i 've traveled as i said to many many countries  and i 've seen if we do what we
 do to the girl inside us then obviously it 's horrific to think what we do to girls in the world and we heard from sunitha yesterday and kavita about what we do to girls but i just want to say that
 i 've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns who are literally being treated like ashtrays  i 've seen girls be treated like garbage cans i 've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers 
 and brothers and fathers and uncles i 've seen girls starving themselves to death in america in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves
 i 've seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them illiterate  or we make them feel bad about being too smart we silence them we make them feel guilty for being smart we get them to behave 
  to tone it down not to be too intense we sell them  we kill them as embryos we enslave them we rape them  
  objectified them and turned them into commodities the selling of girls is rampant across the planet and in many places they are worth less than goats and cows  
 but i also want to talk about the fact that
 if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of ten to to twenty four they are they key really in the developing world as well as in the whole world to the future of humanity 
  trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be including lack of access to healthcare education healthy foods labor force participation  
 the burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers the state of girls the condition of girls  will in my belief and that 's the girl inside us and the girl
  in the world determine whether the species survives  and what i want to suggest
 is that having talked to girls because i just finished a new book called i am an emotional creature the secret life of girls around the world 
 i 've been talking to girls for five years and one of the things that i 've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that 's been enforced on girl
  if we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them and
 i have to now share a few stories of girls i 've seen across the planet who have engaged their girl
 who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them  
 i know a 14 year old girl in the netherlands for example who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself 
 there is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed fifty six stars tattooed on the right side of her face 
 there is a girl  julia butterfly hill who lived
  for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks 
 there is a girl who i met fourteen years ago in afghanistan who i have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed her mother was a revolutionary  
 and this girl when she was seventeen years old 
 wore a burqa in afghanistan and went into the stadiums
  and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women underneath her burqa with a video  and that video became the video that went out all over the world after nine eleven to show what was going on in afghanistan  
 i want to talk about rachel corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an israeli tank to say end the occupation and she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank  
 and i want to talk about a girl that i just met recently in
  bukavu 
 who was impregnated by her rapist 
 and she was holding her baby and i asked her if she loved her baby and she looked into her baby 's eyes and she said of course i love my baby 
 how could i not love my baby it 's my baby and it 's full of love 
 the capacity for girls to overcome situations and to
  there is a girl named dorcas  and i just met her in kenya dorcas is fifteen years old and she was trained in 
 a few months ago she was picked up on the street by three older men 
 they kidnapped her they put her in a car  and through her self defense she grabbed their adam 's apples she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car 
  i went to visit one of the v day safe houses for girls a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named agnes pareyio 
 agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl she was female genitally mutilated and she made a decision
 as many women do across this planet that what was done to her would not be enforced and done to other women and girls  so for years agnes walked through the rift valley she taught girls
 what a healthy vagina looked like
  what a
 mutilated vagina looked like  
 and in that time she saved many girls and when we met her we asked her what we could do for her and she said well if you got me a jeep i could get around a lot faster 
 so we got her a jeep  
 and then she saved four thousand five hundred girls and then we asked her okay what else do you need and she said well now i need a house so seven years ago agnes built the first 
  v day safe house in narok kenya in the masai land
  and it was a house where girls could run away  they could save their clitoris they wouldn 't be cut they could go to school 
 and in the years that agnes has had the house she has changed
 the situation there she has
 literally become deputy mayor she 's changed the rules the whole community has bought in to what she 's doing when we were there she was doing
 a ritual where she reconciles girls who have run away with their
  families and there was a young girl named jaclyn jaclyn was fourteen years old and she was in her masai family and
 there 's a drought in kenya  so cows are dying and cows are the most valued possession  
 and jaclyn overheard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to sell her for the cows  
 and she knew that meant she would be cut  she knew that meant she wouldn 't go to school  she knew that meant she wouldn 't have a future
  she knew she would have to marry that old man and she was fourteen 
 so one afternoon she 'd heard about the safe house  jaclyn left her father 's house and she walked for two days 
 two days through masai land  
 she slept with the hyenas  she hid at night  she imagined her father killing her on one hand and mama agnes greeting her with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house 
 and when she got to the house she was
  greeted agnes took her in and agnes loved her and agnes supported her for the year she went to school and she found her voice and she found her identity and she found her heart 
 then 
 her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation after a year i had the privilege of being in the hut
 when she was reunited with her father and reconciled in that hut we
  in and her father and his four wives were sitting there  
 and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled and her primary mother who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders
 when her father saw her and saw who she had become in her full girl self he threw his arms
  you are beautiful you have grown into a gorgeous woman we will not cut you  and i give you my word here and now that we will not cut your sisters either 
 and what she said to him was you were willing to sell me for four cows  and a calf and some blankets  
 but i promise you now that i will be educated
 i will always take care
  and i will come back and i will build you a house 
 and i will be in your corner for the rest of your life for me  that is the power of girls and that is the power of transformation
  i want to close
 today with a new piece from my book  and
 i want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here  
 and i want to do it for sunitha  and i want to do it for the girls that sunitha talked about yesterday
 the girls who survive the girls who can become
  somebody else  but i really want to do it for each and every person here  
 to value the girl in us to value the part that cries  to value the part that 's emotional to value the part that 's vulnerable to understand that 's where the future lies 
 this is called i 'm an emotional creature and it happened because i met a girl in watts l a i was asking girls if they like being a girl and all the girls were like
 i hate it i can 't stand it it 's all bad my brothers get everything and this girl just sat up and went i love being a girl  i 'm an emotional creature 
 this is for her  
 i love being a girl  
 i can feel what you 're feeling as you 're feeling inside the feeling before  
 i am an emotional creature
  things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard pressed ideas  they pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears oh 
 i know when your girlfriend 's really pissed off  even though she appears to give you what you want  
 i know when a storm is coming  i can feel the invisible stirrings in the air  i can tell you he won 't call back it 's a vibe i
  i am an emotional creature  i love that i do not take things lightly everything is intense to me  
 the way i walk in the street  the way my momma wakes me up the way it 's unbearable when i lose  the way i hear bad news  i am an emotional creature  
 i am connected to everything and everyone i was born like that don
 't you say all negative that it 's only only a teenage thing or it 's only because i 'm a girl  these feelings make me better they make me present  they make me ready
  make me strong  i am an emotional creature  there is a particular way of knowing it 's like the older women somehow forgot
  i rejoice that it 's still in my body oh i know when the coconut 's about to fall  
 i know we have pushed the earth too far  
 i know my father isn 't coming back
  and that no one 's prepared for the fire  
 i know that lipstick means more than show and boys are super insecure  and so called terrorists are made not born  
 i know that one kiss could take away all my 
  know what sometimes it should 
 this is not extreme it 's a girl thing what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open don 't tell me not to cry to calm it down not to be
  so extreme to be reasonable  i am an emotional creature  it 's how the earth got made how the wind continues to pollinate you don 't tell the atlantic ocean to behave  
 i am an emotional creature  why would you want to shut me down or turn me off  i am your remaining memory  i can take
  nothing 's been diluted  nothing 's leaked out i love hear me  i love that i can feel
 the feelings inside you 
 even if they stop my life  
 even if they break my heart  even if they take me off track  they make me responsible
  i am an emotional
