  check out those killer equations  sweet 
 actually for the next eighteen minutes i 'm going to do the best i can to describe the beauty of particle physics without
  equations  
 it turns out there 's a lot we can learn from coral 
 a coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal each coral head consists of thousands of individual polyps 
 these polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors 
 if we imagine this to be a hyperintelligent coral  we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question we can ask how exactly he got to be
 in this particular location compared to his neighbors
 if it was just chance  or destiny  or what 
 now  after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high  
 he would tell us that our question was completely stupid these corals can be kind of mean you see and i have surfing scars to prove that 
 but this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him that he was in all these other locations
  as well  but experiencing them as separate individuals 
 for a coral branching into different copies is the most natural thing in the world  
 unlike us a hyperintelligent coral would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics  
 the mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works  and it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities just like a coral
 it 's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around  since we only ever get to experience one possibility  
 this quantum weirdness was first described by erwin  schrdinger and his cat the cat likes this version better 
 in this setup schrdinger is in a box with a radioactive sample
  by the laws of quantum mechanics  branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not 
 in the branch in which the sample radiates  it sets off a trigger that releases poison and schrdinger is dead  but in the other branch of reality he remains alive 
 these realities are experienced separately by each individual as far as either can tell the other one doesn 't exist 
 seems weird to us because each of us only experiences an individual existence and we don 't get to see other branches  it 's as if each of us like schrdinger here are a kind of coral
 branching into different possibilities  
 the mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales it can be summed up in a single sentence 
 everything that can happen does that 's quantum mechanics  but this does not mean everything happens the rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can
 what physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles 
 and things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced 
 now i 'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles  what they are and how this balance works 
 in this machine a beam of protons and and antiprotons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a
  collision  producing a burst of pure energy this energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties  
 this enormous machine the large hadron collider at cern in geneva has a circumference of seventeen miles and when it 's operating draws five times as much power as the city of monterey  
 we can 't predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual collision
  mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized but physics does tell us what particles can be produced 
 these particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and antiproton 
 any particles more massive than this energy limit aren 't produced and remain invisible to us 
 this is why this new particle
  is so exciting  it 's going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what 's ever been done before so we 're going to get to see some new particles very soon  
 but before talking about what we might see let me describe the particles we already know of 
 there 's a whole zoo of subatomic particles  most of us are familiar with electrons a lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around 
 but the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino with no electric charge and a very tiny mass in contrast
 the up and down quarks have very large masses and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms 
 all of these matter particles come in left and right handed varieties  and have antiparticle partners that carry opposite charges 
 these familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations 
 which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses 
 these matter particles all
  interact with the various force particles  the electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter via particles called photons 
 there is also a very weak force called  rather unimaginatively the weak force 
 that interacts only with left handed matter the strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge called color charge
  and come in three different varieties red green and blue you can blame murray gell mann for these names they 're his fault
  finally there 's the force of gravity  which interacts with matter via its mass and spin 
 the most important thing to understand here is that there 's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces 
 these four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has 
 a particle that hasn 't been seen yet  but we 're pretty sure exists is the higgs particle
  which gives masses to all these other particles  the main purpose of the large hadron collider is to see this higgs particle and we 're almost certain it will  
 but the greatest mystery is what else we might see  
 and i 'm going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk now
 if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges there are two hundred and twenty six that 's a lot of particles to keep track
  of  and it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles  
 but if we plot them out according to their charges  some beautiful patterns emerge the
 most familiar charge is electric charge  
 electrons have an electric charge a negative one  and quarks have electric charges in thirds  so when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton it has a total electric charge of plus one
  these particles also have antiparticles which have opposite charges  now it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges  hypercharge and weak charge  
 if we spread out the  hypercharge and weak charge
 and plot the charges of particles in this two dimensional charge space  the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction  
 the electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their
 hypercharge and weak charge which make this pattern  this is called the unified electroweak model and it was put together back in 
 the reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge and not both of these is because of the higgs particle 
 the higgs over here on the left has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern  it makes the
 weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass  since this massive higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram  
 the photons of electromagnetism remain massless and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space  
 so the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two dimensional space  
 we can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions
 and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions
 the charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four dimensional charge space  and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them 
 whenever particles interact nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions  
 if a particle and an antiparticle collide  it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero
  all four charge directions at this point anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero 
 for example this weak force particle and its antiparticle can be created in a collision 
 in further interactions the charges must always balance one of the weak particles
 could decay into an electron and an antineutrino and these three still add to zero total charge nature always keeps a perfect
 perfect balance 
 so these patterns of charges are not just pretty 
 they tell us what interactions are allowed to happen and we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction  
 which has this nice hexagonal symmetry in a strong interaction a strong force particle 
 such as this one  interacts with a colored quark such as this green one 
 to give a quark with a different color charge
  strong interactions are happening millions of times each second in every atom of our bodies  holding the atomic nuclei together  
 but these four charges corresponding to three forces are not the end of the story  
 we can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force 
 when we include these each matter particle has two different spin charges spin up and spin down 
 so they all split and give a nice pattern in
  we can rotate this pattern in six dimensions and see that it 's quite pretty 
 right now  this pattern
 matches our best current knowledge of how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles  
 this is what we know for certain  some of these particles are at the very limit of what we 've been able to reach with experiments
  from this pattern we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales the way the universe works at these tiny scales
 is very beautiful 
 but now i 'm going to discuss some new and old ideas about things we don 't know yet  
 we want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada  
 we want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe 
 and we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we 'll see when experiments reach higher energies
 so there 's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges 
 which is not very symmetric could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken
 similar to how the higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism 
 in order to do this we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions  
 when we introduce a new direction
 we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction  and then we can rotate it in with the others 
 if we guess wisely  we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions
 as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions this particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory
  when we look at this new unified pattern we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing  
 this is the way theories of unification work a physicist looks for larger more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset 
 the larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen 
 this unification model predicts the existence of these two new force particles  which should act a lot like
  the weak force only weaker 
 now we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions and consider an odd fact about the matter particles  
 the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six dimensional charge space as the first generation 
 these particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges 
 they sit on top of one another in the standard charge space
 if we work in eight dimensional charge space  then we can
 assign unique new charges to each particle  then we can spin these in eight dimensions
 and see what the whole pattern looks like 
 here we can see the second and third generations of matter now  related to the first generation by a symmetry called triality 
 this particular pattern of charges
 in eight dimensions
  is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics it
 's a pattern of the largest exceptional lie group e8 
 this lie group is a smooth curved shape with two hundred and forty eight dimensions each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape 
 one small part of this e8 shape can be used to describe the curved space time of einstein 's general relativity explaining gravity
 together with quantum mechanics  the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales the pattern of this shape
 living in eight dimensional charge space
 is exquisitely beautiful 
 and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape 
 as we spin it we can see many of the
  other intricate patterns contained in this one  
 and with a particular rotation  we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis
 and see all the particles at once  
 it 's a very beautiful object and as with any unification we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern  
 there are twenty gaps where new particles should be two of which have been filled by the
 pati salam particles  from their location in this pattern we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the higgs particle but have color charge and interact with the strong force  
 filling in these new particles completes this pattern  giving us the full e8 this e8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots  it 's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in
  a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions at the smallest scales imaginable and
 this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new in one thousand six hundred and twenty three galileo wrote this 
 nature 's grand book  which stands continually open to our gaze is written in the language of mathematics
  its characters are triangles  circles and other geometrical figures  without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it 
 without these one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth i believe this to be true  
 and i 've tried to follow galileo 's guidance in describing the mathematics of particle physics using only triangles  circles and other geometrical figures 
 of course  when other physicists and i actually work on this stuff  the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth
  but it 's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure beautiful geometry 
 joined with quantum mechanics this mathematics describes our universe as a growing e8 coral 
 with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways according to a beautiful pattern  
 and as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the large hadron collider we may be able to see whether nature
  nature uses this e8 pattern or a different one  
 this process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in 
 if the lhc finds particles that fit this  e8 pattern that will be very very cool 
 if the lhc finds new particles but they don 't fit this pattern well that will be very interesting but bad for this e8 theory 
 and of course bad for me personally
 now how bad would that be well  pretty bad 
 but predicting how nature works is a very risky game  
 this theory and others like it are long shots 
 one does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won 't end up being true about
  that 's what doing theoretical physics is like there are a lot of wipeouts in this regard new physics theories are a lot like start up companies 
 as with any large investment  it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn 't working out 
 but in science if something isn 't working you have to toss it out and try something else 
 now the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty
 is to keep balance and perspective in life 
  best i can to live a balanced life 
 laughter i try to balance my life equally between physics love and surfing my own three charge directions 
 laughter this way even if the physics i work on comes to nothing i still know i 've lived a good life  
 and i try to live in beautiful places for most of the past ten years i 've lived on the island of maui  a very beautiful place now it 's one of the greatest
  mysteries in the universe to my parents how i managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full time employment i 'm going
 to let you in on that secret  this was a view from my home office on maui  
 and this is another 
  and you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar  but in slightly different places  that 's because this used to be my home and office on maui 
 i 've chosen a very unusual life  
 but not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what i love 
 living a nomadic existence has been hard at times but it 's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that i 've been happy with 
 it allows me to spend a lot of my
  time hanging out
 with hyperintelligent coral  but i also greatly enjoy the company of  hyperintelligent people so i 'm very happy to have been invited here to ted  
 thank you very much
  's got a few people at least excited is because if you 're right it brings gravity and quantum theory together so are you saying that
  we should think of the universe at its heart that the smallest things that there are are somehow
 an e8 object of of possibility  i mean is there a scale to it at the smallest scale 
  right now
 the pattern i showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics
 that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape  and that 's the one that i said we knew for certain and that shape has remarkable similarities
  and the way it fits into this e8 pattern  which could be the rest of the picture  
 and these patterns of of points that i 've shown for you actually represent symmetries of this  high dimensional object
 that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience and that that would would be what explains all these
  in terms of much smaller strings vibrating i know you don 't like string theory
 vibrating inside it
 how should we think of an electron
 in relation to e8 gl well  it would be one of the symmetries of this e8 shape  
 so what 's happening is as the shape is moving over space time it 's twisting 
 and the direction it 's twisting as it moves is what particle we see
  it would be ca the size of the e8 shape how does that relate to the electron i feel like i need that for my picture is it bigger is it smaller gl as far as we know electrons are point particles
 so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales  so the way these things are explained in quantum field theory
 is all possibilities are expanding and developing at once and this is why i use the analogy to coral and
 in this
  way 
 the way that e8 comes in is it will be as a shape that 's attached at each point in the space time 
 and as i said the way the shape twists the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface
 is what the elementary particles are themselves
  it doesn 't really matter
 it 's evoking a kind of sense of wonder and i certainly want to understand more of this but thank you so much for coming that was absolutely fascinating
