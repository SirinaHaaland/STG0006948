  i was listed
 on the online biography that said i was a design missionary that 's a bit lofty i 'm really
 more of something like a street walker  i spend a lot of time in urban areas looking for
  and studying design in the public sector i take about five thousand photographs a year  and
 i thought that i would edit from these and try to come up with some
 images that might be appropriate and interesting to you and i used
 three criteria the first was i thought i 'd talk about
 real design within reach design that 's free not design not quite within reach as we 're fondly known by our competition and competitors  
 but stuff that you can find on the streets stuff that was free
  stuff that was available to all people and stuff that probably contains some other important messages 
 i 'll use these sidewalks in rio as an example a very common public design done in the ' 50s it 's got a nice kind of flowing organic form
 very consistent with the brazilian culture i think good design adds to to culture  
 wholly inconsistent with san francisco or new york  but i think these are my sort of information
  highways i live in much more of an analog world 
 where pedestrian traffic and interaction and diversity exchange and where i think the simple things under our feet have a great amount of meaning
 to us  
 how did i get started in this business i was a ceramic designer for about ten years  and just loved utilitarian form simple things that we use every day little compositions of color and surface on form
  led me to starting a company called design within reach  a company dealing with simple forms making good designers available to us  and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well 
 and it seems to have have worked a couple of years into the process  i spent a lot of time in europe traveling around looking for design  and i had a bit of a wake up call in
  was there going into the design stores and mixing with our crowd of designers and i recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also 
 we know a lot about what 's going on with design around the world and it 's getting increasingly more difficult to find design that reflects a unique culture 
 i was walking around on the streets of amsterdam and i recognized you know the big story from amsterdam isn 't what 's in the design stores it 's what 's out on the streets and maybe it 's 
  self explanatory but a city that hasn 't been
  taken over by modernism that 's preserved its kind of architecture and character and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected  
 and i write a newsletter that goes out every week and i wrote an article about this and it got such enormous response that i realized that design that common design that 's in the public area
  to people and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog  i
 then kind of thought about the other cities in europe where i spend a lot of time looking for design like basel where vitra is located 
 or in northern italy all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles and where pedestrian areas  and i came to the conclusion that perhaps
 there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic and i 'm sure the skeptic
  the correlation there is that there there are universities and schools where people can 't afford cars but it it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected
  you wouldn 't look at this and call this a designer bike a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum  but i began looking at design in a place like amsterdam and recognized you know the first job of design is to serve a social purpose 
 and so i look at this bike as not being
 a designer bike but being a very good example of design
  since that time in amsterdam i spent an increasing amount of time in the cities looking at design for for common evidence of design that
 that really isn 't under so much of a designer 's signature  i was in buenos aires very recently  
 and i went to see this bridge by santiago calatrava he 's a spanish architect
 and designer and the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge i love bridges metaphorically and and symbolically and structurally
 and it was a bit of a disappointment because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it it really wasn 't in use  and i recognized that oftentimes design when you 're set up to see design  it can be a bit of a letdown 
 but there were
 lots of other things going on in this area  it was a kind of construction zone a lot of buildings were going up and approaching a building from a distance you don 't see
  get a little closer and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a mondrian or a
 diebenkorn or something but to me it was an example of industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation and a nice little still life kind of unintended piece of design and going a little closer  
 you get a different perspective  i find these little vignettes these little accidental pieces of design 
 to be refreshing they give me
  i don 't know a sense of correctness in the in the world and some visual delight
 in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple
 industrial scaffolding that is there to to serve down the road there was another building a nice visual structure horizontal vertical elements little
 decorative lines going across these magenta squiggles  the workmen being reduced to decorative elements just a nice kind of breakup of the urban place and you know that no longer exists you 've captured it for a moment
  and finding this little still life 's like listening to little songs or something it gives me an enormous amount of of pleasure 
 antoine predock designed a wonderful ball stadium in san diego called petco park 
 a terrific use of local materials but inside you could find some interior compositions some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games i go and see design
  just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture and the way that the trees form vertical elements red is a color in the landscape that that is often on stop signs it takes your attention it has a great 
  amount of emotion it stares back at you the way that a figure might just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in italy 
  optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service 's mailbox door service 
 plumbing it looks as if these different public services work together to create some nice little compositions in italy you know almost everything kind of looks good simple menus put on a board achieving kind of the sort of balance  but i 'm convinced that it 's because you 're walking around the streets
  can be comical it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in havana color can animate simple blocks simple materials 
 walking in new york i 'll stop i don 't always know why i take photographs of things 
 a nice visual composition of symmetry  curves against sharp things 
 it 's a comment on the way in which we deal with public seating in the city of new york i 've come across some other just kind of
  relationships of bollards on the street that that have different interpretations but these things amuse me 
 sometimes a trash can this is just in the street in san francisco a trash can that 's been left there for eighteen months creates a nice 45 degree angle against these other relationships and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of
  there 's this sort of silent hand of design at work that i see in places that that i go havana is a wonderful area  
 it 's quite free of commercial clutter  you don 't see our logos and brands and names and therefore you 're alert to things physically and this is a great
 protection of a pedestrian zone and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that and
 cuba needs to be far more resourceful because of the blockades and things but a really wonderful playground  i 've often
  wondered why italy is really a leader in modern design 
 in our area in furnishings they 're sort of way at the top the dutch are good also but the italians are good  
 and i came across this little street in venice where the communist headquarters were sharing a wall with this catholic shrine  
 and i realized that you know italy
  they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem or they can choose to ignore them but these these you don 't have warring factions and i think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity
 which has made italy
 so innovative and so tolerant the past and the present work quite well together in italy also and i
  it 's recognizable there and has an important effect on culture because their public spaces are protected their sidewalks are protected  and you 're actually able to confront these things
 physically and i think this helps people get over their fear of modernism and other such things 
 a change might be a typical street corner in san francisco  
 and i use this this is sort of what i consider to be urban spam i notice this stuff because i because i walk a lot but
  industry is really kind of making a mess of of the public sector and as i look at it i sort of say you know 
 the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it and it 's just my call to say to all of us  
 public policy won 't change this at all private industry has to work to
 take things like this seriously  the extreme might be in italy where again there 's kind of some type of control over what 's happening in the environment is very evident  even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals
  i
 walk to work every day
  or ride my scooter and i come down and park in this little spot  and i came down one day and
 all the bikes were red now this is not going to impress you guys who photoshop and can do stuff but this was an actual
 moment when i got off my bike and i looked and i thought  it 's as if all of my
 biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to to make a little statement
  and it reminded me that
 to keep in the present to look out for these kinds of things it gave me possibilities for wonder if maybe it 's a yellow day in san francisco and we could all
 agree and create some
 some installations but
 it also reminded me of the power of pattern and repetition to make an effect in our mind
  and i don 't know if there 's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of
 disparate elements  
 i was at the art show in miami in december and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art and amazed at the prices of art and how expensive it is but having a great time looking at it and i came outside 
 and the valets for this car service had created you know 
 quite a nice little collage
  and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that i had seen in tokyo  and i thought that if
 pattern can unite these disparate elements it can do just about anything  i don 't have very many shots of people because they kind of get in the way of studying pure form  
 i was in a small restaurant in
 in spain having lunch one of those nice days where you had the place kind of to yourself and you have a glass of wine and enjoying the
  local area and the culture and the food and the quiet  and feeling very lucky and a bus load of tourists arrived  
 emptied out 
 filled up the restaurant in a very short period of time completely changed the atmosphere and character with with loud voices and large bodies and such  and we had to get up and leave it was just that
 sun came out and through this perforated screen a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear and we left the restaurant kind of feeling
 o k about stuff  and
 i do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of
 the most evil evil forces of society such as bad form in restaurants but quite seriously  it was
  it was a statement to me that one thing that you do sort of see is
 the aggressive nature of of the industrial world has produced kind of  
 large masses of of things and
 when you in monoculture and i think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that 's important to us
  that i have deal with coming back to this theme of sidewalks and
 i wanted to say something here about i 'm kind of optimistic you know post second world war
 the influence of the automobile has really been devastating in a lot of our cities a lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use a lot of the planning departments became subordinated to the transportation department it 's
  as easy to rag on cars as it is
 on wal mart i 'm not going to do that 
 but they 're real examples in urbanization and the change that 's occurred in the last number of years and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers i think that they are 
 that the statements that we make in this public sector
 are our
 contributions to a larger whole cities are the place where we 're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with with other people
  go there for stimulation in art and all those other things  
 but i think people have recognized the sanctity of our urban areas a place like chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature the u s is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened 
 urban planning and renewal and i want to single out a place like chicago where i look at some guy like mayor daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area you
  expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on michigan avenue where where wealthy people shop  but if you actually go along the street you find the flower boxes change from 
  street to street there 's actual diversity in the plants and the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is is really quite quite exceptional 
  statements the pritzker pavilion done by frank gehry my measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks  but the fact that it performs 
  a very important social function there are a lot of free concerts for example that go on in in this area it has a phenomenal acoustic system but the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant and almost an international model i work on the mayor 's council in san francisco
 design council for mayors and chicago is looked at as the pinnacle and i really would like to salute mayor daley and the folks there i thought that i should include at least one shot of technology for you guys this is also in millennium park in chicago where
 the spanish artist designer plensa has created kind of  a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of of the people
 in this area and it 's a welcoming area i think inclusive of diversity reflective of diversity and i think
 this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the u s can really take a leadership role and chicago is one example
