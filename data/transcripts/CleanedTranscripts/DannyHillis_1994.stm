  because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people
 how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be  and i thought that since i was among friends here
  i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here
 with these
 amazing
 jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can we can barely keep on top of it  so i 'm going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide  
 and then  
 so if you can just turn on the
  this is just a random slide that i i picked out of my file 
 what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide but the general form of it this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing
 about
 the power of risc microprocessors versus the power of local area networks 
 and the interesting thing about it is that this slide like so many technology slides that we 're used to is a sort of a straight
  line on a semi log curve  
 in other words every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale  
 and this is a new thing that we talk about technology 
 something really weird is going on here  and that 's basically what i 'm going to be talking about so if you could bring up the
  bring up the lights higher because i 'm just going to use a piece of paper here
  now why do we draw technology curves in semi log curves well the answer is if i drew it on a normal curve
 where let 's say this is years this is time of some sort  and this is whatever measure of the technology
 that that i 'm trying to
  the graphs look sort of silly  they sort of go like this and
 they don 't tell us much  now
 if i graph for instance  some other technology say transportation technology 
 on a semi log curve it would look very stupid it would look like a flat line but
 when something like this happens things are qualitatively changing  so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology
 the day after tomorrow i would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in tokyo in thirty seconds 
 it 's not moving like that and there 's nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years  
 now the question that i 'd like to ask
  if you look at these these exponential curves  they don 't go on forever things just can 't possibly keep changing
 as fast as they are one of two things is going to happen either it 's going to turn into a sort of classical   s curve
 like this  until something totally different comes along or maybe it 's going to do this 
  now i 'm an optimist so i sort of think it 's probably going to do something like that 
 if so that means that what we 're in the middle of right now is a transition we 're sort of on this line
 in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is 
 and so what i 'm trying to ask what i 've been asking myself is what 's this new way that the world is what 's that new state that the world is
  the transition seems very very confusing when we 're right in the middle of it now when i was a kid growing up 
 the future was kind of the year two thousand and people used to talk about what would happen in the year two thousand
  now here 's a conference in which people talk about the future  and you notice that the future is still at about the year two thousand it 's about as far as we go
  so in other words the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year
 for my whole lifetime now i think that the reason
 is because we all feel that something 's happening there that transition is happening we can all sense it 
 and we know that it just doesn 't make too much sense to think out thirty fifty years because everything 's going to be so different
 that a simple
  doing just doesn 't make any sense at all so what i would like to talk about is what that could be what that transition could be that we 're going through  
 now in order to do that i 'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with
 technology and computers because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back
 and take a long time scale look at things so the time scale that i would like to look at this on
  the time scale of of life on earth so
 i think this
 this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time  
 so if you go back about two and a half billion years  the earth was this big sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it
  if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it
 and i think that there 's theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with rna but i 'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it  
 which is that at that time there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them 
 and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them
 which caused them
  to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil  
 and those that were like that started to split and divide  and those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense those little drops of oil  
 but now those drops of oil weren 't really alive as we say it now because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals
  sort of
 unequal division of the chemicals within them and so every drop was a little bit different 
 in fact the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them 
 grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more  so those tended to live longer get expressed more  
 now
 that 's sort of
 just a very simple chemical form of life
  things got interesting
 was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction  somehow
 by ways that we don 't quite understand these little drops learned to write down information they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell
 onto a particular kind of chemical
  so in other words they worked out in this mindless sort of evolutionary way 
 a form of writing that let them write down what they were so that that way of writing it down could get copied  
 the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago  in fact the recipe for us our genes is exactly that same code and that same way of writing  
 in fact every living creature is written
 in exactly the same set of letters and
  same code  in fact one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code and i 've got here a little one
 hundred micrograms of white powder
  which i
 try not to let the security people see at airports but this has in it
 what i did is i took this code
 the code has standard letters that that we use for symbolizing it  and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna
 and amplified it ten to the twenty two times  
 so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card i have plenty for everyone in the room and in fact everyone in the world  and it 's right here
  i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room 
 so what was the next step writing down the dna was an interesting step  
 and that caused these cells that kept them happy for another billion years  but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different which is these
  cells started exchanging and communicating information so that they began to get communities of cells  i don 't know if you know this but bacteria can actually exchange dna now
 that 's why for instance antibiotic resistance has evolved some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin  
 and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with
 other bacteria and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate
 now what this communication allowed was communities to form
 that in some sense were in the same boat together they were synergistic 
 so they survived or they failed together which means that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community
 were repeated more and they were favored by
  now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that in fact they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together
 on one string of dna 
 and so the next stage that 's interesting in life took about another billion years and
 at that stage we have multi cellular communities communities of lots of different types of cells  working together
  lots of cells
 that are not out for themselves anymore your skin cell is really useless without
 a heart cell muscle cell a brain cell and so on 
 so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell  
 but a community which we call an organism  
 now the next step that happened
 is within these communities
  communities of cells  again began to abstract information and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community 
 and those are the neural structures so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up and
 in fact they began to get specialists in the community and special structures
 that were responsible for recording
 understanding learning information and that was the brains and the nervous system
 of those communities  and that gave them an evolutionary advantage because at that point 
 an individual
 learning could happen within the time span of a single organism  instead of over this evolutionary time span  so
 an organism could for instance learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because
  it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate
 it that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism  whereas before they 'd built these special information processing structures 
 that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over
 hundreds of thousands of years by by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit  so that nervous system the fact that they built these special information structures
  up the whole process of evolution because evolution could now happen within an individual it could happen in learning time scales but
 then what happened was the individuals worked out of course tricks of communicating  
 and for example the most sophisticated version that we 're aware of is human language it 's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it here i have a very
 complicated messy
  idea in my head i 'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically  and hopefully constructing a similar messy confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it  
 but we 're taking something very complicated turning it into sound  sequences of sounds and producing something very complicated in your brain  
 so
 this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism
  and so in fact  what we 've done
 is we humanity have started abstracting out we 're going through the same levels that multi cellular organisms have gone through
 abstracting out our methods of recording  presenting  processing information  so for example the invention of language was a tiny step in that
  so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we 've now built within our society for handling that information  
 and it all connects us together
 into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than than what we were before 
  so now evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds and you saw ty 's little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution
 on the convolution program right before your eyes  
 so now we 've speeded up the time scales once again so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece  
 and the next steps like nervous systems and brains took a few hundred million years  then the next
  like language and so on took less than a million years  and these next steps like electronics seem to be taking only a few decades
 the process is feeding on itself and becoming
  i guess  autocatalytic is the word for it when something reinforces its rate of change the more it changes the faster it changes and
 i think that that 's what we 're seeing here in this explosion of curve we 're seeing this process feeding back on itself 
  and i know that the mechanisms that i use to design computers would be impossible
 without recent advances in computers so right now what i do is i design objects at such complexity
 that it 's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense i don 't know what every transistor in the connection machine does  there are billions
  i do and what the designers at thinking machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it
 beyond what we could ever do much farther and faster than we could ever do  and in fact sometimes it takes it by methods that we don 't quite even understand 
 one method
 that 's particularly interesting that that i 've been using a lot lately is evolution itself  so what we do is we put
 inside the machine
 a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale  
 so for example in the most extreme cases  we can actually evolve a program
 by starting out with random sequences of instructions  say computer would you please make a hundred million random sequences of
  now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions run all of those programs and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what i wanted 
 so in other words i define what i wanted let 's say i want to sort numbers as a simple example i 've done it with 
 so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers  
 so of course random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers  so none of them will really do it but one of them by luck may
 put two numbers in the right order
  say computer 
 would you please now take the ten percent of those random sequences that did the best job  save those kill off the rest  
 and now let 's reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best 
 and let 's reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the
  two programs  
 so i 've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job  say please repeat that process score them again  introduce some mutations perhaps  
 and try that again and do that for another generation 
 well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds  
 so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that
 within the computer
 in a few minutes or in the complicated cases in a few hours 
 at the end of that i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers 
 in fact they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand  
 now if i look at those programs i can 't tell you how they work i 've tried looking at them and telling you how they work they 're obscure weird programs  
 but they do the job  and in fact i know
 'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job  in fact their life depended on doing the job 
 laughter i was riding in a seven hundred and forty seven with marvin minsky once and he pulls out this card and says oh look
  look at this it says ' this plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight '
 doesn 't that make you feel confident 
 in fact we know that the engineering process doesn 't work very well when it gets complicated 
 so we 're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that 's very different
 than engineering and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce  and yet we don 't
  quite understand the options of it so in a sense it 's getting ahead of us 
 we 're now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we 'll be able to run this process much faster so it 's feeding back on itself the
 thing is becoming faster and that 's why i think it seems so confusing because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves
  we 're taking off 
 and what we are is we 're at a point in time which is analogous to when single celled organisms were turning into multi celled organisms so we
 're the amoebas and we can 't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we 're creating we 're right at that point of transition  
 but i think that there really is something coming along after us i think it 's very haughty of us to think that we 're the end product of evolution
  i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is 
 so lunch is coming along  and i think i will stop at that point before i get selected out
