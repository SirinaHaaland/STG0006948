  get invited to give weird talks 
 i got invited to speak to the people who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes to perform at sporting events  
 unfortunately i couldn 't go  but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys
  guys at least most of them  know what it is that they do for a living what they do is they dress up as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events  
 shortly after that i got invited to speak at the convention of the people who make balloon animals 
 and again i couldn 't go but it 's a fascinating group they make balloon animals there is a big schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals but
  really cool stuff with balloons sometimes they get in trouble
 but not often  and the other thing about these guys is they also know what they do for a living  they make balloon animals  
 but what do we do for a living  what exactly to the people watching this do every day 
 and i want to argue
  that what we do is we try to change everything that we try to find a piece of the status quo something that bothers us something that needs to be improved something that is
 itching to be changed and we change it  we try to make big  permanent  important change  
 but we don 't think about it that way and we haven 't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like  
 and i 've been studying it for a couple years and i want to share a couple stories with you today  first about a guy named
  nathan winograd 
 nathan was the number two person at the san francisco spca and what you may not know about the history of the spca is it was founded to kill dogs and cats 
 cities gave them a charter to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them 
 in a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed most of them within twenty four hours of being scooped off of the street
  nathan and his boss saw this and they could not tolerate it so they set out to make san francisco a no kill city 
 create an entire city where every dog and cat  unless it was
 ill or dangerous would be adopted not killed  and everyone said it was impossible 
 nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance  and people from
 spcas and humane shelters around the country flew to san francisco to testify against them
 to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane  
 they persisted and nathan went directly to the community  he connected with people who cared about this nonprofessionals people with passion  
 and within just a couple years san francisco became the first
  running no deficit 
 completely supported by the community
  nathan left and went to tompkins county new york a place as different from san francisco as you can be and still be in the united states  and he did it again  he went from being a glorified
 dogcatcher to completely transforming the community  and then he went to north carolina and did it again  and he went to reno and he did it again  
  do i think about ideas  and i think about the idea that
 creating an idea spreading an idea has a lot behind it  i don 't know if you 've ever been to a jewish wedding but what they do
 is they take a light bulb and
 they smash it now there is a bunch of reasons for that and stories about it but one reason is because it indicates a change
  change from before to after it is a moment in time  
 and i want to argue that we are living through and are right at the key moment of a change in the way ideas are created and spread and implemented 
 we started with the factory idea that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory that could churn out change 
 we then went to the tv idea that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece if you could get on
  tv enough times if you could buy enough ads you could win and now we 're in this new model of leadership 
 where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system  
 but by leading  so let me tell you about the three cycles the first one is the factory cycle henry ford comes up with a really cool idea  
 it enables him to hire
  men who used to get paid fifty cents a day and pay them five dollars a day  
 because he 's got an efficient enough factory well with that sort of advantage you can churn out a lot of cars you can make a lot of change you can get roads built you can change the fabric of an entire country 
 that the essence of what you 're doing is you need ever cheaper labor 
  and the problem we 've run into is we 're running out of both ever cheaper labor and 
 so
 we shift gears for a minute  and say i know television  
 advertising push push take a good idea and push it on the world  i have a better mousetrap  and if i can just get enough money to tell enough
  people i 'll sell enough and you can build an entire industry on that if necessary you can put babies in your ads  
 if necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff and if babies don 't work you can use doctors  
 but be careful because you don 't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition where you 're talking about one thing instead of the other
  you to act like the king 
 like the person in the front of the room throwing things to the peons in the back that you are in charge  and you 're going to tell people what to do next the 
  quick little diagram of it is you 're up here  and you are pushing it out to the world this method mass marketing requires average ideas  because you 're going to the masses  
 what we 've done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea  hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause  hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate 
 and  unfortunately it doesn 't work so well anymore either 
 but there is good news around the corner really good news
 i call it the idea
 of tribes 
 what tribes are is a very simple concept that goes back fifty thousand years  it 's about leading and connecting people and ideas  and it 's something that people have wanted forever  
 lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe or a church tribe  
 having a work tribe
  a community tribe  
 but now thanks to the internet thanks to the explosion of mass media  thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world 
 tribes are everywhere the internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all instead what it 's allowed is silos of interest so you 've got the red hat ladies over here  you 've got
  triathletes over there  you 've got the organized armies over here you 've got the disorganized rebels over here you 've got people in white hats making food  and people in white hats sailing boats the point is that you can find ukrainian folk dancers and connect with them  
 because you want to be connected 
 that people on the fringes can find each other connect and go somewhere 
 every town that has a volunteer fire
  it turns out this is a legitimate non photoshopped photo people i know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon and that what firemen do to train sometimes is they take a house that is going to be torn down and they burn it down instead and practice putting it out but they always stop
  you know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one they 've got their own flag they 've got the eye patches you can tell when you 're running into someone in a tribe  and it turns out that it 's tribes 
  not money not factories that can change our world  that can change politics that can align large numbers of people not because you force them
  find something worth changing and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes that spread the idea and spread the idea and it becomes something far bigger than ourselves it becomes a movement  
 so when al gore set out to change the world again  he didn 't do it by
  and he didn 't do it by buying a lot of ads  he did it by creating a movement  thousands of people around the country who could give his presentation for him because he can 't be in one hundred or two hundred or five hundred cities in each night 
 you don 't need everyone  what kevin kelley has taught us is you just need  i don 't know a thousand true fans a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next
  that means that the idea you create the product you create the movement you create isn 't for everyone it 's not a mass thing that 's not what this is about what it 's about instead is finding the true believers  
 it 's easy to look at what i 've said so far and say wait a minute  i don 't have what it takes to be that kind of leader 
 so here are two leaders they don 't have a lot in common  
 they 're about the same age
  that 's about it 
 what they did though is each in their own way created a different way of navigating your way through technology  
  so some people will go out and get people to be on one team and some people will get people to be on the other team  
  this is one of my favorite devices  but what a shame that it 's not organized to help authors create movements  what would happen if when you 're using your kindle you could 
  see the comments and quotes and notes from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment or from your book group or from your friends or from the circle you want what would happen 
 if authors or people with ideas could use version two which comes out on monday  and use it to organize people
 who want to talk about something 
 now there is a million things i could share with you about the mechanics here but let me just try a couple the beatles did not invent teenagers  
 they merely decided to lead them  
 that most movements  most leadership that we 're doing is about finding a group that 's disconnected but already has a yearning not persuading people to want something they don 't have yet 
 when diane hatz
 worked on the meatrix her video that spread all across the internet about the way farm animals are treated  she didn 't invent the idea 
  of being a vegan she didn 't invent the idea of caring about this issue  but she helped organize people and helped turn it into a movement hugo chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of venezuela he merely led them bob marley did not invent rastafarians
 he just stepped up and said follow me derek sivers
 invented cd baby  which allowed independent musicians to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man to have place to take the mission they already wanted to go to and connect with each other  
 what all these people have in common is that they are heretics that heretics look at the status quo and say this will not
  stand  i can 't abide this status quo i am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward i see what the status quo is  i don 't like it 
 that instead of looking at all the little rules and following each one of them  
 that instead of being
 what i call a sheepwalker somebody who
  keeping their head down  fitting in
 every once in a while someone stands up and says not me 
 someone stands up and says this one is important 
 we need to organize around it and not everyone will  but you don 't need everyone you just need a few people 
 who will look at the rules realize they make no sense
  and realize how much they want to be connected  
 so tony hsieh does not run a shoe store  zappos isn 't a shoe store  zappos is the one the only the 
 place for people who are into shoes to find each other 
 to talk about their passion to connect with people who care more about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow  it can be something as prosaic
  as shoes and something as complicated as overthrowing a government it 's exactly the same behavior though  
 what it requires as geraldine carter has discovered is to be able to say i can 't do this by myself  but if i can get other people to join my climb and ride 
 then together we can get something that we all
  just waiting for someone to lead us michelle kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture  
 she doesn 't do it by quietly building one house at a time  
 she does it by telling a story
 to people who want to hear it by connecting a tribe of people who are desperate to be connected to each other by leading a movement
 and around and around and around it goes so three questions i 'd offer you the first one is  who exactly are you upsetting  
 because if you 're not upsetting anyone you 're not changing the status quo  
 the second question is  who are you connecting because for a lot of people that 's what they 're in it for  
 the connections that are being made one to the other  and the third one
  are you leading  
 because focusing on that part of it not the mechanics of what you 're building 
 but the who and the leading part is where change comes so
 blake at tom 's shoes had a very simple idea what would happen
 if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes i gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn 't even own a pair
  this is not the story of how you get shelf space at neiman marcus  it 's a story of a product that tells a story 
 and as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes and someone says what are those you get to tell the story on blake 's behalf on behalf of the people who got the shoes 
 and suddenly it 's not one pair of shoes or one hundred pairs of shoes it 's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes my friend red maxwell has spent the last ten years
 fighting against juvenile diabetes not fighting the organization that 's fighting it
  fighting with them  leading them  connecting them  challenging the status quo because it 's important to him  and the people he surrounds himself with
 need the connection they need the leadership  it makes a difference 
 you don 't need permission from people to lead them but in case you do here it is they 're waiting we 're waiting for you to show us
  where to go next  so here is what leaders have in common the first thing is they challenge
 the status quo  they challenge what 's currently there  the second thing is they build a culture 
 a secret language a seven second handshake a way of knowing that you 're in or out they have curiosity  curiosity
  people in the tribe curiosity about outsiders  they 're asking questions they connect people to one another do you know what people want more than anything  
 they want to be missed 
 they want to be missed the day they don 't show up they want to be missed when they 're gone  and tribe leaders can do that it 's fascinating because
 all tribe leaders have charisma  but you don 't need charisma to become a leader being a leader gives
  if you look and study the leaders who have succeeded that 's where charisma comes from from the leading finally  they commit  
 they commit to the cause they commit to the tribe they commit to the people who are there
