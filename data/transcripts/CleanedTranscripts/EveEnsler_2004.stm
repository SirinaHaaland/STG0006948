  i bet you 're worried 
 i was worried 
 that 's why i began this piece i was worried about vaginas 
 i was worried what we think about vaginas and even more worried that we don 't think about them
  i was worried about my own vagina  it needed a context a culture  a community of other vaginas 
 there is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them like the bermuda triangle nobody ever reports back from there 
 in the first place  it 's not so easy to even find your vagina women go days weeks months without looking at it
  i interviewed a high powered businesswoman she told me she didn 't have time looking at your vagina she said is a full day 's work 
 you 've got to get down there on your back in front of a mirror full length preferred you 've got to get in the perfect position with the perfect light which then becomes shadowed by the angle you 're at you 're twisting your head up arching your back it 's exhausting 
 she was busy she didn 't have time
  so i decided to talk to women about their vaginas 
 they began as casual vagina interviews  and they turned into vagina monologues  
 i talked with over two hundred women  i talked to older women  younger women married women lesbians single women  i talked to corporate professionals college professors actors sex
  at first women were a little shy a little reluctant to talk once they got going you couldn 't stop them 
 women love to talk about their  vaginas they do 
 mainly because no one 's ever asked them before 
  it doesn 't matter how many times you say the word it never sounds like a word you want to say 
 it 's a completely ridiculous  totally un sexy word if you use it during sex trying to be politically correct darling 
 would you stroke my vagina
 you kill the act right there 
 i 'm worried what we call them and don 't call them  
 in great neck new york they call it a pussycat 
 a woman told me there her mother used to tell her don 't wear panties dear underneath your pajamas you need to air out your pussycat 
 in westchester they call it a pooki in new jersey  a twat
  a mimi in miami  a split knish in philadelphia and a schmende in the bronx 
 i am worried about vaginas 
 this is how the vagina monologues begins  but it really didn 't begin there it began
 with a conversation with a woman
  we were having a conversation about menopause  
 and we got onto the subject of her vagina which you 'll do if you 're talking about menopause  
 and she said things that really shocked me about her vagina that it was dried up and finished and dead and i was kind of shocked so i said to a friend casually well what do you think about your vagina 
 and that woman said something more amazing and then the next woman said something more amazing and before i knew it  every woman was telling me i had to talk to somebody
  about their vagina because they had an amazing story  and i was sucked down the vagina trail and
 i really haven 't gotten off of it  
 i think if you had told me when i was younger that i was going to grow up and be in shoe stores and people would scream out there she is the vagina lady i don 't know that that would have been my life ambition 
 laughter but i want to talk a little bit about happiness and the relationship to this whole vagina journey
  it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago  i think before i did the vagina monologues i
 didn 't really believe in happiness  i thought that only idiots were happy to be honest
  i remember when i started practicing buddhism fourteen years ago  and i was told that the end of this practice was to be happy i said how could you be happy and live in this world of suffering and live in this world of pain
  happiness for a lot of other things like numbness
 or decadence or selfishness  
 and what happened through the course of the vagina monologues and this journey is i think i have come to understand a little bit more about happiness 
 there are three qualities i want to talk about one is
 seeing what 's right in front of you and talking about it and stating it i think what i learned from
  talking about the vagina and speaking about the vagina is it was the most obvious thing it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about 
 the second thing is is that what talking about the vagina did
 is it opened this door which allowed me to see that there was a way to serve the world to make it better
  and that 's where the deepest happiness has actually come from 
 and the third principle of happiness which i 've realized recently 
 eight years ago  this momentum and this energy this v wave started and i can only describe it as a v wave because to be honest i really don 't understand it completely i feel 
  at the service of it  but this wave started and if i question the wave or try to stop the wave or look back at the wave
  have the experience of whiplash or the potential of my neck breaking  
 but if i go with the wave and i trust the wave and i move with the wave  i go to the next place and it happens logically and organically and truthfully  
 and i started this piece particularly
 with stories and narratives  and i was talking to one woman and that led to another woman and that led to another woman 
 and then i wrote those stories down and i put them out in front of other people and every single time i did the show at
  the beginning women would literally line up after the show because they wanted to tell me their stories 
 and at first i thought oh great i 'll hear about wonderful orgasms and great sex lives and how women love their vaginas but in fact  that 's not what women lined up to tell me 
 what women lined up to tell me was how they were raped  and how they were battered and how they were beaten  and how they were gang raped in parking lots and how they were incested by their uncles
  and i wanted to stop doing the vagina monologues because it felt too daunting i felt like a war photographer who takes pictures of terrible events but doesn 't intervene on their behalf 
 and so in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven i said let 's get women together what could we do with this information that all these women are being violated 
  and investigating that i discovered and the un has actually said this recently
 that one out of every three women on this planet will be beaten or raped in her lifetime  
 that 's essentially a gender that 's essentially the resource of the planet which is women  
 so in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven we got all these incredible women together and we said how can we use the play this energy  to stop violence against women 
 and we put on one event in new york city in the theater and all these great actors came from susan sarandon
  glenn close to whoopi goldberg
 and we did one performance on one evening 
 and that catalyzed this wave this energy 
 and within five years this extraordinary thing began to happen 
 one woman took that energy and she said i want to bring this wave this energy to college campuses and so she
  took the play and she said let 's use the play and have performances once a year where we can raise money to stop violence against women in local communities all around the world 
 and in one year it went to fifty colleges and then it expanded 
 and over the course of the last six years it 's spread and it 's spread and it 's spread around the world 
 what i have learned
 is two things one that the epidemic of
  violence towards women is shocking 
 it 's global 
 it is so profound and it is so devastating and it is so in every little pocket of every little crater of every little society that we don 't even recognize it because it 's become ordinary 
 this journey has taken me to afghanistan  where i had the extraordinary honor and privilege to go into
 into parts of afghanistan under the taliban i was dressed in a burqa and i went in with an extraordinary group called the revolutionary association of the women
  afghanistan and i saw firsthand how women had been stripped of every single right that was possible to strip women of
 from being educated  to being employed  to being actually allowed to eat ice cream 
 for those of you who don 't know it was illegal to eat ice cream under the taliban  and i actually
 saw and met women who had been flogged for being caught eating vanilla ice cream  i was taken to the
  secret ice cream eating place in a little town where
 we went to a back room and women were seated and a curtain was pulled around us  and they were served vanilla ice cream and women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream  and i don 't think i ever understood pleasure until that moment 
 and how women have found a way to keep their pleasure alive  
  it has taken me this journey to islamabad where i have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off  
 it has taken me to juarez mexico  where i was a week ago  where i have literally been there in parking lots where bones of women have washed up and been dumped next to coca cola bottles  
 it has taken me to universities all over this country where girls are date raped and drugged  i have seen
  terrible violence 
 but i have also recognized in the course of seeing that violence that being in the face of things and seeing actually what 's in front of us
 is the antidote to depression 
 and to a feeling that one is worthless and has no value 
 because before the vagina monologues i will say that eighty percent of my consciousness was closed off to what was really going on in this
  off my vitality and my life energy 
 what has also happened is in the course of these travels and it 's been an extraordinary thing is that every single place that i have gone to in the world i have met a new species and i really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea  
 and i was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people on this particular panel 
 that it 's beneath beyond and between and the vagina kind of fits into all those
 categories
 but one of the things i 've seen is this species and it is a species and it is a new paradigm  
 and it doesn 't get reported in the press or in the media because i don 't think good news ever is news  
 and i don 't think people who are transforming the planet are what gets the ratings on tv shows  
 but every single country i have been to and in the last six years i 've been to about forty five countries and many tiny little villages and
  cities and towns i have seen something what i 've come to call vagina warriors a vagina warrior is
 a woman or a vagina friendly man who has witnessed incredible violence or suffered it and rather than getting an 
  or a weapon of mass destruction or a machete they
  the violence in their bodies they grieve it 
 they experience it  and then they go out and devote their lives to making sure it doesn 't happen to anybody else 
 i have met these women everywhere on the planet  and i want to tell a few stories because i believe that stories are the way that we transmit information where it goes into our bodies  
 and i think one of the things about being at ted that 's been very interesting is
  i live in my body a lot and i don 't live in my head very much anymore and this is a very heady place and
 it 's been really interesting to be in my head for the last two days i 've been very disoriented because i think
 the world the v world is very much in your body it 's a body world and
 the species really exists in the body and i think there 's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads that that separation has created a divide
 that is often separating purpose from
  intent and the connection between body and head
 often brings those things into union 
 i want to talk about three particular people that i 've met vagina warriors who really transformed my understanding of this whole principle and species and one is a woman named marsha lopez 
 marsha lopez was a woman i met in
  she was fourteen years old and she was in a marriage and her husband was beating her on a regular basis  
 and she couldn 't get out because she was addicted to the relationship and she had no money 
 her sister was younger than her and she applied we had a stop rape contest
 a few years ago in new york
 and she applied  hoping that she would become a finalist and she could bring her sister
 she did become a finalist she brought marsha to new york and at that time we did this extraordinary
 v day at madison square garden  
 where we sold out the entire testosterone filled dome eighteen thousand people standing up to say yes to vaginas which was really a pretty incredible transformation 
 and she came and she witnessed this and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband 
 and that she would bring v day to guatemala she was twenty one years old i went to guatemala and she had sold out 
 the national theater of guatemala
 and i watched her walk up on stage in her red
 short dress and high heels and she stood there and said  my name is marsha 
 i was beaten by my husband for five years he almost murdered me i left and you can too 
 and the entire two thousand people went absolutely crazy  
 there 's a woman named esther chvez who i met in juarez mexico and esther chvez was a brilliant accountant in mexico city
  she was seventy two years old and she was planning to retire 
 she went to juarez to take care of an ailing aunt and in the course of it she began to discover what was happening to the murdered and
 disappeared women of juarez  she gave up her life she moved to juarez  she started to write the stories which documented the disappeared women 
  three hundred women have disappeared in a border town because they 're brown and poor  there has been no response to the disappearance and not one person has been held accountable  she began to document it  she opened 
 a center called casa amiga  and in six years she has literally brought this to the consciousness of the world 
  to see that other people from the world had showed up for that particular community  there 's another woman named agnes and agnes for me 
 epitomizes what a vagina warrior is i met her three years ago in kenya  and
 agnes was mutilated as a little girl she was circumcised against her will when she was ten years old and she really made a decision that she didn 't want this
  practice to continue anymore in her community  so when she got older she created this incredible thing it 's an
 anatomical sculpture of a woman 's body  half a woman 's body and she walked through the rift valley and she had
 vagina and vagina replacement parts where she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls what a healthy vagina looks like and what a mutilated vagina looks like and
 in the course of her travel she
  walked literally for eight years through the rift valley  through dust through sleeping on the ground because the maasai are nomads and she would have to find them and they would
 move and she would find them again
 she saved one thousand five hundred girls from being cut
  and in that time she created an alternative ritual which involved girls coming of age without the cut  when we met her three years ago
  could v day do for you and she said well if you got me a jeep i could get around a lot faster 
 so we bought her a jeep  
 and in the year that she had the jeep she saved four thousand five hundred girls from being cut 
 so we said to her what else could we do for you she said well eve if you gave me some money i could open a house and girls could run away  and they could be saved and
 i want to tell this little story about my own beginnings because it 's very interrelated to
  happiness and and agnes when i was a little girl i grew up in
 a wealthy community  it was an upper middle class white community and it had all the trappings and the looks of a
 perfectly nice wonderful 
 great life 
 and everyone was supposed to be happy in that community  and in fact my life was hell i lived with an alcoholic father who beat me and molested me and it was all inside that
  and always as a child i had this fantasy
 that somebody would come and rescue me and i actually made up a little character whose name was mr alligator 
 i would call him up when things got really bad and say it was time to come and pick me up  and i would pack a little bag and wait for mr alligator to come  
 now mr alligator never did come 
 but the idea
  alligator coming actually saved my sanity and made it ok for me to keep going because i believed in the distance there would be someone coming to rescue me 
 cut to 40 some odd years later we go to kenya 
 and we 're walking we arrive at the opening of this house 
 and agnes hadn 't let me come to the house for days because they were preparing this whole ritual  i want to tell you a great story when agnes first started fighting to stop female genital mutilation in her community she had become an outcast
  and she was exiled and slandered and the whole community turned against her but being a vagina warrior she kept going  and she kept committing herself to transforming consciousness  
 and in the maasai community  goats and cows are the most valued possession they 're like the 
 of the rift valley  and she said two days before the house opened two different people arrived to give her a goat each
 and she said to me i knew then that female genital mutilation would end one day in africa anyway we arrived and when we arrived  
 there were hundreds of girls dressed in red homemade dresses which is the color of the maasai and the color of v day and they greeted us they had made up these songs that they were singing about the end of suffering and the end of mutilation and they walked us down the path
  gorgeous day in the african sun and the dust was flying and the girls were dancing and there was this house and it said v day safe house for the girls 
 and it hit me in that moment
 that it had taken forty seven years  but that mr alligator had finally shown up 
 and he had shown up  obviously in a form that it took me a long time to understand which is that when we give
  in the world what we want the most we heal the broken part inside each of us  
 and i feel in the last eight years that this journey this miraculous vagina journey
 has taught me this really simple thing 
 which is that happiness exists in action it exists in telling the truth and saying what your truth is 
 and it exists in giving away
  away what you want the most  and i feel
 that knowledge and that journey has been an extraordinary privilege  and i feel really blessed to have been here today to communicate that to you
