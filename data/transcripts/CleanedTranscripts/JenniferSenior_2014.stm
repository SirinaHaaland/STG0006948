  when i was born  there was really only one book about how to raise your children  and it was written by dr spock 
 thank you for indulging me i have always wanted to do that 
 no it was benjamin spock
  and his book was called the common sense book of baby and child care it sold almost fifty million copies by the time he died 
 today i as the mother of a six year old walk into barnes and noble and see this  
 and it is amazing the variety
  if you ask me is a little bit creepy  there are guides to raising a bilingual kid even if you only speak one language at home  
 there are guides to raising a financially savvy kid
  kid and a kid who is a whiz at yoga  
 short of teaching your toddler how to defuse a nuclear bomb there is pretty much a guide to everything  
 all of these books are well intentioned i am sure that many of them are great  but taken
  i do not see help when i look at that shelf  
 i see anxiety  i see a giant candy colored monument to our collective panic  
 and it makes me want to know  why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish and so much confusion
  why is it that we are at sixes and sevens about the one thing
 human beings have been doing successfully for millennia  long before parenting message boards and peer reviewed studies came along  
 why is it that so many mothers and fathers
 experience parenthood
 as a kind of crisis 
 crisis might seem like a strong
  but there is data suggesting it probably isn 't there was in fact a paper of just this very name parenthood as crisis published in 
 and in the 50 plus years since  there has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern
 of parental anguish parents experience more stress than non parents their marital satisfaction is lower
  there have been a number of studies looking at how parents feel when they are spending time with their kids and the answer often is not so great
  last year  i spoke with a researcher named matthew killingsworth who is doing a very very imaginative project
 that tracks people 's happiness and here is what he told me he found 
 interacting with your friends is better than interacting with your spouse  which is better than interacting with other relatives
 which is better than interacting with acquaintances which is better than interacting with parents which is better than interacting with children 
 who are on par with strangers 
 but here 's the thing  
 i have been looking at what underlies these data
 for three years and children
  are not the problem something about parenting
 right now at this moment
 is the problem 
 specifically  i don 't think we know what parenting is supposed to be 
 parent as a verb only entered common usage in one thousand nine hundred and seventy 
 our roles as mothers and fathers have changed  the roles
  of our children have changed  we are all now furiously improvising our way through a situation for which there is no script  
 and if you 're an amazing jazz musician then improv is great  but for the rest of us it
 can kind of feel like a crisis 
 so how did we get here how is it that we are all now
  a child rearing universe without
 any norms to guide us  
 well for starters  there has been a major historical change  until fairly recently 
 kids worked on our farms primarily  but also in factories mills mines kids were considered economic assets  
 sometime during the progressive era we put an end to this arrangement we recognized
  kids had rights  we banned child labor we focused on education instead  and school became a child 's new work 
 and thank god it did  
 but that only made a parent 's role more confusing in a way  the old arrangement might not have been particularly ethical  but it was reciprocal we provided
  and moral instruction to our kids and they in return provided income 
 once kids stopped working the economics of parenting changed  
 kids became in the words of one brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist 
 economically worthless but emotionally priceless 
 rather than them working for us  we began to work for them because
  within only a matter of decades it became clear if we wanted our kids to succeed school was not enough 
 today  
 extracurricular activities are a kid 's new work  but that 's work for us too because we are the ones driving them to soccer practice  
 massive piles of homework are a kid
  but that 's also work for us because we have to check it about three years ago a texas woman told something to me that
 totally broke my heart she said almost casually homework
 is the new dinner 
 the middle class now pours all of its time and energy and resources into its
  even though the middle class has less and less of those things to give mothers
 now spend more time with their children than they did in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five when most women were not even in the workforce  
 it would probably be easier for parents to do their new roles if they knew what they were preparing their kids for 
 this is yet another thing that makes modern parenting so very confounding we have no clue what
  portion our wisdom if any is of use to our kids the world is changing so rapidly it 's impossible to say 
 this was true even when i was young  
 when i was a kid  high school specifically i was told that i would be at sea in the new global economy if i did not know
 japanese  and with all due respect to the japanese  it didn 't turn out that way
 now there is a certain kind of middle class parent that is obsessed with teaching their kids mandarin and maybe they 're onto something 
 but we cannot know for sure 
 so  absent being able to anticipate the future what we all do as good parents 
 is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future  hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off
  we teach our kids chess thinking maybe they will need analytical skills  
 we sign them up for team sports  thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills 
 you know for when they go to harvard business school  we try and teach them to be financially savvy and
 i was not
  and gluten free as a child  i ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef 
 and you know what i 'm doing okay  i pay my taxes  i hold down a steady job 
 i was even invited to speak at ted  
 but the presumption now is that what was good enough for
  me or for my folks for that matter isn 't good enough anymore so we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf  
 because we feel like if we aren 't trying everything  
 it 's as if we 're doing nothing
 and we 're defaulting on our obligations to our kids 
 so it 's hard enough to navigate our new roles as mothers and fathers now add to this problem something else
  we are also navigating new roles as husbands and wives because most women today are in the workforce 
 this is another reason i think that parenthood feels like a crisis  
 we have no rules no scripts no norms for what to do when a child comes along now that both mom and dad are breadwinners  
 the writer michael lewis once put this very very well he said that the surest way
  way for a couple to start fighting
 is for them to go out to dinner with another couple whose division of labor is ever so slightly different from theirs because
 the conversation in the car on the way home goes something like this 
 so did you catch that dave is the one who walks them to school every morning
 without scripts telling us who does what in this brave new world couples fight  
 and both mothers and fathers each have their legitimate gripes 
 mothers are much more likely to be multi tasking when they are at home and fathers when they are at home are much more likely to be
  find a guy at home  and odds are he is doing just one thing at a time in fact ucla recently did a study
 looking at the most common configuration of family members in middle class homes  guess what it was dad in a room by himself  
 according to the american time use survey mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers
 is better than it was in erma bombeck 's day  but i still think that something she wrote is highly relevant 
 i have not been alone in the bathroom since october 
 but here is the thing men are doing
  they spend more time with their kids than their fathers ever spent with them 
 they work more paid hours on average than their wives 
 and they genuinely want to be good involved dads today it is fathers 
 not mothers who report the most work life conflict  
 either way by the way if you think it 's hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles just imagine what it 's like now for
  families families with two dads families with two moms single parent households they are truly improvising as they go 
 now in a more progressive country  
 and forgive me here for capitulating to clich and invoking  yes  sweden parents could rely on the state
 for support  there are
  countries that acknowledge the anxieties and the changing roles of mothers and fathers  
 unfortunately the united states is not one of them so in case you were wondering what the u s has in common with
 papua new guinea and liberia  it 's this 
 we too have no paid
 paid maternity leave policy  we are one of eight known countries that does not 
 in this age of intense confusion 
 there is just one goal upon which all parents can agree  
 and that is whether they are tiger moms or hippie moms helicopters or drones 
  is paramount 
 that is what it means to raise kids in an age when they are economically worthless but emotionally priceless  
 we are all the custodians of  their self esteem 
 the one mantra no parent ever questions is all i want is for my children to be happy 
 and don 't get me wrong  i think happiness is a wonderful
  goal for a child but it is a very elusive one happiness and 
 teaching children that is not like teaching them how to plow a field 
 it 's not like teaching them how to ride a bike  there 's no curriculum for it 
 happiness and self confidence can be the byproducts of other things but they cannot really be goals unto themselves
 a child 's happiness is a very unfair burden to place on a parent 
 and happiness is an even more unfair burden to place on a kid 
 and i have to tell you  i think it leads to some very strange excesses  
 we are now so anxious to protect our kids from the world 's ugliness
 that we now shield them from
 sesame street i wish i could say i was kidding about this but
 if you go out and you buy the first few episodes of sesame street on dvd  as i did out of nostalgia 
 you will find a warning at the beginning
 saying that the content is not suitable for children
  content of the original sesame street is not suitable for children 
 when asked about this by the new york times a producer for the show gave a variety of explanations 
 one was that cookie monster smoked a pipe in one skit and then swallowed it bad modeling i don 't know but the thing that stuck with me
 is she said that she didn 't know whether oscar the grouch
 could be invented today because he was too depressive  
 i cannot tell you how much this distresses me 
 you are looking at a woman who has a periodic table of the muppets hanging from her cubicle wall
  the offending muppet  right there
  that 's my son
 the day he was born  i was high as a kite on morphine  i had had an unexpected c section 
 but
 even in my opiate haze  i managed to have one very clear thought
 the first time i held him  i whispered it into his ear i said
  try so hard not to hurt you 
 it was the hippocratic oath and i didn 't even know i was saying it  but it occurs to me now
 that the hippocratic oath is a much more realistic aim than happiness in fact  as any parent will tell you
  hard all of us have said or done hurtful things
 that we wish to god we could take back  
 i think in another era
 we did not expect quite so much from ourselves  and it is important that we all remember that the next time we are staring with our
  hearts racing at those bookshelves  
 i 'm not really sure how to create new norms
 for this world  but i do think that
 in our desperate quest to create happy kids we may be assuming the wrong
  wrong moral burden 
 it strikes me as a better goal and dare i say a more virtuous one 
 to focus on making productive kids and moral kids and to simply hope that happiness will come to them by virtue of
 the good that they do and their accomplishments
 and the love that they feel from us 
 that anyway is one response to having no script  
 absent having new scripts  we just follow the
  oldest ones in the book
 decency a work ethic love
 and let happiness and self esteem take care of themselves  i think if we all did that 
 the kids would still be all right and so would their parents possibly in both cases even better
