  i think it was in my second grade that i was caught drawing the bust of a nude by michelangelo  i was sent straight away to my school principal  
 and my school principal a sweet nun 
  looked at my book with disgust  flipped through the pages saw all the nudes you know i 'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and i 'd copy her
 and the nun slapped me on my face and said sweet jesus this kid has already begun i had no clue what she was talking about but it
  was convincing enough for me never to draw again
 until the ninth grade thanks to a really boring lecture i started caricaturing my teachers in school  and you know i got a lot of
  popularity  i don 't play sports  i 'm really bad at sports  
 i don 't have the fanciest gadgets at home i 'm not on top of the class so for me cartooning gave me a sense of identity i got popular  
 but i was scared i 'd get caught again  so what i did was i quickly put together a collage of all the teachers i had drawn  
 glorified my school principal put him right on top and gifted it to him
 he had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board this is a part of that  and
 i became a school hero all my seniors knew me  i felt really special 
 i have to tell you a little bit about my my family that 's my mother  i love her to bits  she 's the one who taught me how to draw and more importantly how to love 
 she 's a bit of a hippie she said don 't say that but i 'm saying it
  anyway  
 the rest of my family are boring academics busy collecting ivy league decals for our classic ambassador car my father 's a little different  
 my father believed in a holistic approach to living  and you know every time he taught us he 'd say i hate these books because these books
 are hijacked by industrial
  while he still held that worldview  i was sixteen  i got the best lawyer in town  my older brother karthik  
 and i sat him down and i said pa from today onwards i 've decided i 'm going to be disciplined  i 'm going to be curious  
 i 'm going to learn something new every day i 'm going to be very hard working  and i 'm not going to depend on you emotionally or financially 
 and he was very impressed he was all tearing up ready to hug me and i said hold that thought i said can i quit school
  then 
 but to cut a long story short i quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist 
 i must have done about thirty thousand caricatures i would do birthday parties weddings divorces anything for anyone who wanted to use my services 
 but most importantly while i was traveling  i taught children cartooning and in exchange i learned how to be spontaneous and mad and crazy and fun
  when i started teaching them i said let me start doing this professionally when i was eighteen i started my own school  
 however an eighteen  year old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have a big patron or a big supporter  
 so i was flipping through the pages of the times of india when i saw that the prime minister of india was visiting my home
  you know just like how every cartoonist knows bush here  and if you had to meet bush it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist 's delight i had to meet my prime minister 
 i went to the place where his helicopter helicopter was about to land  i saw layers of security  
 i caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the guards
  but i got stuck i got stuck at the third  and what happened was to my luck
  i saw a nuclear scientist at whose party i had done cartoons i ran up to him and said hello sir how do you do he said what are you doing here raghava i said i 'm here to meet the prime minister
  this is one i remember fondly  salman rushdie was pissed off i think because i altered the map of new york if you notice 
 laughter anyway  the next slide i 'm about to show you 
 should i just turn that  off the next slide i 'm about
  is a little more serious i was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published
 soon after nine eleven 
 what was for me a very naive observation turned out to be a disaster that evening i came home to hundreds of hate mails 
 hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this i was also asked to leave
 the organization
  organization in america  that for me was my lifeline that 's when i realized you know  cartoons are really powerful art comes with responsibility  
 anyway what i did was i decided that i need to take a break  i quit my job at the papers  i closed my school  and i wrapped up my pencils and
 and my brushes and inks  and i decided to go traveling  
 when i went traveling i remember i met this fabulous old man who i met when i was caricaturing who turned out to be an artist
 in italy he invited me to his studio he said come and visit 
 when i went i saw the ghastliest thing ever  i saw this dead naked effigy of himself hanging from the ceiling 
 i said oh my god what is that and i asked him  and he said oh that thing in the night  i die in the morning  i am born
  i thought he was koo koo  
 but something about that really stuck  i loved it  i thought there was something really beautiful about that so i said i am dead so i need to be born again so i wanted to be a painter like him  except  i don 't know how to paint  
 so i tried going to the art store 
 you know there are a hundred types of brushes forget it  they will confuse you even if you know how to draw  so i decided i 'm going to learn to paint by myself i 'm going to show you a very quick clip to show you how i painted
 and a little bit about my city
  had to be larger than life  everything had to be larger the next painting was even bigger  and even bigger  and for me it was i had to dance while i painted it was so exciting  except
  i even started painting dancers here for example is a flamenco dancer  except there was one problem  
 i didn 't know the dance form  so i started following them and i made some money sold my paintings and would rush off to france or spain and work with them  that 's pepe linares the renowned flamenco singer  
 but i had one problem  my paintings never danced 
 as much energy as i put into them while making them they never danced  so i decided i had this crazy
  at two in the morning  i called my friends  painted on their bodies  and had them dance in front of a painting and all of a sudden my paintings came alive  
 and then i was fortunate enough to actually perform this in california with velocity circus  
 and i sat like you guys there in the audience  and i saw my work come alive you know normally you
 work in isolation and you show at a gallery but here 
 the work was coming alive  and it had some other artists working with me the collaborative effort was fabulous 
 i said i 'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody i meet i started doing fashion this is a fashion show we held in london 
 the best collaboration of course is with children  they are ruthless  they are honest  but they 're full of energy
  this is a work a library i designed
 for the robin hood foundation  
 and i must say  i spent time in the bronx working with these kids  
 and in exchange for me working with them they taught me how to be cool  i don 't think i 've succeeded but they 've taught me they said stop saying sorry say my bad 
 then i said
  all this is good  but i want to paint like a real painter  american education is so expensive  
 i was in india  and i was walking down the streets and i saw a billboard painter  and these guys
 paint humongous paintings and they look really good  
 and i wondered how they did it from so close so one day i had the opportunity to meet one of these guys  and i said how do you paint like that
  it 's very easy i can teach you  but we 're leaving the city because billboard painters are a dying extinct
 bunch of artists because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them 
 i said  in exchange for education in how to paint i will support them and i started a company  
 and since then i 've been painting all over the place this is a painting i did of my wife in
  is another painting and in fact  i started painting on anything  and started sending them around town  
 since i mentioned my wife the most important collaboration has been with her netra netra and i met when she was eighteen 
 i must have been nineteen and a half then  
 and it was love at first sight i lived in india  she lived in america she 'd come every two months to visit me 
 and then i said i 'm the man  i 'm the man  and i have
  travel seven oceans  and i have to come and see you i did that twice and i went broke 
 so then i said nets what do i do she said why don 't you send me your paintings my dad knows a bunch of rich guys we 'll try and con them into buying it  
 and then 
 but it turned out after i sent the works to her that her dad 's friends 
 like most
 are geeks  i 'm joking no
 they were really big geeks and they didn 't know much about art  
 so netra was stuck with thirty paintings of mine
  so what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over
 the east coast trying to sell it she contacted anyone and
  everyone who was willing to buy my work 
 she made enough money she sold off the whole collection and made enough money to move me for four years with lawyers a company  everything and she became my manager 
 that 's us in new york  notice one thing 
 we 're equal here something happened along the line 
 but this brought me with netra managing
  my career it brought me a lot of success  i was really happy i thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar  i loved the attention
 this is all the press we got and we said  it 's time to celebrate  
 and i said that the best way to celebrate is to marry netra i said let 's get married and i said not just married let 's invite
  everyone who 's helped us all the people who bought our work and you won 't believe it we put together a list of seven thousand people who had made a difference
 a ridiculous list  
 but i was determined to bring them to india so a lot of them were in india 
 one hundred and fifty artists volunteered to help me with my wedding we had fashion designers  installation artists 
 models  we had makeup artists jewelry
  kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation and i had a special
 installation in tribute to my in laws i had the vegetable carvers work on that for me
 but all this excitement led to the press writing about us we were in the papers we 're still in the news three years later 
 but unfortunately something tragic happened right after 
  i love my mother and and i was told all of a sudden that she was going to die  and they said
 you have to say bye to her you have to do what you have to do  and i was devastated i had shows booked up for another year  i was on a on a high  and
 i couldn 't i could not my life was not exuberant i could not live this larger than life person  
 i started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind of course my work turned
 ugly  but
 another thing happened 
 i lost all my audiences  
 the bollywood stars who i would party with and and buy my work disappeared the collectors the friends the press everyone said nice 
 but thank you no thank you was more like it  but
 i wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut  because i was painting it from my gut
 if they wanted beauty i said  this is the beauty i 'm willing to give you it 's politicized of
 course none of them liked it my works also turned autobiographical 
 at this point something else happened a very very dear friend of mine
 came out of the closet  and in india at that time it was illegal to be gay  and it 's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay
  person  i was very upset i remember the time when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl that 's me there
 because she wanted a girl and she has only boys 
 anyway  i don 't know what my friends are going to say after this
  it 's a secret so after this 
 my works turned a little violent i talked about this masculinity that one need not perform  
 and i talked about the weakness of male sexuality  
 this time not only did my collectors disappear  the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to
 forbid me from showing it turned nasty and i 'm a bit of a
 i can 't deal with any threat this was a big threat  so i decided
 it was time to end and go back home  this time i said let 's try something different i need to be reborn again  
 and i thought the best way as most of you know who have children the best way to have a new lease on life is to have a child  i decided to have a child  
 and before i did that i quickly studied what can go wrong
 how can a family get dysfunctional  
 and rudra was born that 's my little son  
 and two magical things happened after he was born my mother miraculously recovered after a serious operation  
 and
 this man was elected president of this country you know i sat at home and i watched i teared up and i said that 's where i want to be so netra and i
 wound
  up our life closed up everything we had and we decided to move to new york  and this was just eight months ago  
 i moved back to new york my work has changed everything about my work has
 has become more whimsical  this one is called what the fuck was i thinking it talks about mental incest you know
  i may appear to be a very nice clean sweet boy  but i 'm not  i 'm capable of thinking anything  but i 'm very civil in my action i assure you 
 these are just different cartoons  
 and before i go i want to tell you a little story i was talking to mother and father this morning and my dad said i know you have so much you want to say but you have to talk about your work with children 
 so i said okay  
 i work with children all over the world
  and that 's an entirely different talk but
 i want to leave you with one story that really really inspired me i met belinda when she was sixteen  i was seventeen  
 i was in australia  and belinda
 had cancer  and i was told she 's not going to live very long they in fact told me
  three weeks 
 i walk into her room and there was a shy girl  and she was bald  and she was trying to hide her baldness  
 i whipped out my pen  and i started drawing on her head and i drew a crown for her 
 and then  we started talking  and we spent a lovely time i told her how i ended up in australia how i backpacked and who i conned and how i got a ticket and
 all the all the stories and i drew it out for her and then i
  and within a few days of her
 death they published a book for
 her and she used my cartoon on the cover  and she wrote a little note she said hey rags  thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world
