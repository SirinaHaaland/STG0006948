  a few years ago  i felt like i was stuck in a rut  
 so i decided to follow in the footsteps of the great american philosopher morgan spurlock and try something new for thirty days
  the idea is actually pretty simple think about something you 've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next thirty days  
 it turns out thirty days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit like watching the news from your life 
 there 's a few things i learned while doing these 30 day challenges  
 the first was instead of the months flying by 
  the time was much more memorable 
 this was part of a challenge i did to take a picture every day for a month and i remember exactly where i was and what i was doing that day  
 i also noticed that as i started to do more and harder 30 day challenges my self confidence grew  
 i went from desk dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work 
  even last year  i ended up hiking up mt kilimanjaro the highest mountain in africa  
 i would never have been that adventurous before i started my 30 day challenges  
 i also figured out that if you really want something badly enough you can do anything for thirty days  
 have you ever wanted to write a novel 
 every november  tens of thousands of people try to write their own
  scratch in thirty days  it turns out all you have to do is write one thousand six hundred and sixty seven words a day for a month  
 so i did by the way the secret is not to go to sleep until you 've written your words for the day 
 you might be sleep deprived but you 'll finish your novel  now is my book the next great american novel
  no i wrote it in a month it 's awful 
 laughter but for the rest of my life if i meet john hodgman at a ted party  i don 't have to say 
 i 'm a computer scientist no no if i want to i can say i 'm a novelist 
 so here 's one last thing i 'd like to mention i learned that when i made small
  changes things i could keep doing they were more likely to stick  
 there 's nothing wrong with big crazy challenges  in fact they 're a ton of fun  but they 're less likely to stick  
 when i gave up sugar for thirty days day thirty one looked like this 
 so here 's my question
  to you what are you waiting for i guarantee you the next thirty days are going to pass whether you like it or not 
 so why not think about something you have always wanted to try
 and give it a shot for the next thirty days
