  and we 're chefs  so when moto opened in two thousand and four people didn 't really know what to expect a lot of people thought that it was a japanese restaurant and maybe it was the name
  requests for japanese food which is really not what we did  and after about the ten thousandth request for a maki roll  we decided to give the people what they wanted  so this picture is an example of printed food and this was the first foray into what we like to call flavor transformation  
 so this is all the ingredients all the flavor of you know a standard maki roll printed onto a little piece of paper hc 
 so our diners started to get bored with this idea
  and we decided to give them the same course twice  
 so here we actually took an element from the maki roll and and took a picture of a dish and then basically served that picture with the dish  
 so this dish in particular is basically champagne with seafood the champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes a
 little bit of seafood and some crme fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish
 's not all just edible pictures  we decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar
 so in this case we have carrot cake  so we take a carrot cake put it in a blender  and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice  and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen 
 to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream i guess  and it comes off looking like
  around your plate so yeah 
 we 're transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for hc 
 and here 's something we have no reference to eat 
 this is a cigar  and basically it 's a cuban cigar made out of a cuban pork sandwich  
 so we take these spices that go into the pork shoulder  we fashion that into
  we take the sandwich and wrap it up in a collard green put an edible label that bears no similarity to a cohiba cigar label  
 and we put it in a dollar ninety nine ashtray and charge you about twenty bucks for it hc 
 delicious 
 br that 's not it though instead of making foods that look like things that you wouldn 't eat  we decided to make
 ingredients look like dishes that you know  so this is a plate of nachos the difference between our nachos and
  other guy 's nachos is that this is actually a dessert  
 so the chips are candied the ground beef is made from chocolate and the cheese is made from a shredded mango sorbet that gets shredded into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese 
 and after doing all of this 
 dematerialization and reconfiguring of this of
  we realized that it was pretty cool because as we served it we learned that the dish actually behaves
 like the real thing where the cheese begins to melt so when you 're looking at this thing in the dining room you have this sensation that this is actually a plate of nachos 
 and it 's not really until you begin tasting it that you realize this is a dessert  and it 's just kind of like a 
 so we had been creating all of these dishes out of a kitchen that was more like a mechanic 's
  than a kitchen and the next logical step for us was to install a state of the art laboratory 
 and that 's what we have here so we put this in the basement and we got really serious about food like serious experimentation br 
 one of the really cool things about the lab besides that we have a new science lab in the kitchen is that you know  with this new equipment
  all these different doors to creativity that we never knew were there began to open  and so the the experiments and the the food and the dishes that we created  they just kept going further and further out there hc 
 let 's talk about flavor transformation  and let 's actually make some cool stuff 
 you see a cow with its tongue hanging out what i see is a cow about to eat something delicious what is that cow eating 
 and why is it delicious  so the cow basically eats
  three basic things in their feed  corn  beets  and barley  
 and so what i do is i actually challenge my staff with these crazy wild ideas can we take what the cow eats remove the cow and then make some hamburgers out of that 
 and
 basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this br 
  's our chef de cuisine chris jones this is not the only guy that just flips out when we assign a ridiculous task  but
 a lot of these ideas  they 're hard to understand  they 're hard to just get automatically there 's a lot of research and
 a lot of failure  trial and error i guess more error that goes into each and every dish so we don 't always get it right and it it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people hc 
 so after about a day of chris and i staring at each other we
  came up with something that was pretty close to the hamburger patty  
 and as you can see it basically forms like hamburger meat this is made from three ingredients  beets  barley  corn  
 and so it actually cooks up like hamburger meat  looks and tastes like hamburger meat  and not only that but
 it 's basically removing the cow from the equation so replicating food taking it into that next level is where we 're going
 and it 's definitely the world 's first bleeding veggie burger
  which is a cool side effect  and a miracle berry if you 're not familiar with it is a natural ingredient  and it contains a special property it 's a glycoprotein called miraculin a
 naturally occurring thing it still freaks me out every time i eat it but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue
 so that
 primarily sour taste receptors so normally things that would taste very sour or tart  
 somehow begin to taste very sweet hc you 're about to eat a lemon and now it tastes like lemonade  let 's just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that we could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas  
 and we can replace it with
 all natural fresh fruit br so you see us
  here cutting up some watermelon the idea with this is that we 're going to eliminate
 tons of food miles  wasted energy and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna or any exotic
 produce or
 or item from a very far away place with local organic produce  so we have a
  so if miracle berries take sour things and turn them into sweet things we have this other pixie dust that we put on the watermelon  and it makes it go from sweet to savory  so after we do that we put it into a vacuum bag  
 add a little bit of seaweed some spices and we roll it and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna  so the key now is to make it
  and then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear 
 we really have something that looks tastes and behaves like like the real thing hc 
 so the key thing to remember here is we don 't really care what this tuna really is as long as it 's good for you and good for the environment it doesn 't matter  
 but where is this going how can we take this idea of tricking your tastebuds and leapfrog it into something that we can do today
 that could be a disruptive food technology  
 so here 's the next challenge i told the staff let 's just take a bunch of wild plants think of them as food ingredients  as long as they 're non poisonous to the human body go out around chicago 
  sidewalks take it  blend it cook it and then have everybody flavor trip on it at moto let 's charge them a boatload of cash for this and see what they think
 so you can imagine 
 a task like this this is another one of those assignments that the kitchen staff hated us for but we really had to almost relearn how to cook in general  
 because these are ingredients you know plant life that we 're one unfamiliar with and two we have no reference for how to cook these things because people don 't eat them 
  so we really had to think about new creative ways to flavor new ways to cook and to change change texture and that was the main issue with this challenge hc 
 so this is where we step
 into the future
 and we leapfrog ahead so developing nations and first world nations  imagine if you could take
 these wild plants and consume them food miles would basically turn into food feet
  this disruptive mentality of what food is would essentially open up the encyclopedia of what raw ingredients are even if we just swapped out say one of these for flour that would eliminate so much energy and so much waste 
 to give you a simple example here as to what we actually fed these customers there 's a bale of hay there and some crab apples 
 and basically we took hay and crab apples and made barbecue
 sauce out of those two ingredients people swore they were eating barbecue sauce  and this is free food
