  people returning to work after a career break  
 i call them relaunchers 
 these are people who have taken career breaks for elder care for childcare reasons  pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue
  closely related are career transitioners of all kinds veterans military spouses retirees coming out of retirement or repatriating expats 
 returning to work after a career break is hard because of a disconnect between the employers and the relaunchers 
 employers can view hiring people with a gap on their resume
 and individuals on career break can have doubts about their abilities to relaunch their careers especially if they 've been out for a long time 
 this disconnect is a problem that i 'm trying to help solve 
 now successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field this
  he 's a nuclear physicist in the uk who took a five year career break to be home with his five children 
 the singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work after long career breaks  
 and speaking of long career breaks this is mimi kahn 
 she 's a social worker in orange county california who returned to work in a social services
  career break that 's the longest career break that i 'm aware of supreme court justice sandra day o 'connor took a five year career break early in her career  
 and this is tracy shapiro who took a 13 year career break  
 tracy answered a call for essays by the today show from people who were trying to return to work but having a difficult time
  tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home 
 but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work  plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she loved working  
 tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we 've put in a good day in the job search 
 she was looking for a finance or accounting role  and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online
  and applying for jobs with no results  
 i met tracy in june of two thousand and eleven when the today show asked me if i could work with her to see if i could help her turn things around 
 the first thing i told tracy was she had to get out of the house  i told her she had to go public with her job search and tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work  
 i also told her
 you are going to have a lot of conversations that don 't go anywhere  expect that and don 't be discouraged by it 
 there will be a handful that ultimately lead to a job opportunity i 'll
 tell you what happened with tracy in a little bit but i want to share with you a discovery that i made when i was returning to work after my own career break of eleven years out of the full time workforce  and that is
  that people 's view of you is frozen in time
  what i mean by this is when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past the people with whom you worked or went to school 
 they are going to remember you as you were before your career break  and that 's even if your sense of self has diminished over time as happens with so many of us the farther
  removed we are from our professional identities  so for example you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this 
 this is me crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan or
 here i am in the kitchen  
 but those people from the past they don 't know about any of this 
 they only remember you as you were  and it 's a great confidence boost to be back in
  touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work 
 there 's one more thing i remember vividly from my own career break  and that was that i hardly kept up with the business news 
 my background is in finance and i hardly kept up with any news when i was home caring for my four
  i was afraid i 'd go into an interview and start talking about a company that didn 't exist anymore  so
 i had to resubscribe to the wall street journal and read it for a good six months cover to cover before i felt like i had a handle on what was going on in the business world again
  i believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce  and here 's why think about our life stage for those of us who took career
 for childcare reasons  we have fewer or no maternity leaves we did that already we have fewer spousal or partner job relocations we 're in a more settled time of life 
 we have great work experience we have a more mature perspective we 're not trying to find ourselves at an employer 's expense  plus we have an
  an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we 've been away from it for a while 
 on the flip side i speak with employers and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers 
 the first one is employers are worried that  relaunchers are technologically obsolete  
 now i can tell you having been technologically obsolete myself at one point that it 's a temporary
  i had done my financial analysis so long ago that i used lotus 
  know if anyone can even remember back that far but i had to relearn it on excel it actually wasn 't that hard a lot of the commands are the same  
 i found powerpoint much more challenging  but now i use powerpoint all the time  
 i tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software
  and if they 're not up to speed then it 's their responsibility to get there and they do 
 the second area of concern that employers have about  relaunchers is they 're worried that relaunchers don 't know what they want to do  
 i tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed
  or have not changed while they have been on career break that 's not the employer 's job it 's the relauncher 's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer
 where they can add the most value 
 back in two thousand and ten i started noticing something 
 i had been tracking return to work programs since two thousand and eight and in two thousand and ten i started noticing the use of a
  whether it was called an internship or not but an internship like experience as a way for professionals to return to work  
 i saw goldman sachs and sara lee start corporate reentry internship programs  
 i saw a returning engineer a nontraditional reentry candidate 
 apply for an
  internship program in the military  and then get a permanent job afterward  i saw two universities
 integrate internships into mid career executive education programs 
 so i wrote a report about what i was seeing  and it became this article for harvard business review called the 
 i have to thank the editors there for that title  and also for this artwork where you can see the 40 year old intern in the midst of all the college interns
 courtesy of fox business news they called the concept the 50 year old intern 
 so five of the biggest financial services companies have reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals and at this point  hundreds of people have
  these internships are paid and the people who move on to permanent roles are commanding competitive salaries  
 and now  seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the society of women engineers 
 now why are companies embracing the reentry internship
  because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual work sample instead of a series of interviews and the employer does 
  not have to make that permanent hiring decision until the internship period is over 
 think about how far we have come 
 before this most employers were not interested in engaging with relaunchers at all but now not only are programs being developed specifically with 
 relaunchers in mind  but you can 't even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your rsum 
  can solve this problem for relaunchers we can solve it for other career   transitioners too in fact an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program  
 and there 's no reason why there can 't be a retiree internship program  
 different pool
  so let me tell you what happened with tracy shapiro remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work well
 one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for tracy and it was an accounting job in a finance department  
 but it was a temp job 
 the company told her there was a possibility it could turn into something more but
 no guarantees this was in the fall of two thousand and eleven
  tracy loved this company and she loved the people and the office was less than ten minutes from her house  so even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full time role she decided to take her chances with this internship
 and hope for the best  
 well she ended up blowing away all of their expectations and the company not only made her a permanent offer at the beginning of two thousand and twelve
  but they made it even more interesting and challenging because they knew what tracy could handle 
 fast forward to two thousand and fifteen  tracy 's been promoted they 've paid for her to get her mba at night she 's even hired another relauncher to work for her 
 tracy 's temp job
 was a tryout just like an internship and it ended up being a win for both tracy
 and her employer 
 now  my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers  
 but in the meantime if you are returning to work after a career break don 't hesitate to suggest an internship or an
  to an employer that does not have a formal reentry internship program 
 be their first success story and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come thank you
