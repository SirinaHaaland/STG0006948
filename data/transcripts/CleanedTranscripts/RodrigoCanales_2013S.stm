  in december of two thousand and ten  
 the city of apatzingn in the coastal state of michoacn in mexico  awoke to gunfire 
 for two straight days  the city became an open battlefield
 between the federal forces
 and a well organized group  presumably from the local criminal organization la familia michoacana or the michoacn family 
 the citizens didn 't only experience incessant gunfire but also explosions
 and burning trucks used as barricades across the city so truly like a battlefield after
  these two days and during a particularly intense encounter it was presumed that the leader of la familia michoacana nazario moreno was killed 
 in response to this terrifying violence the mayor of apatzingn decided to call the citizens to a march for peace  the idea was
 to ask for a softer approach to criminal activity in the state and so the day of the scheduled procession thousands of people showed up
  as the mayor was preparing to deliver the speech starting the march his team noticed that while half of the participants
 were appropriately dressed in white  and bearing banners asking for peace  the other half was actually marching in support
 of the criminal organization and its 
 leader shocked  the mayor decided to step aside rather than participate or lead a procession that was ostensibly in support of organized crime
  and so his team stepped aside the two marches joined together  and they continued their
 path towards the state capital this story
 of horrific violence
 followed by a fumbled approach by federal and local authorities as they tried to engage civil society who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization
  metaphor for what 's happening in mexico today 
 where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least incomplete 
 if you decided to spend thirty minutes trying to figure out what 's going on with drug violence in mexico by say just researching online  
 the first thing you would find out is that while
  the laws state that all mexican citizens are equal 
 there are some that are more and there are some that are much less equal than others  
 because you will quickly find out that in the past six years anywhere between sixty and one hundred thousand people have lost their lives in drug related violence 
 to put these numbers in perspective this is eight times larger than the number of casualties
 in the iraq and afghanistan wars combined
  it 's also shockingly close to the number of people who have died in the syrian civil war  which is an active civil war this is happening just south of the border  
 now as you 're reading however you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly become numb to the numbers of deaths  because
 you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers of faceless  nameless dead people implicitly or
  there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade  and we infer this
 because they were either tortured or executed in a professional manner or most likely both
 and so clearly they were criminals because of the way they died 
 and so the narrative is that somehow these people got what they were deserved they were part of the bad guys
  and that creates some some form of comfort for a lot of people however
  while it 's easier to think of us  the citizens the police the army as the good guys  and them
  as the bad guys if you think about it the latter are only providing a service to the former whether we like it or not the
  is the largest market
 for illegal substances in the world accounting for more than half of global demand it shares thousands of miles of border with mexico
 that is its only route of access from the south 
 and so as the former dictator of mexico porfirio diaz used to say poor mexico so far from god
 and so close to the united states 
  estimates that there are fifty five million users of illegal drugs in the united states  
 using very very conservative assumptions this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between thirty and one hundred and fifty billion dollars  if we assume
 that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part which we know is false 
 that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between fifteen billion and sixty billion dollars 
 to put these numbers in perspective microsoft has yearly revenues
  of sixty billion dollars
  and it so happens that this is a product that because of its nature a business model to address this market requires you
 to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed  and the only way to do this 
  because it 's illegal is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors that are used to transport drugs  hence
 the violence if
 you look at a map of cartel influence and violence you will see that it almost perfectly aligns with the most efficient routes of transportation from the south to the north 
 the only thing that the cartels are doing is that they 're trying to protect their business 
 it 's not only a multi billion dollar market but it 's also a complex one for example the coca plant is is a fragile plant that can only
  grow in certain latitudes
 and so it means that a business model to address this market requires you to have decentralized international production 
 that by the way needs to have good quality control because people need a good high that is not going to kill them and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it
 and so that means they need to secure production
  and quality control in the south and you need to ensure that you have efficient and effective distribution channels
 in the markets where these drugs are consumed  i urge you but only a little bit because i don 't want to get you in trouble to just
 ask around and see how difficult it would be to get whatever drug you want wherever you want it whenever you want it anywhere in the u s 
 and some of you may be surprised to know that there are many dealers that offer a service where if you send them a text message
  guarantee delivery of the drug in thirty minutes or less think about this for a second think about the complexity
 of the distribution network that i just described  it 's very difficult to reconcile this
 with the image of faceless  ignorant goons that are just shooting each other 
 very difficult to reconcile now as a business professor and as any business
  professor would tell you an effective organization requires
 an integrated strategy that includes a good organizational structure good incentives a solid identity and good brand management 
 this leads me to the second thing that you would learn in your 30 minute exploration of drug violence in mexico  
 because you would quickly realize  and maybe be confused by the fact that there are three organizations that are constantly named
 in the articles you will
  hear about los zetas  the knights templar which is the new brand for the familia michoacana that i spoke about at the beginning and the sinaloa federation 
 you will read that los zetas is this assortment of sociopaths
 that terrify the cities that they enter and they silence the press  and this is somewhat true or mostly
  but this is the result
 of a very careful branding and business strategy 
 you see los zetas
 is not just this random assortment of individuals but was actually created by another criminal organization the gulf cartel that used to control the eastern corridor of mexico  
 when that corridor became contested they decided that they wanted to recruit a professional enforcement arm 
 so
 they recruited los zetas an entire unit
 of elite paratroopers from the mexican army  
 they were incredibly effective as enforcers for the gulf cartel so much so that at some point they decided to just take over the operations which
 is why i ask you to never keep tigers as pets 
 because they grow up  
 because the zetas organization was founded in treason they lost some of the linkages to the production
  distribution in the most profitable markets like cocaine  
 but what they did have  and this is again based on their military origin was a perfectly structured chain of command with a very clear hierarchy
 and a very clear promotion path
 that allowed them to supervise and operate across many many markets very effectively  which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do
  and so because they didn 't have access to the more profitable drug markets this pushed them and gave them the opportunity to diversify into other forms of crime 
 that includes kidnapping  prostitution local drug dealing
 and human trafficking including of migrants that go from the south to the u s so what they currently run
 is truly
 and quite literally
  a franchise business  
 they focus most of their recruiting on the army  
 and they very openly advertise for better salaries  better benefits  better promotion paths not to mention much better food than what the army can deliver 
 the way they operate is that when they arrive in a locality  they
  let people know that they are there and they go to the most powerful local gang and they say i offer you
 to be the local representative of the zeta brand if they agree and you don 't want to know what happens if they don 't
 they train them and they supervise them on how to run the most efficient criminal operation for that town in exchange for royalties 
 this kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear  and so los zetas
 carefully stage
 acts of violence that are spectacular in nature
 especially when they arrive first in a city  but again that 's just a brand strategy 
 i 'm not saying they 're not violent  but what i am saying is that even though you will read that they are the most violent of all when you count when
 you do the body count they 're actually all the same
  in contrast to them the knights templar that arose in michoacn emerged in reaction to the incursion of the zetas into the state of 
 is a geographically strategic state because it has one of the largest ports in mexico and it has very direct routes to the center of mexico which then gives you direct access to the u s 
 the knights templar realized very quickly that they couldn 't face the zetas on violence alone  and so they developed a strategy as a
  social enterprise 
 they brand themselves as representative of and protecting of the citizens of michoacn against organized crime 
 their brand of social enterprise means that they require a lot of civic engagement so they invest heavily in providing local services 
 like dealing with home violence 
 going after petty criminals treating addicts
 and keeping drugs out of the local markets where they are 
 and of course  protecting people from from other criminal organizations now they kill a lot of people too  but
 when they kill them they provide very careful narratives and descriptions for why they did them through
  and billboards that explain that the people who were killed were killed because they represented a threat not to us as an organization of course but to you as citizens  
 and so we 're actually here to protect you 
 they as social enterprises do
 have created a moral and ethical code that they advertise around and they have very strict recruiting practices  
 and here you have the types of explanations that they provide
 for some of their actions they have
  actually retained access to the profitable drug trade 
 but the way they do it is because they control all of michoacn and they control the port of lzaro crdenas they leverage that to for example trade
 copper from michoacn that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from china which is a
 critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the sinaloa federation
 that place their products in the  u s 
 finally the sinaloa federation when you read about them you will often read about them with an undertone of reverence and admiration 
 because they are the most integrated and the largest of all the mexican organizations and many people argue the world  
 they started as just sort of a transport organization that specialized in smuggling between the u s and the
  mexican borders  but now they have grown into a truly integrated
 multinational that has partnerships in production in the south and partnerships in global distribution
 across the planet  they have cultivated a brand of professionalism business acumen
 and innovation  they have designed new drug products and new drug processes they have
 that go across the border  and you can see that these are not the shawshank redemption types they have invented 
 and boats that are not detected by radar  they have invented drones to transport drugs  catapults 
 you name it one of the leaders of the sinaloa federation
 actually made it to
 the forbes list [ # seven hundred and one joaquin guzman
 like any multinational would  they have specialized and focused only in the most profitable part of the business which is high margin drugs like cocaine  heroine  methamphetamines 
 like any traditional latin american multinational would the way they control their operations is through family ties  when they
  entering a new market they send  a family member to supervise it or if they 're partnering with a new organization they create a family tie  either through marriages or other types
 of ties  like any other multinational would they protect their brand
 by outsourcing the more questionable parts of the business model like for example when they have to engage in violence against other criminal organizations  
 they recruit gangs and other smaller players to do the dirty work for them and they try to
  separate their operations and their violence and be very discrete about this to further
 strengthen their brand they actually have professional p r firms
 that shape how the press talks about them  they have professional videographers on staff  they have incredibly productive ties
 with the security organizations on both sides
 of the border  
 and so
  differences aside what these three organizations share
 is on the one hand a very clear understanding
 that institutions cannot be imposed from the top  but rather they are built from the bottom up
 one interaction at a time  they have created extremely coherent structures that they use to show the inconsistencies in government policies
 and so what i want you to remember from this talk are three things  the first one
 is that drug violence is actually the result
 of a huge market demand
 and an institutional setup that forces the servicing of this market to necessitate violence to guarantee
 delivery routes the
  second thing i want you to remember is that these are sophisticated coherent organizations
 that are business organizations  and analyzing them and treating them as such is probably a much more useful approach the third thing i want you to remember
 is that even though we 're more comfortable with this idea of them a set of bad guys separated from us we are actually accomplices to them
  either through our direct consumption
 or through our acceptance of the inconsistency between our policies of prohibition and our actual behavior
 of tolerance or even encouragement of consumption 
 these organizations service recruit
  operate within our communities so necessarily they are much more integrated within them
 than we are comfortable acknowledging  and so
 to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have we see that the nature of this phenomenon
 guarantees that they will the question is whether we are willing to continue
 our support of a failed strategy
 based on our stubborn
 blissful voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young  thank you
