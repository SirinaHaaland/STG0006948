  i have a very difficult task  i 'm a spectroscopist 
 i have to talk about astronomy without showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies etc 
 because my job is spectroscopy  i never deal with images
 spectroscopy is actually something which can
 change this world 
 spectroscopy can probably answer the question is there anybody out there 
 are we alone seti  it 's not very fun to do spectroscopy one of my colleagues in bulgaria nevena markova spent about twenty
  just dedicated to the subject can you imagine day and night  thinking observing the same star for twenty years is incredible but we are crazy we do these things 
 and
 i 'm not that far  i spent about eight months working on these profiles  
 because i 've noticed a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars and i thought
 maybe there is lithium 6 in this star  which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet  
 because apparently you can 't have this fragile isotope of lithium 6
 in the atmospheres of sun like stars  but you have it in planets and asteroids so if you
 isotope in the spectrum of the star  so i invested
 more than eight months just studying the profile of this star 
 and actually it 's amazing because i got phone calls from many reporters asking have you actually seen the planet going into a star 
 because they thought that if you are having a telescope you are an
 astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope and
 you might have seen the planet going into a star and i was saying no excuse me what i see is this one 
 it 's just incredible because nobody understood really 
 i bet that there were very few people who really understood what i 'm talking about because this is the indication that the planet went into the star
  because they actually said
 that you can get any color you like
 in a spectrum  and all you need is time and money to make your spectrograph this is the
 number one high resolution most precise spectrograph on this planet called harps which is actually
  used to detect extrasolar planets and sound waves in the atmospheres of stars  how we get spectra  i 'm sure most of you
 know from school physics that it 's basically splitting a white light
 into colors  and if you have a liquid
 hot
  it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum a hot gas is producing emission lines only 
 no continuum  and if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source  
 you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines 
 which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter which is absorbing
  exactly at those frequencies now what we can do with the spectra 
 we can actually study line of sight velocities of cosmic objects  
 and we can also study chemical composition and physical parameters of stars galaxies nebulae 
 a star is the most simple object in the core  we have thermonuclear reactions going on 
 creating chemical elements
  and we have a cool atmosphere  it 's cool for me cool in my terms is
 three or four or five thousand degrees my colleagues in infra red astronomy call minus two hundred kelvin is cool for them but you know
 everything is relative so for me five thousand degrees is pretty cool 
 this is the spectrum of the sun twenty four thousand spectral lines  and about fifteen percent of these lines is not yet
  identified it is amazing so we are in the 21st century  and we still cannot properly
 understand the spectrum of the sun  sometimes we have to deal with
 just one tiny weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere  for instance you see the spectral line of the gold
 is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the sun  and we use this weak
  feature to measure the
 composition of gold in the atmosphere of the sun  and now this is a work in progress we have been dealing with a similarly
 very weak feature which belongs to osmium it 's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear
 explosions of supernovae it 's the only place where you can produce actually osmium just comparing
 composition of osmium in one of the planet host stars  
 we want to understand why there is so much of this element perhaps we even think that maybe supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars it
 can be an indication 
 the other day my colleague from berkeley  gibor basri emailed me a very interesting spectrum asking
  this and i couldn 't sleep  next
 two weeks 
 when i saw the huge amount of oxygen and other elements in the spectrum of the stars i knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy 
 it was incredible the only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system  which polluted the atmosphere of this star
  and later a black hole was formed
 in a binary system  which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses this was considered as first evidence that actually black holes
 come from supernovae explosions my colleagues comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars
  actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy it 's amazing that you can go so far
 simply studying the chemical composition of stars  they actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien it comes from a different galaxy 
 there is interaction of galaxies we know this and sometimes they just capture stars 
 you 've heard about solar flares  we were very surprised to
  discover a super flare 
 a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the sun 
 in one of the binary stars in our galaxy called fh leo  
 we discovered the super flare  and later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything
  and we found that everything is normal 
 these stars are normal like the sun  age everything was normal  so this is a mystery it 's one of the mysteries we still have super flares  
 and there are six or seven similar cases
 reported in the literature  
 now to go ahead with this  we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe it 's very complicated i don 't really want you to
 try to understand what is here
 it 's to show you how complicated is the whole story of the
 production of chemical elements you have two channels the massive stars and low mass stars producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe  
 and doing this for fourteen billion years  we end up with this picture which is a very important
 graph  showing relative abundances of chemical elements in
  interstellar medium  
 so which means that it 's really impossible to find an object where you find about ten times more sulfur than silicon 
 five times more calcium than oxygen it 's just impossible  and if you find one i will say that this is something related to seti
  because naturally you can 't do
  doppler effect is something very important from fundamental physics and this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source 
 the doppler effect is used to discover extrasolar planets 
 the precision which we need to discover a jupiter like planet
 around a sun like star is something like twenty eight point four meters per second  and we need nine centimeters per second to detect
  this can be done with the future spectrographs i myself  
 i 'm actually involved in the team which is developing a codex high resolution future generation spectrograph for the forty two meter  e elt
 telescope and this is going to be an instrument to detect earth like planets
  is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves
 in the atmospheres of stars  this is the sound of an alpha cen 
 we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of sun like stars  those waves have frequencies in
 infrasound domain the sound actually nobody knows domain coming back to the most
  is there anybody out there this is closely related to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets  
 connection between life and radioactive nuclei
 is straightforward no life without tectonic activity without volcanic activity  
 and we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of
  and potassium 
 how to measure if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small  
 so those planets are tectonically dead there cannot be life 
 if there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium 
 probably  again there would be no life because can you imagine everything boiling it 's too much energy on a planet  
 now we have been measuring abundance of thorium in one of the stars with
  extrasolar planets  it 's exactly the same game a very tiny feature 
 we are actually trying to measure this profile and to detect thorium  it 's very tough  it 's very tough  and you have to first you have to convince yourself 
 then you have to convince your colleagues and then you have to convince the whole world
 that you have actually detected something like this
 in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in one hundred
  parsec away from here it 's really difficult but if you want to know about a life on
 extrasolar planets you have to do this job because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have in those systems 
 the one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals if you receive something interesting
  well that 's what seti does actually what seti has been doing for many years  i think the most promising way
 is to go for biomarkers 
 you can see the spectrum of the earth this earthshine spectrum  
 and that is a very clear signal the slope which is coming which we call a red edge is a
  we can detect vegetation from a spectrum  now imagine doing this test for other planets  
 now very recently very recently i 'm talking about last six seven eight months 
 water  methane 
 carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system  it 's amazing
  so this is the power of spectroscopy you can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets
 far far far from solar system  we have to detect oxygen or ozone to make sure that we have all necessary conditions
 to have life
  cosmic miracles are something which can be related to seti  
 now imagine an object amazing object or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say look we give up physics doesn 't work 
 so it 's something which you can always refer to seti and say well somebody must be doing this  somehow 
 and
 with the known physics etc  it 's something actually which has been pointed out by frank drake many years ago and shklovsky
 if you see in the spectrum of a planet host star  if you see strange chemical elements
  it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it they want to actually
 signal their presence
 through these spectral lines in the spectrum of a star
  can be different ways doing this one is for instance technetium
 is a radioactive element with a decay time of four point two million years 
 if you suddenly observe technetium in a sun like star  you can be sure that somebody has put this
 element in the atmosphere because in a natural way it is impossible to do this now we are reviewing the spectra of about three hundred
 stars with extrasolar planets
 and we are doing this job since two thousand
 and it 's a very heavy project  we have been working very hard  and we have some interesting cases 
 candidates so on things which we can 't really explain and
 i hope in the near
  is the spectrum of
