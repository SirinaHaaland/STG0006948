  i was raised by lesbians in the mountains and i sort of came like a forest gnome to new york city a while back really messed with my head but i
 'll get into that later i
 i 'll start with
 when i was eight years old i took a wood box 
 and i buried a dollar bill a pen and a fork inside this box in colorado  
 and i thought some strange humanoids or aliens in five hundred years would find this box
 and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas  maybe how we ate our spaghetti  i really didn 't know  
 anyway this is kind of funny because here i am  thirty years later  and i 'm still making boxes
  now  at some point i was in hawaii i like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff and i was making a collage for my ma  and i took
 a dictionary and i ripped it up and i made it into a sort of agnes martin grid  and i poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck now she 's afraid of bees and she 's allergic to them so i poured more resin on the canvas thinking i could hide it or something  
 instead the opposite
  happened  it sort of created a magnification like a magnifying glass on the dictionary text
 so what did i do i built more boxes  
 this time  i started putting electronics  frogs 
 strange bottles i 'd find in the street anything i could find because i was always finding things my whole life and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects  
 so i started
 drawing around the objects and i realized
 holy moly i can draw in space i can make free floating lines  like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene so i took the objects out  and i created my own taxonomy of invented specimens  first botanical
 which you can kind of get a sense of then i made some weird insects and creatures
  i was just drawing on the layers of resin  and it was cool because i was actually starting to have shows and stuff 
 i was making some money i could take my girlfriend for dinner and like go to sizzler it was some good shit man at
 some point
 i got up to the human form life size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers  this was great except for one thing 
 i was going to die 
 i didn 't know what to do because the resin was going to kill me
 and i went to bed every night thinking about it so i tried using glass  
 i started drawing on the layers of glass almost like if you drew on a window  then you put another window  and another window  and you had all these windows together that made a  three dimensional composition 
 and this really worked because i could stop using the resin 
 so i did this for years
  it 's kind of ahead of its time they say  so the triptych i 'll walk you through this piece it weighs twenty four thousand pounds  it 's eighteen
  that 's the blood fountain 
 to
 the left you have jesus and the locusts there 's a cave where all these animal headed creatures travel between two worlds they go from the representational world to this 
  hiding  this is where the animal headed creatures are by the lighthouse and they 're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean
  is made up of
 thousands of elements  this is a bird god tied up to a battleship 
 billy graham is in the ocean  the horizon from the oil spill waldo osama bin laden 's shelter
 there 's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look really hard in the ocean anyway this is a lady creature she 's coming out of the ocean
  and she 's spitting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand her hands are like scales and she
 has the mythological reference of the earth and cosmos in balance 
 so that 's one side of the triptych it 's a little narrative thing that 's her hand that she 's spitting into 
 and then when you go to the other side she has like a trunk like a bird 's beak and she 's spitting clouds out of her trunk  then she has an
  on fire from the back of the volcano i don 't know why that happened 
 that happens
 you know her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball made out of one thousand nine hundred and eighty six terrorist cards have you guys seen those they were made in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty 's they 're like baseball cards of terrorists way ahead of their time
  two projects one 's called psychogeographies 
 it 's about a six year project to make one hundred of these humans each one is an archive of our culture through our ripped up media and matter whether it 's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines 
 but each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human and they travel in groups of twenty four or twelve
  like cells they come together they divide and you kind of walk through them it 's taking me years each one is basically a 
 microscope slide with a human stuck inside 
 this one has a little cave in his chest 
 that 's his head there 's the chest you can kind of see the beginning i 'm going to go down the body for you  there 's a waterfall coming out
 of his chest 
  take you quickly through these works because i can 't explain them for too long there are the layers you can kind of see it
 that 's a body getting split in half this one has two heads and it 's communicating between the two heads 
 you can see the pills coming out going into one head from this weird statue there 's a
  little forest scene inside the chest cavity can you see that anyway this talk 's all about these boxes like the boxes we 're in 
 this box we 're in the solar system is a box this brings you to my latest box it 's
 a brick box it 's called pioneer works inside
 of this box is a physicist a
 neuroscientist a painter a musician a writer a radio station a museum  a school
  a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world  a garden 
 we shake this box up and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles  
 and i think that 's the way you change the world
 you redefine your insides and the box that you 're living in  and you come together to realize that we 're all in this together that this delusion of difference this idea of countries
 of borders of religion
 doesn 't work  
 we 're all really made up of the same stuff in the same box and if we don 't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely we 're all going to die real soon  
 thank you very much
