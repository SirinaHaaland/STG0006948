  very strange for me because im not used to doing this i usually stand on the other side of the light and now i 'm feeling the pressure i put other people into
  and it 's hard
  really painted a very good background as to
 the impulse behind my work and what drives me and my sense of of loss and trying to find
 the answer to the big questions  but this for me i mean coming here to do this feels
  sculptor that i like very much  giacometti who after
 many years of living in france and learning  you know  studying and
 working he returned home and he was asked what did you produce what have you
 done with so many years of being away and he sort of he showed a handful of figurines and
 obviously they were is this what you spent years doing and we expected
 huge
 masterpieces
 what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a mans life search 
 thought everything just
  in a reduced small version in a way i feel like that i feel like im coming home to
 talk about what ive been away doing for for twenty years  and i will start with a
 brief taster of what ive been about a handful of films nothing much two feature films and a handful of short films
  mum and dad dumped me and fucked off back to nigeria
  you is a waste of time marcus
  like me not getting a break in life marcus so what solutions do you offer  i mean the job of a poet is
  a sure sign of his inability to express himself
  can you not shut up now you talk straight to me
  do you think about your movie d1 my movies they are ok  fine they are better than making documentaries no one ever sees
  trying to capture what cinema is for me and where i 'm coming from in terms of cinema  the first piece  was 
 really there 's a young woman talking about nigeria that she has a feeling she 'll be happy there
  the sentiments of someone that 's been away from home and that was something that i went through you know and i 'm still going through i 've not been home for quite a while for about five years now i 've been away
 twenty years in total 
 and so its its really it 's really
 how suddenly you know  this was made in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven which is the time of abacha the military
  for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is 
 how and it 's sort of 
 perhaps romantic but i think  i think beautiful because you you just need something to hold on to especially in a society where you feel
  which takes us to the next piece where the young man talks about lack of opportunity  living as a as a black person in europe
  the glass ceiling that we all know about that we all talk about 
 and his reality  again this was my this was me talking about this was again the time of multiculturalism in in the united kingdom  and there was this buzzword and it
  trying to say what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people and what what would a child
 what does a child like jamie the young boy think i mean with all this anger that 's
 built up inside of him  what happens with that what of course happens with that is violence  which we see when
 we talk about the ghettos and we talk about  you know
  and manifests itself as riots  like the one in france two years ago where i live which shocked everybody because everyone thought oh well france is a liberal society but
 i lived in england for eighteen years i 've lived in france for about four and i feel actually thrown back twenty years living in france
  and then the third piece  the third piece for me is the question what is cinema to you what do you do with cinema there
 's a young director hollywood director with his friends fellow filmmakers
 talking about what cinema means i suppose that will take me to
  my last piece what cinema means for me  my life started as a
 i started life in one thousand nine hundred and sixty six a few months before the biafran which lasted for three years and it was three years of war so
 that whole thing that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece
  to school with your brother
 this
  injection made us not to have mind
  of rufus you are ezra the coward hes not taking care of his troops troop 
  the diamonds end up in his pocket
  help of others that this commission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war more than
  begin a healing process and finally to as an act of closure to a terrible period in this countrys history the beginning of hope
  like to remind you youre not on
 trial here for any crimes you committed e we were fighting for our freedom 
 if killing in a war is a crime then you have to charge every soldier
  the world war is a crime yes  but i did not start it you too are a retired general not so cc yes 
 correct e so you too must stand trial then 
 our government was corrupt lack of education
 was their way to control power  if i may ask do you pay for school in your country
 you are richer than us but we pay for school 
 your country talks about democracy but you support corrupt governments
 like my own why because you want our diamond 
  to say that my point really here is that while were making all these huge advancements
 for me you know i think we should
 africa should move forward but we should remember so we do not go back here again thank you emeka okafor 
 thank you newton 
 one of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched
 is this sense of
 the psychological trauma
 of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers  and
 considering where you are coming from and when we consider the extent to which its not
 taken as seriously as it should be what would you have to say about that na in the process
  of my research i actually spent a spent a bit of time in sierra leone researching this  and i remember i met a lot of
 child soldiers   ex combatants as they
 like to be called i met psychosocial
 psychosocial workers
  the flight back on my last trip i remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself
 if any kid in the west in the western world went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through
  they will be
 in therapy for the rest of their natural lives
  so for me the thought that we have all these children its a generation we have a whole generation of children who have
 who have been put through so so much psychological psychological trauma or damage and africa has to live with that but im just saying to factor
  that in factor that in with all this great advancement all this pronouncement of great achievement 
 thats really my thinking eo well we thank you again for coming to the ted stage that was a very moving piece
