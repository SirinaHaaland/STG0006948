  i wrote this poem after hearing a
 pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television i 'm really getting into the internet lately i just wish it were more organized so
 if i controlled the internet
 you could auction your broken heart on ebay
 take the money go to amazon buy a phonebook for a country you 've never been to call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language
 if i were in charge of the internet you could mapquest your lover 's mood swings
  hang a left at cranky right at preoccupied u turn on silent treatment all the way back to tongue kissing and good love and you could navigate and understand every 
 emotional intersection some days i 'm as shallow as a baking pan but i still stretch miles in all directions if i owned the internet napster
  com would be one big website
 that way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you 're really just chatting with your pals heck if i ran the web
 you could email dead people
 they would not email you back
 but you 'd get an automated reply
 their name in your inbox it 's all you wanted anyway and a message saying hey
 it 's me i miss you
 listen you 'll see being dead is
 dandy now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy if i designed the internet childhood com would be a loop
 of a boy in an orchard with a ski pole for a sword
  trashcan lid for a shield shouting i am the emperor of oranges i am the emperor of oranges i am the emperor of oranges now follow me ok grandma com would be a recipe for 
 biscuits and spit bath instructions one two three that links with hotdiggitydog com that is my grandfather they take you to gruff ex cop on his fourth marriage dad he forms an attachment to kind of ditzy 
  but still sends ginger snaps for christmas mom who downloads the boy in the orchard the emperor of oranges who grows up to be
  who usually goes too far so if i were emperor of the internet i guess i 'd still be mortal huh
 but at that point i would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis so i would outlaw 
  spam on my first day in office i wouldn 't need it i 'd be like some kind of internet genius and me i 'd like
  and maybe just like that pop i 'd go wireless
 huh maybe google would hire this i could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the world wide web is as wise
 as wild and as organized as i think a modern day miracle
 oracle can get but ooh eee you want to bet just how whack and un pc your mac or pc is going to be when i 'm rocking hot shit hot shot god
  god net i guess it 's just like life it is not a question of if you can it 's do ya
 we can interfere with the interface we can make you 've got hallelujah the national anthem of cyberspace every lucky time we log on you don 't say a prayer you don 't write a psalm you don 't chant an om
 you send one blessed email to
 whoever you 're thinking of at dah da la dat da dah da
