  when i was eleven  seeing some of my friends leaving the school because their parents could not afford textbooks
 made me angry  
 when i was twenty seven hearing the plight of a desperate
 slave father
 whose daughter was about to be sold to a brothel
 made me angry  
 at the age of fifty
 the street in a pool of blood  along with my own son 
 made me angry  
 dear friends for centuries
 we were taught anger is bad our parents  teachers priests everyone taught us
 how to control and suppress our anger
 but i ask why 
 why can 't we convert our anger for the larger good of society  
 why can 't we use our anger to challenge and change the evils of the world 
 that i tried to do
  friends  
 most of the brightest ideas came to my mind out of anger  like when i was
 it has given birth to a new idea  but i will come to that later on let me begin with
 the story of how i got a name for myself  
 i had been a big admirer of mahatma gandhi since my childhood
  and lead india 's freedom movement  but more importantly he taught us
 how to treat the most
 vulnerable sections the most deprived people with dignity and respect 
 and so when
 india was celebrating mahatma gandhi 's birth centenary in
 and sixty nine at that time i was fifteen
 an idea came to my mind 
 why can 't we celebrate it differently  i knew as perhaps
 many of you might know that in india a large number of people are born in the lowest
 segment of caste 
 and they are treated as untouchables  these are the people forget about
 allowing them to go to the temples  they cannot even go into the houses and shops
 of high caste people  so i
 i was very impressed with the leaders of my
  speaking very highly against the caste system and untouchability and talking of gandhian ideals  
 so inspired by that i thought let us set an example by inviting these people
 to eat food cooked and served by the untouchable community  i went to
 some
  it 's not possible it never happened 
 i said look at these leaders  they are so great  they are against untouchability they will come if nobody comes we can set an example 
 these people thought that
  they were convinced my friends and i took our bicycles and invited
 political leaders  and i was so thrilled  rather empowered
 to see that each one of them agreed to come  
 i thought great idea we can set an example we can bring about change in the society
 the day has come  all these
 untouchables  three women and two men  they
 agreed to come  i could recall that
 they had used the best of their clothes  they brought new utensils
 they had taken baths hundreds of times because it was unthinkable for them to do  it was the moment of change 
 they gathered food was cooked it was seven o 'clock 
 by eight o 'clock we kept on waiting 
 because it 's not very uncommon that the leaders become late for an hour or so
  so after eight o 'clock  we took our bicycles and went to these leaders ' homes just to remind them 
 one of the leader 's wives
 told me sorry  he is having some headache perhaps he cannot come 
 i went to another leader and his wife told
 he will definitely join so i thought that
 the dinner will take place  though not at that large a scale  
 i went back to the venue which was
 a newly built mahatma gandhi park
 it was ten o 'clock  none of the
  leaders showed up that made me angry 
 i was standing  leaning against mahatma gandhi 's statue  
 i was emotionally drained  rather exhausted
  sat down where the food was lying  
 i kept my emotions on hold  
 but then when i took the first bite  i broke down in tears and suddenly i felt
 a hand
  and it was the healing motherly touch
 of an untouchable woman and she told me kailash why are you crying 
 you have done your bit  you have eaten the food cooked by untouchables which has never happened in our memory
  she was right  
 i came back home a little after midnight  
 shocked to see that several high caste elderly people were sitting in my courtyard  
 i saw my mother and elderly women were crying and they were pleading
 to these elderly people because they had threatened to outcaste my whole family
 and you know outcasting the family is the biggest social punishment one can think of 
 somehow they agreed to punish only me  
 and the punishment was purification that means i had to go six hundred miles away from my hometown
  river ganges to take a holy dip  
 and after that i should organize a feast for priests one hundred and one priests wash their feet and drink that water 
 it was total nonsense  and i refused to accept that punishment 
 how did they punish me  i was barred from entering into my own kitchen
 and my own dining room my utensils were separated
  but the night when i was angry  
 they wanted to outcaste me  
 but i decided to outcaste the entire caste system 
 and that was possible because
 the beginning would have been to change the family name or surname
  in india most of the family names are caste names  so i decided to drop my name  
 and then  later on i gave a new name to myself
 friends  maybe one of you can tell me what
 was i doing before becoming a children 's rights activist  does anybody know  
 no  
 i was an engineer an electrical engineer and then i learned
 how
 the energy
  of burning fire  coal 
 the nuclear blast inside the chambers  raging river currents
 fierce winds 
 could be converted into the light and lives of millions  
 i also learned how the most uncontrollable form of energy
  could be harnessed for good and making society better  so
 i 'll come back to
 the story of when i was caught in the prison  i was very happy freeing a dozen children from slavery
  handing them over to their parents  i cannot explain my joy when i free a child  
 i was so happy  
 but when i was waiting for my train to come back to my hometown delhi  
 i saw that dozens of children were arriving  they were being trafficked by someone  i stopped them  those people  
  i complained to the police  so the policemen instead of helping me  they threw me in this small  tiny
 shell  like an animal  
 and that was the night of anger when one of the brightest and biggest ideas was born  
 i thought that if i keep on freeing ten children and fifty more will join  
 that 's not done and i believed in the power of consumers and let me tell you
  that this was the first time
 when a campaign was launched by me or anywhere in the world 
 to educate and sensitize the consumers
 to create a demand for
  rugs in europe and america we have been successful 
  it has resulted
 in a fall
 in child labor in south asian countries by eighty percent 
 not only that 
 but this first ever consumer 's power or consumer 's campaign
 has grown in other countries and other industries  maybe chocolate maybe apparel maybe shoes it has gone beyond
 my anger at the age of eleven when i realized how important education is for every child 
 i got an idea to collect used books
 and help the poorest children i created a book bank at the at the age of
  but i did not stop later on i cofounded the
 world 's single largest civil society campaign for education that is the global campaign for education 
 that has helped in changing
 the whole thinking towards education from the charity mode to the human rights mode  and that has concretely helped the reduction of
  my anger at the age of twenty seven to free that girl who was about to be sold to a brothel 
 has given me an idea to
 go for a new strategy of raid and rescue freeing children from slavery
 and i am
 so lucky and proud to say that it is not one or ten or twenty  
 but my colleagues and i have been able to physically liberate eighty three thousand child slaves and hand them over back to their families and mothers
 i knew that we needed global policies
  organized the worldwide marches against child labor and that has also resulted in
 a new international convention
 to protect the children who are in the worst forms  
 and the concrete result was that the number of child laborers globally has gone down
  by one third in the last fifteen years
  anger is an energy and the law of nature is that energy can never be created and never be vanished 
 can never be destroyed  so why can 't
 the energy of anger
  be translated and harnessed to create a better and beautiful world a more just and equitable
  world anger is within each one of you and
 i will share a secret for a few seconds that if
 we are confined in the narrow shells of egos  and the circles of
  then the anger will turn out to be hatred 
 violence  revenge destruction  
 but if we are able to break the circles then the same anger could
 turn into a great power  we can break the circles by using our inherent compassion
 and connect with the world through compassion to make this world better that same anger could be transformed into it
 so dear friends sisters and brothers  again as a nobel laureate  i am urging you to become angry  
 i am urging you to become angry  
 and the angriest among us is the one
  inspiration to others who or what inspires you and why
 chris let me tell you and that is the truth each time
 when i free a child the child who has lost all his hope that he will ever come back to his mother the first
 smile of freedom  and the mother who has lost all hope that the son or daughter can ever come back and sit in her lap
 become so emotional and the first tear of joy rolls down on her cheek  
 i see the glimpse of god in it this is my biggest inspiration and i am so lucky that not once as i said before but thousands of times 
 i have been able to witness my god in the faces of those children and they are my biggest inspirations  thank you
