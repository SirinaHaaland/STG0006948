  i was excited to be a part of the dream theme  and then i found out i 'm leading off the nightmare section of it 
 laughter and certainly there are things about the climate crisis that qualify and i have some
  bad news but i have a lot more good news i 'm going to propose three questions
 and the answer to the first one necessarily involves a little bad news  but hang on because the answers to the second and third questions really are very positive  
 so the first
  do we really have to change and of course  the
 apollo mission  among other things changed
 the environmental movement really launched the modern environmental movement eighteen months after this earthrise picture
 was first seen on earth the first earth day was
 organized and we learned a lot about ourselves looking back at our planet from space and
 one of the things that we learned confirmed what the
  scientists have long told us one of the most
 essential facts about the climate crisis has to do with the sky as this picture illustrates 
 the sky is not the vast and limitless expanse that appears when we look up from the ground it is a very thin shell
 of atmosphere surrounding the planet  that right now is the open sewer for our industrial
  civilization as it 's currently organized  we are spewing one hundred and ten million tons of heat trapping global
 warming pollution into it every twenty four hours  free of charge go ahead  
 and there are many sources of the greenhouse gases i 'm certainly not going to go through them all i 'm going to focus on the main one but agriculture is involved diet is involved population is involved management
  of forests  transportation the oceans the melting of the permafrost  
 but i 'm going to focus on the heart of the problem which is the fact that we still rely on dirty carbon based fuels for eighty five percent of all the energy 
 that our world burns every year and you can see from this
  accumulated amount of man made global warming pollution that is up in the atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy
 as would be released by four hundred thousand
  atomic bombs exploding every twenty four hours three hundred and sixty five days a year 
 fact checked over and over again conservative  it 's the truth now it 's a big planet but
  that is a lot of energy particularly when you multiply it four hundred thousand times per day 
 and all that extra heat energy is heating up the atmosphere the whole earth system  let 's look at the atmosphere  
 this is a depiction of what we used to think of as the normal
  the blue are cooler than average days  the red are warmer than average days  but the entire curve has moved to the right in the 
 'll see in the lower right hand corner the appearance of statistically significant numbers of extremely hot days in the 90s the curve shifted further
  and in the last ten years 
 you see the extremely hot days are now more numerous than the cooler than average days in fact they are one hundred and fifty times more common
 on the surface of the earth than they were just thirty years ago  so
 we 're having record breaking temperatures fourteen of the fifteen of the hottest years ever measured with instruments have been in this young century the
  month in a row warmer than the 20th century average and for the first time not only the warmest january  but for the first time 
 it was more than two degrees fahrenheit warmer than the
 average these higher temperatures are having an effect on animals plants people ecosystems
  but on a global basis 
  percent of all the extra heat energy is trapped in the oceans  
 and the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths deep mid ocean the first few hundred
 meters  and this too is accelerating  it goes back more than a century and more than half of the increase has been in the last nineteen years  this has consequences
  get stronger super typhoon haiyan went over areas of the pacific five and a half degrees fahrenheit warmer than normal before it slammed into tacloban as the most destructive 
 storm ever to make landfall pope francis who has made such a difference to this whole issue  visited tacloban right after that superstorm 
  sandy went over areas of the atlantic nine degrees warmer than normal before slamming into new york and new
  jersey  
 the second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now the warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent 
 and it creates these atmospheric rivers the brazilian scientists call them flying
  and they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land where storm conditions trigger these massive 
 downpours this is from montana 
 take a look at this storm last august as it moves over tucson arizona  it literally splashes off the city  
 these downpours are really
 unusual
  it rained for two days one hundred and sixty two billion gallons that represents more than two days of the full flow of niagara falls in the middle of the city which was of course  
 paralyzed these record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides this one is from
 chile
 last year and you 'll see that warehouse going by there are oil tankers cars
 going by this is from spain last september
  you could call this the running of the cars and trucks i guess
 every night on the tv news now is like a nature hike through the book of revelation 
 i mean really 
 the insurance industry has certainly noticed  the losses have been mounting up they 're not under any illusions about what 's happening  
 and the causality requires
  a moment
 of discussion we 're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect one cause one effect this is systemic causation  
 as the great kevin trenberth says all storms are different now there 's so much extra energy in the atmosphere there 's so much extra water vapor every storm is
  the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground and causes these deeper longer more pervasive droughts and many of them are underway right 
  now it dries out the vegetation and causes more fires in the western part of north america  there 's certainly been evidence of that a lot of them more lightning as the heat energy builds up there 's
  also have geopolitical consequences and create instability the climate related historic drought that started in syria in two thousand and six
 destroyed sixty percent of the farms in syria  killed eighty percent of the livestock  and drove one point five million climate refugees into the cities of syria where they collided with another one
  refugees from the iraq war and along with other factors that opened the gates of hell that people are trying to close now 
 the us defense department has long warned of consequences from the climate crisis including
 refugees food and water shortages and
  right now we 're seeing
 microbial diseases from the tropics spread to the higher latitudes the transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this  but the changing conditions change 
  the latitudes and the areas where these microbial diseases can can become endemic and change the range of the the vectors like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them the zika
  too cool
 and we have a better public health system  but when women in some regions of south and central america are advised not to get pregnant for two years that 's something new that ought to get our attention  
 the lancet one of the two greatest medical journals in the world last summer labeled this a medical emergency now
 and there are many factors because of it
  this is also connected to the extinction crisis we 're in danger of losing fifty percent of all the living species on earth by the end of this century and already land based plants and animals are now moving towards the poles at an average rate of fifteen feet
 per day  
 speaking of the north pole last december twenty nine the same storm that caused historic flooding in the american midwest
  raised temperatures at the north pole fifty degrees fahrenheit warmer than normal causing the thawing of the north pole in the middle of the long  dark winter polar night 
 and when the land based ice of the arctic melts  it raises sea level  paul nicklen 's beautiful photograph from svalbard illustrates this 
 it 's more dangerous coming off greenland and particularly antarctica
  the ten largest risk cities for sea level rise by population are mostly in south and southeast asia when you measure it by assets at risk  number one is miami three and a half trillion dollars
 at risk number three new york and newark i was in miami last fall during the supermoon one
  and there were fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets of miami beach and fort lauderdale and del rey and this happens regularly during the  highest tide tides now  not with rain 
 they call it sunny day flooding it comes up through the storm sewers
 past time this can be viewed through a partisan lens  this is a crisis that 's getting worse day by day we have to move beyond partisanship and i want to take a moment to honor these house republicans applause
 who had the courage last fall
 to step out
 and take a political risk
 by telling the truth about the climate crisis  so the cost of the climate crisis is mounting up there are many of these aspects i haven 't
 even mentioned
 it 's an enormous burden i 'll mention just one more because the world economic forum
 last month in davos after their annual survey of seven hundred and fifty economists said the climate crisis is now the number one risk to the global economy
  so you get central bankers like mark carney the head of the uk central bank saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are
 carbon i 'm not going to remind you what happened with subprime mortgages but it 's the same thing  if you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned since the beginning of the industrial 
 revolution this is the quantity burned in the last sixteen years  here are all the ones that are proven and left on the books twenty eight trillion dollars
  the international energy agency says only this amount can be burned  so the rest twenty two trillion dollars
 risk to the global economy that 's why divestment movement makes practical sense and is not just a moral imperative so the answer to the first question 
 must we change is yes  we have to change  second question can we change
  this is the exciting news  
 the best projections in the world sixteen years ago were that by two thousand and ten the world would be able to install thirty gigawatts of wind capacity  
  we beat that mark by fourteen and a half times over  we see an exponential curve for wind installations now we see the cost coming 
  down dramatically some countries take germany an industrial powerhouse with a climate not that different from vancouver
  's by the way one day last december got eighty one percent of all its energy from renewable resources mainly solar and wind a lot of countries are getting more than half on 
  an average basis more good news energy storage from batteries particularly is now beginning to take off because the cost has been coming down very dramatically to solve the intermittency problem with solar the news is even more exciting
  the best projections fourteen years ago were that we would install one gigawatt per year by two thousand and ten when two thousand and ten came around  we beat that mark by seventeen 
  times over last year  we beat it by fifty eight times over  this year we 're on track to beat it sixty eight times over we 're going to win this  we are going to prevail  the exponential curve on solar is even steeper and more dramatic
  when i came to this stage ten years ago this is where it was 
 we have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves 
 and the cost has come down ten percent per year for thirty years and it 's continuing
  to come down now the business community has certainly noticed this  because it 's crossing the grid parity point cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise grid parity 
  is understood as that line that threshold below which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels 
  degrees fahrenheit or zero and one celsius it 's a difference of more than one degree it 's the difference between ice and water and it 's the difference between markets 
  that are frozen up  and liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment  this is the biggest new business opportunity in the history 
  of the world and two thirds of it is in the private sector we are seeing an explosion of new investment starting in two thousand and ten
 investments globally in renewable electricity generation surpassed fossils the gap has been growing ever since 
 the projections for the future are even more dramatic even though fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate forty times larger than renewables and by the way if you add the projections for nuclear on here 
 particularly if you assume that the work many are doing to try to break
  through to safer and more acceptable more affordable forms of nuclear this could change even more dramatically  
 so is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption of a new technology  well  there are many but let 's look at cell phones in one thousand nine hundred and 
  then ma bell commissioned mckinsey to do a global market survey of those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then how many can we sell by
  the year two thousand they asked mckinsey came back and said nine hundred thousand and sure enough when the year two thousand arrived they did sell nine hundred thousand in the first three days  and for the balance 
  of the year they sold one hundred and twenty times more and now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world so 
  and i think the answer is in three parts 
 first the cost came down much faster than anybody expected even as the quality went up and low income countries places that did not have a landline grid 
 they leap frogged to the new technology the big expansion has been in the developing counties so what about the electricity grids in the developing world  well not so hot and in many
  areas they don 't exist there are more people without any electricity at all in india than the entire population of the united states of america so now we 're getting this  solar panels 
  on grass huts and new business models that make it affordable muhammad yunus financed this one in bangladesh
  country in the world two systems per minute on average night and day and we have all we need  enough energy from the sun comes to the earth every hour to supply the full world 's energy 
  needs for an entire year it 's actually a little bit less than an hour so the answer to the second question 
  some of the provisions are binding and the regular reviews will matter a lot but nations aren 't waiting they 're going ahead china has already announced that starting next year  they 're adopting a nationwide 
  cap and trade system they will likely link up with the european union the united states has already been changing all of these coal plants were proposed in the next ten years and canceled all of these existing coal plants were retired
  of these coal plants have had their retirement announced all of them
 canceled  
 we are moving forward last year if you look at all of the investment in new electricity generation in the united states  almost three quarters was from renewable energy mostly wind and solar we are solving this
  the only question is how long will it take to get there so 
 it matters that a lot of people are organizing to insist on this change almost four hundred thousand people marched in new york city before 
  the un special session on this many thousands  tens of thousands marched in cities around the world  and so 
  this i 'll finish with this story when i was thirteen years old 
 i heard that proposal by president kennedy to land a person on the moon and bring him back safely in ten years 
 and i heard adults of that day and time say that 's reckless expensive  may well fail but eight years and two months later in the moment that neil armstrong set foot on the moon
  there was great cheer that went up in nasa 's mission control in houston  here 's a little known fact about that the average age of the systems engineers the controllers in the room that day was 
 which means among other things their age when they heard that challenge was eighteen we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have faced 
  the greatest poets of the last century in the us wallace stevens  wrote a line that has stayed with me after the final ' no ' there comes a ' yes ' and on that ' yes ' the future world depends 
 when the abolitionists started their movement they met with no after no after no and then came a yes  the women 's suffrage and women 's rights movement met endless no 's until finally  there was a yes  the civil rights movement the
  against apartheid and more recently the movement for gay and lesbian rights
 here in the united states and elsewhere after the final no comes a yes when any great moral challenge
 is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong the outcome is  fore ordained because of who we are as human beings
  that is where we are now and it is why we 're going to win this  we have everything we need some still doubt that we have the will to act  but i say 
 the will to act is itself a renewable resource  thank you very much
  you 've got this incredible combination of skills you 've got this scientist mind that can understand the full range of issues  
 and the ability to turn it into the most vivid language no one else can do that that 's why you led this thing 
 it was amazing to see it ten years ago it was amazing to see it now
 really good friends in the scientific community who are incredibly patient and who will sit there and explain this stuff to me over and over and over again until i can
 get can get it into simple enough language that i can understand it and that 's the key to trying to communicate
  know that all those graphs all that progress is enough
 to solve what you showed in the first part  ag i think that
 the crossing you know i 've only been in the business world for fifteen years 
 but one of the things i 've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is more expensive than the incumbent or cheaper than 
 turns out it makes a difference if it 's cheaper than
 and when it it crosses that line then a lot of things really change  we are regularly surprised by these developments the late rudi dornbusch the great economist said 
 things take longer to happen then you think they will and then they happen much faster than you thought they could i really think that 's where we are some people are using the phrase
  when it gets below the grid parity unsubsidized in most places then it 's the default choice now
 in one of the presentations yesterday  the jitney thing  there is an effort to use regulations to slow this down  
 and i just don 't think it 's going to work
 there 's a woman in atlanta debbie dooley who 's the chairman of the atlanta tea party  they enlisted her
  in this effort to put a tax on solar panels and regulations and she had just put solar panels on her roof and she didn 't understand the request and so she went and
 and formed an alliance with the sierra club and they formed a new organization called the green tea party 
 laughter and they defeated the proposal 
  the answer to your question is this sounds a little corny and maybe it 's a clich 
 but ten years ago and christiana referred to this there are people in this audience who played an incredibly significant role in generating 
  those exponential curves  and it didn 't work out economically for some of them  but it kick started this global revolution and what people in this audience do now with the knowledge that we
  are going to win this  but it matters a lot how fast we win it ca al gore  
 that was incredibly powerful if this turns out to be the year  that the partisan thing changes 
  as you said it 's no longer a partisan issue  but you bring along people from the other side together  backed
 by science backed by these kinds of investment opportunities backed by reason that you win the day boy  that 's really exciting thank you so much
