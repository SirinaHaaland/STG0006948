  i come from
 one of the most liberal  tolerant progressive places in the united states seattle washington  
 and i grew up with a family of
 great seattlites
  was an artist my father was a college professor  
 and i am truly grateful for my upbringing  because i always felt completely comfortable designing my life exactly as i saw fit 
 and in point of fact i took a a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind when i was nineteen i dropped out of college
 dropped out kicked out splitting hairs
  and i went on the road
 as a professional french horn player  which was my lifelong dream  i played chamber music all over the united states and europe and
 i toured for a couple of years with a great jazz guitar player named charlie bird and by the end of my 20s i wound up as a member of the barcelona symphony orchestra
 in spain  what a great life and you know my parents never complained they supported me all the way through it
  dream they used to tell their their neighbors and friends our son  he 's taking a gap decade 
 and
 there was however one
 awkward conversation about my lifestyle that i want to tell you about i was twenty seven 
 and i was home from barcelona and i was visiting my parents for christmas  and i was cooking dinner with my mother
  and we were alone in the kitchen  and
 she was quiet  too quiet  something was wrong  and so i said mom  what 's on your mind 
 and she said your dad and i are really worried about you 
 and i said what i mean what could it be at this point  and she said i want you to be completely honest with me
  the truth is i wasn 't really political i was just a french horn player  but
 i had a bit of an epiphany  and they had detected it and it was causing some confusion you see i had become
 an enthusiast for capitalism  
  and i want to tell you why that is it stems from a lifelong interest of mine in believe it or not poverty  
 see when i was a kid growing up in seattle i remember
 the first time i saw real poverty we were a lower middle class family  but that 's of course not real poverty that 's not even close 
 the first time i saw poverty  and poverty
 's face was when i was six or seven years old early 1970s and it was like a lot of you kind of a prosaic example kind of trite  it was a picture
 in the national geographic magazine of a kid who was my age
 in east africa  and there were flies on his face and a distended belly 
 and he wasn 't going to make it and i knew that  and i was helpless some of you remember that
  not exactly that picture one just like it  it introduced the west to grinding poverty around the world  
 well that vision kind of haunted me as i grew up and i and i went to school and i dropped out and dropped in and
 started my family and i wondered what happened to that kid or to people just like him all over the world  
 and so i started to study even though i wasn 't in college i was looking for the answer what happened to the world 's poorest people
  gotten better what  and i found the answer  and it changed my life  and i want to share it with you see
 most americans believe that poverty has gotten worse since we were children
 since they saw that vision if you ask americans has poverty gotten worse or better around
  seventy percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s but here 's the truth here 's the epiphany that i had that changed my thinking 
 from one thousand nine hundred and seventy until today 
 the percentage of the world 's population
 living in starvation levels  living on a dollar a day or less obviously adjusted for inflation that percentage has declined
  eighty percent 
 there 's been an eighty percent decline in the world 's worst poverty since i was a kid and i didn 't even know about it  this my friends that 's a miracle  
 that 's something we ought to celebrate  it 's the greatest antipoverty achievement in the history of mankind  and it happened in our lifetimes 
 so when i learned this i asked what did that what made it possible because if you don 't know why
 if you want to replicate it and get the next two billion people out of poverty because that 's what we 're talking about since i was a kid two billion of the least of these our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of poverty  i want the next two billion so i 've got to know why  
 and i went in search of an answer  and it wasn 't a political answer because i didn 't care  you know what i still don 't care  
 i wanted the best answer from mainstream economists
  left  right and center and here it is here are the reasons there are five reasons
 that two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of poverty since i was a kid  
 number one  globalization  number two free trade  number three property rights  number
  it was
 the free enterprise system spreading around the world after one thousand nine hundred and seventy that did that now  i 'm not naive 
 i know that free enterprise isn 't perfect  and i know that free enterprise isn 't everything we need
 to build a better world but that is great  and that 's beyond politics here 's what i learned
  is not just about accumulation 
 at its best it 's about aspiration which is what so many people on this stage talk about is the aspiration that comes from dreams
 that are embedded in the free enterprise system and we 've got to share it with more people now 
 i want to tell you about a second epiphany that 's related to that first one
 that i think can bring us
  not just around the world but right here at home 
 the best quote i 've ever heard to summarize the thoughts that i 've just given you about pulling people out of poverty
 is as follows 
 free markets have created more wealth than any system in history they have lifted billions out of poverty 
 who said it  it sounds like
 milton friedman
 or ronald reagan
  barack obama said that why do i know it by heart  because he said it to me  
 crazy  and i said hallelujah 
 but more than that i said what an opportunity you know what i was thinking it was at an event that we were doing on the subject at georgetown university in may of two
  solution to the biggest problem facing america today  what it
 's coming together around these ideas liberals and conservatives to help people who need us the most 
 now  i don 't have to tell anybody in this room that we 're in a crisis in america and many countries around the world with political polarization  it 's risen to to critical
  an article last year in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals
 published in the west and it was an article in two thousand and fourteen on political motive asymmetry what 's that that 's what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your ideology is based in love
 but your opponents ' ideology is based in hate
 it 's common in
 world conflict you expect to see this between palestinians and israelis for example  what the authors of this article found
 was that in america today a majority of republicans and democrats suffer from political motive asymmetry a majority of people in our country today who are 
  politically active believe that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate  think about it
  think about it  most people are walking around saying
 you know my ideology is based on basic benevolence i want to help people but the other guys they 're evil and out to get me 
 you can 't progress as a society when you have this kind of asymmetry it 's impossible 
 how do we solve it well  
  let 's be honest there are differences  let 's not minimize the differences that would be really nave 
 there 's a lot of good research on this a veteran of the ted stage is my friend jonathan haidt he 's a psychology professor at new york university he does work on the 
  ideology and values and morals of different people to see how they differ  
 has shown
 that liberals care about poverty fifty nine percent more than they care about economic liberty 
 and conservatives care about economic liberty twenty eight percent more than they care about poverty  
 irreconcilable differences right we 'll never come together  wrong  
 that is diversity in which lies our strength remember what pulled
  up the poor  it was the obsession with poverty  accompanied by the method
 of economic freedom spreading around the world  we need each other in other words if we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty  there 's no other way 
 hmm how are we going to get that it 's a tricky thing
  we need innovative thinking a lot of it 's on this stage social entrepreneurship  yeah  absolutely phenomenal 
 we need investment overseas in a sustainable responsible ethical and moral way  yes yes  but you know what we really need 
 we need a new day
 in flexible
  you ever feel
 like your own ideology is starting to get predictable  kinda conventional do you ever feel like you 're always listening to people who agree with you 
 why is that dangerous  because when we talk in this country about economics
 on the right conservatives you 're always talking about taxes and regulations and big government and on the left
  liberals you 're talking about economics it 's always about income inequality right  now
 those are important things really important to me really important to you but when it comes to lifting people up who are starving and need us today  those are distractions  
 we need to come together around the best ways to mitigate poverty using the best tools at our disposal and that comes only
  when conservatives recognize that they need liberals and their obsession with poverty and liberals need conservatives and their obsession
 with free markets that 's the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country if we choose to take it  
 so how are we going to do it  how are we going to do it
  i 've got to have some action items not just for you but for me  
 number one  
 action item number one  remember  it 's not good enough just to tolerate people who disagree it 's not good enough 
 we have to remember that we need people who disagree with us because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting
 for these tools  now  what are you going to do how are you going to express that where does this start it starts here
  this room we 're blessed we 're blessed with people who listen to us we 're blessed with prosperity we 're blessed with leadership when people hear us with the kind of unpredictable ideology
 then maybe people will listen  maybe progress will start at that point that 's number one number two  number two
  i 'm asking you and i 'm asking me
 to be the person specifically who blurs the lines who is ambiguous who is hard to classify  
 if you 're a conservative be the conservative who is always going on about poverty
 and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor  and if you 're a liberal 
 be a liberal who is always talking about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems when we use them responsibly
 if we do that we get two things  number one  we get to start to work on the next two billion and be the solution
 that we 've seen so much of in the past and we need to see more of in the future that 's what we get and the second is
 that we might just be able to take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we 're suffering under in this country and turn it into
 a competition of ideas
 based on solidarity and mutual respect  and then
 maybe just maybe we 'll all realize
 that our big differences aren 't really that big after all thank you
