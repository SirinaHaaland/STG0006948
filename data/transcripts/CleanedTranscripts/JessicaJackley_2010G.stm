  the stories we tell about each other
 matter very much the stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter and most of all i think the way that we participate in each other 's stories
  i was six years old when i first heard stories about the poor now i didn 't hear those stories from the poor themselves i heard them from
 my sunday school teacher and jesus kind of via my sunday school teacher  
 i remember learning that people who were poor needed something material food clothing shelter that they didn 't have 
 and i also was taught coupled with that that it was my job this classroom full of five and six year old children it was our job
  help this is what jesus asked of us and then he said what you do for the least of these you do for me now i was pretty psyched  i was very
 eager to be useful in the world i think we all have that feeling and also it was kind of interesting that god needed help that was news to me and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in 
 but i also learned very soon thereafter that jesus also said and i 'm paraphrasing the poor would always be with us this frustrated and confused
  i felt like i had been just given a homework assignment that i had to do and i was excited to do but no matter what i would do i would fail  so i felt confused a little bit frustrated and angry 
 like maybe i 'd misunderstood something here and i felt overwhelmed 
 and for the first time i began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people i imagined in my head a kind of long line of individuals that were never going
 away that would always be with us they were always going to ask me to help them and give them things which
 i was excited to do  but i didn 't know how it was going to work and i didn 't know  what would happen when i ran out of things to give
 especially if the problem was never going going away in the years following  the other stories i heard about the poor growing up were no
  for example i saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering i heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor i heard about disease i heard about war
 they always seemed to be kind of related and in general i got this sort of
 idea that the poor
 poor in the world
 lived lives that were wrought with suffering and sadness devastation hopelessness  
 and after a while i developed what i think many of us do is this predictable response where i started to feel bad every
  time i heard about them i started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth  
 because i wasn 't doing more apparently to make things better  and i even felt a sense of shame because of that 
 and so naturally i started to distance myself i stopped listening to their stories quite as closely as i had before  
 and i stopped expecting things to
  really change now i still gave on the outside it looked like i was still quite involved i gave of my time and my money  i gave when solutions were on sale the cost of a cup of coffee
 can save a child 's life right i mean who can argue with
 that i gave when i was cornered when it was difficult to avoid and i gave in general when the negative emotions built up enough that i gave to relieve my own suffering not someone else 's 
 the truth be told 
 i was giving out of that place not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and
  generosity it became a transaction for me  became sort of a trade i was purchasing something i was
 buying my right to go on with my day
 and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news  and i think the way that we go through that sometimes can 
 first of all disembody a group of people individuals out there in the world and it can also turn into a commodity which is a very scary thing 
 as i did this and as i think many of us do this we kind of buy our distance we kind of buy our right to go on with our day
  i think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most it can get in the way of our desire
 to really be meaningful and useful in another person 's life and in short to love 
 thankfully a few years ago things shifted for me because i heard this gentleman speak dr muhammad yunus i know many in the room probably know exactly who he is
 but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak
 dr yunus won the nobel peace prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance when i heard him speak it was three years before that 
 but basically microfinance if
 this is new to you as well think of that as financial services for the poor think of all the things you get at your bank and imagine those products and services tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day
  story explaining what that was and what he had done with his grameen bank he also talked about in particular microlending 
 which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business now 
 when i heard him speak  it was exciting for a number of reasons first and foremost i learned about this new method of change in the world that for once showed me maybe a way to interact with someone and to
  to share of a resource in a way that wasn 't weird and didn 't make me feel bad
 that was exciting but more importantly 
 he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories i had heard before in fact those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note he was talking about strong  smart  
 hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family 's lives better 
 all they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital 
 an amazing sort of insight for me and i in fact was so deeply moved by this it 's hard to express now how much that affected me but i was so moved that i actually quit my job a few weeks later  and i moved to east 
  africa to try to see for myself what this was about for the first time actually in a long time i wanted to meet those individuals i wanted to meet these entrepreneurs and see for myself what their lives were actually
  i spent three months in kenya uganda and tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received one hundred dollars to start or grow a business 
 and in fact through those interactions for the first time i was starting to get to be friends with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there that was supposed to be far away
 i was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories and over and over again as i interviewed them and spent my days with them i did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change  so i would hear
  from goat herders who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats their business trajectory would change they would make a little bit more money their standard of living would
 would shift and would get better  and they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives like they would start to send their children to school they might be able to buy mosquito nets  maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure  
 maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea
  and offer that to me when i came as their guest and that made them feel proud  but there were these beautiful details even if i talked to twenty goat herders in a row  and some days that 's what happened these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them
 that was another thing that really touched me it was really humbling to see for the first time to really understand that even if i could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything i probably would have gotten a lot wrong because the best way for people to change
  change their lives is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them  so i saw that and it was very humbling anyway  
 another interesting thing happened while i was there i never once was asked for a donation  which had kind of been my mode right there 's poverty you give money to help
 no one asked me for a donation  in fact  no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all if anything they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and
  to build on their own capabilities  so what i did hear once in a while was that people wanted a loan
 i thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting and by the way i was a philosophy and poetry major in school so i didn 't know the difference between profit and revenue when i went to east africa i just got this impression 
 that the money would work and  my introduction to business was in these $ one hundred little infuses of capital and i learned about profit and revenue about leverage
  all sorts of things from farmers from seamstresses from goat herders 
 so this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family and through that maybe we could get some of the money that they needed
 to be able to continue their businesses as loans  that 's this little idea that turned into kiva a few months
  went back to uganda
 with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner matthew and i had kind of built 
 and took pictures of seven of my new friends posted their stories these stories of entrepreneurship up on the website  spammed friends and family and said we think this is legal haven 't heard back yet 
 from sec on all the details but do you say do you want to help participate in this provide the money that they need the money came in basically overnight we sent it over to uganda and over the next six months a beautiful thing happened 
  they were paid and their businesses in fact grew and they were able to support themselves and change the trajectory of their lives 
 in october of ' five 
 after those first seven loans were paid  matt and i took the word beta off of the site  we said our little experiment has been a success let 's start for real that was our official launch  
 and then that first year october ' five through ' six kiva facilitated $ five hundred thousand in loans 
 the second year it was
 a total of fifteen million the third year the total was up to around forty the fourth year we were just short of one hundred and today less than five years in kiva 's facilitated more than one hundred 
  and fifty million dollars in little 25 dollar bits from lenders and entrepreneurs more than a million of those collectively in two hundred countries 
 to me  kiva 's really about stories it 's about retelling the story of the poor  
 and it 's about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity  validates a partnership relationship not a relationship that 's based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary
 weirdness that can happen  but instead a relationship that can promote respect
  and hope and this 
 this optimism that together we can move forward so
 what i hope is that not only can the money keep flowing forth through kiva that 's a very positive and meaningful thing but i hope kiva can blur those lines like i said between the traditional rich and poor
 categories that we 're taught to see in the world this false dichotomy of us and them have and have not i hope that kiva can blur those lines  because as
 that happens i think we can feel free to interact in a way that 's more open more just and more creative to engage with each other and to help each other  
 imagine
 how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you 're about to approach them imagine how you feel 
 and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work who
 wants to tell you
 about their business maybe they 're smiling and they want to talk to you about what they 've done imagine if you 're speaking with somebody who 's growing things and making them flourish 
 somebody who 's using their talents
 to do something productive  somebody who 's built their own business from scratch someone who is surrounded by abundance  not
  who 's in fact creating abundance  somebody with full hands with something to offer not empty hands asking for you to give them something
 imagine if you could hear a story
 you didn 't expect of somebody who wakes up every day and works very very hard to make their life better 
 these stories can really change the way that we think about each other and if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around
 these individuals and to participate in their story by lending a little bit of money i
  think that can change the way we we believe in each other and each other 's potential now for me kiva is just the beginning and as i look forward to what is next it 's been helpful to reflect on the things i 've 
  learned so far the first one is as i mentioned entrepreneurship was a new idea to me  kiva borrowers as i interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years have taught me what entrepreneurship is and i think at its core  it 's deciding that you want your life to be better you see an opportunity and you decide what you 're going to do to try
  seize that in short it 's deciding that tomorrow can better than today and going after that  
 second thing that i 've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity so they 're not a donation yeah  maybe it doesn 't sound that much different but in fact  when you give something to someone and they say 
 thanks and let you know how things go that 's one thing when you lend them money  and they slowly
  pay you back over time you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue this continued attention this ongoing attention is a really big deal
 to build different kinds of relationships among us 
 and then third from what i 've heard from the entrepreneurs i 've gotten to know when all else is equal given the option to have just money to do what you need to do or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community people choose
 the community plus the money that 's a much more meaningful combination a more powerful combination so with that in mind this particular incident
 has led to the things that i 'm working on now 
 i see entrepreneurs everywhere now now that i 'm tuned into this and one thing that i 've seen is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world with social networks it 's an amazing way 
 growing the number of people that we all have around us in our own supportive communities 
 rapidly  and so as i have been thinking about this i 've been wondering how can we engage these supportive communities to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas and to
  all of us to make tomorrow better than today  
 as i 've researched what 's going on in the united states a few interesting little insights have come up so one is that of course as we all might expect many small businesses in the u s and all over the world still need money 
  to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month but there 's always a need for resources
  another thing is it turns out those resources don 't usually come from the places you might expect
 banks venture capitalists
  other organizations and support structures they come from friends and family some statistics say  eighty five percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family that 's around one hundred and thirty billion dollars a year it 's a lot  
 and third so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process it 's very awkward people don 't know exactly what
  to ask for how to ask what to promise in return  even though they have the best of intentions and want to thank those people that are supporting them so
 to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves exactly what that financial exchange should look like exactly what fits them and the people around them this 
  week actually we 're quietly doing a launch of profounder which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need through investments from their friends and family and it 's investments not donations not loans but investments that have a dynamic return
  so the mapping of participating in the story it actually flows with the up and down so in short
 it 's a do it yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds and what you can do is go onto the site  
 create a profile  create investment terms in a really easy way we make it really really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site  
 and we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues they can raise up to a million dollars from an unlimited number of unaccredited unsophisticated
  investors everyday people heaven forbid and they can share those returns over time again whatever terms they set 
 as investors choose to become involved based on those terms they can either take their rewards back as cash or they can
 decide in advance to give those returns away to a non profit so they can be a cash or a cause investor it
 's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the people
  around them that they already have the people that know them best and that love them and want to support them to gather them to make this happen  
 so that 's what i 'm working on now and to close i just want to say look these are tools right now profounder 's right at the very beginning and it 's very palpable it 's very clear to me that it 's just a vessel it 's just a tool 
 what we need are for people to care to actually go use it 
  just like they 've cared enough to use kiva to make those connections but the good news is i don 't think i need to stand here and convince you to care i 'm not even going to try  i don 't think even though we often hear you know 
 hear the ethical and moral reasons the religious reasons 
 here 's why caring and giving will make you happier i don 't think we need to be convinced of that i think we know in fact i think we know so much and 
 it 's such a reality that we care so deeply
  that in fact what usually stops us is that we 're afraid to try and to mess up because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other 's lives so
 what i think i can do today  
 that best thing i can give you i 've given you my story which is the best i can do  and i think i can remind us that we do care i think we all already know that and
 i think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and
  the best way to be inspired to try
 is to stop and to listen to someone else 's story  and i 'm grateful that i 've gotten to do that here at ted  
 and i 'm grateful that whenever i do that  guaranteed i am inspired i am inspired by the person i am listening to 
 and i believe more and more every time i listen
 in that that person 's potential to do great things in the world and in my own potential to maybe help and that forget
  the tools forget the moving around of resources that stuff 's easy 
 believing in each other really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world 
 that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one
 that continually perpetuates hope
 and good things for all of us so
  this belief in each other  knowing that without a doubt and practicing that every day in whatever you do that 's what i believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today  thank you
