  i want to introduce you to some very wise kids that i 've known  but first i want to introduce you to a camel 
 this is cassie a therapy camel visiting one of our young patients in her room  
 which is pretty magical
  friend of mine raises camels at his ranch in the santa cruz mountains 
 he has about eight of them  and he started thirty years ago because he thought horses were too mundane  
 john is an  out of the box thinker which explains why the two of us have been such good friends all of our lives 
  over the years  i 've convinced him to shuttle those sweet furry beasts up to hang out with our sick kids from time to time  
 talking to john  i was surprised to learn that camels have an average life expectancy of forty to fifty years 
 the life expectancy of many of the children with whom i work
 is less than a year this is a picture of the george mark children 's house  the first pediatric palliative respite care center
  to open in the united states  
 i founded it in two thousand and four after years of working as a psychologist on pediatric intensive care units 
 frustrated with the undignified deaths that so many children experienced and their families had to endure 
 as i sat with families whose children were at the end of their lives  i was acutely aware
 of our surroundings  
 while the elevated train rumbled overhead on its track  quite literally the room reverberated with each passing train car  
 the lights on the ward were fluorescent and too bright  monitors beeped as did the elevator  noisily announcing its arrival 
 these families were experiencing some of the most excruciating
  moments of their lives  and i so wanted them to have a more peaceful place in which to say a last goodbye to their young daughters and sons  
 surely  i thought 
 there must be a better spot than a hospital intensive care unit for children at the end of their lives 
 our children 's house
 is calm and nurturing it 's a place where
  families can stay together to enjoy quality time with their children 
 many of whom are there for respite stays some with repeated visits over a span of many years we call those kids our frequent flyers  
 rather than the bright noisy quarters of the hospital their rooms are calm and comfortable 
 with actual living spaces for the families
  a sanctuary of gardens and a wonderful outdoor playground
 with special structures for children with physical limitations  this sweet baby lars
 came to us directly from a hospital intensive care unit  
 imagine hearing the heartbreaking news that none of us would ever want to hear his parents had been told that lars had a brain
  anomaly
 that would keep him from ever swallowing  walking  talking or developing mentally  
 recognizing what little chance he had for survival his parents chose to focus on the quality of time that they could spend together  
 they moved into one of our family apartments and treasured each day that they had which were far too few 
 lars 's life was
 brief to be sure  mere weeks but it was calm and comfortable he went on hikes with his parents 
 the time that he spent in the pool with our aquatic therapist lessened the seizures he was experiencing and helped him to sleep at night 
 his family had a peaceful place in which to both celebrate his
  been five years since lars was with us and in that time his family has welcomed
 a daughter and another son they are such a powerful testament
 to the positive outcome that specialized children 's hospice care can create 
 their baby 's physical discomfort was well managed giving all of them the gift of time to be together in a beautiful place
  i 'm going to talk to you now about the elephant rather than the camel in the room 
 very few people want to talk about death  and even fewer about children 's death  
 loss of a child especially for those of us who have our own children is frightening
  than frightening  paralyzing  debilitating  impossible  
 but what i 've learned is this 
 children don 't stop dying just because we the adults can 't comprehend the injustice of losing them 
 and what 's more 
  if we can be brave enough to face the possibility of death  even among the most innocent  we gain an unparalleled kind of wisdom 
 take crystal for example 
 she was one of the first children to come for care after we opened our doors  
 she was nine when she arrived and her neurologist expected that she might live another two weeks 
 she had an inoperable brain tumor and her decline had really accelerated
 in the week before she came to us 
 after settling into her room  dressed entirely in pink and lavender  
 surrounded by the hello kitty accessories that she loved  
 she spent the next several days winning over the hearts of every staff member 
 bit by bit her condition stabilized  and then to our astonishment
 she actually improved  there were a variety of factors that contributed
 to crystal 's improvement which we later came to call the george mark bump 
 a lovely not uncommon phenomenon where children outlive the prognoses of their illnesses if they 're outside of the
  the calmer atmosphere of her surroundings  
 tasty meals that were fixed often to accommodate her requests  the resident pets  
 the therapy dog and rabbit spent lots of cozy time with crystal 
 after she had been with us for about a week she called her grandmother  and she said
  i 'm staying in a great big house  and there 's room for you to come too 
 and guess what you don 't have to bring any quarters because the washer and dryer are free 
 crystal 's grandmother soon arrived from out of town  and they spent the remaining four months of crystal 's life
 enjoying very special days together some days were special because crystal was outside in her wheelchair sitting by the
  fountain 
 for a little girl who had spent most of the year earlier in a hospital bed being outside counting hummingbirds made for an amazing time with her grandma  and lots of laughter  
 other days were special because of the activities that our child life specialist created for her 
 crystal strung beads and made jewelry for everybody in the house  she painted a pumpkin to help
  decorate for halloween 
 she spent many excited days planning her tenth birthday which of course none of us thought she would ever see 
 all of us wore pink boas for the occasion and crystal as you can see queen for a day wore a sparkly tiara
  one hot morning i arrived at work and crystal and
 her partner in crime charlie  greeted me with some help they had set up a lemonade and cookie stand outside the front door 
 a very strategic location
 i asked crystal the price of the cookie that i had selected and she said three dollars 
 i said that seemed a bit high for one
  cookie it was small 
 i know she acknowledged with a grin but i 'm worth it 
 and therein lie the words of wisdom of a young girl
 whose brief life forever impacted mine crystal was worth it
  and shouldn 't every child whose life is
 shortened by a horrific illness be worth it 
 together all of us today can offer that same specialized care that crystal received by recognizing
 that children 's respite and hospice care
 is a critical component missing from our healthcare landscape 
  it 's also interesting to note that we are able to provide this care at about one third of the cost of a hospital intensive care unit  and
 our families don 't see a bill we are ever grateful to the supporters who believe in this important work that we 're doing 
 the truth is that my colleagues and i
 and the parents and other family members who get to experience this special wisdom are in a unique
  position  
 there are only two freestanding pediatric hospices in the united states  
 although i 'm happy to report that based on our model there are eighteen others under various stages of development applause
 still most of the children who die in the united states every year die in hospital rooms
  surrounded by beeping machines and anxious  exhausted adults who have no other option
 but to say goodbye under those harsh institutional lights and among virtual strangers 
 for comparison 's sake the united kingdom which is a country with about one fifth the population
  and about half the size of the state of california has 
 hospice and respite centers 
 why is that i 've asked myself
 that question obviously many times my best guess is that americans with our positive can do attitude
 hold the expectation that our medical care system will fix it  even though it may be
  a childhood illness for which there is no cure we go to extraordinary measures to keep children alive
 when in fact the greatest kindness that we might give them
 would be a peaceful pain free end of life the transition from cure to care
 remains a challenging one for many hospital physicians whose training has really been about saving
  lives  not about gently guiding the patient to the end of life 
 the dad of a sweet baby for whom we cared at the end of her life certainly captured this dichotomy
 when he reflected that there are a lot of people to help you bring an infant into the world but very few to help you usher a baby
  so what is the magic ingredient at george mark  
 the complex medical diagnoses that bring our young patients to us mean that their lives have often been restricted  
 some to a hospital bed for long periods of time  others to wheelchairs  
 still others to intensive courses of chemotherapy or rehab 
 we make a practice of ignoring those limitations our default answer is
  and our default question is why not 
 that 's why we took a young boy who wasn 't going to live for another baseball season to game five of the world series 
 that 's why we have a talent show put on by the staff and kids for family and friends who wouldn 't be enchanted by a young boy playing a piano piece with his feet because his arms are atrophied
  's why we have a prom every year it 's pretty magical  we started the prom
 after hearing a dad lament that he would never pin a  boutonniere on his son 's tuxedo lapel  
 the weeks before the dance  the house is in a flurry and i don 't know who 's more
  the night of the event involves rides
 in vintage cars a walk on a red carpet into the great room a terrific dj
 and a photographer at the ready to capture pictures of these attendees and their families 
 at the end of the evening this year one of our young delightful teenaged girls
 said to her mom 
 that was the best night of my whole life 
 and that 's just the point to capture the best days and nights 
 to abolish limitations to have your default answer be yes and your default question be why
  life is too short  whether we live to be eighty five years or just eight  trust me  better yet  trust sam 
 it 's not by pretending that death doesn 't exist
 that we keep the people especially the little people that we love  safe 
 in the end we can 't control how long any of us lives what we can control
  we spend our days the spaces we create  the meaning and joy
 that we make we cannot
 change the outcome but we can change the journey isn 't it time
 to recognize that children deserve nothing less than our most uncompromising
  bravery and our wildest imagination  thank you
