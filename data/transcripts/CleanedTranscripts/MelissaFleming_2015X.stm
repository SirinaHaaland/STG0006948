  every day i listen to harrowing stories of people fleeing for their lives 
 across dangerous borders and unfriendly seas  but there 's one story that keeps me awake at night
 a syrian refugee nineteen years old 
 she was living a grinding existence in egypt working day wages her dad was constantly thinking of his thriving business back 
  in syria that had been blown to pieces by a bomb  
  and the community that once welcomed them there
 had become weary of them  
 and one day men on motorcycles tried to kidnap her 
 once an aspiring student thinking only of her future now she was scared all the time  
 but she was also full of hope  because she was in love with a fellow syrian refugee
  named bassem bassem was also struggling in egypt  and he said to doaa 
 let 's go to europe seek asylum safety  i will work you can study the promise of a new life 
 and he asked her father for her hand in marriage  but they knew to get to europe they had to risk their lives
  across the mediterranean sea putting their hands
 in smugglers ' notorious for their cruelty  
 and doaa was terrified of the water  she always had been she never learned to swim  
 it was august that year and already two thousand people had died trying to cross the mediterranean but doaa knew of
  a friend
 who had made it all the way to northern europe and she thought maybe we can too 
 so she asked her parents if they could go and after a painful discussion they consented  and bassem paid his entire life savings
 two thousand five hundred dollars each to the smugglers it was a saturday morning when the call came and they were taken by
  bus to a beach hundreds of people on the beach  
 they were taken then by small boats onto an old fishing boat  five hundred of them crammed onto that boat three hundred below [ two hundred ] above
  there were syrians palestinians africans muslims and christians one hundred
  sandra little sandra six years old and masa eighteen months 
 there were families on that boat crammed together shoulder to shoulder feet to feet 
 doaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest bassem
 holding her hand 
 day two on the water they were sick with worry and sick to their stomachs from the rough sea day three
  had a premonition  
 and she said to bassem i fear we 're not going to make it  i fear the boat is going to sink 
 and bassem said to her please be patient we will make it to sweden we will get married and we will have a future 
 day four the passengers were getting agitated  they asked the captain when will we get there
 he told them to shut up and he insulted them  he said in sixteen hours we will reach the shores of italy they were weak
 and weary 
 soon they saw a boat approach a smaller boat  ten men on board who started shouting at them  hurling insults  throwing
  asking them to all disembark and get on this smaller more unseaworthy boat  the parents were terrified
 for their children  and they collectively refused to disembark 
 so the boat sped away in anger  and a half an hour later came back
 and started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of
  below where she and bassem were sitting  
 and she heard how they yelled let the fish eat your flesh 
 and they started laughing
 as the boat capsized and sank the three hundred people below deck were
  the side of the boat as it sank  
 and watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller 
 bassem said to her please let go or you 'll be swept in and the propeller will kill you too and remember she can 't swim  
 but she let go
 and she started moving her arms and her legs thinking this is swimming
 bassem found a life ring  
 it was one of those child 's rings that they use to play in swimming pools and on calm seas 
 and  doaa climbed onto the ring her arms and her legs
 dangling by the side bassem was a good swimmer  so he held her hand
  around them there were corpses around one hundred people survived initially and they started coming together in groups  praying for rescue 
 but when a day went by
 and no one came 
 some people gave up hope  and doaa and bassem watched as men in the distance took their life vests off
 and sank into the water  one man approached
  them
 with a small baby perched on his shoulder  nine months old malek he was holding onto a gas canister
 to stay afloat  
 and he said to them i fear i am not going to survive i 'm too weak i don 't have the courage anymore and he handed little malek over to bassem
 and to doaa and they perched her onto the life ring
 so now they were three doaa bassem and little malek  and let me take a pause in this story right here
 and ask the question  why do refugees like doaa take these kinds of risks risks  
 millions of refugees are
  from a war that has been raging for four years  
 even if they wanted to return  they can 't their homes their businesses their towns and their cities have been completely destroyed this is a unesco world heritage city 
  in syria so people continue to flee into neighboring countries and we build refugee camps for them
 in the desert hundreds of thousands of people live in camps
 like these and thousands and thousands more millions live in towns and cities and the communities the neighboring countries that once
 welcomed them with open arms and hearts are overwhelmed there are simply not enough
  schools water systems sanitation  even rich european countries could never handle such an influx
 without massive investment  
 the syria war has driven almost four million people over the borders but over seven million people
 are on the run inside the country that means that over half
  the syrian population has been forced to flee back to those neighboring countries hosting so many 
 they feel that the richer world has done too little to support them  
 and days have turned into months months into years a refugee 's stay is supposed to be temporary
  back to  doaa and bassem in the water  it was their second day and bassem was getting very weak 
 and now it was doaa 's turn to say to bassem 
 my love please hold on to hope to our future we will make it 
 and he said
  i 'm sorry my love that i put you in this situation i have never loved anyone
 as much as i love you and he released himself into the water and doaa watched
 as the love of her life drowned before her eyes  
 later that day a mother came up to
 with her small 
 daughter masa 
 this was the little girl i showed you in the picture earlier with the life vests 
 her older sister sandra had just drowned and her mother knew she had to do everything
 in her power to save her daughter  and she said to doaa please take this child let her be part of you  
 i will not
  survive and then she went away and drowned so 
  refugee who was terrified of the water who couldn 't swim  found herself
 in charge of two little baby kids  and they were thirsty and they were hungry and they were agitated  and she tried her best
 to amuse them
  to sing to them to say words to them from the quran 
 around them  the bodies were bloating and turning black 
 the sun was blazing during the day at night there was a cold moon and fog it was very frightening  
 on the fourth day in the water this is how  doaa
  probably looked on the ring with her two children a woman came on the fourth day and approached her and asked her to take another child
 a little boy  just four years old  
 when doaa took the little boy and the mother drowned she said to the sobbing child she just went away to find you water and food
  but his heart soon stopped and doaa had to release the little boy into the water  
 later that day  she looked up into the sky with hope  
 because she saw two planes crossing in the sky and she waved her arms 
 hoping they would see her but the planes were soon gone  but that
  as the sun was going down she saw a boat  a merchant vessel  and she said please god 
 let them rescue me she waved her arms and she felt like she shouted for about two hours  
 and it had become dark but finally the searchlights found her
 and they extended a rope  astonished to see a woman
 clutching onto two babies  they pulled them onto the boat they got oxygen and blankets
 and a greek helicopter came to pick them up and take them to the island of crete  
 but doaa looked down and asked what of malek and they told her the little baby did not survive she drew her last
 breath in the boat 's clinic but doaa was sure
 that as they had been pulled up onto the rescue boat that little baby
  girl had been smiling 
 only eleven people survived that wreck of the five hundred 
 there was never an international investigation into what happened  
 there were some media reports about mass murder at sea a terrible tragedy  but that was only for one day and then
  then
 the news cycle moved on 
 meanwhile in a pediatric hospital on crete little masa was on the edge of death 
 she was really dehydrated her kidneys were failing 
 her glucose levels were dangerously low the doctors did everything in their medical power to save them and the greek nurses
 never left her side holding her hugging her singing her words my colleagues also visited and said pretty words to her in arabic amazingly 
 little masa survived  
 and soon the greek press started reporting about the miracle
  who had survived four days in the water without food
 or anything to drink  and offers to adopt her
 came from all over the country  and meanwhile doaa was in another hospital on crete  thin dehydrated 
 an egyptian family took her into their home
 as soon as she was released  and soon word went around about
  and a phone number was published on facebook messages started coming in 
 doaa do you know what happened to my brother my sister 
 my parents my friends do you know if they survived one of those messages said 
 i believe you
  saved my little niece masa and it had this photo 
 this was from masa 's uncle a syrian refugee who had made it
 to sweden with his family and also masa 's older sister 
 soon we hope  masa will be reunited with him in sweden  and until then she 's being cared
  for in a beautiful orphanage in athens  
 and doaa well word went around about her survival too and the media wrote
 about this slight woman and couldn 't imagine how she could survive all this time under such conditions in that sea  and still save another
  life 
 the academy of athens one of greece 's most prestigious institutions gave her an award of bravery  
 and she deserves all that praise  and she deserves a second chance  
 but she wants to still go to sweden she wants to reunite with her family there she wants to bring
 her mother and her father and her younger siblings away from egypt there as well and i believe
 she will succeed she wants to become a lawyer or a politician or something that can help fight
 injustice  she is an extraordinary survivor  
 but i have to ask what if she didn 't have to take that risk
  why did she have to go through all that 
 why wasn 't there a legal way for her to study in europe  why couldn 't masa have taken an airplane to sweden  why couldn 't bassem have found work  
 why is there no massive resettlement program
 for syrian refugees the victims of the worst war of our times
  the world did this for the vietnamese in the 1970s why not now 
 why is there so little investment in the neighboring countries hosting so many refugees  
 and why the root question is so little being done
 to stop the wars the persecution
 and the poverty
 that is driving so many people to the shores of europe  
 until these issues are resolved people will continue to take to the seas
 and to seek safety
 and asylum  and what happens next well
  that is largely europe 's choice  and i understand the public fears 
 people are worried about their security their economies  the changes of culture  
 but is that more important than saving human lives  because there is something fundamental here
 that i think overrides the rest  and it is about our common humanity no person
  fleeing war or persecution should have to
 die
 crossing a sea to reach safety 
 one thing is for sure that no refugee would be on those dangerous boats if they could thrive where they are 
 and no migrant would take that dangerous journey if
  they had enough food for themselves and their children  and no one would put their life savings
 in the hands of those notorious smugglers if there was a legal way to migrate  so on behalf of little masa
 and on behalf of doaa and of bassem and of those five hundred people who drowned with them
  can we make sure that they did not die in vain could we be inspired by what happened and take a stand
 for a world in which every life matters  thank you
