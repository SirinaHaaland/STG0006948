  it 's something we spend about a third of our lives doing  but do any of us really understand what it 's all about 
 two thousand years ago galen one of the most prominent medical researchers
  of the ancient world proposed that while we 're awake our brain 's motive force its juice would flow out to all the other parts of the body  
 animating them but leaving the brain all dried up 
 and he thought that when we sleep all this moisture that filled the rest of the body would come rushing back rehydrating the brain
 and refreshing the mind  now that sounds completely ridiculous to us now  but galen was simply trying to explain something about sleep that
  we all deal with every day see we all know based on our own experience that when you sleep  it clears your mind 
 and when you don 't sleep  it leaves your mind murky  
 but while we know a great deal more about sleep now than when galen was around  
 we still haven 't understood why it is that sleep of all of our activities has this incredible restorative function for the mind  
 so today i want to tell you
  about some recent research that may shed new light on this question we 've found that sleep may actually be a kind of elegant design solution
 to some of the brain 's most basic needs a unique way that the brain meets the high demands and the narrow margins that set it apart from all the other organs of the body  
 so almost all the biology that we observe
 can be thought of as a series of problems and their corresponding solutions  
 and the first problem that every organ must solve is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel all those cells of the body  
 in the brain that is especially critical its intense electrical activity uses up a quarter of the body 's entire energy supply 
 even though the brain accounts for only about two percent of the body 's mass
  so the circulatory system solves the nutrient delivery problem by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen to every corner of our body 
 you can actually see it in this video here  
 here we 're imaging blood vessels in the brain of a living mouse the blood vessels form a complex network that fills the entire brain volume  
 they start at the surface of the brain  and then they
  dive down into the tissue itself  and as they spread out they supply nutrients and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain  
 now just as every cell requires nutrients to fuel it every cell also produces waste as a byproduct  and the clearance of that waste is the second basic problem that each organ has to solve
  this diagram shows the body 's lymphatic system  which has evolved to meet this need 
 it 's a second parallel network of vessels that extends throughout the body  
 it takes up proteins and other waste from the spaces between the cells  it collects them  and then dumps them into the blood so they can be disposed of  
 but if you look really closely at
  see something that doesn 't make a lot of sense  so if we were to zoom into this guy 's head one of the things that you would see there
 is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain  
 but that that doesn 't make a lot of sense does it 
 i mean the brain is this intensely active organ that produces a correspondingly large amount of waste that must be efficiently cleared  
  it lacks lymphatic vessels which means that the approach that the rest of the body takes to clearing away its waste
 won 't work in the brain  
 so how then does the brain solve its waste clearance problem well that seemingly mundane question
 is where our group first jumped into this story  and what we found
 as we dove down into the brain down
 down among the neurons and the blood vessels was that the brain 's solution to the problem of waste clearance  it was really unexpected 
 it was ingenious 
 but it was also beautiful  
 let me tell you about what we found  
 so the brain has this large pool of clean clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid we call it the csf 
 the csf fills the space that surrounds the brain 
 and wastes from inside the brain
  make their way out to the csf which gets dumped along with the waste into the blood so in that way it sounds a lot like the lymphatic system doesn 't it 
 but what 's interesting is that the fluid and the waste from inside the brain  they don 't just percolate their way randomly out to these pools of csf  
 instead there is a specialized network of plumbing
 that organizes and facilitates this process
 you can see that in these videos  
 here  we 're again imaging into the brain of living mice  the frame on your left shows what 's happening at the brain 's surface and the frame on your right shows what 's happening down below the surface of the brain within the tissue itself we 've
 labeled the blood vessels in red and the csf that 's surrounding the brain will be in green  
 now what was surprising to us was that the
  fluid on the outside of the brain  it didn 't stay on the outside  
 instead the csf was pumped back into and through the brain
 along the outsides of the blood vessels  
 and as it flushed down into the brain along the outsides of these vessels  
 it was actually helping to clear away to clean the waste from the spaces between the brain 's cells
  if you think about it using the outsides of these blood vessels like this
 is a really clever design solution  
 because the brain is enclosed in a rigid skull and it 's packed full of cells so there is no extra space inside it for a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system 
 yet the blood vessels  they extend from the surface of the
  brain down to reach every single cell in the brain  which means that fluid that 's traveling along the outsides of these vessels can gain easy access to the entire brain 's volume  
 so it 's actually this really clever way to repurpose one set of vessels the blood vessels to take over and replace the function of a second set of vessels  the lymphatic vessels to make it so you don 't need them
 and what 's amazing is that no other organ takes quite this approach to clearing away the waste from between its cells this is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain
  but our most surprising finding
 was that all of this everything i just told you about with
  all this fluid rushing through the brain it 's only happening in the sleeping brain
  here the video on the left shows how much of the csf is moving through the brain of a living mouse while it 's awake 
 it 's almost nothing
  yet in the same animal if we wait just a little while until it 's gone to sleep  what we see is that the csf is
  and we discovered that at the same time when the brain goes to sleep 
 the brain cells themselves seem to shrink  opening up spaces in between them  allowing fluid to rush through and allowing waste to be cleared out  
 so it seems that galen may actually have been sort of on the right track when he wrote about fluid rushing through the brain when sleep came on 
 our own research now it 's two thousand years later  suggests that what 's
  happening is that when the brain is awake and is at its most busy  
 it puts off clearing away the waste from the spaces between its cells until later  
 and then when it goes to sleep and doesn 't have to be as busy  it shifts into a kind of cleaning mode to clear away the waste from the spaces between its
  the waste that 's accumulated throughout the day  so it 's actually a little bit like how you or i we put off our household chores during the work week when we don 't have time to get to it and then we play catch up on all the cleaning that we have to do when the weekend rolls around
 now i 've just talked a lot about waste clearance  but i haven 't been very specific about the kinds of waste that the brain needs to be clearing
 during sleep in order to stay healthy the waste product that these recent studies focused most on is
 is amyloid beta which is a protein that 's made in made in the brain all the time  my brain 's making amyloid beta right now and so is yours  
 but in patients with alzheimer 's disease amyloid beta builds up and aggregates in the spaces between the brain 's cells instead of being cleared away like it 's supposed to be 
 and it 's this buildup of amyloid beta that 's thought to be one of the key steps in the development of that terrible disease
  we measured how fast amyloid beta is cleared from the brain when it 's awake versus when it 's asleep  
 and we found that indeed the clearance of amyloid beta is much more rapid from the sleeping brain  
 so if sleep then is part of the brain 's solution to the problem of waste clearance
  then this may dramatically change how we think about the relationship between sleep amyloid beta and alzheimer 's disease 
 a series of recent clinical studies suggest that among patients who haven 't yet developed alzheimer 's disease  
 worsening sleep quality and sleep duration are associated with a greater amount of amyloid beta building up in the brain  
 and while it 's important to point out that these studies don 't prove that lack of sleep or poor sleep cause alzheimer 's
  disease  
 they do suggest that the failure of the brain to keep its house clean by clearing away waste like amyloid beta
 may contribute to the development of conditions like alzheimer 's 
 so what this new research tells us then is that the one thing that all of you already knew about sleep 
 that even galen understood about sleep that it refreshes and clears the mind
 may actually be a big part of what sleep is all about 
 see you and i we go to sleep every single night  but our brains  they never rest while our body is still
 and our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere  
 the elegant machinery of the brain is quietly hard at work cleaning and maintaining this unimaginably complex machine 
 like our housework
 it 's a dirty and a thankless job  but it 's also important in your house if you stop cleaning your kitchen for a month 
 your home will become completely unlivable very quickly  
 but in the brain  the consequences of falling behind may be much greater than the embarrassment of dirty
  when it comes to cleaning the brain it is the very health and function of the mind and the body that 's at stake  
 which is why understanding these very basic housekeeping functions of the brain today
 may be critical for preventing and treating diseases of the mind tomorrow
