  two months ago my kids and i huddled around a cell phone watching the live stream of the game awards  one of the video game industry 's biggest nights 
 they announced the nominees for the game for impact an award that 's given to a thought provoking video game with a profound
 prosocial message or meaning they opened the envelope
 and they read the title of our video game an award 
 for impact 
 it was almost funny actually because i always thought that winning an award like that would have this huge impact on my life  but
 i found that the
  the big nights the accomplishments
 they fade  but the hardest nights of my life have stuck with me  impacting who i am
 and what i do in two thousand and ten my third son joel was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive brain tumor 
 and before that year was finished  doctors sat my husband and i down
 and let us know that his tumor had returned
 despite the most aggressive chemotherapy and radiation that they could offer him 
 on that terrible night  
 after learning that joel had perhaps four months to live  i cuddled up with my two older sons in bed they were five and three at the time
 and i never really knew how much they understood
  i started telling them a bedtime story  i told them about this very brave knight named joel
 and his adventure fighting a terrible dragon
 called cancer 
 every night  i told them more of the story  
 but i never let the story end  i was just building up a context that they could understand and hoping that our prayers would be answered and i would never have to tell them that that knight who had fought so bravely 
 was done fighting
 and could rest now  forever  
 fortunately  i never did have to finish that bedtime story  
 my children outgrew it joel responded better than anyone expected to palliative treatment and so instead of months we spent years learning 
  how to love our dying child with all of our hearts 
  recognize that shameful feeling of holding back
 just a little love to try to spare ourselves just a little pain somewhere further down the road  
 we pushed past that self preservation because joel was worth loving even if that love could crush us 
 and that lesson of intense vulnerability has changed me more than
  any award ever could 
 we started living like joel could live  and we began developing a video game called that dragon cancer 
 it was the story of joel  it was the story of hope
 in the shadow of death  it was the story of faith
 and doubt and the realization that a wrestle with
 doubt is a part of faith
 maybe the biggest part of it it was a story that began as a miracle and ended as a memorial
 the
  transformed into a witness of joel 's life exploring an emotional landscape clicking to discover more of what we as a family felt
 and experienced it feels a little bit like analyzing interactive poetry because every game mechanic
  and so the more the player asks themselves what we as designers were trying to express and why the richer the experience becomes  
 we took that vulnerability that joel taught us and we encoded the game with it 
 players expect their video games to offer them branching narrative so that every decision that they make feels important and can change the outcome of the game 
 we subverted that principle of game design collapsing
  the choices in
 on the player so that they discover for themselves that there is nothing that they can do that will change the outcome for joel 
 and they feel that discovery as deeply and desperately as we felt it on nights when we held joel in our arms praying for hours stubbornly holding out hope for a grace that we could not create
 for ourselves
 we 'd all prefer to win  but when you discover that you can 't win what do you value instead 
 i never planned to write video games but these moments that really change our lives they often come as the result of our hardship
 and not our glory when we thought that joel could live  i left the game designing to my husband
  in here and there with a scene or two and some suggestions  but after the night that joel died 
 the passion 
 the possibility of sharing joel 's life through our video game it was something that i couldn 't resist i started writing more i sat in on our team 's design meetings i added more ideas and i helped direct scenes 
 and i discovered that creating a video game
 is telling a story  but with an entirely new vocabulary 
 all the same elements of imagination and symbolism are there but they 're just partnered with player agency and system responsiveness 
 it 's challenging work i have to think in a totally new way to do it
  but i love it and i wouldn 't have known that without joel maybe
 you 're a little surprised by our choice to share our story of terminal cancer through
 a video game  perhaps you 're even thinking like so many people before you cancer is not a game well
 tell that to any pediatric cancer parent that 's ever taken an exam glove and blown it up into a balloon  or transformed a syringe into a rocket
  ship or let their child ride their iv pole through the hospital halls like it was a race car  
 because when you have children everything is a game 
 and when your young child experiences something traumatic you work even harder to make sure that their life feels like a game because children naturally explore their worlds
 through play
  steal many things from a family it shouldn 't steal play  
 if you 're listening to me and you 're trying to imagine this family that revolves entirely
 around a dying child and you can 't imagine joy as part of that picture  then we were right to share our story with you 
 because that season of our life was hard unspeakably
  hard at times but it was also pure hope deep love and joy like i have never experienced since 
 our video game was our attempt to share that world with people who hadn 't experienced it before because we never could imagine that world until it became ours  
 we made a video game that 's hard to play
  it will never be a blockbuster 
 people have to prepare themselves to invest emotionally in a story that they know will break their hearts  
 but when our hearts break they heal a little differently 
 my broken heart has been healing with a new and a deeper compassion a desire to sit with people in their pain
  to hear their stories and try to help tell them so that they know that they 're seen 
 on the night when that dragon cancer won the game for impact award  we cheered  we smiled and
 we talked about joel
 and the impact he had on our life on all of those hard and hopeful nights that we shared with him when he changed our hearts and taught us so much
  more about life and love and faith and purpose 
 that award will never mean as much to me as even a single photograph
 of my son  
 but it does represent all of the people who his life has impacted people i 'll never meet  
 they write me emails sometimes they tell me that they miss joel
 even though they never met him they describe
 the tears that they 've shed for my son  and it makes my burden of grief
 just a little bit lighter knowing that it 's shared with a 10 year old watching a youtube playthrough or a doctor playing on his airplane with a smartphone or a professor introducing joel to her
  students  we made a video game that 's hard to play  but that feels
 just right to me because the hardest moments of our lives change us more than any goal we could ever accomplish  
 tragedy has shifted my heart more than any dream i could ever see come true
