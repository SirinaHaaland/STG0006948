  strap yourselves in we 're going to mars  
 not just a few astronauts thousands of people are going to colonize mars and i am telling you that they 're going to do this
  some of you will end up working on projects on mars  and i guarantee that some of your children will end up living there  
 that probably sounds preposterous  so i 'm going to share with you how and when that will happen  
 but first i want to discuss the obvious question  why the heck should we do this 
 twelve years ago i gave a ted talk on ten ways the world could end suddenly
  we are incredibly vulnerable to the whims of our own galaxy a single large asteroid could take us out forever 
 to survive we have to reach beyond the home planet think what a tragedy it would be
 if all that humans have accomplished were suddenly obliterated 
 and there 's another reason we should go exploration is in our dna two million years ago humans evolved in africa and then slowly but surely spread out
  across the entire planet by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons this stuff is inside us and they prospered doing that 
 some of the greatest advances in civilization and technology
 came because we explored 
 yes we could do a lot of good with the money it will take to establish a thriving colony on mars  and yes we should all be taking far
  better care of our own home planet  and yes i worry we could screw up mars
 the way we 've screwed up earth  
 but think for a moment what we had when john f kennedy told us we would put a human on the moon  
 he excited an entire generation to dream 
 think how inspired we will be to see a landing on mars  perhaps then we will
  look back at earth and see that that is one people instead of many and perhaps then we will look back at earth  as we struggle to survive on mars  and realize how precious the home planet is  
 so let me tell you about the extraordinary adventure we 're about to undertake  
 but first a few fascinating facts about where we 're going 
 this picture actually
  represents the true size of mars compared to earth mars is not our sister planet it 's far less than half the size of the earth 
 and yet despite the fact that it 's smaller the surface area of mars that you can stand on is equivalent to the surface area of the earth that you can stand on because the earth is mostly covered by water 
 the atmosphere on mars is really thin one hundred times thinner than on earth
  and it 's not breathable it 's ninety six percent carbon dioxide 
 it 's really cold there  the average temperature is minus eighty one degrees  although there is quite a range of temperature 
 a day on mars is about as long as a day on earth plus about thirty nine minutes  
 seasons and years on mars are twice as long as they are on earth 
 and for
  anybody who wants to strap on some wings and go flying one day 
 mars has a lot less gravity than on earth and it 's the kind of place where you can jump over your car instead of walk around it 
 now  as you can see mars isn 't exactly earth like 
 but it 's by far the most livable other place in our entire solar system 
 here 's the problem mars is a long way away a thousand
 times farther away from us than our own moon the moon is two hundred and fifty thousand miles away
 and it took apollo astronauts three days to get there  
 mars is two hundred and fifty million miles away and it will take us eight months to get there two hundred and forty days  
 and that 's only if we launch on a very specific day at a very specific time once
 every two years when mars and the earth are aligned just so so the distance that the rocket would have to travel will be the shortest 
 two hundred and forty days is a long time to spend trapped with your colleagues in a tin can 
 and meanwhile our track record of getting to mars is lousy  we and the russians the europeans the japanese the chinese and the indians have actually sent
 forty four rockets there and the vast majority of them have either missed or crashed only about a third of the missions to mars have been successful 
 and we don 't at the moment have a rocket big enough to get there anyway  
 we once had that rocket the saturn v a couple of saturn vs would have gotten us there it was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans 
 and it was the rocket that took us to the
  moon  but the last saturn v was used in one thousand nine hundred and seventy three to launch the skylab space station  and we decided to do something
 called the shuttle instead of continuing on to mars after we landed on the moon  
 the biggest rocket we have now is only half big enough to get us anything to mars  
 so getting to mars is not going to be easy and that brings up a really interesting question
  how soon will the first humans actually land here  
 now  some pundits think if we got there by two thousand and fifty that 'd be a pretty good achievement 
 these days nasa seems to be saying
 that it can get humans to mars by two thousand and forty  maybe they can i believe that they can get human
  beings into mars orbit by 
 but frankly i don 't think they 're going to bother in two thousand and thirty five to send a rocket to mars  
 because we will already be there  we 're going to land on mars in 
 and the reason is this man is determined to make that happen  his name is elon musk he 's the ceo of tesla motors and spacex
  now  he actually told me that we would land on mars by 
 but elon musk is more optimistic than i am and that 's going a ways so i 'm giving him a couple of years of slack 
 still you 've got to ask yourself can this guy really do this by 
 well let 's put a decade with elon musk into a little perspective
  where was this ten years ago 
 that 's the tesla electric automobile in two thousand and five a lot of people in the automobile industry were saying we would not have a decent electric car for fifty years 
 and where was that 
 that is spacex 's falcon nine rocket lifting six tons of supplies to the international space
  years ago spacex had not launched anything  or fired a rocket to anywhere  so i think it 's a pretty good bet
 that the person who is revolutionizing the automobile industry in less than ten years and the person
 who created an entire rocket company in less than ten years will get us to
  you need to know this governments and robots no longer control this game  
 private companies are leaping into space and they will be happy to take you to mars 
 and that raises a really big question can we actually live there  
 now  nasa may not be able
  or we may get there a long time before nasa but nasa has taken a huge responsibility in figuring out how we can live on mars  
 let 's look at the problem this way  here 's what you need to live on earth  food water  shelter and clothing  
 and here 's what you need to live on mars  all of the above  plus oxygen  
 so let 's look at the most important thing on this list first  water is the basis of all life as we know it
 and it 's far too heavy for us to carry water from the earth to mars to live  so we have to find water if our life is going to succeed on mars  
 and if you look at mars it looks really dry it looks like the entire planet is a desert  but it turns out that it 's not 
 the soil alone on mars contains up to sixty percent water 
 and a number of
  orbiters that we still have flying around mars have shown us and by the way that 's a real photograph
 that lots of craters on mars have a sheet of water ice in them it 's not a bad place to start a colony  
 now  here 's a view of a little dig the phoenix lander did in two thousand and eight showing that just below the surface of the soil is ice that white stuff is ice 
 in the second
  picture which is four days later than the first picture you can see that some of it is evaporating 
 orbiters also tell us that there are huge amounts of underground water on mars as well as glaciers 
 in fact if only the water ice at the poles on mars melted  most of the planet would be under thirty feet of water  
 so there 's plenty of water there  but most of it 's ice most of it 's underground  it takes
  a lot of energy to get it and a lot of human labor 
 this is a device cooked up at the university of washington back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight 
 it 's basically a low tech dehumidifier  and it turns out the mars atmosphere is often one hundred percent humid 
 so this device can extract all the water that humans will need simply from the atmosphere on mars  
 next we have
  to worry about what we will breathe frankly i was really shocked to find out that nasa has this problem worked out 
 this is a scientist at mit named michael hecht  
 and he 's developed this machine moxie  i love this thing it 's a reverse fuel cell essentially that sucks in the martian atmosphere and pumps out
  the next big rover that nasa sends to mars in two thousand and twenty is going to have one of these devices aboard and it will be able to produce enough oxygen to keep one person alive indefinitely  
 but the secret to this and that 's just for testing
 the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the
 to be scalable by a factor of one hundred 
 next what will we eat  
 well we 'll use hydroponics to grow food  but we 're not going to be able to grow more than fifteen to twenty percent of our food there at least not until water is running on the surface 
  of mars and we actually have the probability and the capability of planting crops 
 and it will be dried 
 and then we need some shelter 
 at first we can use inflatable pressurized buildings as well as the landers themselves  but this really only works during the daytime 
 there is too much solar radiation and too much radiation from cosmic rays  
 so we really have to go underground  now  it turns out that the soil on mars by and large
 is perfect for making bricks  and nasa has figured this one out too they 're going to throw some polymer plastic into the bricks  shove them in a microwave oven  and then you will be able to 
  build buildings with really thick walls  or we may choose to live underground in caves or in lava tubes 
  atmosphere piled up on us which creates fifteen pounds of pressure on our bodies at all times and we 're constantly pushing out against that on mars there 's hardly any atmospheric pressure 
 so dava newman 
 a scientist at mit has created this sleek space suit  it will keep us together  block radiation and keep us warm  
 so let 's think about this for a minute food shelter
 clothing water oxygen we can do this we really can  
 but it 's still a little complicated and a little difficult so that leads to the next big really big step
 in living the good life on mars  and that 's terraforming the planet making it more like earth  reengineering an entire planet
  that sounds like a lot of hubris  but the truth is that the technology to do everything i 'm about to tell you already exists 
 first we 've got to warm it up 
 mars is incredibly cold because it has a very thin atmosphere 
 the answer lies here at the south pole and at the north pole of mars  both of which are covered with an incredible amount of frozen carbon dioxide dry ice
 if we heat it up it sublimes directly into the atmosphere and thickens the atmosphere the same way it does on earth 
 and as we know co2 is an incredibly potent
 greenhouse gas  
 now  my favorite way of doing this is to erect a very very large solar sail and focus it it essentially serves as a mirror and focus it on the south pole of mars at first 
 as the
  planet spins it will heat up all that dry ice sublime it and it will go into the atmosphere 
 it actually won 't take long for the temperature on mars to start rising probably less than twenty years 
 right now  on a perfect day at the equator in the middle of summer on mars  temperatures can actually reach seventy degrees  but then they go down to minus one hundred at night
  shooting for is a runaway greenhouse effect 
 enough temperature rise to see a lot of that ice on mars especially the ice in the ground melt 
 then we get some real magic  
 as the atmosphere gets thicker everything gets better we get more protection from radiation 
 more atmosphere makes us warmer makes the planet warmer so we get running water and that makes crops
 then more water vapor goes into the air forming yet another potent greenhouse gas  it will rain and it will snow on mars  
 and a thicker atmosphere will create enough pressure so that we can throw away those space suits  we only need about five pounds of pressure to survive  
 eventually  mars will be made to feel
 a lot like british columbia
 'll still be left with the complicated problem of making the atmosphere breathable and frankly that could take one thousand years to accomplish  
 but humans are amazingly smart and incredibly adaptable there is no telling what our future technology will be able to accomplish
 and no telling what we can do with our
  in biology right now we are on the very verge of being able to control our own genetics 
 what the genes in our own bodies are doing and
 certainly  eventually our own evolution  
 we could end up with a species of human being on earth that is slightly different from the species of human beings on mars  
 but what would you do there how would you live it 's going to be the same as it is on earth
 somebody 's going to start a restaurant  somebody 's going to build an iron foundry  
 someone will make documentary movies of mars and sell them on earth  
 some idiot will start a reality tv show 
 there will be software companies there will be hotels
  there will be bars 
 this much is certain  it will be the most disruptive event in our lifetimes  and i think it will be the most inspiring 
 ask any 10 year old girl if she wants to go to mars  
 children who are now in elementary school are going to choose to live there  
 remember when we landed humans on the moon when that happened people looked at each other and said if we can do this we can do anything
 what are they going to think when we actually form a colony on mars  
 most importantly  it will make us a spacefaring species 
 and that means humans will survive no matter what happens on earth 
 we will never be the last of our kind  thank you
