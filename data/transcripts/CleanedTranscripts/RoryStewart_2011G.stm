  the question today is not 
 why did we invade afghanistan the question is 
 why are we still in afghanistan one decade later  
  why have we got one hundred and thirty thousand troops on the ground why were more people killed
 last month
 than in any preceding month of this conflict  how has this happened  
 the last twenty years has been the age of
  and afghanistan is simply one act in a 
 tragedy  we came out of the end of the cold war
 in despair  
 we faced rwanda  we faced bosnia 
 and then we rediscovered our confidence in the third act  we went into bosnia and kosovo and we seemed to succeed  in the fourth
 with our hubris our overconfidence developing  we invaded iraq and afghanistan 
 and in the fifth act  we plunged into a humiliating mess  
 so the question is what are we doing  why are we still stuck in afghanistan 
 and the answer of course  that we keep being given
 is as follows we 're told that we went into afghanistan because of nine eleven  and that we remain there
  because the taliban poses an existential threat to global security  
 in the words of president obama 
 if the taliban take over again  they will invite back  al qaeda who will try to kill as many of our people
 as they possibly can the story that we 're told is that there was a light footprint initially
 in other words that we ended up in a situation where we didn 't have enough troops
 we didn 't have enough resources  that afghans were frustrated
 they felt there wasn 't enough progress and economic development and security  and therefore the taliban came back
 that we responded in two thousand and five and two thousand and six with troop deployments  but we still didn 't put enough troops on the ground 
  and that it wasn 't until two thousand and nine 
 when president obama signed off on a surge that we finally had in the words of secretary clinton 
 the strategy  the leadership and the resources so as the president now reassures us we are on track to achieve our goals 
 all of this is wrong every one of those statements is wrong afghanistan does not
  pose an existential threat to global security  it is extremely unlikely the taliban would ever be able to take over the country
 extremely unlikely they 'd be able to seize kabul they simply don 't have a conventional military option  
 and even if they were able to do so even if i 'm wrong  it 's extremely unlikely the taliban would
  from the taliban 's point of view  that was their number one mistake last time if they hadn 't invited back  al qaeda they would still be in power today  
 and even if i 'm wrong about those two things even if they were able to take back the country even if they were to invite back  al qaeda 
 it 's extremely unlikely that al qaeda would significantly enhance its ability to harm the united states
  base was to be established near ghazni we would hit them very hard and it would be very very difficult for the taliban to protect them  
 furthermore  
 it 's simply not true that what went wrong in afghanistan is the light footprint  
 in my experience in fact the light footprint was extremely helpful 
 and these troops that we brought in
  's a great picture of david beckham there on the sub machine gun made the situation worse not better  when i walked across afghanistan in the winter of 
 what i saw was scenes like this a girl if you 're lucky in the corner of a dark room lucky to be able to
  in those early days when we 're told we didn 't have enough troops and enough resources we made a lot of progress in afghanistan within a few months there were two and a half million more girls in school 
 in sangin where i was sick in two thousand and two the nearest health clinic was within three days walk 
 today there are fourteen health clinics in that area alone  
 there was amazing improvements we went from almost no afghans having mobile telephones during the
  taliban to a situation where almost overnight three million afghans had mobile telephones 
 and we had progress in the free media  we had progress in elections all of this with the so called light footprint  
 but when we began to bring more money when we began to invest more resources  things got
  well first see if you put one hundred and twenty five billion dollars a year into a country like afghanistan
 where the entire revenue of the afghan state is one billion dollars a year  you drown everything  
 it 's not simply corruption and waste that you create  
 you essentially replace the priorities of the afghan government the elected afghan government with the
  the micromanaging tendencies of foreigners on short tours
 with their own priorities and the same is true for the troops when i walked across afghanistan i stayed with people like this this is commandant
 haji malem mohsin khan of kamenj 
 commandant haji malem mohsin khan of kamenj was a great host he was very generous like many of the afghans i stayed with but he was also considerably more conservative
  considerably more islamist than we 'd like to acknowledge 
 this man for example  mullah mustafa  tried to shoot me  
 and the reason i 'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is i was somewhat frightened and i was too afraid on this occasion to ask him having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house  
 why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me  
 but eighteen months later i asked him why he had tried to shoot me
 and mullah mustafa he 's the man with the pen and paper explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph nadir shah had bet him that he couldn 't hit me  
 now this is not to say afghanistan is a place full of people like mullah mustafa it 's not it 's a wonderful place full of incredible energy and
  of the troops has increased the violence rather than decreased it 
 two thousand and five anthony fitzherbert an agricultural engineer could travel through helmand could stay in nad ali sangin and ghoresh which are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place today he could never do that 
 so the idea that we deployed the troops to respond to the taliban insurgency is mistaken  
 rather than preceding the insurgency
  the taliban followed the troop deployment and as far as i 'm concerned the troop deployment caused their return  
 now is this a new idea no 
 there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years i ran a center at harvard from two thousand and eight to two thousand and ten  
 and there were people
  like michael semple there who speak afghan languages fluently  who 've traveled to almost every district in the country  andrew wilder for example  
 born
 on the pakistan iranian border  served his whole life in pakistan and afghanistan  paul fishstein who began working there in 
  worked for save the children  ran the afghan research and evaluation unit these are people who were able to say consistently
 that the increase in development aid
  was making afghanistan less secure not more secure that the 
  strategy was not working and would not work  and yet  nobody listened to them  instead 
 there was a litany of astonishing optimism 
 beginning in two thousand and four every general came in saying
  i 've inherited a dismal situation but finally i have the right resources and the correct strategy which will deliver in general barno 's word in two thousand and four the decisive year 
 well guess what it didn 't 
 but it wasn 't sufficient to prevent general abuzaid saying that he had the strategy and the resources to deliver in two thousand and five 
 the decisive year or general david richards to come in in two thousand and six and say he had the strategy and the resources to deliver the
  year or in two thousand and seven the norwegian deputy foreign minister espen eide to say that that would deliver the decisive year or in two thousand and eight major general champoux 
  to come in and say he would deliver the decisive year or in two thousand and nine my great friend general stanley mcchrystal who said that he was knee deep in the decisive
  or in two thousand and ten the u k foreign secretary david miliband who said that at last we would deliver the decisive year and you 'll be delighted to hear in two thousand and eleven today  
 that guido westerwelle the german foreign minister  assures us that we are in the decisive year 
  do we allow any of this to happen  
 well the answer of course is if you spend one hundred and twenty five billion or one hundred and thirty billion dollars a year in a country you co opt almost everybody  
 even the aid agencies who begin to receive an enormous amount of money from the u s and the european governments to build schools and clinics are somewhat disinclined 
 to challenge the idea that afghanistan is an existential threat to global security
  in other words that if anybody believes that it wasn 't such a threat
 oxfam save the children wouldn 't get the money to build their hospitals and schools  
 it 's also very difficult to confront a general with medals on his chest  
 it 's very difficult for a politician because you 're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain you
  you exaggerate your fears  and you 're terrified about the humiliation of defeat 
 what is the solution to this  
 well the solution to this is we need to find a way that people like michael semple or those other people who are telling the truth  
 who know the country  who 've spent thirty years on the ground and most importantly of all  
 the missing component of this
 afghans themselves
  who understand what is going on we need to somehow get their message to the policymakers  and this is very difficult to do
 because of our structures  the first thing we need to change is the structures of our government 
 very very sadly our foreign services the united nations the military
 in these countries have very little idea of what 's going on the average british soldier is on a tour
  of only six months  italian soldiers on tours of four months  
 the american military on tours of twelve months  
 diplomats are locked in embassy compounds when they go out they travel in these curious armored vehicles with these somewhat threatening security teams who ready twenty four hours
  in advance who say you can only stay on the ground for an hour in the british embassy in afghanistan in two thousand and eight
  embassy of three hundred and fifty people there were only three people who could speak dari the main language of afghanistan at a decent level and there was not a single pashto speaker  
 in the afghan section in london responsible for governing afghan policy on the ground 
 i was told last year that there was not a single staff member of the foreign office in that section who had ever served on a
  posting in afghanistan so we need to change that institutional culture and i could make the same points about the united states and the united nations  
 secondly we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals we need to make sure that we 're a little bit suspicious that we understand that optimism is in the dna of the military 
 that we don 't respond to it with quite as much alacrity 
 and thirdly  we need
  to have some humility we need to begin from the position
 that our knowledge our power our legitimacy is limited 
 this doesn 't mean that intervention around the world is a disaster it isn 't 
 bosnia and kosovo were signal successes  
  today when you go to bosnia it is almost impossible to believe that what we saw in the early 
 happened  it 's almost impossible to believe the progress we 've made since one thousand nine hundred and ninety four 
 refugee return which the united nations high commission for refugees thought would be extremely unlikely 
 has largely happened a million properties have been returned  borders between the bosniak territory and the
  territory have calmed down the national army has shrunk  the crime rates in bosnia today are lower than they are in sweden
 this has been done by an incredible  principled effort by the international community 
 and of course  above all by bosnians themselves
  but you need to look at context and this is what we 've lost in afghanistan and iraq you need to understand that in those places what really mattered
 was firstly the role of tudman and milosevic in coming to the agreement  and then the fact those men went that the regional situation improved 
 that the european union could offer bosnia something extraordinary the chance to be part of a new thing a new club a chance to join something bigger
  and finally we need to understand that in bosnia and kosovo a lot of the secret of what we did a
 lot of the secret of our success was our humility
 was the tentative nature of our engagement 
 we criticized people a lot in bosnia for being quite slow to take on war criminals  we criticized them for being quite slow to return refugees  
 but that slowness that caution the fact that president clinton
  initially said that american troops would only be deployed for a year turned out to be a strength  and it helped us to put our priorities right 
 one of the saddest things about our involvement in afghanistan
 is that we 've got our priorities out of sync we 're not matching our resources to our priorities 
 because if what we 're interested in is terrorism pakistan is far more important than afghanistan 
 if what we 're interested in is regional
  stability egypt is far more important if what we 're worried about is poverty and development sub saharan africa is far more important 
 this doesn 't mean that afghanistan doesn 't matter  but that it 's one of forty countries in the world with which we need to engage 
 so if i can finish with a metaphor
 for intervention  what we need to think of
 is something like mountain rescue
 why mountain rescue  
 because when people talk about intervention they imagine that some scientific theory the rand corporation goes around counting forty three previous insurgencies producing 
  mathematical formula saying you need one trained counter insurgent for every twenty members of the population 
 you don 't take a doctorate in mountain rescue  
 you look for somebody who knows the terrain  it 's about context  
 you understand that you can prepare  but the amount of preparation you can do is limited
 you can take some water you can have a map you can have a pack  but what really matters
 is two kinds of problems problems that occur
  on the mountain which you couldn 't anticipate such as for example  ice on a slope  but which you can get around  
 and problems which you couldn 't anticipate and which you can 't get around like a sudden blizzard or an avalanche or a change in the weather 
 and the key to this is a guide who has been on that mountain in every temperature at every period
 a guide who above all  knows when to turn back  who doesn 't press on relentlessly when conditions turn against them 
 what we look for in firemen in climbers in policemen  and what we should look for in intervention is intelligent risk takers not people who plunge blind off a cliff 
 not people who jump into a burning room but who weigh their
  risks weigh their responsibilities  because the worst thing we have done in afghanistan is this idea that failure is not an option  
 it makes failure
 invisible inconceivable and inevitable and if we can resist this crazy slogan
  we shall discover in egypt in syria  in libya and anywhere else we go in the world
 that if we can often do much less than we pretend we can do much more than we fear  thank you very much
  you mentioned libya at the end  just briefly  what 's your take on the current events there and the intervention
  the problem in libya is that we are always pushing for the black or white we imagine there are only two choices  either full engagement and troop deployment
 or total isolation  
 and we are always being tempted up to our neck we put our toes in and we go up to our neck what we should have done in libya is we should have stuck to the u n 
  we should have limited ourselves very very strictly to the protection of the civilian population in benghazi  
 we could have done that 
 we set up a no fly zone within forty eight hours because gaddafi had no planes within forty eight hours  
 instead of which we 've allowed ourselves to be tempted towards regime change in doing so we 've destroyed our credibility with the security council which means it 's very difficult to get a resolution on syria  and we 're setting ourselves up again
  for failure once more humility  limits  honesty  realistic expectations and we could have achieved something to be proud of
