  the following are my opinions and do not reflect the opinions or policies of any particular prosecutor 's office 
 i am a prosecutor  i believe in law and order i am the adopted son of a police officer a marine and a hairdresser  i believe
 in accountability and that we should all be safe in our communities  
 i love my job and the people that do it  
 i just think that it 's our responsibility to do it better 
 by a show of hands  
 how many of you by the age of twenty five had either acted up in school  went somewhere you were specifically told to stay out of
  drank alcohol before your legal age all right 
 how many of you shoplifted  tried an illegal drug
 or got into a physical fight yes even with a sibling 
 now how many of you ever spent one day in jail for any of those decisions
  how many of you sitting here today think that you 're a danger to society or should be defined by those actions of youthful indiscretion laughter
 point taken  
 when we talk about criminal justice reform we often focus on a
  and that 's what i want to talk to you about today  but first i 'm going to since you shared with me i 'm going to give you a confession on my part i went to law school
 to make money  
 i had no interest in being a public servant i had no interest in criminal law and i definitely didn 't think that i would ever be a prosecutor
 near the end of my first year of law school i got an internship in the roxbury division of boston municipal court  i knew of roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in boston
 plagued by gun violence and drug crime 
 my life and my legal career changed the first day of that internship  
 i walked into a courtroom and i saw an auditorium of people
 who one by one would approach the front of that courtroom to say two words and two words only
  they were predominately black and brown  
 and then a judge a defense attorney and a prosecutor would make life altering decisions about that person without their input 
 they were predominately white 
 as each person one by one approached the front of that courtroom  i couldn 't stop but think how did they get here i wanted to know their stories  
 and as the prosecutor read the facts of each case 
 was thinking to myself we could have predicted that that seems so preventable  
 not because i was an expert in criminal law but because it was common sense  
 over the course of the internship i began to recognize people in the auditorium not because they were criminal masterminds
 but because they were coming to us for help and we were sending them out without any
  my second year of law school i worked as a paralegal for a defense attorney and in that experience i met many young men accused of murder 
 even in our worst i saw human stories  
 and they all contained childhood trauma victimization poverty loss  disengagement from school  early interaction with the police and the criminal justice system all leading to a seat in a courtroom
  convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison and it was during those meetings with those men that i couldn 't fathom why we would spend so much money to keep this one person in jail 
  for the next eighty years when we could have reinvested it up front and perhaps prevented the whole thing from happening in the first place 
 my third year of law school i defended people
 accused of small street crimes mostly mentally ill mostly homeless mostly drug addicted all in need of help 
 they would come to us  and we would send them away without that help 
 they were in need of our assistance  but we weren 't giving them
  by people who knew nothing
 about them  
 the staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work  the unfairness of it all made me want to be a defender 
 the power dynamic
 that i came to understand
 made me become a prosecutor 
 i don 't want to spend a lot of time talking about the problem we know the criminal justice system needs reform  we know there are two point
  three million people in american jails and prisons making us the most incarcerated nation on the planet  
 we know there 's another seven million people on probation or parole  we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately affects people of color particularly poor people of color 
 and we know there are system failures happening everywhere that bring people to our courtrooms but what we do not discuss
  our prosecutors are to receive them 
 when we talk about criminal justice reform we as a society focus on three things  we complain we tweet we protest about the police about sentencing laws and about prison  
 we rarely  if ever talk about
 the prosecutor 
 in the fall of two thousand and nine a young man was arrested by the boston police department he was eighteen years old he was african american and he was a senior at a local
  public school  he had his sights set on college but his part time minimum wage job wasn 't providing the financial opportunity he needed to enroll in school 
 in a series of bad decisions he stole thirty laptops from a store
 and sold them on the internet this led to his arrest and a criminal complaint of thirty felony
  the potential jail time he faced is what stressed christopher out the most but what he had little understanding of was the impact a criminal record would have on his future  
 i was standing in arraignments that day when christopher 's case came across my desk and at the risk of sounding dramatic in that moment i had christopher 's life
 in my hands  i was twenty nine years old a brand new prosecutor and
 i had little appreciation for how the decisions i would make would impact christopher 's
 life christopher 's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such but i didn 't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life
 was the right answer 
 for the most part prosecutors step onto the job with little appreciation of the impact of our decisions regardless of our intent  
 despite our broad discretion we learn to avoid risk at all cost rendering our discretion
 basically useless
 history has conditioned us to believe that somehow the criminal justice system brings about accountability and improves public safety despite evidence to the contrary  
 we 're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins so prosecutors aren 't really incentivized to be creative at our case dispositions or to take risks on people we might not otherwise
  to an outdated method  counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want  and that 's safer communities  
 yet most prosecutors standing in my space would have arraigned christopher 
 they have little appreciation
 for what we can do arraigning christopher
 would give him a criminal record  making it harder for him to get a job  setting in motion a cycle that defines the failing
  criminal justice system today with
 a criminal record and without a job christopher would be unable to find employment  education or stable housing 
 without those protective factors in his life christopher would be more likely to commit further more serious crime  the more contact christopher had with the criminal justice system the more likely it would be that he would return again
 and again and again
 all at tremendous
  social cost to his children to his family and to his peers and ladies and gentlemen it is a terrible
 public safety outcome for the rest of us 
 when i came out of law school 
 i did the same thing as everybody else i came out as a prosecutor expected to do justice but i never learned what justice was in my classes none of us do 
 none of us
  and yet prosecutors are the most powerful actors in the criminal justice system 
 our power is virtually boundless in most cases not the judge not the police not the legislature not the mayor not the governor not the president can tell us how to prosecute our cases  
 the decision to arraign christopher and give him a criminal record was
  i would choose whether to prosecute him for thirty felonies for one felony for a misdemeanor or at all 
 i would choose whether to leverage christopher into a plea deal or take the case to trial and ultimately i would be
 in a position to ask for christopher to go to jail 
 these are decisions that prosecutors make every day unfettered  and we are unaware
 and untrained of the grave consequences of those decisions
  one night this past summer i was at a
 small gathering of professional men of color from around the city 
 as i stood there stuffing free finger sandwiches into my mouth as you do as public servant i noticed
 across the room a young man
 waving and smiling at me and approaching me and i i recognized him but i couldn 't place from where and before i knew it this young man
  was hugging me and thanking me 
 you cared about me and you changed my life it
 was christopher 
 see i never arraigned christopher he never faced a judge or a jail he never had a criminal record 
 instead i worked with christopher first on being accountable for his actions  and then putting him in a position where he wouldn 't
 seventy five percent of the computers that he sold and gave them back to best buy and came up with a financial plan to repay for the computers we couldn 't recover 
 christopher did community service he wrote an essay reflecting on how this case could impact his future and that of the community 
 he applied to college he obtained financial aid and he went on to graduate from
  after we finished hugging i looked at his name tag to learn that christopher was the manager of a large bank in boston christopher had accomplished and making a lot more money than me 
 he had accomplished all of this in the six years since i had first seen him in roxbury court  
 i can 't take credit for christopher 's journey to
  but i certainly did my part to keep him on the path 
 there are thousands of christophers out there some locked in our jails and prisons we need thousands of prosecutors to recognize that
 and to protect them an employed christopher is better for public safety than a condemned one it 's a bigger win
 for all of us in retrospect the decision not to throw the book at christopher makes perfect sense  when i saw
  him that first day in roxbury court i didn 't see a criminal standing there i saw myself a young person in need of intervention 
 as an individual caught selling a large quantity of drugs in my late teens  i knew firsthand the power of opportunity as opposed to the wrath of the criminal justice system  
 along the way
  and guidance of my district attorney my supervisor
 and judges  i learned the power of the prosecutor to change lives instead of ruining them 
 and that 's how we do it in boston  
 we helped a woman who was arrested for stealing groceries to feed her kids get a job  
 instead of putting an abused teenager in adult jail for punching another teenager we secured mental health treatment and community supervision a runaway girl
  girl who was arrested for prostituting to survive on the streets needed a safe place to live and grow something we could help her with 
 i even helped a young man who was so afraid of the older gang kids showing up after school that one morning instead of a lunchbox into his backpack he put a loaded 9 millimeter 
 we would spend our time that we 'd normally take prepping our cases for months and months for trial down the road by coming
  up with real solutions to the problems as they presented  
 which is the better way to spend our time 
 how would you prefer your prosecutors to spend theirs 
 why are we spending eighty billion dollars on a prison industry that we know is failing when we could take that money and reallocate it into education
  into mental health treatment into substance abuse treatment and to community investment so we can develop our neighborhoods 
 so why should this matter to you well one we 're spending a lot of money 
 our money 
 it costs one hundred and nine thousand dollars in some states to lock up a teenager for a year with a sixty percent chance that that person will return to the very same system that
  a terrible
 return on investment 
 number two it 's the right thing to do  
 if prosecutors were a part of creating the problem it 's incumbent on us to create a solution and we can do that using other disciplines that have already done the data and research for us  
  and number three your voice and your vote can make that happen the next time there 's a local district attorney 's election in your jurisdiction ask candidates these
  questions one what are you doing to make me and my neighbors safer 
 two what data are you collecting and how are you training your prosecutors to make sure that it 's working and
 number three  if it 's not working for everybody what are you doing to fix it if
 they can 't answer the questions  they shouldn 't be doing the job 
 each one of you that raised your hand at the beginning of this talk is a living breathing example
 of the power of opportunity of intervention of support and of love  
 while each of you may have faced your own brand of discipline for whatever 
  malfeasances you committed  barely any of you needed a day in jail to make you the people that you are today some of the greatest minds on the planet  
 every day thousands of times a day prosecutors around the united states wield power so great that it can bring about catastrophe as quickly as it can bring
  about opportunity intervention  support and yes  even love 
 those qualities are the hallmarks of a strong community and a strong community is a safe one  if our communities are broken don 't let the lawyers that you elect fix them with outdated inefficient expensive methods demand more vote for the prosecutor
  's helping people stay out of jail not putting them in demand better you deserve it your children deserve it the people who are tied up in the system deserve it but most of all the people that we are sworn to 
  protect and do justice for demand it we must  we must do better
