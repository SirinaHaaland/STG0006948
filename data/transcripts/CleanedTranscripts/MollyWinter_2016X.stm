  whenever i get to travel for work i try to find out where my drinking water comes from and where my poop and pee go 
 this has earned me the nickname the poo princess in my family and it 's ruined many family
  because this is not normal  but
 thinking about where it all goes is the first step in activating what are actually superpowers in our poop and pee 
 yeah  and if we use them well  we can live healthier and more beautifully  check out this landscape
 in santa fe new mexico just notice what kinds of words and feelings come to mind 
 this landscape was watered with treated sewage water
 does that change anything for you i imagine it might  and that 's ok 
 how we feel about this
 is going to determine exactly how innovative we can be  and
 i want to explain how it works  but
  poo and the pee and the wash water are going to this treatment plant right in the middle of the community
  it looks more like a park than a treatment plant the poo at the very bottom of all those layers of gravel not touching anyone
 is providing solid food for those marsh plants and the clean clear water that comes out the other end
 is traveling underground to water each person 's yard  so even though they 're in a desert they get their own personal oasis 
 this approach is called integrated
  water management or holistic or  closed loop 
 whatever you want to call it it 's in conflict with the status quo of how we think about sanitation which is contain  treat push it away  
 but in this approach we 're doing one step better we 're designing for reuse from the very beginning because everything does get reused
  now we 're planning for it and often that makes for really beautiful spaces  but the most important thing
 about this system isn 't the technicals of how it works it 's how you feel about it 
 do you want this in your yard  why not 
 i got really curious about this question  why don 't we see more innovation
  why isn 't that kind of thing the new normal  
 and i care so much about this question  that i work for a nonprofit called recode we want to accelerate adoption of sustainable building and development practices  
 we want more innovation 
 but a lot of times whole categories of innovation ones that can help us live more beautifully
 turn out to be illegal today 's regulations and codes were written under the assumption that
 best practices would remain best practices with incremental updates forever and ever 
 but innovation isn 't always incremental
 it turns out how we feel about any particular new technique gets into everything we do how we talk about it  how we encourage people to study our jokes our codes and it ultimately determines how innovative we can be 
 so that 's the first
  reason we don 't innovate in sanitation  
 we 're kind of uncomfortable talking about sanitation  
 that 's why i 've gotten called the poo princess so much  the second reason is 
 we think the problem is solved here in the us  but not so here in the us we still get sick from drinking shit in our sewage water 
  seven million people get sick every year nine hundred die annually and we 're not taking a holistic approach to making it better so we
 're not solving it 
 where i live in portland oregon  i can 't take echo for a swim during the rainy season because we dump raw sewage sometimes into our river 
 our rainwater and our sewage go to the same treatment plant 
 too much rain
 overflows into the river  and portland is not alone here forty
  percent of municipalities  self report dumping raw or partially treated sewage into our waterways  
 the other bummer going on here with our status quo
 is that half of all of your poop and pee is going to fertilize farmland  the other half is being incinerated
 or land filled and that 's a bummer to me because there are amazing nutrients in your daily doody it is comparable
  to pig manure we 're omnivores they 're omnivores think of your poo and pee as a health smoothie for a tree 
 the other bummer going on here is that we 're quickly moving all the drugs we take into our waterways  
 the average wastewater treatment plant
 can remove maybe half of the drugs that come in the
  other half goes right out the other side consider what a cocktail of
 pharmaceuticals hormones steroids vicodin does to a fish to a dog to a child  
 but this isn 't just some problem that we need to contain  
 if we flip this around we can create a resource that can solve so many of our other problems  
 and i want to get you
  comfortable with this idea  so
 imagine the things i 'm going to show you these technologies  and this attitude that says we
 're going to reuse this let 's design to make it beautiful as advanced potty training 
 i think you 're ready for it  i think we as a culture are ready for advanced potty training  and there are three
  great reasons to enroll today number one 
 we can fertilize our food  
 each one of us is pooping and peeing something that could fertilize half or maybe all of our food depending on our diet 
 that dark brown poo in the toilet is dark brown because of what dead stuff bacteria  
 that 's carbon  and carbon if we 're getting that into the soil is going to bind to the other minerals and nutrients
  chemical fertilizers by definition don 't have carbon in them imagine if we could move our animal manure and our human manure
 to our soil we might not need to rely on fossil  fuel based fertilizers mine minerals from far away  
 imagine how much energy we could
  some of us are concerned about industrial pollutants contaminating this reuse cycle 
 that can be addressed  but we need to separate our discomfort about talking about poo and pee
 so we can calmly
 talk about how we want to reuse it and what things we don 't want to reuse and get this 
 if we change our approach to sanitation we can start to
  slow down climate change 
 remember that carbon in the poop  
 if we can get that into our soil bank it 's going to start to absorb carbon dioxide that we put into the air  
 and that could help slow down global warming 
 i want to show you some brave souls who 've had the courage to
  embrace this advanced potty training approach 
 so those folks in new mexico why did they do it ' cause
 they 're in a desert ' cause they save money  yeah  but more importantly  they felt comfortable
 seeing what was going down the toilet as a resource 
 here 's an average house in portland oregon  this house is special because they have a composting toilet turning all their poo and
  over time into a soil amendment 
 their wash water their shower water is going underground to a series of mulch basins  and then watering that orchard downhill  
 when they went to get this permitted  it wasn 't allowed in oregon  but it was allowed in five other states nearby that 
 my organization 's first code change campaign 
 here 's a great example where the integrated water management approach
 was the cheapest this is three  high rise residential buildings in downtown portland  and they 're not flushing to the sewer system 
 how well their wash water is getting reused
 to flush toilets cool mechanical systems water the landscape  
 and then once the building has thoroughly used everything aka shat in it it 's treated to highest standard right
  on site by plants and bacteria  and then infiltrated into the groundwater right below and all that
 was cheaper than updating the surrounding sewer infrastructure so that
 's the last reason we should get really excited about doing things differently we can save a lot of money
  i keep showing examples where everyone 's reusing everything on site why well when we look at our aging infrastructure and it is old
 and we look at the cost of updating it three quarters of that cost is
  the pipes snaking through our city  so as we build anew as we renovate it might make more sense
 to treat and reuse everything on site 
 san francisco realized that it made sense to invest in rebates for every household to reuse their wash water and their rainwater to water the backyard  
 because the amount of water they would save as a community would be so big
  but why were all these projects so innovative the money piece  yeah  
 but more importantly they felt comfortable with this idea of advanced potty training 
 imagine
 if we embraced innovation for sanitation
 the way we have for say solar power
  think about it solar power used to be uncommon and unaffordable now it 's more a part of our web of power than ever before 
 and it 's creating resiliency  we now have sources of power like the sun
 that don 't vary with our earthly dramas 
 what 's driving all that innovation it
 's us we 're talking about energy  it 's cool to talk about energy 
 some folks are even talking about the problems with the limited resources where our current
  energy is coming from we encourage our best and brightest
 to work on this issue better solar panels better batteries everything 
 so let 's talk about where our drinking water is coming from where our poo and pee are actually going 
 if we can get over this discomfort
 with this entire topic we could create something that creates our future goldmine
  every time you flush the toilet i want you to think where is my poop and pee going will they be gainfully employed 
 or are they going to be wreaking havoc in some waterway if you don 't know find out and if you don 't like the answer  figure out how you can communicate to those who can drive this change that you have advanced
  you are ready for reuse how all of you feel is going to determine exactly how innovative we can be thank you so much
