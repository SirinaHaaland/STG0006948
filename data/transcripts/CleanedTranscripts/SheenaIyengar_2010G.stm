  i 'm going to take you around the world in eighteen minutes my base of operations
  is in the u s but let 's start at the other end of the map  in kyoto japan 
 where i was living with a japanese family while i was doing part of my dissertational research fifteen years ago 
 i knew even then that i would encounter cultural differences and misunderstandings but they popped up when i least expected it 
 on my first day i went to a restaurant and i ordered a cup of green tea with sugar
  after a pause the waiter said one does not put sugar in green tea 
 i know i said i 'm aware of this custom but i really like my tea sweet 
 in response he gave me an even more courteous version of the same explanation 
 one does not put sugar in green tea 
 i understand i said that the japanese do not put sugar in their green tea but i 'd like to put some sugar in my green tea
 surprised by my insistence the waiter took up the issue with the manager pretty soon 
 a lengthy discussion ensued and finally the manager came over to me and said 
 i am very sorry we do not have sugar 
 well  since i couldn 't have my tea the way i wanted it i ordered a cup of coffee which the waiter brought brought over promptly
 resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar 
 my failure to procure myself a cup of sweet green tea was not due to a simple misunderstanding 
 this was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice  
 from my american perspective when a paying customer makes a reasonable request based on her preferences she has every
  right to have that request met 
 the american way to quote burger king is to have it your way because as starbucks says happiness is in your choices 
 but from the japanese perspective it 's their duty to protect those who don 't know any better 
 in this case the ignorant gaijin from making the wrong choice
 let 's face it the way i wanted my tea was inappropriate according to cultural standards and they were doing their best to help me save face 
 americans tend to believe that they 've reached some sort of pinnacle in the way they practice choice  
 they think that choice as seen through the american lens best fulfills an innate and universal desire for choice
 in all humans unfortunately these beliefs are
  based on assumptions that don 't always hold true
 in many countries in many cultures at times they don 't even hold true at america 's own borders i 'd like
 to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them  
 as i do so i hope you 'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds 
 first assumption if a choice
 affects you then you should be the one to make it 
 this is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for it is essential for success 
 in america the primary locus of choice is the individual 
 people must choose for themselves sometimes sticking to their guns regardless of what other people want or recommend  it 's called being true
  to yourself 
 but do all individuals benefit from taking such an approach to choice  
 mark lepper and i did a series of studies in which we sought the answer to this very question  
 in one study which we ran in japantown san francisco  we brought seven to 
  children into the laboratory and we divided them up into three groups 
 the first group came in and they were greeted by miss smith who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles  
 the kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do and they even got to choose which marker they would write their answers with 
 when the second group of children came in they were brought to the same room shown the same anagrams but this time miss smith told them which anagrams to do and which markers to write their answers with
 now when the third group came in they were told that their anagrams and their markers had been chosen by their mothers 
 laughter in reality  the kids who were told what to do whether by miss smith or their mothers were actually given the very same activity which their counterparts in the first group had freely chosen 
 with this procedure we were able to ensure that the kids
  across the three groups all did the same activity making it easier for us to compare performance 
 such small differences in the way we administered the activity yielded striking differences in how well they performed
 they did two and a half times more anagrams when they got to choose them
  as compared to when it was chosen for them by miss smith or their mothers 
 it didn 't matter who did the choosing if the task was dictated by another their performance suffered 
 in fact  some of the kids were visibly embarrassed when they were told that their mothers had been consulted 
 one girl named mary said
  performed best when they believed their mothers had made the choice  
 second best when they chose for themselves  and least well when it had been chosen by miss smith 
 a girl named natsumi even approached miss smith as she was leaving the room and tugged on her skirt and asked could you please tell my mommy i did it just like she said
  children were strongly influenced by their immigrant parents ' approach to choice  
 for them  choice was not just a way of defining and asserting their individuality  
 but a way to create community and harmony by deferring to the choices of people whom they trusted and respected 
 if they had a concept of being true to one 's self then that self most likely
  individual  but of a collective 
 success was just as much about pleasing key figures as it was about satisfying one 's own preferences 
 or you could say that the individual 's preferences were shaped by the preferences of specific others  
 the assumption then that we do best when the individual self chooses
 only holds when that
  self
 is clearly divided from others 
 when in contrast two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected 
 then they may amplify one another 's success by turning choosing into a collective act 
 to insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their
 and their relationships  
 yet that is exactly what the american paradigm demands  
 it leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility 
 it requires that everyone treat choice as a private and 
 people that have grown up in such a paradigm might find it motivating  but it is a mistake
  to assume that everyone thrives under the pressure of choosing alone 
 the second assumption which informs the american view of choice goes something like this 
 the more choices you have the more likely you are to make the best choice  so bring it on walmart with one hundred thousand different products
  fifteen million date possibilities now 
 you will surely find the perfect match  
 let 's test this assumption by heading over to eastern europe 
 here i interviewed people who were residents of formerly communist countries who had all faced the challenge of transitioning to a more democratic and capitalistic society 
 one of the most interesting
  came not from an answer to a question  but from a simple gesture of hospitality  
 when the participants arrived for their interview i offered them a set of drinks coke diet coke sprite seven to be exact  
 during the very first session which was run in russia one of the participants made a comment
  it 's all just soda that 's just one choice 
 i was so struck by this comment that from then on i started to offer all the participants those seven sodas  
 and i asked them how many choices are these 
 again and again they perceived these seven different sodas  not as seven
  but as one choice  soda or no soda  
 when i put out juice and water in addition to these seven sodas now they perceived it as only three choices juice water and soda  
 compare this to the die hard devotion of many americans not just to a particular flavor of soda but to a particular brand  
 you know research shows repeatedly that we can 't actually tell the difference between coke and pepsi 
 of course you and i
  know that coke is the better choice 
 for modern americans who are exposed to more options and more ads associated 
  with options than anyone else in the world choice is just as much about who they are as it is about what the product is 
  little difference matters and so every choice matters 
 but for eastern europeans  
 the sudden availability of all these consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge 
 they were flooded with choice before they could protest that they didn 't know how to swim  
 when asked what words and images do you associate
  for me it is fear there are some dilemmas you see i am used to no choice 
 bohdan from kiev said  in response to how he felt about the new consumer marketplace 
 it is too much  we do not need everything that is there 
 a sociologist from the warsaw survey agency explained the older generation jumped from nothing
 to choice all around them
  were never given a chance to learn how to react 
 and tomasz a young polish man said 
 i don 't need twenty kinds of chewing gum  i don 't mean to say that i want no choice  but many of these choices are quite artificial 
 in reality many choices are between things that are not that much different
  of choice depends on our ability to perceive differences between the options 
 americans train their whole lives to play spot the difference 
 they practice this from such an early age that they 've come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability in
 fact though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice we don 't all see choice in
  same places or to the same extent 
 when someone can 't see how one choice is unlike another 
 or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast  the process of choosing can be confusing and frustrating  
 instead of making better choices we become overwhelmed by choice  sometimes even afraid of it 
 choice no longer offers opportunities but imposes
  constraints  it 's not a marker of liberation but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae 
 in other words choice can develop into the very opposite of everything it represents in america
 when it is thrust upon those who are insufficiently prepared for it  
 but it is not only other people in other places that are feeling the
  pressure of ever increasing choice  americans themselves are discovering that unlimited choice
 seems more attractive in theory than in practice we all have physical mental and emotional 
 laughter limitations that make it impossible for us to process every single choice we encounter even in the grocery store let alone over the course of our entire
  lives 
 a number of my studies have shown that when you give people ten or more options when they 're making a choice  
 they make poorer decisions  whether it be health care  investment other critical areas  
 yet still many of us believe that we should make all our own choices and seek out even more of them
  this brings me to the third and perhaps most problematic assumption 
 you must never say no to choice 
 to examine this  let 's go back to the u s and then hop across the pond to france  
 right outside chicago a young couple susan and daniel mitchell were about to have their first baby 
 they 'd already picked out a name for her barbara  after her grandmother
 one night when susan was seven months pregnant she started to experience contractions and was rushed to the emergency room 
 the baby was delivered through a c section but barbara suffered cerebral anoxia a loss of oxygen to the brain 
 unable to breathe on her own she was put on a ventilator 
 two days later  the doctors gave the mitchells a choice
 they could either remove barbara off the life support in which case she would die within a matter of hours 
 or they could keep her on life support 
 in which case she might still die within a matter of days  if she survived she would remain in a permanent vegetative state 
 never able to walk  talk or interact with others
 what do they do what do any parent do 
 in a study i conducted with simona botti and kristina orfali  
 american and french parents were interviewed 
 they had all suffered the same tragedy 
 in all cases the life support was removed  and the infants had died
 there was a big difference 
 in france  the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be removed  
 while in the united states the final decision rested with the parents 
 we wondered does this have an effect on how the parents cope with the loss of their loved one 
 we found that it did
  even up to a year later american parents were more likely to express negative emotions as compared to their french counterparts 
 french parents were more likely to say things like 
 noah was here for so little time but he taught us so much  he gave us a new perspective on life 
 american parents were more likely to say things like
 what if 
 another parent complained i feel as if they purposefully tortured me how did they get me to do that 
 and another parent said i feel as if i 've played a role in an execution 
 but when the american parents were asked if they would rather have had the doctors make the decision they all said
 they could not imagine turning that choice over to another even though having made that choice made them feel trapped  
 guilty  angry in a number of cases they were even clinically depressed 
 these parents could not contemplate giving up the
  because to do so would have gone contrary to everything they had been taught
 and everything they had come to believe about the power and purpose of choice 
 in her essay the white album joan didion writes 
 we tell ourselves stories in order to live 
 we interpret what we see select the most workable of the multiple choices  
  entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images by the idea with which we have learned to freeze
 the shifting phantasmagoria  which is our actual experience 
 the story americans tell the story upon which the american dream depends is the story of limitless choice
  narrative
 promises so much freedom  happiness success 
 it lays the world at your feet and says you can have anything everything 
 it 's a great story and it 's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it 
 but when you take a close look you start to see the holes
  and you start to see that the story can be told in many other ways  
 americans have so often tried to disseminate their ideas of choice  
 believing that they will be or ought to be welcomed with open hearts and minds  
 but the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn 't always work
  the phantasmagoria the actual experience that we try to understand and organize through narrative varies from place to place 
 no single narrative serves the needs of everyone everywhere  
 moreover americans themselves
 could benefit from incorporating new perspectives into their own narrative which has been driving their choices for so
  long  robert frost once said
 that it is poetry that is lost in translation 
 this suggests that whatever is beautiful and moving 
 whatever gives us a new way to see cannot be communicated to those who speak a different language  
 but joseph brodsky said that it is poetry that is
 gained in translation suggesting that translation can be a creative transformative act 
 when it comes to choice we have far more to gain than to lose
 by engaging in the many translations of the narratives  
 instead of replacing one story with another we can learn
  from and revel in the many versions that exist and the many that have yet to be written no matter where we 're from
 and what your narrative is  we all have a responsibility to open ourselves up to a wider array of what choice can do 
 and what it can represent
  and this does not lead to a paralyzing moral relativism rather
 it teaches us when and how to act  
 it brings us that much closer to realizing the full potential of choice 
 to inspiring the hope and achieving the freedom that choice promises but doesn 't always deliver 
 if we learn to speak to one another  albeit through translation
  we can begin to see choice in all its strangeness  complexity
 and compelling beauty  thank you
  a detail
 about your biography that we have not written in the program book but by now it 's evident to everyone in this room you 're blind  and
 i guess one of the questions on everybody 's mind is how does that influence your study of choosing because that 's an activity that for
 most people is associated with visual inputs like
  funny that you should ask that because
 one of the things that 's interesting about being blind is you actually get a different vantage point when you observe the way sighted people make choices and as you just mentioned there 's lots of choices out there that are very visual these days yeah
 i as
 you would expect get pretty frustrated by choices like what nail polish to put on because i have to rely on what other people suggest and i can 't decide 
 and so one time i was in a beauty salon
  i was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink and one was called ballet slippers and the other one was called adorable 
 and so i asked these two ladies and the one lady told me well you should definitely wear ' ballet slippers
  glamorous shade of pink 
 and so i asked them well how do i tell them apart what 's different about them and they said well one is elegant the other one 's glamorous okay we got that 
 and the only thing they had consensus on well if i could see them i would clearly be able to tell them apart 
 and what i wondered was whether they were being affected by the name or the content of the color so i decided
  to do a little experiment 
 so i brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory and i stripped the labels off  and i brought women into the laboratory and i asked them which one would you pick 
 fifty percent of the women accused me of playing a trick of putting the same color nail polish in both those bottles
  to wonder who the trick 's really played on
  now of the women that could tell them apart when the labels were off they picked adorable and when the labels were on they picked 
 ballet slippers 
 so as far as i can tell a rose by any other name probably does look different and maybe
  even smells different
