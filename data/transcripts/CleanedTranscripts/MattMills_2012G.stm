  so wouldn 't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do 
 as we 're walking around being able to to point a phone at anything  and then have it actually recognize images and objects like the human
  and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of of knowledge and experiences and ideas well
 traditionally that was seen as science fiction but now we 've moved to a world where actually this has become possible  
 so the best way of explaining it is to just show it what you can see over here is tamara who is holding my phone that 's now plugged in so
 let me start with this what we have here is a painting of the great
 poet rabbie burns  and it 's just a normal image but if we now switch inputs over to the phone running our technology
  technology you can see effectively what tamara 's seeing on the screen  and when she points at this image something magical happens
  no trickery here 
 there 's nothing done to this image  and what 's great about this is the technology 's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does 
 not only that but as i move the object around  
 it 's going to track it
 and overlay that content seamlessly 
  the thing that 's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become all the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself 
 now this has applications everywhere  
 whether in things like art in museums like you just saw or in the world of say advertising or print journalism  
 so a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it 's printed and here is this morning 's newspaper 
 and we have some wimbledon news which is
  now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bulletin voice to the grass and it 's very important that
 you adapt and you you have to be flexible you have to be willing to change direction at a split second 
 and she does all that she 's won this title mm 
 and that linking of the digital content to something that 's physical is what we call an aura and i 'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk 
  what 's great about this is it isn 't just a faster more convenient way to get information in the real world  but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible 
 so what i have here is a wireless router my american colleagues have told me i 've got to call it a router  so that everyone hereunderstands 
 but nonetheless here is the device 
 so now what i
 can do is rather than getting the instructions for the device online i can simply point at it the device is recognized  and then voice 
 begin by plugging in the grey adsl cable then connect the power  
 finally the yellow ethernet cable  congratulations you have now completed setup
  in the  u k by scientists at cambridge  and
 they work in our offices and i 've got a lovely picture of them here they couldn 't all be on stage but we 're going to bring their aura to the stage so here they are 
 they 're not very animated this was the fourth take i 'm told 
  as we 're talking about cambridge let 's now move on to technical advancements because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than less than twelve months ago the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate  
 and that means that i can now take 
  3d models and place them in the world around me so i have one over here 
  after the fun comes the more emotional side of what we do  because effectively this technology allows you to see the world through someone 's eyes and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world 
 what 's great about this is the tools to do this are free they 're open they 're available to everyone within our application  and educators have really got on board with with the classrooms  
  so we have teachers who 've tagged up textbooks teachers who 've tagged up school classrooms and a great example of this
  a school in the u k i have a picture here from a video  and we 're now going to play it
  it 's not magic it 's available for everyone to do  and actually i 'm going to show you how easy it is to do
 by doing one right now so as sort of i 'm told it 's called a stadium wave so we 're going to start from this side of the room on the count of three and go over to here 
 tamara are you recording  okay  so are you all ready  
 one two three  go audience whooooooo mm 
 fellows are really good at that 
 okay  now we 're going to switch back into the aurasma application  and what tamara 's going to do is is tag
 that video that we just took onto my my badge  so that i can remember it forever
  now we have lots of people who are doing this already
 and we 've talked a little bit about the educational side on the emotional side we have people who 've done things like
 send postcards and christmas cards back to their family
 with with little messages on them we have people who have 
 for example taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine  so that if you 're stuck and you want
  find out more you can point and discover the information 
 we 're all very very familiar with the internet 
 in the last twenty years it 's really changed the way that we live and work and the way that we see the world  
 and what 's great is we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift  because
 now we can literally take the content that we share we discover  and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us
 it 's completely free to download this application if you have a good wi fi connection or 3g this process is very very quick oh there we are we can save it now 
 it 's just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint  and the great thing is if you 're a professional user 
  to what we 've just used to create this demonstration the only difference is that you 've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content
 you now ready
