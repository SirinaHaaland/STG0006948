  many of you here  i am trying to contribute
 towards a renaissance in africa the question of transformation in africa really is a question of leadership  africa can only be transformed
 by enlightened leaders
 and it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent  
 i want to tell you some stories
 that explain my view we all heard about the importance of stories yesterday an american friend of mine
 this year volunteered as a nurse in ghana and in a period of three
  months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in africa that had taken me over a decade to reach twice
 she was involved in surgeries
 where they lost power at the hospital the emergency generators did not start there was not a
  not a lantern not a candle pitch black the patient 's cut open  twice 
 the first time it was a c section thankfully baby was out
 mother and child survived  the second time
 was a procedure that involved local anesthesia  anesthetic wears off the patient feels pain he 's crying
 's praying  pitch black 
 not a candle not a flashlight  and that hospital could have afforded flashlights they
 could have afforded to purchase these things but they didn 't  and it happened twice  another time she watched in horror
 as nurses watched a patient die
  because they refused to give her oxygen that they had 
 and so three months later just before she returned to the united states 
 nurses in accra go on strike and her
 her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone  start all over again  start all over again  
 now what does this have to do with leadership
 you see the folks at the ministry of of health 
 the hospital administrators  the doctors  the nurses
 they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education
 after secondary school they are the elite  they are our leaders their decisions
  their actions matter and when they fail a nation literally suffers 
 so when i speak of leadership  
 i 'm not talking about just political leaders we 've heard a lot about that i 'm talking about the elite  
 those who 've been
  whose job it is to be the guardians of their society  
 the lawyers  the judges the policemen  the doctors  the engineers  the civil servants
 those are the leaders  and we need to train them right now my first pointed
 and memorable experience with leadership in ghana occurred when i was sixteen years old we had just had a military coup
  soldiers were pervasive in our society they were a pervasive presence  
 and one day i go to the airport to meet my father  and as i walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building  
 i 'm stopped by two soldiers wielding 
 assault weapons  and they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this
  embankment why because the path i had taken
 was considered out of bounds  no sign to this effect now i was sixteen 
 i was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill 
 i was especially concerned of what the girls girls might think 
 and so i started to argue with these men
  a little reckless but you know i was sixteen 
 i got lucky a ghana airways pilot falls into the same predicament because of his uniform they speak to him differently and they explain to him
 that they 're just following orders so he takes their radio  talks to their boss  and gets us all released 
 what lessons would you take from an experience like this several for me leadership matters
  those men are following the orders of a superior officer 
 i learned something about courage  it was important not to look at those guns  and i also learned
 that it can be helpful to think about girls 
 so a few years after this event i leave ghana on a scholarship to go to swarthmore college
 for my education it was a breath of fresh air 
 you know  the faculty there didn 't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them
 as i was used to back in ghana they wanted us to think critically they wanted us to be analytical  they wanted us to be concerned about social issues
  my economics classes i got high marks for my understanding of
 basic economics  but i learned something more profound than that which is that
 the leaders the managers of ghana 's economy
 were making breathtakingly bad decisions
 that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse  and so here was this lesson again leadership matters  it matters a great deal
  but i didn 't really fully understand what had happened to me
 at swarthmore i had an inkling
  but i didn 't fully realize it until i went out into the workplace and i went to work at microsoft corporation
  and i was part of this team
 this thinking learning team
 whose job it was to design and implement new software
 that created value in the world  and it was it was brilliant to be part of this team it was brilliant  and i realized
 just what had happened to me at swarthmore this transformation
 the ability the ability to confront problems complex problems  
 and to design solutions to those problems  the ability to create
 is the most
  empowering thing that can happen to an individual  and i was part of that now  while i was
 at microsoft  the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the gdp of the republic of ghana 
 and by the way  it 's continued to the gap has
 widened since i left  
 now  i 've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred i mean it 's the people there
 who are so hardworking persistent creative
  empowered  but there were also some external factors 
 free markets the rule of law  infrastructure these things
 were provided by institutions run by the people that i
  call leaders  and those leaders did not emerge spontaneously somebody trained them to do the work that they do  
 now while i was at microsoft this funny thing happened i became a parent 
 and for the first time  africa mattered more to me than ever before because i realized
 that the state of the african continent
 would matter to my
  children and their children that the state of the world
 the state of the world depends on what 's happening
 to africa as far as my kids would be concerned and at this time when i was going through
 what i call my
  somalia had disintegrated into anarchy  
 rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war  and it seemed to me that that that was the wrong direction and i needed to be back
 helping i couldn 't just stay in seattle
 and and raise my kids in an upper middle class neighborhood and feel good about it this was not the world
 that that i 'd want my children to grow up
  i decided to get engaged  and the first thing that i did
 was to come back to ghana and talk with a lot of people
 and really try to understand what the real issues were and three things kept coming up
 for every problem  corruption  weak institutions
 and the people who run them the leaders now
 i was a little scared because when you see those three problems they seem really hard to deal with 
 and they might say look don 't even try but for me i asked the question well where are these leaders coming from
 what is it about ghana
 that produces leaders that are unethical
 or unable to solve problems so i went to look
  was happening in our educational system and it was the same
 learning by rote from primary school through graduate school very little emphasis
 on ethics  and 
 the typical graduate from a university in ghana
 has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility this is wrong
 so i decided to engage this particular problem 
 because it seems to me that every society 
 every society  must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders  and ghana
 was not paying enough attention  and
  this is what i 'm doing now i 'm trying to bring
 the experience that i had at swarthmore
 to africa  i wish there was a liberal arts college in every african country i
 think it would make a huge difference  and what ashesi university is trying to do
 is to train a new generation
 of
 ethical  entrepreneurial leaders we
 're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity who have the ability to confront the complex problems  ask the right questions  and come up with
 workable solutions i 'll admit that there are times when it
  but we must believe that these kids are smart that if we involve them in their education if we have them discuss
 the real issues that they confront that our whole society confronts
 and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world that magic will
  just started classes and a month into it  i come to the office  and i have this email from one of our students  
 and it said very simply 
 i am thinking now 
 and he signs off thank you 
 it 's such a simple statement
  but i was moved almost to tears because i understood what was happening to this young man  and it is an awesome thing
 to be a part
 of empowering someone in this way  i am thinking now 
 this year we challenged our students to craft
  an honor code themselves there 's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code and if so what it should look like 
 one of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart 
 can we create a perfect society 
  honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection
 is incredible 
 now we cannot achieve perfection but if we reach for it 
 then we can achieve excellence  i don 't know ultimately what they will do i don 't know whether they will decide to have this honor code 
 but the conversation they 're having now about
  what their good society should look like what their excellent society should look like is a really good thing am
 i out of time  ok  
 now  
  i just wanted to leave that slide up
 because it 's important that we think about it i 'm very excited
 about the fact that every student at ashesi university
 does community service before they graduate that for many of them it has been a life altering experience 
 these young future leaders
 are beginning to understand
 the real business of
  leadership the real privilege of leadership  which is after all to serve humanity  
 i am even more thrilled
 by the fact that least year
 our student body elected a woman
 to be the head of student government it 's the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of
  student government at any university  
 it says a lot about her  it says a lot about the culture that 's forming
 on campus  it says a lot about her peers who elected her 
 she won with seventy five percent of the vote  
 and it gives me a lot of hope  it turns out that corporate west africa
 also appreciates
 what 's happening with our students we 've graduated two classes of students
 to date  and every single one of them has been placed  
 and we 're getting great reports back from corporate ghana corporate west africa  and the things that they 're most impressed about is work ethic
  what they 're doing  the persistence their ability to deal with ambiguity their ability to
 tackle problems that they haven 't seen before this is good
 because over the past five years there have been times when i 've felt this is
 of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right  i think
 that the current and future leaders of africa have an incredible opportunity
 to drive a major renaissance on the continent  
 it 's an incredible opportunity there aren 't very many more opportunities like this in the world i believe
  that africa has reached an inflection point
 with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent we have reached a moment
 from which can emerge a great society within one generation it will depend on inspired leadership
  and it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference  thank you
