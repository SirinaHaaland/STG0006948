  in a very small country town
 in victoria i
 had a very normal low key kind of upbringing  i went to school  i hung out with my friends  i fought with my younger
  was all very normal  and when i was fifteen a member of my local community
 approached my parents and wanted to nominate me for a community achievement award 
 and my parents said hm
 that 's really nice but there 's kind of one glaring problem with that she hasn 't actually achieved anything 
 and they were
  went to school  i got good marks  
 i had a very  low key after school job in my mum 's hairdressing salon and
 i spent a lot of time watching buffy the vampire slayer and dawson 's creek yeah 
 i know what a contradiction 
 but they were right you know i wasn 't doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all
  i wasn 't doing anything that could be considered an achievement if you took disability out of the equation 
 years later
  i was on my second teaching round in a melbourne high school  and i was about twenty minutes into a year eleven legal studies class
 when this boy put up his hand and said hey miss  
 when are you going to start doing your speech and i said what speech you know i 'd been talking them about defamation
  's usually in the big hall and
 that 's when it dawned on me this kid had only ever experienced disabled people as objects
  to this kid and it 's not his fault i mean that 's true for many of us 
 for lots of us disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our manicurists  we 're not real people we are there to inspire
  and in fact   i am sitting on this stage looking like i do
 in this wheelchair and you are probably kind of expecting me to inspire
 well ladies and gentlemen  
 i 'm afraid i 'm going to disappoint you dramatically i
 am not here to inspire you  i am here to tell you that we have been lied to
 about disability  yeah we 've been sold the lie that disability is a bad thing
  capital t it 's a bad thing and to live with a disability makes you exceptional  
 it 's not a bad thing  and it doesn 't make you exceptional  
 and in the past few years we 've been able to propagate this lie even further
 via social media   you may have seen images like this
  these are just a couple of examples but there are a lot of these images out there you know you might have seen the one the little girl with no hands drawing a picture with a pencil held in her
  you might have seen a child running on carbon fiber prosthetic legs
  and these images there are lots of them out there they are what we call inspiration porn 
 laughter and i use the term porn deliberately because they objectify one group of people
 for the benefit of another group of people so in this case we 're objectifying disabled people for the benefit of
  these images is to inspire you to motivate you  so that we can look at them
 and think well however bad my life is it could be worse  i could be that person 
 but what if you are that person  
 i 've lost count of the
  number of times that i 've been approached by strangers wanting to tell me that they think i 'm brave or inspirational 
 and this was long before my work had any kind of public profile 
 they were just kind of congratulating me for managing to get up in the morning and remember my own name 
 and it is objectifying these images those images objectify disabled
  they are there so that you can look at them and think that things aren 't so bad for you to put your worries
 into perspective  and
 life as a disabled person
 is actually somewhat difficult we do overcome some things but the things that we 're overcoming are not the things that you think they are
  not things to do with our bodies 
 i use the term disabled people quite deliberately because i subscribe to what 's called the social model of disability which tells us that we are more disabled
 by the society that we live in
 than by our bodies and our diagnoses  so
 i have lived in this body a long time i 'm quite fond of
  does the things that i need it to do and i 've learned
 to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have  and that 's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well  they 're not doing anything out of the ordinary 
 they are just using their bodies to the best of their capacity 
 so is it really fair to objectify them in the way that we do to share those images 
  mean it as a compliment  and i know why it happens it 's because of the lie it 's because we 've been sold this lie that disability makes you exceptional  
 and it honestly doesn 't  
 and i know what you 're thinking you know i 'm up here bagging out inspiration and you 're thinking jeez stella aren 't you inspired sometimes by some things 
 and the thing is i am
  i learn from other disabled people all the time  i 'm learning
 not that i am luckier than them though i am learning that it 's a genius idea to use a pair of barbecue tongs to pick up things that you dropped 
 laughter i 'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge your mobile phone battery from your chair battery
  genius we are learning from each others ' strength and endurance not against our bodies and our diagnoses but against a world that 
  exceptionalizes and objectifies us i really think that this lie that we 've been sold about disability is the greatest injustice
  quote the only disability in life is a bad attitude the reason that that 's bullshit
 is because it 's just not true because of the social model of disability   no amount of
 smiling at a flight of stairs has ever made it turn into a ramp
  no amount of standing in the middle of a bookshop and radiating a positive attitude is going to turn all those books into braille  it 's just not
 just not going to happen  i really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception but the norm
  i want to live in a world where a  15 year old girl sitting in her bedroom watching buffy the vampire slayer isn 't referred to as achieving anything because she 's doing it sitting down  
 i want to live in a world where we don 't have such low expectations
 of disabled people that we are congratulated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning i want to live in a world where we value genuine
  achievement for disabled people  
 and i want to live in a world where a kid in year eleven in a melbourne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user 
 disability doesn 't make you exceptional  but questioning what you think you know about it does
