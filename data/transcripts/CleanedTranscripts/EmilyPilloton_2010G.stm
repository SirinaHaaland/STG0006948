  a place that i now call home it
 's a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve
  so this is bertie county north carolina usa 
 to give you an idea of the where so here 's north carolina and if we zoom in 
 bertie county is in the eastern part of the state  it 's about two hours east driving time from raleigh  and it 's very flat it 's very swampy it
 's mostly farmland  
 the entire county is home to just twenty thousand people and they 're very sparsely distributed so there 's only twenty seven people per square mile which comes down to about ten people per square kilometer
  bertie county is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural america  we 've seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the american borders 
 we know the symptoms  it 's the hollowing out of small towns it 's downtowns becoming ghost towns  
 the brain drain where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back it 's the dependence on farm subsidies and
 under performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban 
 and bertie county is no exception to this  perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with like many communities similar to it is that there 's no
 shared collective investment in the future of rural communities only six point eight percent of all our philanthropic giving in the u s right now benefits rural communities and yet twenty percent of our population lives there
 so bertie county is not only very rural it 's incredibly poor  it is the poorest county in the state
 it has one in three of its children living in poverty  and it 's what is referred to as a rural ghetto the economy is mostly agricultural the biggest crops are cotton and tobacco 
  and we 're very proud of our bertie county peanut  the biggest employer is the purdue chicken processing plant the county seat is windsor this is like
 times square of windsor that you 're looking at right now it 's home to only two thousand people and like a lot of other small towns it has been hollowed out over the years there are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use 
 you can count the number of restaurants in the county on one hand bunn 's barbecue being my absolute favorite  but in the whole county there is no coffee shop there 's no internet cafe there 's no movie theater there 's no
  bookstore there isn 't even a walmart  
 racially  the county is about sixty percent african american but what happens in the public schools is most of the privileged white kids go to the private lawrence academy  so 
  the public school students are about eighty six percent african american and this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class and you can see the difference is pretty stark 
  county is struggling would be a huge understatement  there 's basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor 's degree or higher so there isn 't a big legacy
 in the pride of education 
 in fact two years ago only twenty seven percent of all the third through eighth graders were passing the state standard in both english and math 
 so it
  sounds like i 'm painting a really bleak picture of this place but i promise there is good news  
 the biggest asset in my opinion one of the biggest assets in bertie county right now is this man this is dr chip zullinger fondly known as  dr 
 z he was brought in in october two thousand and seven as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system
  he previously was a superintendent in charleston south carolina and then in denver colorado
 he started some of the country 's first charter schools in the late ' 80s in the  u s and he is
 an absolute renegade and a visionary and he is the reason that i now live and work there  
 so in february of two thousand and nine dr zullinger invited us project h design which is a non profit design firm that i founded
 to come to bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a
  design perspective to the repair of the school district and he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process
 one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that don 't usually have access to design services or creative capital 
 specifically we use these six design directives probably the most important being number two we design with not for in that
  design it 's not about designing for clients anymore  it 's about designing with people and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within 
 so at the time of being invited down there we were based in san francisco  and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of two thousand and nine
 spending about half our time in bertie county and when i say we i mean project
 but more specifically i mean myself and my partner matthew miller who 's an architect and a sort of macgyver type builder
  so fast forward to today and we now live there i have strategically cut matt 's head out of this photo because he would kill me if he knew i was using it
 because of the sweatsuits  but
 this is our front porch we live there  we now call this place home over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth we realized we had fallen in love with the place we had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that
  we 're able to do in a rural place like bertie county that as designers and builders  you can 't do everywhere
 there 's space to experiment and to weld and to test things we have an amazing advocate in dr zullinger there 's a nobility of real
 work but beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there there is a huge need there is a total vacuum of creative capital in
  bertie county there isn 't a single licensed architect in the whole county  and so we we saw an opportunity to bring design as this
 untouched tool something that bertie county didn 't otherwise have 
 and to be sort of the to usher that in as a new type of tool in in their tool kit the initial goal became using design within the public education system
  in partnership with dr zullinger that was why we were there  but beyond that we recognized that bertie county  
 as a community was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness
 and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking  so the goal became  yes to apply design within education but then to figure out how to make education a great vehicle for community development  
 so in order to do this
  we 've taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education and i should say that these are three things that we 've done in bertie county but i feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other
 rural communities around the u s and maybe even beyond  
 so the first of the three is design for education 
 this is the most kind of direct obvious intersection of the two things  it 's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students this is in response
  to the the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we 're building schools out of these days 
 and so this played out for us in a couple different ways the first was a series of renovations of computer labs so traditionally the computer labs  
 particularly in an under performing school like bertie county where they have to benchmark test every other week  
 the computer lab is a
  come in you face the wall you take your test and you leave 
 so we wanted to change the way that students approach technology to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging more accessible and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology based instruction
 so this is the lab at the high school and the principal there is in love with this room every time he has visitors it 's the first place that he takes them  and this also meant the
  the co creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape it allows elementary level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity 
  and running around and screaming and being a kid so this game that the kids are playing here in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called match me and in match me  you take the class divide it into two teams one team on each side of the playground and the teacher will take a piece of chalk
  and just write a number on each of the tires 
 and then she 'll call out a math problem so let 's say four times four and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is sixteen and find the tire with the sixteen on it and sit on it 
 so the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins 
 and the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores
  scores a greater comfort level with the material especially with the boys that in going outside and playing they aren 't afraid to take on
 a double digit multiplication problem
 and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material  
 so with design for education i think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers
  they have the incentive and the desire to use them
 so this is mr perry he 's the assistant superintendent he
 came out for one of our teacher training days and won like five rounds of match me in a row and was very proud of himself 
 laughter so the second approach is redesigning education itself this is the most complex  it 's a
  how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom so in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible
 and the incentive to want to make change which is easier said than done in rural communities and in
 in inside the box education systems in rural communities  
 so for us this was a graphic public campaign called connect bertie there are thousands of these blue dots all over the county  and this was for a fund
 that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system 
 right now i should say there are only ten percent of of the houses that actually have an in home internet connection and the only places to get wifi are in the school buildings or at the bojangles fried chicken joint  which i find myself squatting outside of a lot
 wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place  it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community it asked them 
  to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community 's development  
  we 're helping dr zullinger develop
 some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day  
 and then the third approach which is what i 'm most excited about which is where we are now 
 is design as education so design as education means that we could actually teach design within public schools and not design based learning not like let 's learn physics by building a rocket but actually
  coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose
  it also means that designers are no longer consultants but we 're teachers and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation and what design offers 
  as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring  rigid  verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by
  allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways  
 so we started thinking about the the legacy of shop class and how shop class wood and metal shop class in particular historically has been something intended for kids who aren 't going to go to college  it 's a vocational training path 
 projects are things like let 's make a birdhouse for your mom for christmas 
 and in recent decades a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely  
 so we thought what if you could bring back shop class but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed and to infuse shop class with a more critical and 
  studio process so we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with dr zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one year curriculum offered at the high school
 to the junior class and so this starts in four weeks at the end of the summer and my partner and i matthew and i 
 just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it 
 and this is what it looks like so over the course of two semesters the fall and the spring 
 the students spend three hours a day every single day in our four thousand five hundred square foot studio
  and during that time they 're doing everything from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need finding coming back into the studio doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts 
  that might work and then moving into the shop and actually testing them building them prototyping them  figuring out if they are going to work and refining that 
  us to build these projects in the community  so the first project which will be built next summer
 farmers ' market downtown  followed by
 bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year  so these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say i built that and i 'm
  want you to meet three of our students this is ryan 
 she is fifteen years old 
 she loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher she wants to go to college but she wants to come back to bertie county because that 's where her family is from where she calls home and she feels very strongly about 
  giving back to this place that she 's been fairly fortunate in so what studio h might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way 
 is really into dirtbike racing  and he wants to be an architect 
 so for him studio h offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client  
 and then this is anthony he is sixteen years old  loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything
 with his hands  and so for him studio h means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands on engagement he 's interested in forestry but he isn 't sure so if he ends 
  up not going to college he will have developed some industry relevant skills what design and building really offers to public education is a different kind of classroom  so this building downtown 
 which may very well become the site of our future farmers ' market is now the classroom and going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and
  and from where and why
 that 's a homework assignment and the ribbon cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers ' market and it 's open to the public
 that 's the final exam 
 and for the community what design and building offers is real visible built progress it 's one project per year and it makes the youth the biggest asset and the biggest untapped resource in imagining a new future 
 so we recognize
  that studio h especially in its first year is a small story
 thirteen students it 's two teachers it 's one project in one place  
 but we feel like this could work in other places and i really strongly believe in the power of the small story because
 it is so difficult to do humanitarian work at a global scale because when you zoom out that far you lose the ability to view people as humans
  ultimately design itself is a process of constant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers and let 's face it designers  we need to reinvent ourselves we need to re educate ourselves around the things that matter  
 we need to work outside of our comfort zones more and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard 
 so while this is a very small story  we hope that it represents a step in the right
  direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design thank you
