  there 's a great big elephant in the room called the economy  
 so let 's start talking about that i wanted to give you a current picture of the economy  
 that 's what i have behind myself 
 but of course what we have to remember is this
 and what you have to think about is when you 're dancing in the flames what 's next  so what i 'm going to try to do in the next seventeen and a half minutes
 is i 'm going to talk first about the flames where we are in the economy
 and then i 'm going to take three trends that have taken place at ted over the last twenty five years
 and that will take place in this conference and i will try and bring them together  and i will try and give you a sense of what the
  ultimate reboot looks like those three trends are the ability to engineer cells 
 the ability to engineer tissues  and robots  and somehow it will all make sense 
 but anyway let 's start with the economy there 's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there one is leverage  
 and the problem with
  a normal commercial bank
 has nine to ten times leverage that means for every dollar you deposit it loans out about nine or ten 
 a normal investment bank is not a deposit bank it 's an investment bank it has fifteen to twenty times  
 it turns out that b of a in september had thirty two times  and your friendly citibank had
 forty seven times oops  that means every bad loan goes bad forty seven times over  
 and that of course is the reason why all of you are making such generous and wonderful donations to these nice folks  
 and as you think about that you 've got to wonder  so what do banks have in store for you now
  it ain 't pretty
 the government meanwhile has been acting like santa claus  
 we all love santa claus right  but the problem with santa clause is if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks
  have been doing and promising folks  it turned out that in 
  percent
 was mandatory spending
 on what we call entitlements and then by two thousand and seven it was sixty eight percent  
 and we weren 't supposed to run into one hundred percent until about two thousand and thirty  except we 've been so
 busy giving away a trillion here a trillion there that we 've brought that date of reckoning forward
 to about two thousand and seventeen and we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids but guess what we 're going to start to pay them  
 and the problem with this stuff is now that the bill 's come due  it turns out santa isn 't quite as cute when it 's summertime
  here 's some advice from one of the largest investors in the united states  this guy runs the china investment corporation 
 he is the main buyer of u s treasury bonds and he gave an interview in december 
 here 's his first bit of advice
  and here 's his second bit of advice  
 and by the way
  chinese prime minister reiterated this at davos last sunday 
 this stuff is getting serious enough that if we don 't start paying attention to the deficit we 're going to end up losing the dollar 
 and then all bets are off let me show you what it looks like i think i can safely say
 that i 'm the only trillionaire in this room  this is an actual bill
  and it 's ten triliion dollars  the only problem with this bill is it 's not really worth very much 
 that was eight bucks last week four bucks this week a buck next week  
 and that 's what happens to currencies when you don 't stand behind them  
 so the next time somebody
  as cute as this shows up on your doorstep and sometimes this creature 's called chrysler and sometimes ford and sometimes whatever you want
 you 've just got to say no and you 've got to start banishing a word
 that 's called entitlement 
 and the reason we have to do that in the short term is because we have just run out of cash if you look at the federal budget  
 this is what it looks like the orange slice is what 's discretionary  everything else is mandated it
 makes no difference if
  we cut out the bridges to alaska in the overall scheme of things  
 so what we have to start thinking about doing is capping our medical spending because that 's a monster that 's simply going to eat the entire budget  
 we 've got to start thinking about asking people to retire a little bit later  
 if you 're sixty to sixty five you retire on time your four hundred and one just got nailed  if you 're fifty to sixty we want you to work two years
  if you 're under fifty we want you to work four more years the reason why that 's reasonable is when your grandparents were given social security  they got it at sixty five and were expected to check out at 
  is young today we 've also got to cut the military about three percent a year  we 've got to limit other mandatory
  we 've got to quit borrowing as much because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie  and we 've got to end up with a smaller government and if we don 't start changing this trend line we are going to lose the dollar
 and start to look like iceland
 i got what you 're thinking  this is going to happen
 when hell freezes over  but let me remind you this december it did snow in vegas
 here 's what happens if you don 't address this stuff 
 so japan had a fiscal real estate crisis back in the late ' 80s 
 and its two hundred and twenty five largest companies today are worth one quarter of what they were eighteen years ago  we don 't fix this now how would you like to see a dow three thousand five
  because that 's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff and unless you want this person to not just become the cfo of florida but the united states  
 we 'd better deal with this stuff 
 that 's the short term that 's the flame part 
 that 's the financial crisis 
 now right behind the financial crisis there 's a second and bigger wave that we need to talk about that wave is much larger much more powerful and that 's of course the wave of technology  
 and what 's really important in this stuff is
  as we cut we also have to grow 
 among other things because startup companies are 02 percent of u s gdp investmentm
 and they 're about seventeen point eight percent of output 
 it 's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the u s economy and that 's what we 've got to keep growing we don 't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere  
 so let 's bring a romance novelist into this conversation
 and that 's where these three trends come together  
 that 's where the ability to engineer microbes  the ability to engineer tissues and the ability to engineer robots
 begin to lead to a reboot  
 and let me recap some of the stuff you 've seen craig venter showed up last year and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware
 where you can insert dna and have it
  boot up as a different species 
 in parallel the folks at mit have been building a standard registry of biological parts 
 so think of it as a radio shack for biology you can go out and get your proteins your rna your dna whatever and start building stuff 
 in two thousand and six they brought together high school students and college students and started to build
  these little odd creatures they just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards here was one of the first things they built 
 so cells have this cycle first they don 't grow then they grow exponentially then they stop growing  
 graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in 
 so they engineered these cells so that when they 're growing in the exponential phase they would smell like wintergreen  
 and when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas  and you could tell very easily when your experiment
  was working and wasn 't and where it was in the phase  
 this got a bit more complicated two years later twenty one countries came together dozens of teams they started competing  the team from rice university
 started to engineer
 the substance in red wine that makes red wine good for you into beer  
 so you take resveratrol and you put it
  into beer of course one of the judges is wandering by and he goes wow cancer fighting beer  there is a god laughter
 the team from taiwan was a little bit more ambitious they tried to engineer bacterias in such a way that they would act as your kidneys 
 four years ago  i showed you this picture
  and people oohed and ahhed because cliff tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken  and that was very cool stuff back then 
 but now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering let me show you what 's happened in that period of time 
 two years ago you saw this creature an almost extinct animal from xochimilco mexico called an axolotl
 that can re generate its limbs you can freeze half
  you can freeze half the brain  it regrows it 's almost like leaving congress 
 but now you don 't have to have the animal itself to regenerate 
 because you can build cloned mice molars in petri dishes  
 and of course if you can build mice molars in petri dishes you can
  born with no teeth you
 give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy 
 you re grow a set of teeth  
 but then if you lose one of those second set of teeth they don 't regrow unless if you 're a lawyer 
 but of course for most of us 
 we know how to grow teeth and therefore we can take adult stem teeth  put them on a biodegradable mold
  tooth and simply implant it  and we can do it with other things so a spanish woman who was dying of t b 
 had a donor trachea they took all the cells off the trachea they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage  
 she regrew her own trachea and seventy two hours later it was implanted  
 she 's now running around with her kids  this is going on in tony atala 's lab in wake forest where he
 is re growing ears for injured soldiers  and he 's also  re growing bladders  so there are now nine women walking around boston
 with  re grown bladders  which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags for the rest of your life 
 this is kind of getting boring right i mean you understand where this story 's going 
  it gets more interesting last year  this group was able to take all the cells off a heart leaving just the cartilage  
 then they sprayed stem cells onto that heart from a mouse  those stem cells self organized and that heart started to beat  
 life happens 
 this may be one of the ultimate papers  this was done in japan and in the u s published at the same time  and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells last year
  that meant that you can take the stuff right here  and turn it into almost anything in your body  
 and this is becoming common it 's moving very quickly it 's moving in a whole series of places  
 third trend robots  
 those of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now we would have rosie the robot from the jetsons in our house  and all we 've got is a roomba
 we also thought we 'd have this robot to warn us of danger didn
 't happen and these were robots engineered for a flat world right so rosie runs around on skates
 and the other one ran on flat threads if you don 't have a flat world that 's not good  which is why the robot 's we 're designing today
 are a little different
  this is boston dynamics ' bigdog 
 and this is about as close as you can get to a physical turing test o k 
 so let me remind you a turing test is where you 've got a wall you 're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall  and when you don 't know if that thing is human or animal
 that 's when computers have reached human intelligence this is not an intelligence turing rest but this is as close as you can
  get to a physical turing test and this stuff is moving very quickly and by the way that thing can carry about three hundred and fifty pounds of weight 
 these are not the only interesting robots  you 've also got flies  the size of flies that are being made by robert wood at harvard 
 you 've got stickybots that are being made at stanford
  as you bring these things together as you bring
 cells  biological tissue engineering and mechanics together  you begin to get some really odd questions 
 in the last olympics  this gentleman who had several world records in the special olympics tried to run in the normal olympics 
 the only issue with oscar pistorius is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs
  he came within about a second of qualifying he sued to be allowed to run  and he won the suit  but didn 't qualify by time 
 next olympics you can bet that oscar or one of oscar 's successors is going to make the time  
 and two or three olympics after that they are going to be unbeatable  
 and as you bring these trends together and as you think of what it means to take people who are profoundly deaf who can now begin to hear i mean
  the evolution of hearing aids right i mean your grandparents had these great big
 cones and then your parents had these odd boxes that would squawk at odd times during dinner  
 and now we have these little buds that nobody sees  and now you have cochlear implants that go into people 's heads
 and allow the deaf to begin to hear now they can 't hear as well as you and i can 
  in ten or fifteen machine generations they will and these are machine generations not human generations  
 and about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can they 'll be able to hear
 maybe how bats sing or how whales talk or how dogs talk and
 other types of tonal scales they 'll be able to focus their hearing they 'll be able to increase the sensitivity decrease the sensitivity do a series of things that we can 't do  and the same thing is happening
  a group in germany that 's beginning to engineer eyes so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark very primitive  
 and then they 'll be able to see shape  
 and then they 'll be able to see color and then they 'll be able to see in definition and one day they 'll see as well as you and i can 
 and a couple of years after that they 'll be able to see in ultraviolet they 'll be able to see in infrared they 'll be able to focus their eyes they 'll be able to
  'll do stuff you and i can 't do 
 all of these things are coming together  and it 's a particularly important thing to understand as we worry about the flames of the present 
 to keep an eye on the future and of course the future is looking back two hundred years because next week is the 200th anniversary
 of darwin 's birth
 and darwin of course argued
 that evolution is a natural state it is a natural state in everything that is alive including hominids 
 there have actually been twenty two species of hominids that have been around have evolved have wandered in different places have
  it is common for hominids
 to evolve  and that 's the reason why as you look at the hominid fossil record erectus and 
 and floresiensis and neanderthals  and homo sapiens all overlap  
 the common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids not one  and as you think of the
  implications of that here 's a brief history of the universe  the universe was created thirteen point seven billion years ago  and then you created all the stars and all the planets and all the galaxies and all the milky ways  
 and then you created earth about four point five billion years ago  
 and then you got life about four billion years ago  
 and then you got hominids about zero point zero zero six billion years
  and then you got our version of hominids about zero point zero zero one five billion years ago ta dah 
 maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe  and all the galaxies and all the planets and all the energy and all the dark energy and all the rest of stuff
 is to create what 's in this room  
 maybe not that would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint
  if that 's not the purpose of the universe then what 's next laughter
 i think what we 're going to see is we 're going to see a different species of hominid  
 i think we 're going to move from a homo sapiens into a homo evolutis 
 and i think this isn 't one thousand years out i think most of us are going to glance at it and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it and a homo evolutis
  brings together these three trends into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control over the evolution of his species her species
 and other species and that of course would be the ultimate reboot
