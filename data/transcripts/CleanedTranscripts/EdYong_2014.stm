  a herd of wildebeests a shoal of fish a flock of birds many animals gather in large groups that are among the most wonderful spectacles in the natural world but
 why do these groups form  
 the common answers include things like seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs
 or gathering to mate or breed 
 and all of these explanations while often true  make a huge assumption about animal behavior that the animals are in control of their own actions that they are in charge of their bodies  
 and that is often not the case  
 this is artemia a brine
  you probably know it better as a sea monkey  
 it 's small and it typically lives alone but it can gather in these large red swarms that span for meters  
 and these form because of a parasite these shrimp are infected with a tapeworm a tapeworm is effectively a long living gut with genitals at one end and a hooked mouth at the other as a freelance journalist i sympathize  
 the tapeworm drains nutrients from artemia 's body but it also does
  other things  it castrates them  it changes their color from transparent to bright red 
 it makes them live longer and as biologist nicolas rode has found it makes them swim in groups  
 why  because the tapeworm like many other parasites has a complicated life cycle involving
  are just one step on its journey its ultimate destination is this the greater flamingo 
 only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce so to get there it manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming these conspicuous colored swarms that are 
 easier for a flamingo to spot and to devour  and that is the secret of the artemia
  they aren 't sociable through their own volition but because they are being controlled it 's not safety in numbers  it 's actually the exact opposite  
 the tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies  turning them into vehicles for getting itself into a flamingo 
 and here is another example of a parasitic manipulation  this is a suicidal cricket  
 this cricket swallowed the larvae of a gordian worm or horsehair worm the worm grew to adult size
  size within it  but it needs to get into water in order to mate and it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket 's brain  causing it to behave erratically  
 when the cricket nears a body of water such as this swimming pool  it jumps in and drowns and the worm wriggles out of its suicidal corpse 
 crickets are really roomy who knew
  the tapeworm and the gordian worm are not alone they are part of an entire cavalcade of mind controlling parasites of fungi viruses and worms and insects 
  and more that all specialize in subverting and overriding the wills of their hosts  
  about twenty years ago  and then later through a wonderful book called parasite rex by my friend carl zimmer  
 and i 've been writing about these creatures ever since few topics in biology enthrall me more  it 's like the parasites have subverted my own brain  
 because after all they are always compelling and they are delightfully macabre when you write about parasites your lexicon swells with phrases like devoured alive and bursts out of its
  but there 's more to it than that i 'm a writer and fellow writers in the audience will know that we love stories
 parasites invite us to resist the allure of obvious stories their world is one of plot twists and unexpected explanations  
 why for example does this caterpillar start violently thrashing about when another insect gets close to it and those white cocoons that it seems to be standing guard over is it
  maybe protecting its siblings 
 this caterpillar was attacked by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it the eggs hatched and the young wasps devoured the caterpillar alive before bursting out of its body  see what i mean 
 now  the caterpillar didn 't die some of the wasps seemed to stay
 stay behind and controlled it into defending their siblings which are metamorphosing into adults within those cocoons this caterpillar is a head banging
  zombie bodyguard defending the offspring of the creature that killed it 
 we have a lot to get through i only have thirteen minutes 
 now some of you are probably just desperately clawing for some solace in the idea that these things are oddities of the natural world
 that they are outliers  and that point of view is understandable because by their nature parasites are quite small and they spend a lot of their time inside the bodies of other things 
 they 're easy to overlook  but that doesn 't mean that they aren 't important 
 a few years back a man called kevin lafferty took a group of scientists into three californian estuaries and they pretty much weighed and dissected and recorded everything they could find  
 and what they found were
  parasites in extreme abundance  
 especially common were trematodes tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts like this unfortunate snail  
 now a single  trematode is tiny microscopic  but collectively they weighed as much as all the fish in the estuaries and three to nine times more than all the birds
  and remember the gordian worm that i showed you the cricket thing one japanese scientist called takuya sato found that in one stream 
 these things drive so many crickets and grasshoppers into the water that the drowned insects make up some sixty percent of the diet of local trout 
 manipulation is not an oddity it is a critical and common part of the world around us 
 and scientists have now found hundreds of examples of such manipulators
  to understand exactly how these creatures control their hosts and this is one of my favorite examples  this is
 the emerald cockroach wasp  and it is a truth universally acknowledged that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession of some fertilized eggs must be in want of a cockroach 
 when she finds one she stabs it with a stinger that is also a sense organ
 this discovery came out three weeks ago she
 stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ equipped with small sensory bumps that allow her to feel the distinctive texture of a roach 's brain  
 so like a person blindly rooting about in a bag she finds the brain  and she injects it with venom into two very specific clusters of neurons
  and ram gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon  it doesn 't kill the roach nor does it sedate it the roach could walk away or fly or run if it chose to but it doesn 't choose to 
 because the venom nixes its motivation to walk and only that the wasp basically un checks the escape from danger box in the roach 's operating system  allowing her to lead her helpless
  victim back to her lair by its antennae like a person walking a dog 
 and once there she lays an egg on it egg hatches devoured alive bursts out of body yadda yadda yadda you know the drill 
 now i would argue that once stung  the cockroach isn 't a roach anymore it 's more of an extension of the wasp just like the cricket was an extension of the gordian worm
  these hosts won 't get to survive or reproduce they have as much control over their own fates as my car 
 once the parasites get in the hosts don 't get a say  
 now humans of course are no stranger to manipulation we take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains and to change our moods  and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas if not an attempt to influence someone else 's mind
  but our attempts at doing this are crude and blundering compared to the fine grained specificity of the parasites  don draper only wishes he was as elegant and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp  
 now i think this is part of what makes parasites so sinister and so compelling  
 we place such a premium on our free will and our independence that the prospect of losing
  those qualities to forces unseen informs many of our deepest societal fears  orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals and 
 these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction  but in nature they happen all the time 
 which leads me to an obvious
  sinister parasites that are influencing our behavior without us knowing about it besides the nsa 
 if there are any i 've
 got a red dot on my forehead now don 't i 
 if there are any this is a good candidate for them this is toxoplasma
  for short because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname
 toxo infects mammals  a wide variety of mammals  but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat  
 and scientists like joanne webster have shown that if toxo gets into a rat or a mouse it turns the rodent into a cat seeking missile 
 if the infected rat smells the delightful odor of cat piss it runs towards the source of the smell rather than the more sensible direction of
  away  the cat eats the rat toxo gets to have sex
  we don 't really know we know that toxo releases an enzyme that makes dopamine a substance involved in reward and motivation we know it targets certain parts of a rodent 's brain  including those involved 
  in sexual arousal but how those puzzle pieces fit together is not immediately clear 
  even have a body  but it 's manipulating a mammal  
 we are mammals  we are more intelligent than a mere rat to be sure  but our brains have the same basic structure the same types of cells  the same chemicals running through them  and the same parasites
  estimates vary a lot but some figures suggest that one in three people around the world have toxo in their brains now typically this doesn 't lead to any overt illness 
 the parasite holds up in a dormant state for a long
  period of time  
 but there 's some evidence that those people who are carriers score slightly differently on personality questionnaires than other people that they have a slightly higher risk of car accidents 
 and there 's some evidence that people with schizophrenia are more likely to be infected 
  opinion is divided as to whether the parasite is truly influencing our behavior  
 but given the widespread nature of such manipulations  it would be completely implausible for humans to be the only species that weren 't similarly affected  
 and i think that
 this capacity to constantly subvert our way of thinking about the world makes parasites amazing they 're constantly inviting
  to look at the natural world sideways and to ask if the behaviors we 're seeing whether they 're simple and obvious or baffling and puzzling are not the results of individuals acting through their 
  own accord but because they are being bent to the control of something else  
  origin of species charles darwin writes about the grandeur of life  and of endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful 
 and i like to think he could easily have been talking about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks 
 but perhaps that 's just a parasite talking
