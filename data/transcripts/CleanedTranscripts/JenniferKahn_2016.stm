  so this is a talk about gene drives but i 'm going to start by telling you a brief story  
 twenty years ago a biologist named anthony james got obsessed with the idea of making mosquitos that didn 't transmit malaria
  pretty much a complete failure 
 for one thing it turned out to be really hard to make a malaria resistant mosquito 
 james managed it finally just a few years ago  by adding some genes that make it impossible for the malaria parasite to survive inside the mosquito  
 but that just created another problem 
  now that you 've got a malaria resistant mosquito how do you get it to replace all the malaria carrying mosquitos 
 there are a couple options  but plan a was basically to breed up a bunch of the new genetically engineered mosquitos release them into the wild and hope that they pass on their genes 
 the problem was that you 'd have to release literally ten times the number of native mosquitos to work  
 so in a village with ten thousand mosquitos you release an extra
 one hundred thousand
  as you might guess this was not a very popular strategy with the villagers 
 then last january  anthony james got an email from a biologist named ethan bier 
 bier said that he and his grad student valentino gantz had stumbled on a tool that could not only guarantee that a particular genetic trait would be inherited  
 but that it would spread incredibly quickly 
  were right it would basically solve the problem that he and james had been working on for twenty years  
 as a test  they engineered two mosquitos to carry the anti malaria gene and also this new tool a gene drive which i 'll explain in a minute  
 finally they set it up so that any mosquitos that had inherited the anti malaria gene wouldn 't have the usual white
  but would instead have red eyes  that was pretty much just for convenience so they could tell just at a glance which was which 
 so they took their two anti malarial red eyed mosquitos and put them in a box with thirty ordinary white eyed ones  and let them breed 
 in two generations  those had produced three thousand eight hundred grandchildren 
 that is not the surprising part  this is the surprising part
  when james opened the box all three thousand eight hundred mosquitos had red eyes  
 when i asked ethan bier about this moment he became so excited that he was literally shouting into the phone  
 that 's because getting only red eyed mosquitos violates a rule that is the
  genetics says when a male and a female mate their baby inherits half of its dna from each parent  
 so if our original mosquito was aa and our new mosquito is ab where b is the anti malarial gene the babies should come out in four permutations 
 ba  instead with the new gene drive  they all came out
  that shouldn 't even be possible so what happened 
 the first thing that happened was the arrival of a gene editing tool known as  crispr in two thousand and twelve  
 many of you have probably heard about crispr so i 'll just say briefly that crispr is a tool that allows researchers to edit genes very precisely easily and quickly  
 it does this by harnessing a mechanism that already existed in bacteria basically there 's a protein that acts like a scissors and cuts the dna  and there 's an rna molecule that
  the scissors to any point on the genome you want 
 the result is basically a word processor for genes you can take an entire gene out put one in or even edit just a single letter within a gene 
 and you can do it in nearly any species  
 ok  remember how i said that gene drives originally had two problems  the first was that it was hard to engineer a mosquito
 to be malaria resistant that 's basically
  gone now thanks to crispr but the other problem was logistical how do you get your trait to spread this is where it gets clever 
 a couple years ago a biologist at harvard named kevin 
  esvelt wondered what would happen if you made it so that crispr inserted not only your new gene but also the machinery that does the cutting and pasting  
 in other words what if crispr also copied and pasted
 itself you 'd end up with a perpetual motion machine for gene editing  
 and that 's exactly what happened  this crispr gene drive that esvelt created
 not only guarantees that a trait will get passed on 
 but if it 's used in the germline cells  it will automatically copy and paste your new gene into both chromosomes of every single individual it 's like a global search and
  replace or in science terms it makes a heterozygous trait homozygous  
 so 
 what does this mean for one thing it means we have a very powerful but also somewhat alarming new tool 
 up until now the fact that gene drives didn 't work very well was actually kind of a relief 
 normally when we mess around with an organism 's genes we make that thing less evolutionarily fit
  so biologists can make all the mutant fruit flies they want without worrying about it if some escape  natural selection just takes care of them 
 what 's remarkable and powerful and frightening about gene drives is that that will no longer be true  
 assuming that your trait does not have a big evolutionary handicap like a mosquito that can 't fly
  gene drive will spread the change relentlessly until it is in every single individual in the population 
 now it isn 't easy to make a gene drive that works that well but james and  esvelt think that we can 
 the good news is that this opens the door to some remarkable things 
 if you put an anti malarial gene drive in just one percent of anopheles mosquitoes the species that transmits malaria  
 researchers estimate that it would spread to the entire population in a year
  so in a year you could virtually eliminate malaria  
 in practice we 're still a few years out from being able to do that but still a one thousand children a day die of malaria  
 in a year that number could be almost zero 
 the same goes for dengue fever  chikungunya  yellow fever  
 and it gets better say you want to get rid of
  get asian carp out of the great lakes all you have to do is release a gene drive that makes the fish produce only male offspring 
 in a few generations there 'll be no females left no more carp 
 in theory this means we could restore hundreds of native species that have been pushed to the brink 
 ok  that 's the good news this is the bad news gene drives are so effective
 that even an accidental release could change an entire
  species  and often very quickly  
 anthony james took good precautions he bred his mosquitos in a bio containment lab and he also used a species that 's not native to the us so that even if some did escape  they 'd just die off there 'd be nothing for them to mate with 
 but it 's also true that if a dozen asian carp with the all male gene drive accidentally got carried
 from the great lakes back to asia they could potentially wipe out the native asian carp population  
 and that 's not so unlikely given how connected our world is in fact it 's why we have an invasive species problem  
 and that 's fish things like mosquitos and fruit flies 
 there 's literally no way to contain them they cross borders and oceans all the time  
 ok  the other piece of bad news is that a gene drive might not stay confined to what we call the target species
 that 's because of gene flow which is a fancy way of saying that neighboring species sometimes interbreed 
 if that happens it 's possible a gene drive could cross over like asian carp could infect some other kind of carp  
 that 's not so bad if your drive just promotes a trait like eye color  in fact there 's a decent chance that we 'll see a wave of very weird fruit flies in the near future
  could be a disaster if your drive is deigned to eliminate the species entirely  
 the last worrisome thing is that the technology to do this to genetically engineer an organism and include a gene drive 
 is something that basically any lab in the world can do 
 an undergraduate can do it 
 a talented high schooler with some equipment can do it 
  nearly every scientist i talk to seemed to think that gene drives were not actually that frightening or dangerous  
 partly because they believe that scientists will be very cautious and responsible about using them 
 so far that 's been true  but gene drives also have some actual limitations so for one thing they work only in sexually reproducing species
  be used to engineer viruses or bacteria 
 also the trait spreads only with each successive generation  so changing or eliminating a population is practical only if that species has a fast reproductive cycle like insects or maybe small vertebrates like mice or fish  
 in elephants or people it would take centuries for a trait to spread widely enough to matter 
 also even with crispr it 's not that easy to engineer a truly devastating trait say you wanted to make a fruit fly that feeds
  on ordinary fruit instead of rotting fruit with the aim of sabotaging american agriculture 
 first you 'd have to figure out which genes control what the fly wants to eat  which is already a very long and complicated project  
 then you 'd have to alter those genes to change the fly 's behavior to whatever you 'd want it to be which is an even longer and more complicated project 
  might not even work because the genes that control behavior are complex  
 so if you 're a terrorist and have to choose between starting a grueling basic research program that will require years of meticulous lab work and still might not pan out or just blowing stuff up 
 you 'll probably choose the later 
 this is especially true because at least in theory it should be pretty easy to build what 's called a reversal drive 
 that 's one that basically overwrites the change made by the first gene drive  so if you don 't like the effects of a change you can just release a second drive that will cancel it out
  least in theory  
 ok  so where does this leave us 
 we now have the ability to change entire species at will 
 should we are we gods now i
 'm not sure i 'd say that but i would say this 
 first some very smart people are even now debating how to regulate gene drives
 at the same time some other very smart people are working hard to create safeguards like gene drives that self regulate or peter out after a few generations  
 that 's great 
 but this technology still requires a conversation  
 and given the nature of gene drives that conversation has to be global 
 what if kenya wants to use a drive but tanzania doesn 't who decides whether to release a gene drive that can fly
  fly 
 i don 't have the answer to that question all we can do going forward i think is talk honestly about the risks and benefits
 and take responsibility for our choices  
 by that i mean not just the choice to use a gene drive but also the choice not to use one 
 humans have a tendency to assume that the safest option is to preserve the
  status quo  but that 's not always the case 
 gene drives have risks and those need to be discussed  but malaria exists now and kills one thousand people a day 
 to combat it we spray pesticides that do grave damage to other species including amphibians and birds  
 so when you hear about gene drives in the coming months  and trust me you will be hearing about them  remember that
  it can be frightening to act  but sometimes not acting is worse
