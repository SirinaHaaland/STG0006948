  always to find ways to to chronicle to share and to document
 stories about people just everyday people stories that offer transformation
  that lean into transcendence  but that are never sentimental that never look away from the darkest things about us  because
 i really believe that we 're never more beautiful than when we 're most ugly  because that 's really
 the moment we really know what we 're made of 
 as chris said  i grew up in nigeria with a whole generation
 in the ' 80s of students who were protesting a military dictatorship which has finally ended
  so it wasn 't just me there was a whole generation of us  but what i 've come to learn
 is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures  but in the simple
 accumulation of gentle soft  almost invisible acts of compassion  
 everyday acts of compassion 
 in south africa they have a phrase called ubuntu
  ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me  but if you 're like me  
 my humanity is more like a window  i don 't really see it i don 't pay attention to it until there 's you know 
 like a bug that 's dead on the window then suddenly i see it and usually
  it 's never good it 's usually when i 'm cussing in traffic
 at someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee and send emails and make notes so
 what ubuntu really says is that there is no way for us to be human without other people it
 's really very simple but really very complicated so i thought i should start with
 some stories i should tell you some stories about remarkable people so i thought i 'd start with my mother
 laughter and she was dark too my mother was english my parents met in oxford in the ' 50s and my mother moved to nigeria and lived there she was five foot two very feisty
 and very english this is how english my mother is or was she just passed she came out to california to los angeles to visit me and we went to malibu which
  and then we went to a fish restaurant  
 and we had chad the surfer dude serving us  and he came up and my mother said do you have any specials young man 
 and chad says sure like we have this like salmon that 's like rolled in this like wasabi like crust it 's totally rad and
 my mother turned to me and said what language is he speaking
  americans we gave them a language why don 't they use it 
 so this woman
  who converted from
 the church of england to catholicism when she married my father and there 's no one more rabid than a catholic convert
  decided to teach
 in the rural areas in nigeria  particularly among igbo women the billings ovulation method 
 which was the only approved birth control by the catholic church but
 her igbo wasn 't too good  so she took me along to translate i was seven 
 so here are these women who never discuss their period
  never would have thought of herself as a feminist my mother but she always used to say anything a man can do i can fix
  when my father complained about this situation where she 's taking a seven year old boy
 to teach this birth control you know
 he used to say oh you 're turning him into you 're teaching him how to be a woman my mother said someone has to 
 this woman
  we were caught in the war it was my mother with five little children 
 it takes her one year through refugee camp after refugee camp to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country 
 at every single refugee camp she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother mark who was nine  and make him a boy soldier can
 you imagine this five foot two woman  standing up to men with guns who want to kill us
  all through that one year
  mother never cried one time not once  but when we were in lisbon  in the airport about to fly to england this woman saw my mother
 wearing this dress which had been washed so many times it was basically see through 
 with five really hungry looking kids came over and asked her what had happened  and she told this woman and so this woman emptied out her suitcase
 and gave all of her clothes to
  mother and to us and the toys of her kids who didn 't like that very much but 
 that was the only time she cried and i remember years later i was writing about my mother and i asked her why did you cry then 
 and she said you know you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble 
 any kind of horror  but the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you
 the old women in my father 's village after this war had happened  
 memorized the names of every dead person  
 and they would sing these dirges made up of these names dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you 
  and they would sing them only when they planted the rice as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead
 into the rice  
 but when it came for harvest time  they would sing these joyful songs that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that year 
 and then the next planting season when they sang the dirge they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were
  and in this way these women enacted
 a lot of transformation  beautiful transformation  did you know that before the genocide in rwanda the word for rape
 and the word for marriage was the same one 
 but today women are rebuilding rwanda  did you also know that after apartheid
  when the new government went into the parliament houses there were no female toilets in the building 
 which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men 
 all of this to say that despite the horror and despite the death women are never really counted 
 their humanity never seems to matter
 very much to us
  when
  the igbo part of the country where i 'm from there were always rites of passage for young men men were taught to be men
 in the ways in which we are not women that 's essentially what it is and
 a lot of rituals involved killing killing little animals progressing along so when i turned thirteen
 and i mean it made sense it was an agrarian community somebody
  to kill the animals there was no whole foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at so
 when i turned thirteen it was my turn now to kill a goat and
 i was this weird sensitive kid who couldn 't really do it  but i had to do it and i was supposed to do this alone but a friend of mine called emmanuel who
 was significantly older than me who 'd been a boy soldier during the biafran war decided to come with me
  sort of
 made me feel good  because he 'd seen a lot of things now when i was growing up he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people  and their intestines would fall out but they would keep running 
 so this guy
 comes with me and i don 't know if you 've ever heard a goat or seen one
 they sound like human beings that 's why we call tragedies a
 song of a goat 
  my friend brad kessler says
 that we didn 't become human until we started keeping goats
  anyway a goat 's eyes are like a child 's eyes  
 so when i tried to kill this goat and i couldn 't 
 emmanuel bent down he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat covers its eyes  so i don 't have to look into them 
 while i kill the goat it didn
  like a lot for
 this guy who 'd seen so much  and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience  
 still found it in himself to try to protect me  
 i was a wimp i cried
 for a very long time  and afterwards he didn 't say a word he just sat there watching me cry for an hour 
 and then afterwards he said to me it will always be difficult  
 but if you cry like this every time  you will die of heartbreak
 just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult 
 of course talking about goats makes me think of sheep and not in good ways so 
 i was born two days after christmas  so
  growing up you know i had a cake and everything but i never got any presents because born two days after christmas so
 i was about nine  and my uncle had just come back from germany  and
 we had the catholic priest over my mother was entertaining him with tea and my uncle suddenly says where 
  and my mother said don 't talk about that in front of guests but he was desperate to show that he 'd just come back so he summoned me up and he said go into the bedroom my bedroom
  anything you want out of the suitcase  it 's your birthday present i
 'm sure he thought i 'd take a book or a shirt  
 but i found an inflatable sheep so
 i blew it up and ran into the living room my finger where it shouldn 't have been 
  was waving this buzzing sheep around and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock 
 and father mcgetrick was completely unflustered just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said it 's all right daphne  i 'm scottish
  my last days in prison  the last eighteen months my cellmate
 for the last year  the first year of the last eighteen months
 my cellmate was fourteen years old the name was john james  and in those days if a
  family member committed a crime  the military would hold you as ransom
 till your family turned themselves in 
 so here was this 14 year old kid on death row  and not everybody on death row was a political prisoner there were some really bad people there  and
 he had smuggled in two comics two comic books spiderman and x men he was obsessed and
 when he got tired of reading them he started to teach the men in death row how to read with these comic books  and so
  so i remember night after night you 'd hear all these men these really hardened criminals huddled around john james  
 reciting take that spidey 
 it 's incredible i was really worried he didn 't know what death row meant  
  i heard it on the grapevine they killed him 
 they handcuffed him to a chair  and they tacked his penis to a table
 with a six inch nail then left him there
 to bleed to death
  that 's how i ended up in solitary  because i let my feelings be known 
 all around us everywhere there are people like this  the igbo
 used to say
 that they built their own gods they would come together as a community  and they would express a wish and their wish would then be brought to a priest
 who would find a ritual object and the appropriate sacrifices would be made and the shrine would be built for the god  but if the god
 became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice  the igbos would destroy the god 
 they would knock down the shrine and they would stop saying the god 's name 
 this is how they came to reclaim their humanity
 all of us here we 're building gods that have gone rampant and it 's time we started knocking them down
 and forgetting their names  
 it doesn 't require a tremendous thing 
 all it requires is to recognize among us every day the few of us that can see are surrounded
 by people like the ones i 've told you
