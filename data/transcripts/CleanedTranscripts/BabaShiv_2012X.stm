  a slightly somber note two thousand and seven five years ago  my wife
 gets diagnosed with breast cancer stage iib now looking back the most harrowing part of that experience was not
  just the hospital visits these were very painful for my wife understandably so 
 it was not even the initial shock of knowing that she had breast cancer at just thirty nine years old  absolutely no history of cancer in her family  
 the most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience was we were making decisions after decisions after decisions that were being thrust upon us 
 should it be a mastectomy should it be a lumpectomy
  should it be a more aggressive form of treatment given that it was stage iib with all the side effects or should it be a less aggressive form of treatment  
 and these were being thrust upon us by the doctors 
 now you could ask this question why were the doctors doing this a simplistic answer would be the doctors are doing this because
 they want to protect themselves legally  i think that is too simplistic these are
 well meaning doctors some of them have gone on to become very good friends 
 they probably were simply following the wisdom that has come down through the ages this adage that when you 're making decisions especially decisions of importance  
 it 's best to be in charge  it 's best to be in control it 's best to be in the driver 's seat 
 and we were certainly in the driver 's seat making all these
  let me tell you if some of you have been there it was a most agonizing and harrowing experience 
 which got me thinking i said is there any validity to this this whole adage that when you
 're making decisions  it 's best to take the driver 's seat be in charge be in control  or
 are there contexts where we 're far better off taking the passenger 's seat and have someone else drive for example a trusted financial advisor
  could be a trusted doctor etc  and since
 i study human decision making  i said i 'm going to run some studies to find some answers  and i 'm going to share one of these studies with you today  so 
 imagine that all of you are participants in the study  i want to tell you that what you 're going to do in the study is 
 you 're going to drink a cup of tea  if you 're wondering why i 'll tell you why in a few seconds from now you are going to solve a series of puzzles and i 'm going to show you
  examples of these puzzles
 momentarily  and the more puzzles you solve the greater the chances that you 'll win some prizes  
 now  why do you have to consume the tea  why because it makes a lot of sense in order to solve these puzzles effectively 
 if you think about it your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously  
 right  it needs to be alert
  for which caffeine is very good 
 simultaneously
  it needs to be calm not agitated calm for which chamomile is very good 
 now comes the 
 design  the ab design the ab testing so what i 'm going to do is randomly assign you to one of two groups  so imagine that there is an imaginary line out here  so everyone here
 will be group a everyone out here will be group
  folks what i 'm going to do
 is
 i 'm going to show you these two teas and i 'll go ahead and ask you to choose your tea so you can choose whichever tea you want you can decide what is your mental state ok
 i choose the caffeinated tea i choose the chamomile tea so you 're going to be in charge  you 're going to be in control  you 're going to be in the driver 's seat
  i 'm going to show you these two teas  but you don 't have a choice  i 'm going to give you one of these two teas and keep in mind i 'm going to pick one of these two teas at random for you
 and you know that  
 so if you think about it this is an extreme case scenario because in the real world 
 whenever you are taking passenger 's seat very often the driver is going to be someone you trust an expert etc so this is an extreme case scenario  
  you 're all going to consume the tea so imagine that you 're taking the tea now we 'll wait for you to finish the tea we 'll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects  
 now you 're going to have thirty minutes to solve fifteen puzzles here 's an example of the puzzle you 're going to solve  
 anyone in the audience want to take a stab
  gave the answer
 as a participant we would have calibrated the difficulty level of the puzzles to your expertise because we want these puzzles to be difficult 
 these are tricky puzzles because your first instinct is to say tulip 
 and then you have to unstick yourself  right  so these have been calibrated
 to your level of expertise  
  and all that and then you can unstick yourself   so you have thirty minutes now to solve these fifteen puzzles 
 now the question we 're asking here is in terms of the outcome
  the number of puzzles solved
 will you in the driver 's seat
 end up solving more puzzles because you are in control  you could decide which tea you would choose or would you be better off in terms of the number of puzzles solved 
 and 
 systemically what we will show  across a series of studies is that you the passengers even though the tea was picked for you at random 
 will end up solving more puzzles than you the drivers 
 we also observe
  observe
 another thing  and that is you folks not only are solving fewer puzzles you 're also putting less juice into the task
 less effort you 're less persistent  and so on how do we know that well
 we have two objective measures one is what is the time on average you 're taking in attempting to solve these puzzles 
 you will spend less time compared to you 
 second you have thirty minutes to solve these are you taking the entire thirty
  minutes or are you giving up before the thirty minutes elapse  you will be more likely to give up before the thirty minutes elapse compared to
 you so you 're putting in less juice and therefore the outcome fewer puzzles solved
 that brings us now to why does this happen
  and under what situations when would we see this pattern of results where the passenger is going to show better
  more favorable outcomes compared to the driver 
 it all has to do with when you face what i call the inca it
 's an acronym that stands for the nature of the feedback you 're getting after you made the decision  
 so if you think about it in this particular puzzle task it could happen in investing in the stock market very volatile out there it could be the medical situation the feedback here is immediate
  you know the feedback  whether you 're solving the puzzles or not 
 right  second  it is negative  remember  the deck was stacked against you in terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles 
 and this can happen in the medical domain  for example very early on in the treatment things are negative the feedback before things become positive right it can
 happen in the stock
  volatile stock market getting negative feedback it is also immediate  and the feedback in all these cases is concrete it 's unambiguous  you know if you 've solved the puzzles or not  
 now the added one apart from this immediacy negative 
 this concreteness now you have a sense of agency  
 you were responsible for your decision  so what do you do
  you focus on the foregone option  you say  you know what i should have chosen the other tea 
 that casts your decision in doubt 
 reduces the confidence you have in the decision  the confidence you have in the performance the
 performance in terms of solving the puzzles  and therefore less juice into the task  fewer puzzles solved and less favorable outcomes compared to you folks  
 and this can happen in the medical domain if you think about it right a patient in
  driver 's seat for example less juice which means
 keeping herself or himself less physically fit physically active to hasten the recovery process  which is what is often advocated you probably wouldn 't do that  
 and therefore there are times when you 're facing the inca when the feedback is going to be
  concrete and you have the sense of agency where you 're far better off
 taking the passenger 's seat and have someone else drive  
 now  i started off on a somber note  
 i want to finish up on a more upbeat note it has now been five years slightly more than five years  and the good news  thank god is that
 the cancer is still in remission  
 so
 it all ends well  but one thing i didn 't mention was
  was
 that very early on into her treatment  my wife and i decided that we would take the passenger 's seat and
 that made so much of a difference in terms of the peace of mind that came with that we could focus on her recovery we let the doctors make all the decisions and take the driver 's seat
