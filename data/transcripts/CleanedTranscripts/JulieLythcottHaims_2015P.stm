  you know i didn 't set out to be a parenting expert 
 in fact i 'm not very interested in parenting per se it 's just that there 's a certain style of parenting these days
 that is kind of messing up kids
  to develop into 
 there 's a certain style of parenting these days that 's getting in the way  i guess what i 'm saying is  we spend a lot of time being very concerned about
 parents who aren 't involved enough in the lives of their kids and their education or their upbringing  and rightly so but at the other end of the spectrum 
 there 's a lot of harm going on there as well where parents feel a kid can 't be
  successful unless the parent is protecting and preventing at every turn
 and hovering over every happening and micromanaging every moment and steering their kid towards some small subset of colleges and careers 
 when we raise kids this way  and i 'll say we 
  because lord knows in raising my two teenagers  i 've had these tendencies myself our kids end up leading
 a kind of checklisted childhood  and here 's what the checklisted childhood looks like we keep them safe and sound
 and fed and watered  
 and then we want to be sure they go to the right schools that they 're in the right classes at the right schools and that they get the right grades in the right classes in the right schools  but not just the grades the scores 
 and not just the grades and scores but the accolades
  and the awards and the sports the activities the leadership we tell our kids don 't just join a club start a club  because colleges want to see that 
 and check the box for community service i mean show the colleges you care about others 
 and all of this is done to some hoped for degree of perfection 
 we expect our kids to perform at a level of perfection we were never asked to perform
  at ourselves and so because so much is required we think 
 well then of course we parents have to argue with every teacher and principal and coach and referee and act like our kid 's concierge and personal handler
 and secretary  and then with our kids our precious kids we spend so much time nudging cajoling hinting helping haggling
  nagging as the case may be to be sure they 're not screwing up not closing doors 
 not ruining their future some hoped for admission to a tiny handful of colleges that deny almost every applicant  
 and here 's what it feels like to be a kid in this
  first of all there 's no time for free play there 's no room in the afternoons because everything has to be enriching we think 
 it 's as if every piece of homework every quiz every activity is a make or break moment for this future we have in mind for them and we absolve them of helping out around the house  and we even absolve them of getting enough sleep
 as long as they 're checking off the items
  on their checklist and in the checklisted childhood we say we just want them to be happy  
 but when they come home from school  what we ask about all too often first is their homework
 and their grades and they see in our faces that our approval that our love  that their very worth 
  and then we walk alongside them and offer clucking praise like a trainer at the westminster dog show 
 coaxing them to just jump a little higher and soar a little farther day after day after day and when they get to high 
  school  they don 't say well what might i be interested in studying or doing as an activity they go to counselors and they say what do i need to do to get into the right college
  and then when the grades start to roll in in high school and they 're getting some b 's or god forbid some c 's 
 they frantically text their friends and say has anyone ever gotten into the right college
 with these grades and our kids  regardless of where they end up at the end of high school  they 're breathless 
 they 're brittle  they 're a little burned out
 they 're a little old before their time wishing the grown ups in their lives had said what you 've done is enough this effort you 've put forth in childhood is enough 
 and they 're withering now under high rates of anxiety and depression and some of them are wondering  
 will this life ever turn out to have been worth
  we parents we parents are pretty sure
 it 's all worth it  
 we seem to behave it 's like we literally think they will have no future if they don 't get into one of these tiny set of colleges or careers we have in mind for them 
 or maybe  maybe we 're just afraid they won 't have a future we can brag about to our friends and with stickers on the backs of our cars
 but if you look at what we 've done if you have the courage to really look at it 
 you 'll see that not only do our kids think their worth comes from grades and scores  
 but that when we live right up inside their precious developing minds all the time like our very own version of the movie being john
  malkovich we send our children the message hey kid  i don 't think you can actually achieve any of this without me 
 and so with our overhelp our overprotection and overdirection and hand holding we deprive our kids of the chance to build 
 which is a really fundamental
  of the human psyche far more important than that self esteem they get every time we applaud
 is built when one sees that one 's own actions lead to outcomes  not there you go 
 not one 's parents ' actions on one 's behalf  
 but when one 's own actions lead to outcomes so simply put if our children are to develop
  and they must 
 then they have to do a whole lot more of the thinking  planning  deciding doing hoping coping trial and error  dreaming and experiencing of life
 for themselves  now  am i saying every kid is
  and motivated and doesn 't need a parent 's involvement or interest in their lives and we should just back off and let go  hell no 
 that is not what i 'm saying what i 'm saying is when we treat grades and scores and accolades and awards as the purpose of childhood all in furtherance of some 
 hoped for admission to a tiny number of colleges or entrance to a small number of careers  that that 's too narrow a definition of success for our kids 
 some short term wins by overhelping like they get a better grade if we help them do their homework
  they might end up with a longer childhood rsum when we help
 what i 'm saying is is that all of this comes at a long term cost to their sense of self 
 what i 'm saying is we should be less concerned with the specific set of colleges they might be able to apply to or might get into
 and far more concerned that they have the habits the mindset  the skill set the wellness to be successful wherever they go  
 what i 'm saying is our kids need us to be a little less obsessed with grades and scores
 and a whole lot more interested in childhood providing
  i just say chores did i just say chores  i really did 
 but really here 's why  
 the longest longitudinal study of humans ever conducted is called the harvard grant study it found that
  professional success in life which is what we want for our kids  
 that professional success in life comes from having done chores as a kid and the earlier you started the better that 
  mindset a mindset that says  there 's some unpleasant work  someone 's got to do it it might as well be me a mindset that says  i will contribute my effort to the
 betterment of the whole that that 's what gets you ahead in the workplace now we all know this you know this 
 we all know this and yet in the  checklisted childhood we absolve our kids of doing the work of chores around the house  
 and then they end up as young adults in the workplace still waiting for a checklist  but it doesn 't exist and more importantly lacking
  to roll up their sleeves and pitch in and look around and wonder how can i be useful to my colleagues how can i anticipate a few steps ahead to what my boss might need 
 a second very important finding from the harvard grant study
 said that happiness in life
 comes from love not love of work love of humans our spouse our partner our friends
  our family 
 so childhood needs to teach our kids how to love and they can 't love others if they don 't first love themselves  and they won 't love themselves if we can 't offer them unconditional 
  love right 
 and so instead of being obsessed with grades and scores when
  come home from school or we come home from work  we need to close our technology put away our phones and look them in the eye and let them see the joy that fills our faces
  when we see our child for the first time in a few hours  and then we have to say 
  to hear about the math test not lunch 
 you have to still take an interest in lunch you gotta say what was great about lunch today 
 they need to know they matter to us as humans not because of their 
  so you 're thinking chores and love that sounds all well and
 but give me a break the colleges want to see top scores and grades and accolades and awards and i 'm going to tell you sort of 
 the very biggest brand name schools are asking that of our young adults but here 's the good news 
 contrary to what the college rankings racket would have us believe 
 you don 't have to go to
  one of the biggest brand name schools to be happy and successful in life happy and successful people went to state school  went to a small college no one has heard of went to community college 
  went to a college over here and flunked out 
 the evidence is in this room is in our communities that this is the truth
  and if we could widen our blinders and be willing to look at a few more colleges maybe remove our own egos from the equation 
 we could accept and embrace this truth and then realize it is hardly the end of the world if our kids don 't go to one of those big brand name schools  
 and more importantly if their childhood has not been lived according to a tyrannical checklist
 then when they
 get to college  whichever one it is well they 'll have gone there on their own volition  
 fueled by their own desire  capable and ready to thrive there 
 i have to admit something to you i 've got two kids i mentioned sawyer and avery they
  and once upon a time  i think i was treating my sawyer and avery like little bonsai trees 
 that i was going to carefully clip and prune
 and shape into some perfect form of a human
 that might just be perfect enough to warrant them admission to one of the most highly selective colleges  
 but i 've come to realize after working with thousands of other people 's kids
  and raising two kids of my own my kids aren 't bonsai trees  they 're wildflowers
 of an unknown genus and species 
 and it 's my job to provide a nourishing environment to strengthen them through chores and to love them so they can love others and
  receive love and the college  the major  the career that 's up to them 
 my job is not to make them become what i would have them become 
 but to support them in becoming their glorious selves
