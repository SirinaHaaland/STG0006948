  my travels to afghanistan began many many years ago
 on the eastern border of my country my homeland  poland  i was
 walking through the forests of my grandmother 's tales 
 a land
 where every field hides a grave where millions of people have been deported
 or killed in the 20th century 
 behind the destruction i found a soul of places  i met humble people  
 i heard their prayer and ate their bread  
 then i have
  been walking
 east for twenty years
 from eastern europe to central asia through the caucasus mountains  middle east north africa
 russia  
 and i ever met more humble people and i shared their bread and their prayer this is why i went to afghanistan
 one day i crossed the bridge
 over the oxus river  i was alone on foot and the afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport  
 but he gave me a cup of tea and i understood that his surprise was my protection
  i have been walking and traveling  by horses by yak by truck by hitchhiking from
 iran 's border  to the bottom to the edge of the wakhan corridor and in this way
 i could find
 noor the hidden light of afghanistan  my only weapon was
  the mysticism from gibraltar to india the mosque where the respectful foreigner
 is showered with blessings and with tears and welcomed as a gift
 what do we know
 about the country and the people that we pretend to protect about
 the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium
 the beginning of our war  these are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for afghan businessmen  
 what do we know about the women ten years after the war  
 clothed in this nylon bag  made in china with the name of burqa 
  girls studying
 here
 in the rooms underground full of scorpions  and their
 love
  know about the death threats by the taliban nailed on the doors
 of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in
 balkh the region is not secure  but full of the taliban and they did it my aim is to give a voice to the
  hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict
