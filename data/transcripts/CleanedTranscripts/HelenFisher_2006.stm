  about the two
 biggest social trends in the coming century and perhaps in the next ten thousand years
 but i want to start with my work on romantic love because that 's my most recent work what i and my colleagues did was
  put thirty two people who were madly in love  into a functional mri brain scanner  
 seventeen who were madly in love and their love was accepted and fifteen who were madly in love and they had just been dumped  
 and so i want to tell you about that first  and then go on into where i think love is going
  ancestors
 i think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago  
 i started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last forty five years of 
  research and as it turns out there 's a very specific
 group of things that happen when you fall in love  the first thing that happens is a person begins to take on what i call special meaning 
 as a truck driver once said to me the world had a new center and that center was mary anne 
 george bernard shaw said it differently love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another
  and then you just focus on this person you can list what you don 't like about them but then you sweep that aside
 and focus on what you do as chaucer said love is blind 
 in trying to understand romantic love i decided i would read poetry from all over the world and i just want to give you one very
  because it 's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman 
 it 's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot their car is different from every other car in the parking lot their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass
 at the dinner party  and in this case a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat  and it goes like this it 's by a guy called yuan zhen
  i cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat  the night i brought you home i watched you roll it out 
 he became hooked on a sleeping mat  probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain just like with you and me but anyway
 not only does this person take on special meaning
 you focus your attention on them  you aggrandize them  but you have intense energy as one polynesian said
  i felt like jumping in the sky 
 you 're up all night you 're walking till dawn 
 you feel intense elation when things are going well  mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly 
 real dependence on this person as one businessman in new york said to me anything she liked  i liked 
 simple romantic love is very simple
  you become extremely sexually possessive
  know if you 're just sleeping with somebody casually you don 't really care if they 're sleeping with somebody else  but the moment you fall in love you become extremely sexually possessive of them  i think 
 there 's a darwinian purpose to this the whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team  
 but the main characteristics of romantic love are craving an intense craving to
  be with a particular person not just sexually but emotionally it
 would be nice to go to bed with them  but you want them to call you on the telephone to invite you out etc to tell you that
 that they love you the other main characteristic is
 motivation  the motor in the brain begins to crank and you want this person  and last but not least it is
  an obsession before i put these people 
  in the mri machine i would ask them all kinds of questions but my most important question was always the same it was 
 what percentage of the day and night do you think about this person and indeed they would say 
 all day 
 all night i can never stop thinking about him or her and then the very last question i would always have to work myself
  up to this question because i 'm not a psychologist i don 't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation 
 my final question was always the same i would say would you die for him or her 
 and indeed these people would say yes as if i had asked them to pass the salt i was just
 staggered by it so
  we scanned their brains  looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph with a distraction task in between so we could
 look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state 
 and we found activity in a lot of brain regions  in fact one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active
 when you feel the rush of cocaine  and indeed that 's exactly what happens
 i began to realize that romantic
  love is not an emotion  
 in fact i had always thought it was a series of emotions from very high to very low but actually it 's a drive it comes from the motor of the mind
  the wanting part of the mind the craving part of the mind the kind of part of the mind when you when you 're reaching for that piece of chocolate when you want to win
  the motor of the brain it 's a drive  and in fact  i think it 's more powerful than the sex drive  you know if you ask somebody to go to bed with you and they say no thank you 
 you certainly don 't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression
 but certainly around the world  people who are rejected in love
 will kill for it people live for
  in over one hundred and seventy five societies people have left their evidence of of this powerful brain system i have come to think it 's one of the most powerful brain systems on earth for both great joy
 and great sorrow and i 've also come to think that it 's one of three basically different brain systems that
  evolved from mating and reproduction one is the sex drive  the craving for sexual gratification
  w h auden called it an intolerable neural itch and indeed that 's what it is 
 it keeps bothering you a little bit like being hungry
  the second of these three brain systems is romantic love that elation obsession of early love and the third brain system is attachment that sense of calm and security
 you can feel for a long term partner  and i think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there looking for a whole range
 of partners  you can feel it when you 're just driving along in your car it can be focused on nobody  
 i think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time thereby conserving mating time and
  and i think that attachment the third brain system evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being
 at least long enough
 to raise a child together as a team  
 so with that preamble  i want to go into discussing the two most profound
 social trends one of the last ten thousand years and the other certainly of the last
  that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems lust  romantic love and deep attachment to a partner  the first is
 women working moving into the workforce  
 i 've looked at  one hundred and thirty societies through the demographic yearbooks of the united nations  everywhere in the world
  out of one hundred and thirty of them women are not only moving into the job market sometimes sometimes very very slowly  but they are moving into the job market and they are very slowly closing that gap
  between men and women in terms of economic power health and education it 's very slow for every trend on this planet there 's a counter trend we all know of them  but nevertheless
  the dogs may bark  but the caravan moves on and indeed  that caravan is moving on women are moving back into the job market and i say back into the job market because this is not new 
 for millions of years on the grasslands of africa women commuted to work
 to gather their vegetables they came home with sixty to eighty percent of the evening meal  the double income family was the standard and women were regarded as just
  economically  socially and sexually powerful as men in short  we 're really moving forward to the past 
 women 's worst invention was the plow with the beginning of plow agriculture men 's roles became extremely powerful women lost their ancient
  but then with the industrial revolution and the post industrial revolution they 're moving back into the job market  in short they are acquiring the status that they had a million 
  years ago  ten thousand years ago one hundred thousand years ago  we are seeing now one of one of the most remarkable traditions
  on the business community i 'll say just a couple of things and then go on to sex and love
  there 's a lot of gender differences anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child 
  they want to think that men and women are alike there 's much we have in common  but there 's a whole lot that we do not have in common  we are in the words of ted
  like two feet  we need each other to get ahead but we did not evolve to have the same brain and we 're finding more and more and more gender differences in the brain  i 'll only just use 
  a couple and then move on to sex and love one of them is women 's verbal ability  women can talk 
  women can talk
  they 've been doing it for a million years  words were women 's tools they held that baby in front of their face cajoling it reprimanding it educating it with words  and indeed they 're becoming a very powerful force even in places like india
 and
 japan where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market they 're moving into journalism
  think that the television is like the global campfire we sit around it and it shapes our minds almost always when i 'm on tv
  the producer who calls me who negotiates what we 're going to say is a woman in fact  solzhenitsyn once said to have a great writer is
  of people who are writers in america are women it
 's one of many many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market  
 they 've got incredible people skills negotiating skills  they 're highly imaginative we now know the brain circuitry of imagination
 of long term planning  they tend to be web thinkers  because
 female parts of the brain are better connected they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think put them into more complex patterns see more options
 and outcomes they tend to be contextual  holistic
 thinkers what i call web thinkers  men tend to and these are averages tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous focus on what they do 
 and move in a more
  we need both of them to get ahead  in fact  there 's many more male geniuses in the world and there 's also many more male idiots in the world 
 when the male brain works well it works extremely well  
 and what i really think that we 're doing is we 're moving towards a collaborative society a society in which the
 talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued
  employed  but in fact  women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life
 foremost
  women are starting
 to express their sexuality i 'm always astonished when people come to me and say why is it that men are so adulterous 
  women start sooner at sex have more partners  express less remorse for the partners that they do
 marry later have fewer children leave bad marriages
  in order to get good ones we are seeing the rise of female sexual expression  and indeed  once again we 're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression
  that we probably saw on the grasslands of africa a million years ago  because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today  
  is going to be the century of what they call the symmetrical marriage or the pure marriage 
 or the companionate marriage this is a marriage between equals 
 moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit 
 we 're also seeing a rise of romantic love ninety one percent of american women and eighty six percent of
  american men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner if they were not in love with that person 
 people around the world in a study of thirty seven societies want to be in love with the person that they marry 
 i even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great
 world trend the first one being women moving into the job market  the second one being the aging world population they 're now saying that in america 
 that middle age should be regarded as up to age
  as much as forty percent of people have nothing really wrong with them  so we 're seeing there 's a real extension of middle age 
 for one of my books i looked at divorce data in fifty eight societies and as it turns out the older you get the less likely you are to divorce so the
 divorce rate right now is stable in america and it 's actually beginning to decline it may
  decline some more 
 i would even say that
 with viagra  estrogen replacement  hip replacements
 and the incredibly interesting women as interesting as they are now not at any time on this planet have women been so educated so interesting so capable 
 and so i honestly think that if there
  really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages that time is now  
 however there 's always kinds of complications in this 
 these three brain systems lust 
 romantic love and attachment don 't always go together they can go together by the way that 's why casual sex isn 't so casual with orgasm you get a spike of dopamine dopamine 's associated with
  romantic love and you can just fall in love with somebody who you 're just having casual sex with 
 with orgasm then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin those are associated with attachment this is why you can feel such a sense of of cosmic union with somebody
 after you 've made love to them  but these three brain systems lust  romantic love
  connected to each other 
 you can feel deep attachment to a long term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else  while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners  
 in short  we 're capable of loving more than one person
 at a time in fact you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love
  love for somebody else it 's as if there 's a committee meeting going on in your head
 as you are trying to decide what to do  so i don 't think honestly we 're an animal that was built to be happy  we are an animal that was built to reproduce i think the
 happiness we find we make  and
 i think  however we can make good relationships with each other so i want to conclude with two things
 i want to conclude with a worry  and with a wonderful story  the worry is about antidepressants 
 over one hundred million
 prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the united states and these drugs
  been on them ever since she was thirteen i 've got nothing against people who
 take them short term when they 're going through something horrible they want to commit suicide or kill somebody else i would recommend it 
 but more and more people in the united states
 are taking them
  long term  and indeed  what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin 
 and by raising levels of serotonin  you suppress the dopamine circuit  everybody knows that 
 dopamine is associated with romantic love  
 not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit  but they kill the sex drive  and when you
  kill the sex drive  you kill orgasm  and when you kill orgasm you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment 
 the things are connected in the brain and when you tamper with one brain system you 're going to tamper with another 
 i 'm just simply saying that a world without love
 is a deadly
  i want to end with a story  and then just a comment  i 've been studying romantic love and
 sex and attachment for thirty years
 i 'm an identical twin  i am interested in why we 're all alike  why you and i are alike why the iraqis and the japanese and the australian aborigines and the people
  the amazon river are all alike  and about a year ago  an internet dating service match com came to me and asked me
 if i would design a new dating site for them i said i don 't know anything about personality  you know
 i don 't know do you think you 've got the right person they said yes it got me thinking about why it
  is that you fall in love with one person rather than another  that 's my current project it will be my next book 
 there 's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another  timing is important proximity is important  
 mystery is important you fall in love with somebody who 's somewhat mysterious in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love 
 you fall in love with somebody who fits within what i call your love map an unconscious list of traits
  that you build in childhood as you grow up 
 and i also think that you gravitate to certain people actually with somewhat complementary brain systems and that 's what i 'm now contributing to this  
 but i want to tell you a story 
 to illustrate i 've been carrying on here about the biology of love  
 i wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it too the magic of it
  's a story that was told to me by
 somebody who had heard it just from one probably a true story  
 it was a graduate student i 'm at rutgers and my two colleagues art aron is at suny stony brook that 's where we put our people in the mri machine  
 and this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student and
 she was not in love with him
  and they were all at a conference in beijing  and he knew from our work that
 if you go and do something very novel with somebody 
 you can drive up the dopamine in the brain and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love 
 so he decided he 'd
  invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him 
 and sure enough i 've never been in one but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it 's crazy and it 's noisy and it 's exciting he figured that this would drive up the dopamine and she 'd fall in love with him 
 so off they go and she 's squealing and squeezing him and
 laughing and having a wonderful time an hour later they get down off of the rickshaw
 and she throws her hands up and she says
  we evolved three basic drives the sex drive romantic love and attachment to a long term partner 
 these circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain  they 're going to survive as long as our species survives on what shakespeare called this mortal coil
