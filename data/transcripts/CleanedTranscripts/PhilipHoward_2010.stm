  i 've always been interested in the relationship of
 formal structures and human behavior  if you build a
 wide road out to the outskirts of town people will move there well law is also a powerful driver of human behavior  and what i 'd like to discuss
  today
 is the need to overhaul and simplify the law to release the energy and passion of americans so that we can begin to address the challenges of our society  
 you might have noticed that law has grown
 progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two if you run a business it 's
 hard to do much of anything without calling your general counsel
 is this phenomenon now where the general counsels are becoming the ceos it 's a little bit like the invasion of the body snatchers  you need a lawyer
 to run the company because there 's so much law  but it 's not just business that 's affected by this it 's actually pressed down into the daily activities
 of ordinary people a couple of years ago i was hiking
  it was in a grizzly bear preserve although no one told me that before we went and
 our guide was a local science teacher she was wholly unconcerned about the bears  
 but she was terrified of lawyers the stories started pouring out she 'd just been involved in an episode where a parent
 had threatened to sue sue the school because she lowered the grade of the student by ten percent when he turned the paper in late 
 the principal didn 't want to stand up to the parent because he didn 't want to get dragged into some
  legal proceedings so she had to go to meeting after meeting same arguments made over and over again  after thirty days of sleepless nights she finally capitulated
 and raised the grade  she said life 's too short i just can 't keep keep going with this about the same time she was going to take two students to a leadership conference
 in laramie which is a couple of hours away and she was going to drive them in
  you can 't drive them in the car for liability reasons you have to go in a school bus so they provided a bus that held sixty people
 and drove the three of them back and forth several hours to laramie  her husband is also a science teacher
 and he takes his biology class on a on a hike in the nearby national park  
 but he was told he couldn 't go on the hike this year because one of the students in the class was disabled so the other
  get to go on the hike
 either at the end of this day i could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher 
 now we 've been taught to believe that law is the foundation of freedom  
 but somehow or another in the last couple of decades the land of the free has become become a legal minefield  it 's really changed
 our lives in ways that are sort of imperceptible
  yet when you pull back you see it all the time it 's changed the way we talk i was talking to a pediatrician friend
 in north carolina he said well you know i don 't deal with patients the same way anymore  you wouldn 't want to say something off the cuff that might be used against you 
 this is a doctor whose life is caring for people
  my own law firm has a list of questions that i 'm not allowed to ask when when interviewing candidates  
 such as the sinister question  bulging with hidden
 motives and innuendo where are you from 
 now for twenty years tort reformers have been sounding the alarm that lawsuits are out of control  and we read
 every once in while about these crazy lawsuits like the guy in the district of columbia who sued his dry cleaners for
  million dollars
 because they lost his pair of pants the case went on for two years i think he 's still appealing the case  
 but the reality is these crazy cases are relatively rare they don 't usually win  
 and the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent which is twice as much as in other countries but 
  but the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg what 's happened here again almost without our knowing is
 our culture has changed people no longer feel free to act on their best judgment  
 so what do we do about it we certainly don 't want to give up the rights when people do something wrong to seek redress in the courts
 we need regulation to make sure
 people don 't pollute and such  we lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem  
 and that 's because we have the wrong frame of reference  
 we 've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute every issue is a matter of kind of individual rights and so we peer through a legal microscope  
 and look at everything is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances
 that explain why johnny turned his paper in late in cody wyoming
  is it possible that the doctor might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker  and of course the hindsight bias is perfect there 's always a different scenario that you 
  can sketch out where it 's possible that something could have been done differently  and yet we 've been trained to squint into this legal microscope  
  agree what 's fair  and where accidents will be extinct risk will be no more of course this is utopia
 it 's a formula for paralysis not freedom  it 's not the basis of the rule of law it 's not the basis of a free society  
 so now i have the first of four propositions i 'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law  you 've got to judge law
  by its effect on the broader society not individual disputes 
 absolutely vital  
 so let 's pull back from the anecdotes for a second and look at our society from high above is it working
 what does the macro data show us well the healthcare system has been transformed 
 a culture pervaded with defensiveness
  universal distrust of the system of justice  
 universal practice of defensive medicine  it 's very hard to measure because there are mixed motives doctors can make more
 on
 ordering tests sometimes and also they no longer even know what 's right or right or wrong  but reliable estimates range between sixty billion and two hundred billion dollars per year 
 that 's enough to provide care to all the people
 in america who don 't have
  it  the trial lawyers say well this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine well that 's been studied too by the institute of medicine and others  turns out that 's not the case  the fear
 has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up are you sure that 's the
  because they 're not sure and they don 't want to take legal responsibility  
 let 's go to schools as we saw with the teacher in cody wyoming  
 she seems to be affected by the law  well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law  you could have a separate section of a law library around each 
  of the following legal concepts due process special education no child left behind  
  rules it goes on we did a study of all the rules that affect one school
 in new york  the board of ed had no idea  tens of thousands of discreet rules sixty steps to suspend a student from school it
 's a formula for paralysis what 's the effect of that one
 is a decline in order  again studies have shown it 's directly attributable to the rise of due process
  agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that forty three percent of the high school teachers in america say that they spend at least half of their time maintaining order in the classroom 
 that means those students are getting half the learning they 're supposed to because if one child is disrupting the class no one can learn 
 and what happens when the teacher tries to assert order  they 're threatened
  with a legal claim we also surveyed that seventy eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in america have been threatened by their students with violating their rights with lawsuits
 by their students they are threatening their students it 's not that they usually sue it 's not that they would win  but it 's an
 indication of the corrosion of authority  and how has this system of law worked for government it doesn 't seem to be working
  very well does it  neither in sacramento nor in washington the other day at the state of the union speech president obama said and
 i think we could all agree with this goal from the first railroads to the interstate highway system our nation has always been the first to compete 
 there is no reason europe or china should have the fastest trains 
  actually there is a reason environmental review has evolved into a process of no pebble left unturned
 for any major project taking the better part of a decade  then followed by years of litigation by anybody who doesn 't like the project 
 then just staying above the earth for one more second  people are acting like idiots
  broward county  florida banned running at recess that
 means all the boys are going to be add i mean it 's
 just absolutely a formula for for failure  my favorite though are all the warning labels caution contents are hot on billions of coffee cups
  archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they won 't know about defensive medicine and stuff
  labels contents are extremely hot they 'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac that 's the only explanation because
 why would you have to tell people that something was actually hot  my favorite warning was one on a five inch fishing lure i grew up in the south and whiled away the summers fishing five inch fishing lure
 it 's a big fishing lure with a three pronged hook in the back 
  none of these people are doing what they think is right and why not they don 't trust the law why don 't they trust the law  because it gives us the worst of both worlds it 's random anybody can sue for almost anything and take it to a jury not even an effort at consistency and it 's also too detailed 
 in the areas that are regulated there are so many rules no human could possibly know
  it  well how do you fix it we could spend ten thousand lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle  but the challenge here is not one of just
 amending the law  because the hurdle for success is trust 
 people for law to be the platform for freedom  people have to trust
  that 's my second proposition trust is an essential condition to a free society  
 life is complicated enough without legal fear but law is different than other kinds of uncertainties  because it carries with it the power of state  
 and so the state can come in it actually changes the way people think it 's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders all day long whispering
  could that go wrong might that go wrong it drives people from the smart part of the brain
 that dark  deep well of the subconscious where instincts and experience 
 and all the other factors of creativity and good judgment are it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic pretty soon the doctor 's saying well i doubt if that headache could be a tumor but who would protect me
  so maybe i 'll just order the mri then you 've wasted two hundred billion dollars in unnecessary tests if you make people 
 about their judgments  studies show you will make them make worse judgments 
 if you tell the pianist to think about how she 's hitting the notes when she 's playing the piece she can 't play the piece
 is the enemy of accomplishment
  got no rules around here we 're trying to accomplish something 
 so how do you restore trust tweaking the law 's clearly not good enough and tort reform which is a great idea lowers your cost if you 're a businessperson  but it 's like a band aid on this gaping 
  wound of distrust states with extensive tort reform still suffer all these pathologies 
  out
 that freedom actually has a formal structure and it is this law sets boundaries  and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can 't do or must do
 you can 't steal you 've got to pay your taxes but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom  isaiah berlin put
  law sets frontiers not artificially drawn  within which men shall be inviolable 
 we 've forgotten that second part those dikes have burst people wade through law all day long 
 so what 's needed now is to rebuild these boundaries  
 and it 's especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else 's freedom  
 if someone brings a lawsuit
  over a kid fell off the seesaw it doesn 't matter what happens in the lawsuit all the seesaws will disappear  
 because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit  and that 's what 's happened there are no seesaws jungle gyms merry go rounds climbing ropes  nothing that would interest
 a kid over the age of four because there 's no risk associated with it so how do we rebuild it  life is too complex for
  a software program all these choices involve value judgments and social norms  not objective facts  
 and so here is the fourth proposition 
 this is what we have the philosophy we have to change to and there are two essential elements of it  we have to simplify the law  
 we have to migrate from all this complexity towards general principles and goals the constitution
 is only sixteen pages long  worked pretty well for two hundred years 
 law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices if they can 't internalize it they won 't trust it  
 and how do you make it simple 
 because life is complex and here is the hardest and biggest change we have to restore the authority to judges
  and officials to interpret and apply the law 
 we have to rehumanize the law 
 to make law simple so that you feel free the people in charge have to be free to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law in accord with reasonable social norms  as you
  going down and walking down the sidewalk during the day you have to think that if there is a dispute 
 there 's somebody in society who sees it as their job
 to affirmatively protect you if you 're acting reasonably that person doesn 't exist today 
 this is the hardest hurdle  it 's actually not very hard ninety eight percent of cases this is a piece of cake maybe you 've got a claim in small claims court
  your lost pair of pants for $ one hundred  but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars  case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court  takes five minutes that 's it
 it 's not that hard  
 but it 's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand because we woke up in the  1960s to all these really bad values racism gender discrimination pollution they were bad values  and we wanted to create a legal system
 where no one could have bad values anymore  the problem is
  created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values it doesn 't mean
 that people in authority can do whatever they want they 're still bounded by legal goals and principles the teacher is accountable to the principal 
 the judge is accountable to an appellate court the president is accountable to voters  but the accountability 's up the line judging the decision against the effect on everybody
 not just on the disgruntled person you can 't run a society by the lowest common denominator so
 what 's needed is a basic shift in philosophy we can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy 
 we 've been taught that authority  authority is the enemy of freedom it 's not true authority in fact is essential
 law is a human institution  responsibility is a human institution if teachers don 't have authority to run the classroom to maintain order everybody 's learning suffers if the judge doesn 't
  have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims  then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders if the environmental agency can 't decide that the power lines are good for the environment  then there 's no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city 
  requires red lights and green lights  otherwise it soon descends into gridlock that 's what 's happened to america
  so that we can begin to address the challenges of our
