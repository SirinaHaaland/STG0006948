  woman with chronic schizophrenia  i 've spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals 
 i might have ended up spending most of my life on the back ward of a hospital  but that isn 't how my life turned out 
 in fact i 've managed to stay clear of hospitals for almost three decades perhaps my proudest
  accomplishment 
 that 's not to say that i 've remained clear of all psychiatric struggles  after i graduated from the yale law school and got my first law job my new haven analyst dr white announced to 
  me that he was going to close his practice in three months  several years before i had planned to leave new haven  
  my best friend steve sensing that something was terribly wrong flew out to new haven to be with me  now i 'm going to quote from some of my writings 
 i opened the door to my studio apartment  
 steve would later tell me that for all the times he had seen me psychotic nothing could have prepared him for what he saw that day 
 for a week or more i had barely eaten i was gaunt  i walked as though my legs were wooden
  my face looked and felt like a mask 
 i had closed all the curtains in the apartment so in the middle of the day the apartment was in near total darkness the air was fetid  the room a shambles 
 steve both a lawyer and a psychologist has treated many patients with severe mental illness  and to this day he 'll say i was as bad as any he had ever seen ' hi 
 ' i said  and then i returned to the couch where i sat in silence for several moments ' thank you for coming steve  crumbling world
  word voice tell the clocks to stop time is time has come ' '
 white is leaving ' steve said somberly '
 i 'm being pushed into a grave the situation is grave ' i moan ' gravity is pulling me down i 'm scared tell them to get away ' 
 as a young woman i was in a psychiatric hospital on three different occasions for lengthy periods my doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia
  and gave me a prognosis of grave that is at best i was expected to live in a board and care and work at menial jobs  
 fortunately i did not actually enact that grave prognosis instead i 'm a chaired professor of law psychology and psychiatry at the usc gould school of law i have many close friends and i have a beloved
  he 's definitely the star of my show 
 i 'd like to share with you how that happened and also describe my experience of being psychotic 
 i hasten to add that it 's my experience because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way  
 let 's start with the definition of schizophrenia schizophrenia is a brain disease  its defining feature is psychosis
  or being out of touch with reality  
 delusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of the illness  delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren 't responsive to evidence and hallucinations are false sensory experiences 
 for example when i 'm psychotic i often have the delusion that i 've killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts  i sometimes have the idea that nuclear
  explosions are about to be set off in my brain occasionally i have hallucinations like one time i turned around and saw a man with a raised knife 
 imagine having a nightmare while you 're awake  
 often speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence 
 loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but don 't make sense  
 and if the words get jumbled up enough it 's called word salad 
 contrary to what many people think schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or
  split personality the schizophrenic mind is not split but shattered 
 everyone has seen a street person unkempt  probably  ill fed standing outside of an office building muttering to himself or shouting 
 this person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia  but schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic
  and there are people with the illness
 who are full time professionals with major responsibilities  
 several years ago i decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey  and i want to share some more of that story with you today to convey the inside view  
 so the following episode happened the seventh week of my first semester of my first year at yale law school  quoting from my writings my two classmates rebel and val and i
  to meet in the law school library on friday night to work on our memo assignment together but we didn 't get far before i was talking in ways that made no sense '
 memos are visitations ' i informed them ' they make certain points the point is on your head pat used to say that have you killed you anyone '
 rebel and val looked at me as if they or i had been splashed in the face with cold water ' what are you talking about elyn ' '
 oh you know the usual who 's what what 's who heaven and hell let 's go out on the roof
  it 's a flat surface it 's safe ' rebel and val followed and they asked what had gotten into me '
 this is the real me ' i announced waving my arms above my head and then late on a friday night on the roof of the yale law school i began to sing and not quietly either ' come to the florida sunshine bush do you want to dance ' '
 are you on drugs
  no way no drugs come to the florida sunshine bush  
 where there are lemons where they make demons ' ' you 're frightening me ' one of them said and rebel and val headed back into the library 
 i shrugged and followed them 
 back inside i asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as i was ' i think someone 's infiltrated
  my copies of the cases ' i said ' we 've got to case the joint  i don 't believe in joints but they do hold your body together ' it 's an example of loose associations 
 eventually i made my way back to my dorm room  and once there i couldn 't settle down my head was too full of noise too full of orange trees and law memos i could not write and mass murders i knew i would be responsible for 
 sitting on my bed i rocked back and
  moaning in fear and isolation 
 this episode led to my first hospitalization in america  i had two earlier in england continuing with the writings 
 the next morning i went to my professor 's office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment and i began gibbering unintelligably as i had the night before and he eventually brought me to the emergency room 
 once there someone i 'll just call ' the doctor ' and his whole team of goons swooped down lifted me high into the air and slammed me down on a metal bed with such force that i saw stars
  strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed with thick leather straps a sound came out of my mouth that i 'd never heard before  half groan  half scream 
 barely human and pure terror then the sound came again forced from somewhere deep inside my belly and scraping my throat raw 
 this incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization one of the reasons the doctors gave for
  hospitalizing me against my will was that i was gravely disabled to support this view they wrote in my chart that i was unable to do my yale law school homework 
 i wondered what that meant about much of the rest of new haven 
 during the next year i would spend five months in a psychiatric hospital at times i spent up to twenty hours in mechanical restraints 
 arms tied arms and legs tied down
  arms and legs tied down with a net tied tightly across my chest  i never struck anyone i never harmed anyone  i never made any direct threats 
 if you 've never been restrained yourself you may have a benign
 image of the experience there 's nothing benign about it every week in the united states it 's been estimated that one to three people die
  they strangle they aspirate their vomit they suffocate they have a heart attack  
 it 's unclear whether using mechanical restraints is actually saving lives or costing lives 
 while i was preparing to write my student note for the yale law journal on mechanical restraints i consulted an eminent law professor who was also a psychiatrist and said surely he would agree that restraints must be degrading painful and frightening 
  he looked at me in a knowing way and said 
 elyn you don 't really understand these people are psychotic  they 're different from me and you they wouldn 't experience restraints as we would 
 i didn 't have the courage to tell him in that moment that no we 're not that different from him we don 't like to be strapped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would 
 in fact until very recently and i 'm sure some people still hold it as a view that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe 
 i 've never met a psychiatric patient who agreed with
  view  today i 'd like to say i 'm very pro psychiatry but very 
 i don 't think force is effective as treatment and i think using force is a terrible thing to do to another person with a terrible illness  
 eventually i came to los angeles to teach at the university of southern california law school 
 for years i had resisted medication making many many efforts to get off 
 i felt that if i could manage without medication i could prove
  that after all i wasn 't really mentally ill it was some terrible mistake my motto was the less medicine the less defective 
 my l a analyst dr kaplan was urging me just to stay on medication and get on with my life 
 but i decided i wanted to make one last college try to get off  quoting from the text 
 i started the reduction of my
  and within a short time
 i began feeling the effects  after returning from a trip to oxford i marched into kaplan 's office headed straight for the corner  crouched down covered my face and began shaking 
 all around me i sensed evil beings poised with daggers they 'd slice me up in thin slices or make me swallow hot coals  kaplan would later describe me as ' writhing in agony '
 even in this state what he accurately described as acutely and forwardly psychotic i refused to take more medication  the mission
 is not yet complete 
 immediately after the appointment with kaplan i went to see dr marder a schizophrenia expert who was following me for medication side effects 
 he was under the impression that i had a mild psychotic illness  
 once in his office i sat on his couch  folded over and began muttering '
 head explosions and people trying to kill is it okay if i totally trash your office ' '
 you need to leave if you think you 're going to do that ' said marder
  marder ' okay small fire on ice tell them not to kill me tell them not to kill me what have i done wrong hundreds of thousands with thoughts interdiction ' '
 elyn do you feel like you 're dangerous to yourself or others  i think you need to be in the hospital i could get you admitted right away and the whole thing could be very discrete ' ' ha ha 
 ha you 're offering to put me in
  hospitals are bad they 're mad they 're sad one must stay away  i 'm god or i used to be ' 
 at that point in the text where i said i 'm god or i used to be my husband made a marginal note he said did you quit or were you fired 
 ' i give life and i take it away forgive me for i know not what i do '
 eventually i broke down in front of friends and everybody convinced me to take more medication i could no longer deny the truth and i could not change it
 the wall that kept me  elyn professor saks separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past lay smashed and in ruins 
 everything about this illness says i shouldn 't be here but i am  and i am i think for three reasons first i 've had excellent treatment 
 four to five day a week psychoanalytic psychotherapy for decades and
  i have many close family members and friends who know me and know my illness  
 these relationships have given my life a meaning and a depth and they also helped me navigate my life in the face of symptoms  
 third i work at an enormously supportive workplace at usc law school
  this is a place that not only accommodates my needs but actually embraces them it 's also a very intellectually stimulating
  and occupying my mind with complex problems has been my best and most
 powerful and most reliable defense against my mental illness  
 even with all that excellent treatment  wonderful family and friends supportive work environment i did not make my illness public until relatively late in life 
 and that 's because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that i didn 't feel safe with people knowing 
 if you hear nothing else
  there are people with schizophrenia  and these people may be your spouse they may be your child they may be your neighbor they may be your friend they may be your coworker 
 so let me share some final thoughts 
 we need to invest more resources into research and treatment of mental illness  the better we understand these illnesses the better the treatments we can provide and the better the treatments we can provide
  the more we can offer people care and not have to use force 
 also we must stop criminalizing mental illness it 's a national tragedy and scandal that the l a county jail is the biggest psychiatric facility in the united states  
 american prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer from severe mental illness  and many of them are there because they never received adequate treatment  
 i could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself
  a message to the entertainment industry and to the press on the whole you 've done a wonderful job
 fighting stigma and prejudice of many kinds  
 please continue to let us see characters in your movies your plays your columns who suffer with severe mental illness  portray them sympathetically and portray them in all the richness 
 and depth of their experience as people and not as diagnoses  
 friend posed a question if there were a pill i could take that would instantly cure me would i take it 
 the poet rainer maria rilke was offered psychoanalysis he declined saying don 't take my devils away because my angels may flee too 
 my psychosis on the other hand is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying that all my angels have already fled  
 so would i take the pill in an instant 
 that said  i don 't wish to be seen as regretting the life i could have had if i 'd not been mentally ill  nor am i asking
  anyone for their pity 
 what i rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share is more important than the mental illness we may not 
 what those of us who suffer with mental illness want is what everybody wants in the words of sigmund freud to work and to love
