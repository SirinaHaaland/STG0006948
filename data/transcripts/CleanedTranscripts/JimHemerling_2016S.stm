  have you ever noticed when you ask someone to talk about a change they 're making for the better in their personal lives they 're often really energetic  
 whether it 's training for a marathon  picking up an old hobby or learning a new skill for most people
 occupy a very positive emotional space
 is empowering energizing  even exhilarating i mean just take a look at some of the titles of self help books awaken the giant within 
 practicing the power of now or here 's a great one we can all relate to 
  how to stop doubting your greatness and start living an awesome life 
 when it comes to 
 you can 't help but get a sense of the excitement  
 but there 's another type of transformation that occupies a very different emotional space
  the blood drains from your face your mind goes into overdrive  frantically searching for some place to run and hide 
  you can run but you really can 't hide  
 most of us spend the majority of our waking hours involved in organizations and due to changes in globalization 
 changes due to advances in technology and other factors  
 the reality is is our organizations are constantly having to adapt 
 in fact i call this the era
  when i shared this idea with my wife nicola she said always on transformation that sounds exhausting 
 and that may be exactly what you 're thinking
 and you would be right particularly if we continue to approach the transformation of organizations the way we always have been 
 but because we can 't hide we need to sort out two things first
  transformation so exhausting  and second how do we fix it 
 first of all let 's acknowledge that change is hard 
 people naturally resist change especially when it 's imposed on them  
 but there are things that organizations do that make change even harder and more exhausting for people
 than it needs to be first
  of all leaders often
 wait too long to act as a result  everything is happening in crisis mode 
 which of course tends to be exhausting  
 or given the urgency what they 'll do is they 'll just focus on the  short term
  but that doesn 't give any hope for the future or
 they 'll just take a superficial one off approach hoping that they can return back to business as usual
 as soon as the crisis
 is over this kind of approach is kind of the way some
 students approach preparing for standardized tests in order to get test scores to go up
  will end up teaching to the test 
 now that approach can work test results often do go up  
 but it fails the fundamental goal of education 
 to prepare students to succeed over the long term  
 so given these obstacles what can we do to transform the way we transform organizations
 so rather than being exhausting it 's actually empowering
 and energizing 
 to do that we need to focus on five strategic imperatives 
 all of which have one thing in common putting people first  
 the first imperative for putting people first is to inspire through purpose most transformations have
  financial and operational goals these are important and they can be energizing
 to leaders  but they tend not to be very motivating to most people in the organization 
 to motivate more broadly the transformation needs to connect with a deeper sense of purpose 
 take lego 
 the lego group has become an extraordinary global company under their
  very capable leadership they 've actually undergone a series of transformations 
 while each of these has had a very specific focus the north star linking and guiding all of them has been lego 's powerful purpose  
 inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow  
 expanding
  it 's not about increasing sales  but about giving millions of additional children access to lego building bricks  
 investment and innovation it
 's not about developing new products  but about enabling more children to experience the joy of learning through play 
 not surprisingly that deep sense of purpose tends to be highly motivating
 to lego 's people 
 the second imperative
  for putting people first is to go all in 
 too many transformations are nothing more than  head count cutting exercises  layoffs
 under the guise of transformation  
 in the face of relentless competition it may well be that you will have to take the painful decision to downsize the organization 
 just as you may have to lose
  some weight in order to run a marathon  but losing weight alone will not get you across the finish line with a winning time to win
 you need to go all in you need to go all
 in rather than just cutting costs you need to think about initiatives that will enable you to win in the medium term
  initiatives to drive growth actions that will fundamentally change the way the company operates  and very importantly  
 investments to develop the leadership
 and the talent  
 the third imperative
 for putting people first is to enable people with the capabilities that they need to succeed during the transformation and beyond
 over the years i 've competed in a number of triathlons you know
 frankly i 'm not that good  but i do have one distinct capability i am remarkably fast
 at finding my bike 
 by the time i finish the swim  almost all the bikes are already gone
  real triathletes know
 that each leg the swim the bike the run really requires different capabilities 
 different tools  different skills different techniques  
 likewise when we transform organizations we need to be sure that we 're giving our people
 the skills and the tools they need along the way  chronos a global
  software company  recognized the need to transfer from building products
 software products to building software as a service 
 to enable its people to take that transformation  first of all they invested in new tools that would enable their employees to monitor
  the usage of the features as well as customer satisfaction with the new service they also invested in
 in skill development  so that their employees would be able to resolve customer service problems on the spot 
 and very importantly they also reinforced the collaborative behaviors that would be required to deliver an end to end seamless customer experience  
 because of these investments rather than feeling overwhelmed by the transformation
  employees actually felt energized and empowered in their new roles 
 in the era of always on transformation change is a constant  my fourth imperative therefore is to instill a culture
 of continuous learning 
 when satya nadella became the ceo of microsoft in february two thousand and fourteen he embarked on an ambitious transformation journey to
  prepare the company to compete in a 
  world this included changes to strategy the organization and very importantly  the culture 
 microsoft 's culture at the time was one of silos and internal competition
 not exactly conducive to learning nadella
  he rallied his leadership around his vision for a living learning culture 
 shifting from a fixed mindset  where your role was to show up as the smartest person in the room 
 to a growth mindset  where your role was to listen to learn
 and to bring out the best in people well early days microsoft employees already noticed this shift in the culture
 clear evidence
 of microsoft putting people first my fifth and final imperative is specifically for leaders 
 in a transformation a leader needs to have a vision 
 a clear road map with milestones and then you need to hold people accountable for results 
  in other words you need to be directive  
 but in order to capture the hearts and minds of people you also need to be inclusive 
 inclusive leadership is critical to putting people first 
 i live in the san francisco bay area  
 and right now our basketball team is the best in the league 
 we won the two thousand and fifteen championship  and we 're favored to win again this year 
 there are many explanations for this they have
  some fabulous players  but one of the key reasons is their head coach steve kerr is an inclusive
 leader 
 when kerr came to the warriors in two thousand and fourteen the warriors were looking for a major transformation  they hadn 't won a national championship since
  vision  and he immediately
 got to work 
 from the outset  he reached out and engaged the players and the staff 
 he created an environment of open debate and solicited suggestions 
 during games he would often ask what are you seeing that i 'm missing 
  the best examples of this came in game four of the two thousand and fifteen finals  the warriors were down two games to one
 when kerr made the decision to change the starting lineup a bold move by any measure 
 the warriors won the game and went on to win the championship and it is widely viewed that that move was the pivotal move in their victory
  it wasn 't actually kerr 's idea 
 it was the idea of his 28 year old assistant nick u 'ren 
 because of kerr 's leadership style u 'ren felt comfortable bringing the idea forward 
 and kerr not only listened  but he implemented the idea
 and then
  the credit
 actions all consistent
 with kerr 's highly inclusive approach to leadership 
 in the era of always on transformation  organizations are always going to be transforming  
 but doing so does not have to be exhausting  
 we owe it to
  to our organizations and to society more broadly
 to boldly transform our approach to transformation to do that we need to start putting
 people first  thank you
