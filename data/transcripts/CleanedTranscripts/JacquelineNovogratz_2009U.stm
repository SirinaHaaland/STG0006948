  i 've been working on issues of poverty for more than twenty years and so it 's ironic that
 the problem that and question that i most grapple with is how you actually define poverty what does it mean 
 so often we look at dollar terms people making less than a dollar or two or three a day and yet
  complexity of poverty really has to look at
 income as only one variable because really it 's a condition about choice and the lack of freedom  
 and i had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me the understanding that i have it was in kenya and i want to share it with you i was with my friend susan meiselas the photographer in the mathare 
  valley slums now mathare valley is one of the oldest slums in africa it 's about three miles out of nairobi
 and it 's a mile long and about two tenths of a mile wide 
 where over half a million people live crammed in these little tin shacks generation after generation renting them often eight or ten people to a room  
 and it 's
 known for prostitution violence drugs a hard place to grow
  and when we were walking through the narrow alleys it was literally impossible not to step in the
 raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes  but at the same time
 it was also impossible not to see the human vitality the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there women washing their babies washing their clothes hanging them out to dry 
 i met this woman mama rose who has rented that little tin shack for thirty two
  where she lives with her seven children four sleep in one twin bed and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor  
 and she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside it was also the day after the inauguration 
  and i was reminded how mathare is still connected to the globe  and i would see kids on the street corners and they 'd say obama he 's our brother and i 'd say well obama 's my brother so that makes you my brother too and they would look quizzically and then be
 high five 
 and it was here that i met jane i was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face  and i asked her to tell me her story  
 she started off by telling me her dream she said i had two my first dream was to be a doctor and the second was to marry a good man who would stay with me and
  my mother was a single mom 
 and couldn 't afford to pay for school fees so i had to give up the first dream  and i focused on the second she got married when she was eighteen had a baby right away  and when she turned twenty 
 found herself pregnant with a second child 
 her mom died and her husband left her married another woman so she was again in mathare with no income no skill set no money  and so she ultimately turned to
  organized in the way we often think of it she would go into the city at night with about twenty girls 
 look for work and sometimes come back with a few shillings or sometimes with nothing  and she said you know the poverty wasn 't so bad it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of it all 
 in two thousand and one 
 her life changed 
 she had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization jamii bora that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were as long as you provided a commensurate amount in
  savings  and so she spent a year to save fifty dollars and started borrowing 
 and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine she started tailoring 
 and that turned into what she does now which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets and for about three dollars and twenty five cents she buys an old ball gown  
 some of them might be ones you gave  and
 she repurposes them with
  and ribbons and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women for their daughter 's sweet sixteen or first holy communion
 those milestones in a life that people want to celebrate all along the economic spectrum  
 and she does really good business in fact i watched her walk through the streets hawking and before you knew it there was a crowd of women around her
  and i reflected as i was watching her sell the dresses and also the jewelry that she makes 
 that now jane makes more than four dollars a day  and by many definitions she is no longer poor  but she still lives in mathare valley  and so she can 't
 move out 
 she lives with all of that insecurity and in fact in january during the ethnic riots she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack in which she would live 
 jamii bora understands that and understands that
  about poverty we 've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum  and so with patient capital from acumen and other organizations loans and investments that will
 go the long term with them they built a 
 housing development about an hour outside nairobi central
  and they designed it from the perspective of customers like jane herself  insisting on responsibility and accountability so she
  has to give
 ten percent of the mortgage of the total value or about four hundred dollars in savings  
 and then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty  
 and in the next couple of weeks she 's going to be among the first two hundred families to move into this development 
 when i asked her if she feared anything or whether she would miss anything from
  what would i fear that i haven 't confronted already  i 'm hiv positive i 've dealt with it all 
 and she said what would i miss you think i will miss the violence or the drugs the lack of privacy do you think i 'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home at the end of the day she said if you gave me ten minutes my bags would be packed  
 i said well what about your
  you know my dreams don 't look exactly like i thought they would when i was a little girl  
 but if i think about it i thought i wanted a husband but what i really wanted was a family that was loving  and i fiercely love my children and they love me back 
 she said i thought that i wanted to be a doctor  but what i really wanted to be was somebody who served and
  and so i feel so blessed with everything that i have that two days a week i go and i counsel hiv patients  and i say ' look at me you are not dead you are still alive  and if you are still alive you have to serve ' 
 and she said i 'm not a doctor who gives out pills but maybe me i give out something better because i give them hope 
 and
 in the middle of this economic
  where so many of us are inclined to pull in with fear i think we 're well suited to take a cue from jane
 and reach out recognizing that being poor doesn 't mean being ordinary 
 because when systems are broken like the ones that we 're seeing around the world it 's an opportunity for invention and for innovation 
 it 's an opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend services and products to all human beings
  they can make decisions and choices for themselves  i truly believe it 's where dignity starts 
 we owe it to the janes of the world  and just as important  we owe it to ourselves
