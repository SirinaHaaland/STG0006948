  this morning i 'm speaking on the question of corruption  and corruption is defined
 as the abuse of a
 position of trust for the benefit of yourself or in the case of our context your friends
  your family or your financiers  okay  friends family and financiers  
 but we need to understand what we understand about corruption  and we need to understand
 that we have been miseducated about it  and we have to admit that we have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it 
 the first thing is that the big myth number one 
 is that in fact it 's not
  really a crime  
 when we get together with friends and family and we discuss crime in our country 
 crime in belmont or crime in diego or crime in marabella  nobody 's speaking about corruption that 's the honest truth 
 when the commissioner of police comes on tv to talk about crime he isn 't speaking about corruption and we know for sure when the minister of national security is speaking about crime he 's not
 talking about corruption either  
 the point i 'm making is that it is a crime
 it is an economic crime  because we 're involving the looting of taxpayers ' money 
 public and private corruption is a reality as somebody who comes from the private sector i can tell you there 's a massive amount of corruption in the private sector that has nothing to do with government the same bribes 
  and backhanders and things that take place under the table it all takes place in the private sector 
  i 'm focusing on public sector corruption  which the private sector also participates in 
 the second important myth to understand because we have to destroy these myths dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them the second important myth to understand is the one that says
 that in fact
 corruption is only a small problem if it is a problem it 's only a small problem  
 that in fact it 's only a little ten or fifteen percent  it 's been going on forever  it probably will
  continue forever  and there 's no point passing any laws because there 's little we can do about it  and i want to demonstrate that that too 
 is a dangerous myth very dangerous it 's a piece of public mischief  
 and i want to speak a little bit take us back about thirty years we 're coming out today from trinidad and tobago 
  we had a massive increase in the country 's wealth  
 and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices we call them petrodollars the treasury was bursting with money and it 's ironic  
 because
 we 're standing today in the central bank you see history 's rich in irony  
 we 're standing today in the central bank  and the central bank is responsible for a lot of the things i 'm going to be speaking about okay we 're talking about irresponsibility in public office
  speaking about the fact that across the terrace the next tower is the ministry of finance and there 's a lot of connection with us today so we 're speaking within your temple today 
 okay 
 the first thing i want to talk about is that when all of this money flowed into our country about forty years ago  
 we embarked the government of the day embarked on a series of
 and some of the largest projects in the country were being constructed through government to government arrangements with some of the leading countries in the world the united states and britain and france and so on and so on 
  as i said even this building we 're standing in that 's one of the ironies this building was part of that series of complexes what they called the twin towers  
 it became so outrageous the whole situation that in fact a commission of inquiry was
 and it reported in 
 thirty years ago it reported the ballah report thirty years ago  and immediately the government to government arrangements were stopped 
 the then prime minister went to parliament to give a budget speech  and he said some things that i 'll never forget 
 they went right in here i was a young man at the time it went right into my heart  and he said that in fact
 let me see if this thing works are we getting
  a yeah  that 's what he told us he told us that in fact  
 two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars that we spent the taxpayers ' money was wasted or stolen 
 so the ten or fifteen percent is pure mischief as we
  forget it that 's for little children we are big people and we 're trying to deal with what 's happening in our society  okay this is the size of the problem  
 okay  two thirds of the money stolen or wasted 
 that was thirty years ago one thousand nine hundred and eighty two was ballah so what has changed  
 i don 't like to bring up embarrassing secrets to an international audience but i have to 
 four months ago we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country  
 we call it the section
  suspicious piece of law and i 'm going to say it like it is a suspicious piece of law was passed at a suspicious time to free some suspects 
 and it was called  those people are called
 the piarco airport accused i 'm going to have my own lexicon speaking here today  they are the piarco airport
  it was a constitutional outrage of the first order  and i have labeled it the plot to pervert parliament our highest institution in our country was perverted 
 we are dealing with perverts here of an economic and financial nature do you get how serious this problem is there was massive protest a lot of us in this room took part in the protest in different forms 
 most importantly the american embassy complained  
 so parliament was swiftly reconvened and the law was reversed it was repealed that 's the word lawyers use it was repealed
 but the point is
 that parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events  because what really happened
 is that because of the suspicious passage of that law the law was actually passed into effect
 on the weekend we celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence our jubilee of independence  
  that is the kind of outrage of the thing it was kind of a nasty way to get maturation but we got it  because we all understood it  and for the first time that i could remember 
 there were mass protests against this corruption  
 and that gave me a lot of hope okay those of us who are sometimes you feel like you 're a little bit on your own doing some of this work 
 that passage of the law and the repeal of the law fortified the case
  of the piarco airport accused  so it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place  
 but what were they accused of 
 what was it that they were accused of i 'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there what were they accused of we were trying to build or reconstruct largely an airport that had grown outdated 
 the entire project cost about one point six billion 
  dollars  trinidad and tobago dollars  and in
  we had a lot of bid rigging and suspicious activity corrupt activity took place and
 to get an idea of what it consisted of 
 and to put it in context in relationship to this whole second myth about it being no big thing we can look at this second slide here 
 and what we have here i am not saying so 
 this is the director of public prosecutions in a written statement he said so and he 's telling us that for the $ one point six billion
  cost of the project one billion dollars has been traced
 to offshore bank accounts one billion dollars of our taxpayers ' money has been located in offshore bank accounts 
 being the kind of suspicious person i am i am outraged at that  and i 'm going to pause here i 'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things i 'm going to pause here and bring in something i saw in november
  last year at wall street i was at zuccotti park  it was autumn it was cool it was damp it was getting dark  
 and i was walking around with the protesters looking at the one wall street occupy wall street
 movement walking around 
 and there was a lady with a sign a very simple sign a kind of battered looking blonde lady and the sign was made out of bristol board as we say in these parts and it was made with a marker  
 and what it said on that sign hit me right in the center it said if you 're not outraged you haven 't been paying attention
  if you 're not outraged by all of this you haven 't been paying attention so
 listen up because we 're getting into even deeper waters my brain started thinking  well what if
 because i 'm suspicious like that i read a lot of spy novels and stuff what if
 but to make it in these wrongs you have to read a lot of spy novels and follow some of
  if
 this wasn 't the first time 
 what if this is just the first time that the so and sos had been caught 
 what if it had happened before how would i find out now
 the previous two examples i gave were to do with construction sector
 corruption  okay
  we have the we are the leaders in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system about how public money is transacted  
 so those of you interested in finding out more about it or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions 
 please get involved  but i 'm going to segue to another thing that relates because one of my private
 campaigns i 've been conducting for over three and a half years
 is for transparency and
  accountability
 around the bailout of cl financial cl financial is the caribbean 's largest ever
 conglomerate  okay  and without getting into all of the details it is said to have collapsed i 'm using my words very carefully it 's said to have collapsed
 in january of ' nine  which is just coming up to nearly four years in an unprecedented fit of generosity and you have to be very
  suspicious about these people
 in an unprecedented and i 'm using that word carefully unprecedented fit of generosity  
 the government of the day signed made a written commitment to repay all of the creditors  
 and i can tell you without fear of contradiction that hasn 't happened anywhere else on the planet 
 let 's understand because we lack context people are telling us it
  just like wall street it 's not just like wall street  trinidad and tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something it 's not just
 like anywhere 
 it 's not just like anywhere it 's not just like anywhere here is here and out there is out there 
 okay  i 'm serious now listen they 've had bailouts on wall street  they 've had bailouts
  they 've had bailouts in europe in africa they 've had bailouts in nigeria six of the major commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours eh it 's interesting to parallel how the nigerian experience has
 how they 've treated it  and they 've treated it very well compared to us nowhere on the planet
 have all the creditors been bailed out
 in excess of what their statutory entitlements were only here  so what was the reason for the generosity 
 is our government that generous and maybe they are  let 's look at it let 's look into it
 so i started digging and writing and so and so on and that work can be found my personal work can be found at 
  is my name  it 's a not for profit blog that i run not as popular as some of the other people but there you go 
 but the point is that the bitter experience of section thirty four
  plot to pervert parliament that bitter experience that took place
 in august  when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence going into september  forced me
 to check myself
 and recalculate my bearings  and to go back into some of the work some of the stuff i 'd written and some of the exchanges i 'd had with the officials to see what was really what as we say in trinidad and tobago 
 who is who and what
  we want to try to recalculate  and i made a freedom of information application in
 may this year
 to the ministry of finance the ministry of finance is the next tower over this is the other context 
 the ministry of finance we are told 
 is subject to the provisions of the freedom of information act i 'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that 's really so 
 the central bank in which we stand this morning
  of the freedom of information act so in fact you can 't ask them anything  and they don 't have to answer anything  that is the law since one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine 
 so i plunged into this struggle  and i asked four questions  
 and i 'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply  so you could understand as i said where we are here is not like anywhere else question number one
  i asked to see the accounts of cl financial  and if you can 't show me the accounts
  minister of finance is making statements passing new laws and giving speeches and so on what are the figures he 's relying on it 's like that joke i want whatever he 's drinking  
 and they wrote back and said to me well what do you really mean  so they hit my question with a question second point i want to see
 who are the creditors of the group who have been repaid let me pause here to point out to you all
  billion dollars of our money has been spent on this that is about three and a half billion u s dollars coming out of a small
 we used to be resource rich caribbean country  okay  and i asked the question who was getting that three and a half billion dollars  
 and i want to pause again to bring up context because context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing there 's a particular individual who is in the government now  the name of
  the person doesn 't matter  and that person made a career
 out of using the freedom of information act to advance his political cause  okay his name isn 't important  
 i wouldn 't dignify it i 'm on a point the point is that person made a career out of using the freedom of information act to advance his cause  
 and the most famous case
 was what we came to call the secret scholarship scandal
  in fact there was about sixty million dollars in government money
 that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships and the scholarships hadn 't been advertised and so and so on and so on  
 and he was able to get the court using that act of parliament freedom of information act 
 to release the information and i thought that was excellent  
 fantastic 
  the question is this if it 's right and proper for us to use the freedom of information act and to use the court
 to force a disclosure about sixty million dollars in public money  
 it must be right and proper for us to force a disclosure about twenty four billion dollars
 you see  but the ministry of finance the permanent secretary of the ministry of finance wrote me and said to me that information is exempt too  you see
  is what we 're dealing with okay  the third thing i will tell you
 is that i also asked
 for the directors of cl financial  
 whether in fact they were making filings under our integrity in public life act we have an integrity in public life act as part of our framework
 supposed to safeguard the nation 's
  and public officials are supposed to file to say what it is
 they have in terms of assets and liabilities  and of course i 've since discovered that they 're not filing  and in fact the minister of finance has not even asked them to file  
 so here we have it  we have a situation where
 the basic safeguards
 of integrity and accountability and transparency have all been discarded i 've asked the question in the legal and required fashion it 's been ignored
 the sort of thing that motivated us around section thirty four we need to continue to work on that we can 't forget it  
 i have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country 's history it 's also the single largest example of public corruption according to this equation 
 and this is my reality
  where you have an expenditure of public money
 and it is without accountability
 and it 's without transparency it will always be equal to corruption  
 whether you 're in russia or nigeria or alaska  it will always be equal to corruption  and that is what we are dealing with here 
 i 'm going to continue the work
 to press on to get
 some resolution of those matters at the ministry of finance if it is i have to go to court personally i will do that  we will continue to press on
 we will continue to work within jcc  but i want to step back from the trinidad and tobago context and bring something new to the table in terms of an international example  we had the journalist [ heather ] brooke speaking
 about her battle against government corruption and she introduced me to this website
  information applications and speak with each other 
 i could see what you 're applying for 
 you could see what i applied for and what replies i got  
 we can work on it together we need to build a collective database and a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point we need to increase the consciousness  the final thing i want to say
  they have international branches  and it 's important for us to tune into this one
  is really important a good one to log on to and see
