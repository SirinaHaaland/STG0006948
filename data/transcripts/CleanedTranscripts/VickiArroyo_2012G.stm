  it was a great place to grow up but it 's one of the most vulnerable
  in the world half the city is already below sea level
 in two thousand and five the world watched as new orleans and the gulf coast were devastated by hurricane katrina
 one thousand eight hundred and thirty six people died
 nearly three hundred thousand homes were lost these are my mother 's at the top although that 's not her car it was carried there by floodwaters up to the roof
 and that 's my sister 's below fortunately they and other family members got out in time
 but they lost their homes and as you can see just about everything in them
 other parts of the world have been hit by storms in even more devastating ways
 in two thousand and eight cyclone nargis and its aftermath killed one hundred and thirty eight thousand in myanmar
 climate change is affecting our homes our communities our way of life we should be preparing at every scale and at every opportunity
 this talk is about being prepared for and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home the earth
 the changes in these times won 't affect us all equally there are important distributional consequences and they 're not what you always might think
 in new orleans the elderly and female headed households were among the most vulnerable for those in
  vulnerable low lying nations
 how do you put a dollar value on losing your country where you ancestors are buried
 and where will your people go and how will they cope in a foreign land
 will there be tensions over immigration or conflicts over competition for limited resources it 's already fueled conflicts
 in chad and darfur
 like it or not ready or not this is our
  future
 sure some are looking for opportunities in this new world that 's the russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding arctic sea ice
 but while there might be some short term individual winners our collective losses will far outweigh them
 look no further than the insurance industry as they struggle to cope with mounting catastrophic losses from extreme weather events
  the military gets it they call climate change a threat multiplier that could harm stability and security
 while governments around the world are evaluating how to respond
 so what can we do how can we prepare and adapt
 i 'd like to share three sets of examples starting with adapting to violent storms and floods in new orleans the i ten twin spans with sections knocked
  out in katrina have been rebuilt twenty one feet higher to allow for greater storm surge
 and these raised and energy efficient homes were developed by brad pitt and make it right for the hard hit ninth ward
 the devastated church my mom attends
 has been not only rebuilt higher it 's poised to become the first energy star church in the country they 're selling electricity back to the grid thanks to
  solar panels reflective paint and more their march electricity bill was only forty eight dollars
 now these are examples of new orleans rebuilding in this way
 but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind for example in galveston
 here 's a resilient home that survived hurricane ike when others on neighboring lots clearly did not
 and around
  the world satellites and warning systems are saving lives in flood prone areas such as bangladesh
 but as important as technology and infrastructure are perhaps the human element is even more critical
 we need better planning and systems for evacuation we need to better understand how people make decisions in times of
 crisis and why
 while it 's true that many who died in katrina did not have access to transportation others who did refused to leave as the storm approached
 often because available transportation and shelters refused to allow them to take their pets
 imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue fortunately in two thousand and six congress passed the pet evacuation and transportation
  it spells pets to change that second preparing for heat and drought
 farmers are facing challenges of drought from asia to africa from australia to oklahoma
 while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in western europe in two thousand and three and again in russia in two thousand and ten
  in ethiopia seventy percent that 's seven zero percent of the population depends on rainfall for its livelihood
 oxfam and swiss re together with rockefeller foundation are helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces and find other ways to conserve water
 but they 're also providing for insurance when the droughts do come
 the stability this provides is giving the farmers the confidence to invest it 's giving them access to affordable credit it 's allowing them to become
  productive so that they can afford their own insurance over time without assistance it 's a virtuous cycle and one that could be replicated throughout the developing world
 after a lethal one thousand nine hundred and ninety five heat wave turned refrigerator trucks from the popular taste of chicago festival into makeshift morgues
 chicago became a recognized leader
 tamping down on the urban heat island impact through opening cooling centers
 outreach to vulnerable neighborhoods planting trees creating cool white or vegetated green roofs
 this is city hall 's green roof next to cook county 's portion of the roof which is seventy seven degrees fahrenheit hotter at the surface
 washington d c last year actually led the nation in new green roofs installed
 and they 're funding this in part thanks to a five cent tax on plastic bags
 they 're splitting the
  cost of installing these green roofs with home and building owners
 the roofs not only temper urban heat island impact
 but they save energy and therefore money the emissions that cause climate change and they also reduce stormwater runoff
 so some solutions to heat can provide for win win wins
 third adapting to rising seas sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems
  agriculture even major cities this is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the mekong delta that 's where half of vietnam 's rice is grown
 infrastructure is going to be affected
 airports around the world are located on the coast it makes sense right there 's open space the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings
 here 's just one example san francisco airport
 with sixteen inches or more of flooding imagine the staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with levees
 but there might be some changes in store that you might not imagine
 for example planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated less dense air provides for less lift
 san francisco is also spending forty million dollars to rethink and redesign its water
  and sewage treatment
 as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater causing backups at the plant harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste
 so these outfall pipes have been retrofitted to shut seawater off from entering the system
 beyond these technical solutions our work at the georgetown climate center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available
 and to consider
  how they can accommodate change
 for example in land use which areas do you want to protect through adding a seawall for example
 alter by raising buildings or retreat from to allow the migration of important natural systems such as wetlands or beaches
 other examples to consider in the u k the thames barrier protects london from storm surge the asian cities climate change resilience network
 is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves
 these are not only important ecosystems in their own right but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities
 new york city is incredibly vulnerable to storms as you can see from this clever sign and to sea level rise and to storm surge as you can see from the subway flooding
 but back above ground these raised ventilation grates for the
  subway system show that solutions can be both functional and attractive in fact in new york san francisco and london designers have envisioned ways to better integrate the natural and built environments with climate change in mind
 i think these are inspiring examples of what 's possible when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different
 but now a word of caution adaptation 's too important to be left to the experts
 why well there are no experts we 're entering uncharted territory and yet our expertise and our systems are based on the past
 stationarity is the notion that we can anticipate the future based on the past and plan accordingly
 and this principle governs much of our engineering our design of critical infrastructure city water systems building codes even water rights and other
  legal precedents
 but we can simply no longer rely on established norms
 we 're operating outside the bounds of co two concentrations that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years
 the larger point i 'm trying to make is this
 it 's up to us to look at our homes and our communities our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk and to find ways to not just survive
 but to thrive
 and it 's up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same even while they address the underlying causes of climate change
 there are no quick fixes there are no one size fits all solutions we 're all learning by doing
 but the operative word is doing
 thank you
