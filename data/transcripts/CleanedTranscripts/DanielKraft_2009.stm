  i am a pediatric cancer doctor
 and stem cell researcher at stanford university where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation  now  inspired by jill bolte taylor last year i didn 't bring a
  but i did bring a liter of bone marrow 
 and bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases  
 so a few years ago i 'm doing my transplant fellowship at stanford i 'm
 in the operating room  we have bob here who is a volunteer donor we 're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child
  so actually how do we harvest this bone marrow well we have a whole o r team general anesthesia nurses  and
 another doctor across from me bob 's on the table and we take this sort of small needle you know not too big  and the way we do this is we basically
 place this through the soft tissue and kind of punch it into the hard bone into the tuchus that 's a technical term and
 aspirate about ten mls of bone marrow out
  each time with a syringe  
 and hand it off to the nurse she squirts it into a tin hands it back to me  and we do that again and again 
 about two hundred times usually  and by the end of this my arm is sore i 've got a callus on my hand let alone bob whose rear end looks something more like this like swiss cheese 
 so i 'm thinking you know this procedure hasn 't changed in about forty years  and there is probably a better way to do this so i thought of a minimally invasive approach and a new device that we call the marrow miner
 and the marrow miner the way it works is shown here our standard see through patient instead of entering the bone dozens of times we enter just once into the front of the hip or the back of the hip  
 and we have a flexible powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip as it moves around so it enables you to very rapidly aspirate or suck out rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole 
 we can do multiple passes
  through that same entry no robots required and  so very quickly bob can just get one puncture local anesthesia  and do this harvest as an outpatient  
 so i did a few prototypes  i got a small little grant at stanford and
 played around with this a little bit and our team members developed this technology and
 eventually we got two large animals and
  and we found to our surprise that we not only got bone marrow out but we got ten times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the marrow miner compared to the normal device 
 this device was just fda approved in the last year here is a live patient you can see it following the flexible curves around there will be two passes here in the same patient from the same hole
 this was done under local anesthesia as an outpatient  and we got again about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient  
 so why should you care bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells you all know about embryonic
  stem cells they 've got great potential but haven 't yet entered clinical trials adult stem cells are throughout our body including the blood forming stem cells in our bone marrow  which we 've been using as a form of stem cell therapy for over forty years 
 in the last decade there 's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient 's other diseases such as heart disease  vascular disease  orthopedics tissue engineering even in neurology to treat parkinson 's
 and diabetes
  we 've just come out we 're commercializing this year  generation two point zero of the marrow miner the hope is that this gets more stem cells out  which translates to better outcomes it may encourage more people to sign up to be potential 
 live saving bone marrow donors it may even even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells when you 're younger and healthier to use in the future should you need it 
 hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future thanks
