  everyone is interested in other people everyone has relationships with other people and they 're interested in these relationships for a variety of reasons  good relationships bad relationships  annoying relationships  
  and what i 'm going to do is focus on the central piece of an interaction that goes on in a relationship  so i 'm going to take as inspiration the fact that we 're all interested in interacting with other people  
 i 'm going to completely strip it of all its complicating features  and i 'm going to turn that object that simplified object into a scientific probe  
  and provide the early stages embryonic stages of new insights into what happens in two brains while they simultaneously interact
 but before i do that let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible 
 the first is we can now eavesdrop safely on healthy brain activity
  without needles and radioactivity  without any kind of clinical reason  we can go down the street and record from your friends  ' and neighbors  ' brains while they do a variety 
  of cognitive tasks and we use a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging 
  probably all read about it or heard about in some incarnation let me give you a two sentence version of it  so we 've all heard of
 use magnetic fields and radio waves and they take snapshots of your brain or your knee or your stomach  grayscale images that are frozen in time 
 in the  1990s it was discovered you could use the same machines in a different mode  and in that mode you could make microscopic blood flow movies from hundreds
  of thousands of sites independently in the brain  
 okay so what in fact the so what is in the brain changes in neural activity  the things that make your brain work the things that make your software work in your brain are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow 
 you make a blood flow movie you have an independent proxy of brain activity this has literally revolutionized cognitive science take any cognitive domain you want memory motor planning thinking about your
 getting angry at people  emotional response it goes on and on 
 put people into functional mri devices 
 and image how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity it 's in its early stages and it 's crude by some measures  but in fact  twenty years ago we were at nothing  
 you couldn 't do people like this you couldn 't do healthy people  
 that 's caused a literal revolution  and it 's opened us up to a new experimental preparation neurobiologists as you well know
  have lots of experimental preps worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this and now we have a new experimental prep 
 human beings  we can now use human beings to study and model the software in human beings and we have a few burgeoning biological measures  
 okay  let me give you one example
  of the kinds of experiments that people do  and it 's in the area of what you 'd call valuation 
 valuation is just what you think it is you know if you went and you were valuing two companies against one another you 'd want to know which was more valuable 
 cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago if you want to compare oranges to windshields what do you do well you can 't compare oranges to windshields 
 they 're immiscible they don 't mix with one another so instead you convert them to a common currency scale put them on that scale  and value them accordingly well
  something just like that as well  and we 're now beginning to understand and identify brain systems involved in valuation  and one of them includes a neurotransmitter system
 whose cells are located in your brainstem and deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain 
 i won 't go through the details of it  but that 's an important discovery  and we know a good bit about that now
 's just a small piece of it  but it 's important because those are the neurons that you would lose if you had parkinson 's disease  
 and they 're also the neurons that are hijacked by literally every drug of abuse  and that makes sense drugs of abuse would come in and they would change the way you value the world they change the way you value the symbols associated with your drug of choice  
 and they make you value that over everything else here 's the key feature though 
 these neurons are also involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas and i put some symbols up here that we assign value to
 for various reasons
 we have a behavioral superpower in our brain  and it at least in part involves dopamine we can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea 
 for a mere idea no other species can do that in one
 thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the cult heaven 's gate committed mass suicide predicated on the idea that there was a spaceship
 hiding in the tail of the then visible comet  hale bopp waiting to take them to the next level it was
  it was an incredibly tragic event  more than two thirds of them had college degrees  but the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival
 using exactly the same systems that were put there to make them survive  that 's a lot of control 
 okay  one thing that i 've left out of this narrative is the obvious thing which is the focus of the
  little talk and that is other people  these same valuation systems are redeployed when we 're valuing interactions with other people  
 so this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs 
 that makes you freeze when you get parkinson 's disease that contributes to various forms of psychosis 
 is also redeployed to value interactions with other people and to assign value to gestures that you do when you 're interacting with
  let me give you an example of this 
 you bring to the table such enormous processing power in this domain that you hardly even notice it let
 me just give you a few examples so here 's a baby she 's three months old she still poops in her diapers and she can 't do calculus 
 she 's related to me somebody will be very glad that she 's up here on the screen you can cover up one of her eyes and you can still read something in the other eye  and i see sort of curiosity in one eye  i see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other 
 here 's a couple they 're sharing a moment together
  and we 've even done an experiment where you can cut out different pieces of this frame and you can still see that they 're sharing it they 're sharing it sort of in parallel now the elements of the scene also communicate this to us  but 
  you can read it straight off their faces and if you compare their faces to normal faces it would be a very subtle cue  
 and i 'm thinking i 'm not seeing love and admiration on the left 
 in fact i know this is his sister and you can just see him saying okay we 're doing this for the camera  
 and then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face he 'll
 kill me for showing
  so what does this mean  it means we bring an enormous amount of processing power to the problem  it engages deep systems in our brain in
 dopaminergic systems that are there to make you chase sex food and salt they keep you alive 
 it gives them the pie it gives that kind of a behavioral punch which we 've called a superpower so how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe
  and the short answer is games 
 economic games  so what we do is we go into two areas 
 one area is called experimental economics the other area is called behavioral economics  and we steal their games  
 and we contrive them to our own purposes so this shows you one particular game called an ultimatum game 
 red person is given a hundred dollars and can offer a split to blue 
 let 's say red wants to keep seventy  and offers blue thirty so he offers a 70 30 split with blue 
 control passes to blue and blue says
  in which case he 'd get the money  or blue says i reject it in which case no one gets anything  okay  so
 a rational choice economist would say well  you should take all non zero offers what do people do people are indifferent at an 80 20 split 
 at 80 20 it 's a coin flip whether you accept that or not why is that you know because you 're pissed off you 're mad that 's an unfair offer and you know what an unfair
  offer is this is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world  that just gives you an example of the kind of thing that that
 these games probe  
 the interesting thing is these games require that you have a lot of cognitive apparatus on line  you have to be able to come to the table with a proper model of another person  
 you have to be able to remember what you 've done you have to stand up in the moment to do that then you have to update your model based on the signals coming back and you have to do
  something that
 is interesting which is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay  that is you have to decide what that other person expects of you you have to send signals to manage your image in their mind like a job interview  
 you sit across the desk from somebody they have some prior image of you you send signals across the desk to move their image of you from one place
  place where you want it to be we
 're so good at this we don 't really even notice it  these kinds of probes exploit it  okay  
 in doing this what we 've discovered is that humans are literal canaries in social exchanges canaries used to be used
 as kind of biosensors in mines when methane built up or carbon dioxide built up or oxygen
 was diminished the birds would swoon before people would so it acted as an early warning system hey get out of the mine things aren 't going so well
 come to the table and even these very blunt staged social interactions  and they and there 's just numbers going back and forth between the people 
 and they bring enormous sensitivities to it so we realized we could exploit this and in fact as we 've done that and we 've done this now in many thousands of people i think on the order of 
 five or six thousand  we actually to make this a biological probe need bigger numbers than that remarkably so
 patterns have emerged  and we 've been able to take those patterns convert them into mathematical models
  and use those mathematical models to gain new insights into these exchanges  okay so what well the so what is that 's a really nice behavioral measure  the economic games bring to us notions of optimal play we can compute that during the game  
 and we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior
  here 's the cool thing
  six or seven years ago we developed a team  it was at the time in houston texas it 's now in virginia and london  
 and we built software that 'll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices
 up over the internet
 i guess we 've done up to six machines at a time but let 's just focus on two so it synchronizes machines anywhere in the world  we synchronize the machines set them
  these staged social interactions and we eavesdrop on both of the interacting brains so for the first time we don 't have to look at just averages over single individuals
 or have individuals playing computers or try to make inferences that way we can study individual dyads we can study the way that one person interacts with another person 
 turn the numbers up and start to gain new insights into the boundaries of normal
  but more importantly  we can put people with classically defined mental illnesses or brain damage into these social interactions and use these as probes of that 
 so we 've started this effort we 've made a few hits a few i think embryonic discoveries we think there 's a future to this  but it 's our way of going in and redefining with a new lexicon 
 a mathematical one actually  as opposed to
 the standard ways that we think about mental illness  characterizing these diseases by using the people
  as birds in the exchanges  that is we exploit the fact that the healthy partner playing somebody with major depression or playing somebody with autism spectrum disorder  or 
  playing somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder we use that as a kind of biosensor  and then we use computer programs to model that person  and it gives us a kind of assay of this 
  here are a few of our collaborating sites the hub ironically enough is centered in little roanoke virginia 
 there 's another hub in london now and the rest are getting set up
  we hope to give the data away at some stage  that 's a complicated issue about making it available to the rest of the world
  but we 're also studying just a small part of what makes us interesting as human beings and so i would invite other people who are interested in this to ask us for the software or even for guidance on how to move forward with that
  to gain new insights into
