  i love technology and what i do is is i make paper interactive
 and that 's what i say when people ask me what i do but it really confuses most people so really the best way for me to convey it
 is to take the technology and be creative and
  create experiences
 so i tried to think what i could use for here and a couple of weeks ago i had a crazy idea that i wanted to print
 two dj decks and to try and mix some music and i 'm going to try and show that at the end and
 the suspense will be as much mine if it works
 and i 'm not a dj and i 'm not a musician so i 'm a little bit scared of that
 so i think
 i found the best way to describe
 my journey is just to mention a few little things that have happened to me throughout my life there 's three particular things that i that i 've done and i 'll just describe those first and then talk about some of my work
 so when i was a kid i was obsessed with wires and
 i used to thread them under my carpet and thread them behind the walls and have little switches and little speakers and i wanted to make my
  bedroom be interactive but kind of all hidden away and i was also
 really interested in in wireless as well so i bought one of those little kits that you could get to make a radio transmitter and i got an old book and i carved out the inside 
 and i hid it inside there and then i placed it next to my dad and snuck
  back to my bedroom and tuned in on the radio so i could eavesdrop
 i was not at all interested in what he was saying it 's more that i just liked the idea of an everyday object
 having something inside and doing something different
 several year later i managed to successfully fail all of my exams and didn 't really leave school with
 with much much to show for at all and my parents maybe as a reward bought me what turned out to be
  a one way ticket to australia and i came back home about four years later
 i ended up on a farm
 in the middle of nowhere it was in far western new south wales
 and this farm was one hundred and twenty thousand acres there were twenty two thousand sheep and it was about forty degrees or one hundred or so fahrenheit
  and on this farm there was the farmer his wife and there was the four year old daughter
 and they kind of took me into the farm and showed me what it was like to live and work
 obviously one of the most important things was the sheep and so my job was well pretty much to do everything but it was about
 bringing the sheep back to the homestead and we 'd do that by building fences using motorbikes and horses and the sheep would make their way all the way back to the shearing shed for the different
  seasons
 and what i learned was although at the time like everyone else i thought sheep were pretty stupid because they didn 't do what we wanted them to do
 what i realize now probably only just in the last few weeks looking back is the sheep weren 't stupid at all
 we 'd put them in an environment where they didn 't want to be and they didn 't want to do what we wanted them to do
 so the challenge was to try and get them to do what we wanted them to do by by listening to the weather the
  of the land and and creating things that would let the sheep flow and go where we wanted them to go
 another bunch of years later i ended up at cambridge university at the cavendish laboratory in the u k doing a ph d in physics
 my ph d was to move electrons around one at a time
 and i realize again it 's kind of these realizations looking back as to what i did i realize
  now that it was pretty much the same as as moving sheep around
 it really is it 's just you do it by changing an environment and that 's kind of been a big lesson to me that you can 't act on any object you change its environment and the object will flow
 so we made it very small so things were about thirty nanometers in size making it very cold so
 at liquid helium temperatures
  and changing environment by changing the voltage and the electrons could make flow around a loop one at a time on and off a little memory node
 and i wanted to go one step further and i wanted to move one electron on and one electron off and i was told that i wouldn 't be able to do this which you know as we 've heard from other people that 's the thing that makes you do it
 and i was determined and i managed to show
  i could do that and a lot of that learning i think came from being on that farm because when i was working on the farm
 we 'd have to use what was around us we 'd have to use the environment and there was no such thing as something can 't be done because you 're in an environment where if you can 't do what you need to do
 you can die and you know i had seen that sort of thing
 happen so now my obsession is printing
  and i 'm really fascinated by the idea of using conventional printing processes so the types of print that are used to create many of the things around us
 to make paper and card interactive
 when i spoke to some printers when i started doing this and told them what i wanted to do which was to print conductive inks onto paper
 they told me it couldn 't be done again that kind of favorite thing
 so i
  i got about ten credit cards and loans and got myself very close to bankruptcy really and bought myself this huge printing press which i had no idea how to use 
  at all it was about five meters long and i covered myself and the floor with ink and made a massive mess but i learned to print
  the case
 so
 what we do is we take conventional printing presses we make conductive inks and run those through a press and basically just letting hundreds of thousands 
  of electrons flow through pieces of paper so we can make that paper interactive and it 's pretty simple really it 's just
  of things that have been done before but bringing them together in a different way
 so we have a piece of paper with conductive ink on
 and then add onto that a small circuit board with a couple of chips one to run some capacitive touch software so we know where we 've touched it
 and the other to run quite often some wireless software so the piece of paper can can connect
 so i 'll just describe a couple of things that that we 've created there 's lots of different things we 've created this is one of them because i love
  cake and this one it 's a large poster and you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it and the poster talks to you when you touch it and asks you a series of questions and it works out your perfect cake
 but it doesn 't tell you the cake there and then it uploads a picture and the reason why it chose that cake for you to our facebook page
 and and to twitter so we 're trying to create that connection between the physical and the
  digital but have it not looking on a screen and just looking like a regular poster
 we 've worked with
 a bunch of universities on a on a project looking at interactive newsprint
 so for example we 've created a newspaper a regular newspaper you can wear a pair of headphones that are connected to it wirelessly and when you touch it you can hear the music that 's described on the top which is something you can 't read you can hear
 a press conference as well as reading what the editor has determined that press conference was about and you can press a facebook like button or you can vote on something as well
 something else that we created and this was an idea that i had a couple of years ago and so we 've done a project on this it was for funding from the government for user centered design for energy efficient buildings 
  difficult to say and something i had no idea what it was when i went into the workshop but quickly learned
 and we wanted to try and encourage people to to use energy better and i really liked the idea that instead of looking at dials and reading things to say
 looking at your energy usage i wanted to create a poster that was wirelessly connected and had color changing inks on it and so if your energy usage was trending better than the leaves would appear and the rabbits would appear and all would be good and if it
 't then there 'd be graffiti and the leaves would fall off the trees so it was trying to make you look after something in your immediate environment
 which you don 't want to see not looking so good rather than expecting people to do things in the local environment because of the effect that it has a long way off and i think kind of like going back 
  to the farm it 's about how to let people do what you want them to do rather than making people do what you want them to do
 okay so this is the bit i 'm really scared of
 so a couple of things i 've created are there 's a poster over here that you can play drums on
 and i am not a musician it seemed like a good idea at the time if
 anyone wants to try and play drums then they can i 'll just describe how this works this poster is wirelessly connected to my cell phone and
  when you touch it it connects to the app drums
 and it has really good response time it 's using bluetooth four so it 's pretty instantaneous
 okay
  couple of other things so
 this one is like a sound board so you can touch it and i just love these horrible noises sirens explosions breaking glass okay
  and this is a d j turntable so it 's wirelessly linked to my ipad
  oh yes i just love doing that i 'm not a d j though but i just always wanted to do that scratching
 so i have a crossfader and i have the two decks
 so i 've made some new technology and i love things being creative and i love working with creative people so
 my fifteen year old niece she 's amazing and she 's called charlotte and i
  asked her to record something and i worked with a friend called elliot to put some beats together so this is my niece charlotte
  pretty much what i do i just love bringing technology together having a lot of fun being creative but it 's not about the technology it 's just about i want to create some great experiences so thank you very much
