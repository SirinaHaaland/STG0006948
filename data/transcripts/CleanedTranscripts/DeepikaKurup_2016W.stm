  every summer my family and i travel across the world  three thousand miles away to the culturally diverse country of india  
 now india is a country infamous for its scorching heat and humidity for me the only relief from this heat
 is to drink plenty of water  
 now  while in india  my parents always remind me to only drink boiled or bottled water  
 because unlike here in america  where i can just turn on a tap and easily get clean potable water  
 in india the water is often contaminated  so my parents have to make sure that the water we drink is safe
  i soon realized that not everyone is fortunate enough to enjoy the clean water we did  
 outside my grandparents ' house in the busy streets of india  i saw people standing in long lines under the hot sun
 filling buckets with water from a tap i even saw children who looked the same age as me
  filling up these clear plastic bottles with dirty water from streams on the roadside watching these kids
 forced to drink water
 that i felt was too dirty to touch
 changed my perspective on the world 
 this unacceptable social injustice compelled me to want to find a solution to our world 's clean water
  problem  
 i wanted to know why these kids lacked water  
 a substance that is essential for life and i learned that we are facing a global water crisis  
 now  this may seem surprising as seventy five percent of our planet is covered in water  
 but only two point five percent of that is freshwater 
 and less than one
  percent of earth 's freshwater supply is available for human consumption 
 with rising populations industrial development and economic growth our demand for clean water is increasing  
 yet our freshwater resources are rapidly depleting  
 according to the world health organization
  six hundred and sixty million people in our world lack access to a clean water source  
 lack of access to clean water is a leading cause of death in children under the age of five in developing countries and unicef estimates that three thousand children die every day from a water related disease  
 so after returning home one summer in eighth
  i decided that i wanted to combine my passion for solving the global water crisis with my interest in science 
 so i decided that the best thing to do would be to convert my garage into a laboratory 
 actually at first i converted my kitchen into a laboratory but my parents didn 't really approve and kicked me out
  i also read a lot of journal papers on
  research and i learned that currently in developing countries  something called solar disinfection or sodis is used to purify water
 in sodis clear plastic bottles are filled with contaminated water and then exposed to sunlight for six to eight hours 
 the uv radiation from the
  really easy to use and energy efficient as it only uses solar energy it 's really slow as it can take up to two days when it 's cloudy  
 so in order to make the sodis process faster this new method called
 has recently been used so what exactly is this
  down photo means from the sun and a catalyst is something that speeds up a reaction  
 so what photocatalysis is doing is it 's just speeding up this solar disinfection process 
 when sunlight comes in and strikes a 
  or titanium dioxide it creates
  hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals 
 these reactive oxygen species are able to remove bacteria and organics and a whole lot of contaminants from drinking water  
 but unfortunately there are several disadvantages to the way
 photocatalytic sodis is currently deployed  see  what they do is they take the clear plastic bottles and they coat the inside with this
  photocatalytic coating  but
 like titanium dioxide are actually commonly used in sunscreens to block uv radiation 
 so when they 're coated on the inside of these bottles they 're actually blocking some of the uv radiation and diminishing the efficiency of the process 
  these photocatalytic coatings are not tightly bound to the plastic bottle  which means they wash off and people end up drinking the catalyst 
 while tio2 is safe and inert it 's really inefficient if you keep drinking the catalyst because then you have to continue to replenish it even after a few uses 
 so my goal was to overcome the disadvantages of these current treatment methods and create a safe
  purifying water  
 what started off as an eighth grade science fair project is now my photocatalytic composite for water purification 
 the composite combines titanium dioxide with cement 
 the cement like composite can be formed into several different shapes  which results in an extremely versatile range of deployment methods 
 for example you could create a rod
  rod that can easily be placed inside water bottles for individual use
 or you could create a porous filter that can filter water for families 
 you can even coat the inside of an existing water tank to purify larger amounts of water for communities over a longer period of time 
 now
  over the course of this my journey hasn 't really been easy you know
 i didn 't have access to a sophisticated laboratory  i was fourteen years old when i started but i didn 't let my age deter me in my interest 
  in pursuing scientific research and wanting to solve the global water crisis  
  and for that reason i 'm continuing to work on this science fair project from two thousand and twelve to bring it from the laboratory into the real world and this summer  i founded 
 catalyst for world water  a social enterprise aimed at catalyzing solutions to the global water crisis 
  a single drop of water can 't do much  but when many drops come together they can sustain life on our planet 
 just as water drops come together to form oceans  i believe that we all must come together when tackling this global problem  thank you
