  show you how terrorism
 actually interacts with our daily life  fifteen years ago i received a phone call from a friend at the time he was looking after the rights of political
  he asked me if i wanted to interview the red brigades  now as many of you may remember the red brigades was
 a terrorist  marxist organization which was very active in italy from the 1960s until the 
 as part of their strategy the red brigades never spoke with anybody not even with their lawyers
  they sat in silence through their trails  waving occasionally at family and friends 
 in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three they declared the end of the armed struggle  
 and they drew a list of people with whom they would talk  and tell their story and i was one of those people 
 when i asked my friend why the red brigades want to talk to me he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported
 my name  in particular one person had put it forward  she was my childhood friend 
 she had joined the red brigades and became a leader of the organization  
 naturally  i didn 't know that until the day she was arrested  in fact  i read it in the newspaper 
 at the time of the phone call i just had a baby
  completed a management buyout to the company i was working
 with  and the last thing i wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high security prisons  
 but this is exactly what i did
 because i wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist  and why
  i found the answer very quickly  
 i actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist  the center committee of the red brigades had judged me
  and too opinionated to become a good terrorist 
 my friend on the other hand  she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders  
 she also embraced violence  because she believed that the only way to unblock what at the time was
 known as a blocked democracy italy a country run by the same party for thirty five years
 was the arms struggle  at the same time
  while i was interviewing the red brigades  i also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics
 or ideology  but actually was ruled by economics  they were constantly short of cash  
 they were constantly searching for cash  now contrary to what many people believe
  of the red brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars  this is roughly between one hundred and one hundred and fifty million  today  
  now you know if you live underground it 's really hard to produce this amount of money 
  brigades and then later on other arms organizations including members of
 group in the middle east  
 everybody was extremely reluctant to talk about ideology or politics because they had no idea  
 the
 political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership  which generally is never more than
  five to seven people all the others do day in and day out is search for money 
 once for example i was interviewing this part timer from the red brigades  it was a psychiatrist  he loved sailing he was a really keen sailor 
 and he had this beautiful boat  and he told me that the best time of his life was when he
 was a member of the red brigades
 and he went sailing every summer back and forth from lebanon where he would pick up soviet weapons from the plo  and then carry them all the way to sardinia where the other 
 arms organization from europe would go and take their share of the arms for that service the red brigades were actually paid a fee which went to fund their organization 
 i thought  maybe there is something here  maybe there is a link a commercial link between one organization and another one  
 but it was only when
 i interviewed mario moretti the head of the red brigades  the man who kidnapped and killed aldo moro italian
  i finally realized that terrorism is actually business 
 i was having lunch with him in a high security prison in italy  and
 as we were eating  i had the distinct feeling that
 i was back in the city of london having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist  this guy thought in the
  i wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism  
 naturally  nobody wanted to fund my research  in fact i think many people thought that i was a bit crazy you know that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money thinking about the economics of terrorism  
 so  in the end i took a decision that in retrospect
  i sold my company and funded the research myself  and what i discovered
 is this parallel reality
 another international economic system which runs parallel to our own which has been created by arms organizations since the end of world war ii and what is even more shocking
 is that this system has followed step by step the
  evolution of our own system of our western capitalism  and there are three main stages  
 the first one is the state sponsor of terrorism  
 the second one is the privatization of terrorism  and the third of course is the globalization of terrorism  
 so  state sponsor of
  feature of the cold war this is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy  along the periphery of the sphere of influence  
 fully funding arms organizations a mix of legal and illegal activities is used 
 so the link between crime and terror is established very early on 
 and here is the best example the contras in nicaragua
  and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism  so they gain independence from the sponsor
  we see a mix of legal and illegal activities  so arafat
 used to get a percentage of the smuggling of hashish from beka valley which is the valley between lebanon and syria  
 and the ira  which control the private transportation system in northern ireland
  did exactly the same thing so  every single time
 that somebody got into a taxi in belfast without knowing actually was funding the ira  
 but the great change came of course with globalization and deregulation this is when arms organization
 were able to link up also financially with each other but above all they started to do serious business with the
  their dirty business through the same channel  this is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization al qaeda  
 this is an organization that can raise money across border but also that is able to carry out attacks
 in more than one country  now deregulation also brought back
  so what is rogue economics 
 rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history  
 it comes back at times of great transformation  globalization being one of those transformations  
 it is at this times in which politics
 actually loses control of the economy and the economy becomes a rogue force working against us  it has happened before in history it has happened with the
 the roman empire  it has happened with industrial revolution and it actually happened again with the fall of the berlin wall  
 now i calculated
 how big was this international economic system composed by crime terror  and illegal economy
  dollars  it is trillions it 's not billions  this is about
 twice the gdp of the united kingdom  soon will be more considering where this country is going 
 now  until 9 11 the bulk of all this money flew into the u s economy because
  the bulk of the money was denominated in u s dollars
 and the money laundering was taking place inside the united states  the entry point of course of most of this money were the off shore facilities  
 so  this was a vital injection of cash into the u s economy  
 now when i went to look at the figures of the u s money supply 
  money supply is the amount of dollars
 that the federal reserve prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars  which of course reflects the growth
 of the economy  so when i went to look at those figures  i noted that since the late 
 a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the united states never to come back these were
  money taken out in suitcases or in containers  in cash of course  these were money taken out by criminals and money launderers  these were money taken out to fund the growth
 of the terror  illegal and criminal economy  so  you see what is the
  the united states
 actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world 
 what does it mean 
 that means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have  it can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world  
 this privilege is called seigniorage 
 no other country can do
  all the other countries for example the united kingdom can borrow only against the amount of
 money in circulation inside its own borders 
 so here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime terror  and illegal economy  and our economy the u s 
 in the 1990s was borrowing against the growth of the terror  illegal and criminal economy  
 this is how close we are with this world
 now this situation changed 
 because george bush launched the war on terror  part of the war on terror was the introduction of the patriot act  
 now many of you know that the patriot act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of americans
 in order to protect
  but there is a section of the patriot act which refers specifically to finance and it is in fact 
  legislation what the patriot act did was to prohibit
  authorities
 the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world 
 now you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking  all the bankers said to their clients get out of the dollars
 and go and invest somewhere else now the euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business
  and this is what people did  nobody wants the u s monetary authority to check their relationship to monitor their relationship with their clientele 
 the same thing happened of course  in the world of crime and terror 
 people simply moved their money laundering
 activities away from the united states
 into europe
 why did this happen this happened because the patriot act was a unilateral legislation it was introduced only in the united states and it was introduced only for the u s dollars 
 in europe a similar legislation was not introduced  
 so within six months
 europe became the
  this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror  and our own life
