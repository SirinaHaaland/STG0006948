  my passions
 are music technology
 and making things 
 and it 's the combination of these things that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization  and on occasion has led me to play with fire 
 this is a rubens ' tube it 's one of many i 've made over the years and i have
  one here tonight it 's about an 8 foot long tube of metal it 's got a hundred or so holes on top on that side is the speaker and here is some lab tubing and it 's connected to this tank
 of propane  so 
 let 's fire it up and see what it does  
  it 's okay to applaud the laws of physics but essentially what 's happening here
 is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules is influencing the combustion properties of propane creating a visible waveform  
 and we can see the alternating
  regions of compression and rarefaction that we call frequency and the height is showing us amplitude so let 's change the frequency of the sound and watch what happens to the fire 
 so every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave
 and that emergent sine curve of fire so let 's turn that off we 're indoors
 're indoors thank you i
 also have with me a flame table it
 's very similar to a rubens ' tube and it 's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sound such as eigenmodes so let 's fire it up
 and see what it does
  while the table comes up to pressure let me note here that the sound is not traveling in perfect lines  it 's actually traveling in all directions and the rubens ' tube 's a little like bisecting those waves with a line and the flame table 's a little like bisecting those waves with a plane  
 and it can show a little more subtle complexity  which is why i like to use it to watch geoff farina play guitar
  one
  you watch closely you may have seen some of the eigenmodes
  but also you may have seen that jazz music is better with fire 
 actually a lot of things are better with fire in my world but the fire 's just a foundation it
 shows very well that eyes can hear and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound 
 such as the removal of time so here i 'm using a rendering algorithm to paint the frequencies of the song smells like teen spirit in a way that the eyes can take them in as a single
  visual impression  and the technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition so if i show you another song off this album and another 
 your eyes will easily pick out the use of repetition by the band nirvana and in the frequency distribution the colors you can see the 
  sound that they are famous for
  here is the entire album as a single visual impression and i think this impression is pretty powerful at least it 's powerful enough that if i show you these four songs  and i remind you that this is smells like teen spirit 
 you can probably correctly guess without listening to any music at all that the song a die hard nirvana fan would enjoy is this song i
  looks all right now for some more sound data this is data from a skate park  and this is mabel davis skate park
 in austin  texas and the sounds you 're hearing came from eight microphones attached to obstacles around the park and
 it sounds like chaos but actually all the tricks start with a very distinct
 slap but successful tricks end with a pop  whereas unsuccessful tricks more of a scratch and a tumble
 and tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong 
 and voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park so if we were to render these sounds visually we might end up with something like this 
 this is all forty minutes of the recording  and right away the algorithm tells us a lot more tricks are missed than are made and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely to produce a
  and if you look really closely we can tease out traffic patterns you see the skaters often trick in this direction 
 the obstacles are easier  and in the middle of the recording the mics pick this up but later in the recording  this kid shows up 
 and he starts using a line at the top of the park to do some very advanced tricks on something called the tall rail  and it 's fascinating at this moment in time  all the rest of the skaters turn their lines ninety degrees to stay out of his way 
 you see there 's a subtle etiquette in the skate park
  led by key influencers and they tend to be the kids
 who can do the best tricks or wear red pants and on this day the mics picked that up 
 all right from skate physics to theoretical physics i 'm a big fan of stephen hawking  and i wanted to use all eight hours of his cambridge lecture series to create an homage now in this series 
  he 's speaking with the aid of a computer which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences fairly easy
  a steering algorithm it listens to the lecture and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x axis 
 and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y axis
 and these trend lines you can see there 's more questions than answers in the laws of physics and when we reach the end of a sentence we place a star at that location  so
 there 's a lot of sentences so a lot of stars and after rendering all of the audio this is what we get
 this is stephen hawking 's universe 
 it 's
 all eight hours of the cambridge lecture series taken in as a single visual impression  
 and i really like this image but a lot of people think it 's fake  so i made a more interactive version  and the way i did that
 is i used
 their position in
  time in the lecture to place these stars into 3d space and with some custom software and a kinect 
 i can walk right into the lecture i 'm going to wave through the kinect here and take control and now i 'm going to reach out
 and i 'm going to touch a star and when i do it will play the sentence that generated that star stephen hawking there is one and
  's a really fun way to explore the lecture and i hope a fitting homage  all right  let me close with a work in progress 
 i think after thirty years the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning
  all seen a lot of tedtalks online so let 's watch one now with the sound turned off
 and the closed captioning turned on 
 there 's no closed captioning for the ted theme song and we 're missing it but if you 've watched enough of these you hear it in your mind 's ear  and then applause starts it
 usually begins here and it grows and then it falls  sometimes you get a little star applause and then i think even bill gates takes a nervous breath and
  let 's watch this clip again this time i 'm not going to talk at all there 's still going to be no audio but what i am going to do is i 'm going to render the sound
 visually in real time at the bottom of the screen  so watch closely and see what your eyes can hear
  this is fairly amazing to me even on the first view your eyes will successfully pick out patterns  but on repeated views your brain actually gets better
  at turning these patterns into information you can get the tone and the timbre and the pace of the speech things that you can 't get out of closed captioning 
 that famous scene in horror movies where someone is walking up
 from behind
 is something you can see and
 i believe this information would be something that is useful at times when the audio is turned off or not heard at all and i speculate that deaf audiences might actually even be better at seeing sound than hearing audiences 
 i don 't know it 's a theory right now actually it 's all just an idea
