  i want to speak about a forgotten conflict  it 's a conflict that rarely hits the headlines  
 it happens right here in the democratic republic of congo 
 now most people outside of africa don 't know much about the war in congo  so let me give you a
  couple of key facts  
 the congolese conflict is the deadliest conflict since world war ii it has caused almost four million deaths  
 it has destabilized most of central africa for the past eighteen years  it is the largest ongoing humanitarian crisis in the
  that 's why i first went to congo in two thousand and one 
 i was a young humanitarian aid worker and i met this woman who was my age she was called isabelle 
 local militias had attacked isabelle 's village 
 they had killed many men raped many women they had looted everything  and then they wanted to take isabelle but her husband stepped in
  please don 't take isabelle take me instead 
 so he had gone to the forest with the militias  and isabelle had never seen him again  
 well  it 's because of people like isabelle and her husband
 that i have devoted my career to studying this war that we know so little about 
 although there is one story about congo that you may have heard  it 's a story about
  minerals and rape
  policy statements and media reports both usually focus on a primary cause of violence in congo the illegal exploitation and trafficking of natural resources
 and on a main consequence
 sexual abuse of women and girls as a weapon of war so not that these two issues
 aren 't important and tragic they are 
 but today i want to tell you a different story 
 i want to tell you a story that emphasizes a core cause of the ongoing conflict 
 violence in congo is in large part driven by local bottom up conflicts
 that international peace efforts have failed
  to help address  
 the story starts from the fact that not only is congo notable for being the world 's worst ongoing humanitarian crisis  
 but it is also home to some of the largest international peacebuilding efforts in the world 
 congo hosts the largest and most expensive united nations peacekeeping mission
  in the world
  it was also the site of the first european led peacekeeping mission 
 and for its first cases ever  the international criminal court chose to prosecute
 congolese warlords 
 in two thousand and six  when congo held the first free national elections in its history many observers thought that an end to violence
 in the region had finally come the international community lauded the successful organization of these elections
 as finally an example of successful international intervention in a failed state  
 but the eastern provinces have continued to face massive population displacements and
 horrific human rights violations
  before i went back there last summer there was a horrible massacre in the province of south kivu
 thirty three people were killed they were mostly women and children  and many of them were hacked to death 
 during the past eight years fighting in the eastern provinces has regularly reignited full scale civil and international war
 so basically  every time we feel that we are on the brink of peace the conflict explodes again  why 
 why have the massive international efforts failed to help congo achieve lasting peace
 and security well my answer to this question revolves around two central observations
 first one of the main reasons for the continuation of violence in congo is fundamentally local
 and when i say local i really mean at the level of the individual the family the clan the municipality the community the district sometimes the
  for instance you remember the story of isabelle that i told you  well  the reason why militias had attacked isabelle 's village
 was because they wanted to take the land
 that the villagers needed to cultivate food and to survive  the second central observation
 is that international peace efforts have failed to help address local conflicts because of the presence of a
  dominant peacebuilding culture so
 what i mean is that western and african diplomats united nations peacekeepers
  donors  the staff of most nongovernmental organizations that work with the resolution of conflict they all share a specific way of seeing the
  i was one of these people and i shared this culture  so i know all too well how powerful it is 
 throughout the world  and throughout conflict zones  
 this common culture shapes the intervener 's understanding of the causes of violence
 as something that is primarily located in the national and international
  it shapes our understanding of the path toward peace
 as something again that requires top down intervention to address national and international tensions  
 and it shapes our understanding of the roles of foreign actors as engaging in national and international peace processes  
 even more importantly
  so for instance in congo because of how they are socialized and trained  
 united nations officials donors diplomats  the staff of most nongovernmental organizations  
 they interpret continued fighting and massacres as a
 to them the violence they see is
 the consequence of tensions between president kabila and various national opponents  and tensions between congo  rwanda
 and uganda in addition these international peacebuilders view local conflicts
 as simply the result
 of national and international tensions  insufficient state authority  
 and what they call the congolese people 's so called inherent penchant for violence 
 the dominant culture also constructs intervention at the national and international levels
 as the only natural and legitimate task for united nations staffers and diplomats
 and it elevates the organization of general elections which is now a sort of cure all 
 as the most crucial state reconstruction mechanism over more effective state building approaches  
 and that happens not only in congo but also in many other conflict zones
  let 's dig deeper into the other main sources of violence 
 in congo  continuing violence is motivated not only by the national and international causes
 but also by longstanding bottom up agendas
 whose main instigators are villagers traditional chiefs community chiefs or ethnic leaders 
 many conflicts revolve around political
  social and economic stakes that are distinctively local 
 for instance  there is a lot of competition at the village or district level
 over who can be chief of village or chief of territory according to traditional law  and who can control the distribution of land
 and the exploitation of local mining sites this competition often
  results in localized fighting for instance in one village or territory 
 and quite frequently it escalates into generalized fighting so across a whole province and even at times into neighboring countries 
 take the conflict between congolese of rwandan
  during belgian colonization  
 when both communities competed over access to land and to local power 
 then in one thousand nine hundred and sixty after congolese independence  it escalated
 because each camp tried to align with national politicians
  but still to advance their local agendas  and then at the time of the one thousand nine hundred and ninety four genocide in rwanda 
 these local actors allied with congolese and rwandan armed groups  but still to advance their local agendas in the provinces of the kivus 
 and since then these local disputes over land and local power have fueled violence and they have regularly jeopardized
 the national and international settlements  
 so we can wonder why in these circumstances
 the international peacebuilders have failed to help implement local peacebuilding programs  and the answer
 is that international interveners deem the resolution of grassroots conflict
 an unimportant  unfamiliar and illegitimate task  
 the very idea of becoming involved at the local level clashes fundamentally with existing cultural norms  and it threatens key organizational interests 
  the very identity of the united nations as this macro level diplomatic organization would be upended
 if it were to refocus on local conflicts 
 and the result is that neither the internal resistance to the dominant ways of working nor the external shocks
 have managed to convince international actors that they should reevaluate their understanding of violence
 and intervention 
 and so far there have been only very few exceptions there have been exceptions but only very few exceptions to this broad pattern  
 so to wrap up
  the story i just told you is a story about how a dominant peacebuilding culture shapes the intervener 's understanding of what the causes
  violence are how peace is made  and what interventions should accomplish 
 these understandings enable international  peacebuilders
 to ignore the micro level foundations that are so necessary for sustainable peace  
 the resulting inattention to local conflicts leads to inadequate peacebuilding in the short term
  and potential war resumption in the long term 
 and what 's fascinating is that this analysis helps us to better understand many cases of lasting conflict and international intervention failures 
 in africa and elsewhere 
 local conflicts fuel violence in most war and
  and in the rare cases where there have been comprehensive bottom up peacebuilding initiatives  
 these attempts have been successful at making peace sustainable 
 one of the best examples is the contrast between the relatively peaceful situation in somaliland  
 which benefited from sustained grassroots peacebuilding initiatives
 and the violence prevalent in the rest of somalia  where peacebuilding has been mostly top down and
 there are several other cases in which local grassroots conflict resolution has made a crucial difference  
 so if we want international peacebuilding to
  must be resolved from the bottom up
  and again  it 's not that national and international tensions don 't matter they do  
 and it 's not that national and international peacebuilding isn 't necessary  it is 
 instead  it is that both
 and local nongovernmental organizations local authorities and civil society representatives should be the main actors in the bottom up process  
 so of course there are obstacles local actors often lack the funding and sometimes the logistical means and the technical capacity
 to implement effective local peacebuilding programs so
  actors should expand their funding and support for local conflict resolution 
 as for congo what can be done  
 after two decades of conflict and the deaths of millions  it 's clear that we need to change our approach  
 based on my field research i believe that international and congolese actors
 should pay more attention to
 the resolution of land conflict
 and the promotion of inter community reconciliation  
 so for instance in the province of the kivus the life and peace institute and its congolese partners
 have set up 
  forums to discuss the specifics of local conflicts over land and these forums have found solutions to help manage the violence
 that 's the kind of program that is sorely needed throughout eastern congo  
 it 's with programs like this that we can help people like isabelle and her husband  
 so these will not be magic wands  but because they take into account deeply rooted causes of the violence they could definitely be
