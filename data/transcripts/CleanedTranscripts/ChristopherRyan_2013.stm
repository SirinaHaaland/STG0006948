  i 'm going to go off script and make chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation all right are you with me  
 yeah  yeah all right so what i 'd like to do is have you raise your hand if you 've ever heard a
  couple having sex 
 could be the neighbors hotel room your parents  sorry  
 okay  pretty much everybody  now raise your hand if the man was making more noise than the woman  
 i see
 one guy there it doesn 't count if it was you sir 
 so his hand 's down  and one woman  okay sitting next to a loud guy  
 now what does this tell us it tells us that human beings make noise when they
  have sex and it 's generally the woman who makes more noise this is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd i wasn 't even going to mention this but somebody told me that meg ryan might be here 
 and she is the world 's most famous female 
  so i thought got to talk about that we 'll get back to that a little
  let me start by saying human beings are not descended from apes  despite what you may have heard we are apes we are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo
 than the african elephant is to the indian elephant as jared diamond pointed out in one of his early books we
 're more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate
 gorillas orangutans what have you  so we 're extremely closely related to them
  and as you 'll see in terms of our behavior we 've got some relationship as well  so what i 'm asking today the question i want to explore with you today is 
 what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality 
 now since darwin 's day there 's been what cacilda and i have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution
  read this stuff 
 the idea is that as part of human nature from the beginning of our species ' time men have sort of leased women 's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services 
 generally
 we 're talking about meat shelter status  protection things like that and in exchange women have offered fidelity or at least a promise of fidelity  
 now this sets men and women
  up in an oppositional relationship  the war between the sexes is built right into our dna according to this vision right 
 what cacilda and i have argued is that no this economic
 relationship this oppositional relationship is actually an artifact of agriculture  which only arose about ten thousand years ago at the earliest 
 anatomically modern human beings
  have been around for about two hundred thousand years so we 're talking about five percent at most of our time as a as a modern distinct species  
 so
 before agriculture before the agricultural revolution it 's important to understand that human beings lived in hunter gatherer groups
 that are characterized wherever they 're found in the world
  what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism
 they not only share things they demand that things be shared meat  shelter protection all these things that were supposedly being traded to women for their sexual 
  fidelity it turns out are shared widely among these societies now i 'm not saying that our ancestors were noble savages and i 'm not saying modern day
  savages either what i 'm saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context and there 's really no argument about this among anthropologists 
 all cacilda and i have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality  so we 've argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved
  as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex flexible social systems networks that our ancestors were very good at and that 's why our species has survived so well
 now this makes some people uncomfortable and so i always need to take a moment in these talks to say  listen i 'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous but i 'm not saying they were having sex with strangers there were no strangers
 in a hunter gatherer band there are no strangers you 've known these people your entire life so i 'm saying yes there were overlapping sexual relationships that our ancestors probably had several 
  different sexual relationships going on at any given moment in their adult lives  but i 'm not saying they were having sex with strangers i 'm not saying that they didn 't love the people they were
  having sex with and i 'm not saying there was no pair bonding going on i 'm just saying it wasn 't sexually exclusive  
 and those of us who have chosen to be monogamous my parents for example have been married for fifty two years monogamously 
 and if it wasn 't monogamously mom and dad i don 't want to hear about it
 i 'm not criticizing this and i 'm not saying there 's anything wrong with this what i 'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores
 is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism 
 you can choose to be a vegetarian but don 't think that just because you 've made that decision bacon suddenly stops smelling good  
 okay  so this is my point that
 one took a minute to sink in
  now in addition to being a great genius a wonderful man a wonderful husband a wonderful father charles darwin was also a world class victorian prude 
 all right he was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates including chimps and bonobos because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females  so he couldn 't understand why on earth would the female have developed
  this thing if all they were supposed to be doing is forming their pair bond  right  
 chimps and bonobos darwin didn 't really know this but chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day
 when they have their sexual swellings interestingly chimps have sexual swellings through forty
  of their menstrual cycle bonobos ninety percent  
 and humans are among the only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle  whether she 's menstruating whether she 's post menopausal whether she 's already pregnant this is vanishingly rare
 among mammals  so it 's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality 
 now darwin ignored the reflections of the sexual swelling in his own day
 as
 scientists tend to do sometimes
 so what we 're talking about is sperm competition now the average human ejaculate has about three hundred million sperm cells so it 's already a competitive environment  
 the question is whether these sperm are competing against other men 's sperm or just their own 
 there 's a lot to talk about in this chart
  the one thing i 'll call your attention to right away is the little
 musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human that indicates female copulatory vocalization 
 just look at the numbers the average human has sex about one thousand times per birth if
 that number seems high for some of you i assure you it seems low for others in the room
  we share that ratio with chimps and bonobos  we don 't share it with the other three apes the gorilla the orangutan and the gibbon
  are more typical of mammals having sex only about a dozen times per birth  
 humans and bonobos are the only animals that have sex face to face when both of them are alive 
 and you 'll see that the human chimp and bonobo all have external
  which in our book we we equate to
 a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer 
 if you 're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage you expect a party to happen at any moment and you need to be ready that 's what the external testicles are they keep the sperm cells cool
 so you can have frequent ejaculations i 'm sorry  it 's true  
  some of you will be happy to hear has the largest thickest penis of any primate now this evidence goes way beyond anatomy it goes into anthropology as well  historical 
  records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed about human sexual evolution these women are the mosuo from southwestern china in their society
  men and women are completely sexually autonomous there 's no shame associated with sexual behavior women have hundreds of partners it doesn 't matter nobody cares nobody gossips it 's 
  not an issue when the woman becomes pregnant the child is cared for by her her sisters and her brothers the biological father is a nonissue 
  these people actually believe
 and they have no contact among them no common language or anything so it 's not an idea that spread it 's an idea that 's arisen around the world they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen  
 so a woman who wants to have a child who 's smart and funny and strong makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy the funny guy and the strong guy to get the essence of each of these men into the baby and then when the child is born
  men will come forward and acknowledge their paternity of the child so paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor in this society  
 so there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book 
 now why does this matter  
 edward wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation
  think that 's true this matters because our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict
 with many aspects of the modern world the contradictions between what we 're told we should feel and what we actually do feel
 generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering my hope is that a more
  updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves for each other 
 greater respect for unconventional relationship configurations like same sex marriage or polyamorous unions  
 and that we 'll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate instinctive right to monitor and control women 's sexual
  'll see that it 's not only gay people that have to come out of the closet we all have closets we have to come out of 
 right  and when we do come out of those closets we 'll recognize
 that our fight is not with each other our fight is with an outdated victorian sense of human sexuality
 that conflates desire with property rights generates shame and confusion
 in place of understanding and empathy 
 it 's time we moved beyond mars and venus because the truth is that men are from africa and women are from africa  thank you
  trying to use arguments about
 evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today someone
 could give a talk and say look at us we 've got these really sharp teeth and muscles and a brain that 's really good at throwing weapons  and if you look at lots of societies around the world you 'll see very high rates of violence nonviolence
  is a choice like vegetarianism  but it 's not who you are how is that different from the talk
 you gave cr well first of all
 the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable but that 's just an
  lots of people say to me 
 just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn 't mean we should live that way now and i agree with that everyone has to respond to the modern world 
 but the body does have its inherent
 evolved trajectories  and so you could live on mcdonald 's and milkshakes but your body will rebel
  we have appetites i think it was schopenhauer who said a person can do what they want but not want what they want and so what i 'm arguing against is the shame 
  that 's associated with desires it 's the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people there 's something wrong with you there 's something wrong with your marriage 
 something wrong with your partner  i think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality that 's what i 'm trying to get at
