  want to talk a little bit today about
 labor and work 
 when we think about how people work
 the naive intuition we have is that people are like rats in a maze that all people care about is money  and the moment we give them money we can
  direct them to work one way we can direct them
 to work another way  this is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways  and we really have this incredibly simplistic view of why people work and what the labor market looks like 
 at the same time if you think about it there 's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around
  think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing 
 if you read books of people who climb mountains difficult mountains do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness  
 no they are full of misery in fact it 's all about frostbite and having difficulty walking and difficulty breathing
 cold  challenging circumstances  and if people were just trying to be happy the moment they would get to the top they would say
  terrible mistake i 'll never do it again 
 instead let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos but instead  people go down 
 and after they recover they go up again  
 and if you think about mountain climbing as an example  it suggests all kinds of things  
 it suggests that we care about reaching the end a peak  
 it suggests that we care about the fight
 about the challenge  it suggests that there 's all kinds of other things that motivate us
 to work or behave in all kinds of ways  
 and for me personally i started thinking about this after a student came to visit me this was
 one of my students from a few years earlier  and he came one day back
  he told me the following story  
 he said that for more than two weeks  he was working on a powerpoint presentation  
 he was working in a big bank and this was in preparation for a merger and acquisition  
 and he was working very hard on this presentation graphs tables information  he stayed late at night every day  
 and the day before it was due  he sent his powerpoint presentation to his boss and his boss wrote him back and
  said nice presentation  but the merger is canceled 
 and the guy was deeply depressed  now at the moment when he was working he was actually quite happy 
 every night he was enjoying his work he was staying late he was perfecting this powerpoint presentation  but knowing that nobody would
  ever watch it made him quite depressed  so i started thinking about how do we experiment with this idea of the fruits of our labor 
 and to start with we created a little experiment
 in which we gave people legos and we asked them to build with legos 
 and for some people we gave them legos and we said hey
  would you like to build this bionicle for three dollars we 'll pay you three dollars for it and people said yes  and they built with these legos 
 and when they finished we took it  we put it under the table  and we said would you like to build another one  this time for $ two point seven 
 if they said yes we gave them another one  and when they finished we asked them do you want to build another one
  it for me 
 this was what we called the meaningful condition  
 people built one bionicle after another after they finished every one of them we put them under the table  and we told them that at the end of the experiment we will take all these bionicles 
 we will disassemble them we will put them back in the boxes  and we will use it for the next participant
  there was another condition  this other condition was
 inspired by david my student  and this other condition we called the sisyphic condition  
 and if you remember the story about sisyphus sisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill  and when he almost got to the end the rock would roll over and he would have to start again  
 and you can think about this as
  doing futile work you can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills at least he would have some sense of progress  also if you look at
 prison movies  sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners is to get them to dig a hole  and when the prisoner is finished they ask him to fill the hole back up 
  and then dig again  there 's something about this cyclical version of doing something over and over and over that seems to be particularly demotivating 
  the second condition of this experiment that 's exactly what we did 
 we asked people would you like to build one bionicle for three dollars and if they said yes  they built it
 then we asked them do you want to build another one for $ two point seven 
 and if they said yes  we gave them a new one and as they were building it  we took apart the one that they just finished
  and when they finished that we said would you like
  to build another one  this time for thirty cents less and if they said yes  we gave them the one that they built and we broke  
 so this was an endless cycle of them building and us destroying in front of their eyes  
 now what happens when you compare these two conditions  the first thing that happened was that people
  in the meaningful condition versus seven in the sisyphus condition  
 and by the way we should point out that this was not big meaning people were not curing cancer or building bridges people were building bionicles for a few a few cents 
 and not only that everybody knew that the bionicles would be destroyed quite soon so there was not a real opportunity for big meaning  but even the small meaning made a difference 
 now we had another version of this
  experiment in this other version of the experiment we didn 't put people in this situation  we just described to them the situation much as i am describing to you now  and we asked them to predict what the result would be 
 what happened  people predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude people who were just given the description of the experiment
  in the meaningful condition people would probably build one more bionicle 
 so people understand that meaning is important they just don 't understand the magnitude of the importance the extent to which it 's important 
 there was one other piece of data we looked at 
 if you think about it  there are some people who love legos and some people who don 't  and you would speculate that the people who love legos would build more legos even for less
  because after all they get more internal joy from it and the people who love legos less would build less legos because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower 
 and that 's actually what we found in the meaningful condition  there was a very nice correlation between the love of legos  and the amount of legos people built 
 what happened in the sisyphic condition  
 in that condition the correlation was zero there was no relationship between the
  how much people built which suggests to me that with this manipulation of breaking things in front of people 's eyes  we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity  we basically eliminated it 
 soon after i finished
 running this experiment i went to talk to a big software company in seattle i can 't tell you who they were but they were a big
  this was a group within the software company that was put in a different building and they asked them to innovate and create the next big product for this company 
 and the week before i showed up the ceo of this big software company went to that group two hundred engineers  and canceled the project  
 and i stood there in front of two hundred of the most depressed people i 've ever talked
  i described to them some of these lego experiments  and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment  
 and i asked them i said how many of you now show up to work later than you used to and everybody raised their hand i said 
 how many of you now go home earlier than you used to everybody raised their hand 
 i asked them how many of you now add not so kosher things
  and they didn 't raise their hands but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports  
 and then i asked them i said what could the ceo have done
 to make you not as depressed 
 and they came up with all kinds of ideas they said the ceo could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do 
 he could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts
  of the organization  he could have asked them to build some next generation prototypes and see how they would work  
 but the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation 
 and i think the ceo basically did not understand the importance of meaning  if the ceo just like our participants thought the essence of meaning
  i directed you in this way and now that i 'm directing you in this way  everything will be okay 
 but if you understood how important meaning is 
 then you would figure out that it 's actually important to spend some time energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they 're doing  
 the next experiment was slightly different  
 we took a sheet of paper with random letters  and we asked people to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other 
 that was the task
  people did the first sheet then we asked if they wanted to do another for a little less money the next sheet for a little bit less and so on and so forth  
 and we had three conditions  in the first condition  
 people wrote their name on the sheet  found all the pairs of letters gave it to the experimenter the experimenter would look at it  scan it from
  and put it on the pile next to them 
 in the second condition  people did not write their name on it the experimenter looked at it  took the sheet of paper did not look at it did not scan it and simply put it on the pile of pages  
 so you take a piece you just put it on the side  
 in the third condition the experimenter got the sheet of paper and
  what happened in those three conditions  
 in this plot i 'm showing you at what pay rate people stopped so low numbers mean that people worked harder they worked for much longer  
 in the acknowledged condition  people worked all the way down to fifteen cents at fifteen cents per page  they basically stopped these efforts
  in the shredder condition it was twice as much thirty cents per sheet  and this is basically the result we had before you shred people 's
 efforts  output you get them not to be as happy with what they 're doing but i should point out by the way that in the shredder condition people could have cheated they could have done not so good work because they realized people were just shredding it  
 so maybe the first sheet you 'd do good work but then you see nobody is really testing it  so you would do more and more and more  so in fact in the shredder
  people could have submitted more work and gotten more money and put less effort into it  
 but what about the ignored condition  would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder or somewhere in the middle 
 it turns out it was almost like the shredder  
 now there 's good news and bad news here  the bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost
  as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes  ignoring gets you a whole way out there 
 the good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done scanning it and saying uh huh 
 that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve people 's motivations  
 so the good news is that adding motivation doesn 't seem to be so difficult  the bad news is that
  eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy  and if we don 't think about it carefully  we might overdo it  
 so this is all in terms of negative motivation or eliminating negative motivation  
 the next part i want to show you is something about positive motivation  so there is a store in the
  and ikea is a store with
 kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble 
 i don 't know about you but every time i assemble one of those it takes me much longer it 's much more effortful it 's much more confusing i put things in the wrong way
 i can 't say i enjoy those pieces i can 't say i enjoy the
  but when i finish it  i seem to like those ikea pieces of furniture more than i like other ones 
 and there 's an old story about cake mixes  
 so when they started cake mixes in the ' 40s 
 they would take this powder and they would put it in a box and they would ask housewives to basically pour it in stir some water in it  
 mix it  put it in the oven
  and voila
 you had cake  
 but it turns out they were very unpopular people did not want them 
 and they thought about all kinds of reasons for that maybe the taste was not good no the taste was great 
 what they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved  
 it was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say here is my cake no it was somebody else 's cake as if you bought it in
  it didn 't really feel like your own so what did they do they took the eggs and the milk out of the powder 
 laughter now
 you had to break the eggs and add them you had to measure the milk and add it  mixing it  now it was your cake  now everything was fine
  i think a little bit like the ikea effect by getting people to work harder they actually got them to love what they 're doing to a higher degree  
 so how do we look at this question experimentally  
 we asked people to build some origami  
 we gave them instructions on how to create origami and we gave them a sheet of paper  and these were all novices  and they built something that was really quite ugly
 nothing like a frog or a crane
  but then we told them look this origami really belongs to us you worked for us but i 'll tell you what we 'll sell it to you how much do you want to pay for it 
 and we measured how much they were willing to pay for it  
 and we had two types of people we had the people who built it  and the people who did not build it and just looked at it as external observers 
 and what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami
 and they were willing to pay five times more for them than the people who just evaluated them externally  
 now you could say if you were a builder do you think [ you 'd say ] oh  i love this origami  but i know that nobody else would love it 
 or i love this origami  and everybody
  love it as well which one of those two is correct 
 turns out the builders not only loved the origami more they thought that everybody would see the world in their view they thought everybody else would love it more as well 
 in the next version we tried to do the ikea effect  we tried to make it more difficult  
 so for some people we gave the same task for some people we made it harder by hiding the
  at the top of the sheet we had little diagrams of how you fold origami for some people we just eliminated that 
 so now this was tougher what happened well in an objective
 way  the origami now was uglier it
 was more difficult  
 now when we looked at the easy origami  we saw the same thing builders loved it more evaluators loved it less when you looked at the hard instructions
  the effect was
 larger why because now the builders loved it even more 
 they put all this extra effort into it and evaluators  
 they loved it even less  because in reality it was even uglier than the first version 
 of course this tells you something about how we evaluate things now
  how much would you sell your kids for 
 your memories and associations and so on most people would say for a lot a lot of money on good days 
 laughter but imagine this was slightly different imagine if you did not have your kids and one day you went to the park and you met some kids they were just like your kids and you played with them for a few hours  
 and when you were about to leave the parents said hey  by the way  just before you leave if you 're interested
 they 're for sale 
 how much would you pay for them now 
 most people say not that much  and this is because our kids
 are so valuable not just because of who they are but because of us  because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection by the way if you think ikea instructions
  good what about the instructions that come with kids those are really tough 
 laughter by the way  these are my kids  
 which of course are wonderful and and so on which comes to tell you one more thing which is much like our builders when they look at the creature of their creation  
 we don 't see that other people don 't see things our
  let me say one last comment 
 if you think about adam smith versus karl marx  
 adam smith had a very important notion of efficiency  
 he gave an example of a pin factory 
 he said pins have twelve different steps  and if one person does all twelve steps  production is very low  
 but if you get one person to do step one and one person to do step two and step three and so on  production can increase tremendously
 and indeed this is a great example and the reason for the industrial revolution and efficiency 
 karl marx on the other hand said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important
 in how people think about the connection to what they are doing  and if you do all twelve steps you care about the pin  but if you do one step every time maybe you don 't care as much 
 i think that in the industrial revolution
 adam smith was more correct than karl marx  
 but the reality is that we 've switched  
 and now we 're in the knowledge economy 
 you can ask yourself what happens in a knowledge economy
 is efficiency still more important than meaning  i think the answer is no  i think that as we move to situations in which people have
 to decide on their own about how much effort attention caring how connected they feel to
  are they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on all of a sudden
 marx has more things to say to us  
 so when we think about labor we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing  
 but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it meaning creation challenges ownership 
  the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them how do we create our own meaning pride motivation and how do we do it in our workplace and for the 
  employees i think we could get people to be both more productive and happier  thank you very much
