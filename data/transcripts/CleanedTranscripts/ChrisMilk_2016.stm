  when i was a kid i experienced something so powerful  i spent the rest of my life searching for it and in all
 the wrong places what i experienced wasn 't
  it was music and this is where the story
 begins that 's me  listening to the beatles ' white album and the look on my face is the feeling
 that i 've been searching for
 ever since music goes straight to the emotional vein into your bloodstream and right into your heart  it deepens every
  right piece of music at the right time fuses with us on a
  cellular level when i hear that one song from that one summer
 with that one girl  i 'm instantly transported back there again hey
 stacey  here 's a part of the story though where i got a little greedy  i thought
  more layers on top of the music  i could make the feelings
 even more powerful  so i got into directing music videos this is what they looked like
 that 's my brother jeff  sorry about this jeff
 more like this  in both i 'm searching for the same thing though to capture
 that lightning in a bottle  
 except i 'm not adding moving pictures over the music added narrative dimension yes  but never quite equated the power
 that just raw music had for me on its own this is not a great thing to realize when you 've devoted your life
  and professional career to becoming a music video director i kept asking myself did i take the wrong path 
 so i started thinking if i could involve you the audience more i might be able to make you feel something more as well  
 so aaron koblin and i began auditioning new technologies that could put more of you inside of
  the johnny cash project and your interactive dreams in three dreams of black we
 were pushing beyond the screen trying to connect more deeply
 to people 's hearts and imaginations  but it wasn 't quite enough  it still didn 't have the raw experiential power
 of pure music
  music for me  so i started chasing a new technology that i only had read about in science fiction
 and after years of searching i found a prototype  it was a project from  nonny de la pea in mark bolas 's lab in usc 
 and when i tried it  i knew i 'd found it i could taste the lightning  it was called virtual reality
  this was it five years ago when i ran into it this is what it looks like
 now  
 i quickly started building things in this new medium  and through that process we realized something 
 that vr is going to play an incredibly important role in the history of mediums  in fact
  it 's going to be the last one 
 i mean this because it 's the first medium that actually makes the jump from our internalization of an author 's expression of an experience 
 to our experiencing it
 firsthand you look confused i 'll explain don 't worry 
 if we go back to the origins of mediums by all best guesses  it starts around a
  with a good story our clan leader is telling us about how he hunted the woolly mammoth on the tundra that day we hear his words
 and translate them
 into our own internal truths the same thing happens when we look
 at the cave painting version of the story  the book about the mammoth hunt
 the play 
  television show or
 the movie all of these mediums require what we call suspension of disbelief because there 's a translation gap between the reality of the story
  and our consciousness interpreting
 the story into our reality
  i 'm using the word consciousness as a feeling of reality that we get from our senses experiencing the world around us
  bridges that gap now you are on the tundra hunting with the clan leader or you
 are the clan leader  or maybe you 're even
 the woolly mammoth 
 so here 's what special about vr  in all other mediums
  your consciousness interprets the medium  in vr your consciousness is the medium
 so the potential for vr is enormous  but where are we now
 what is the current state of the art  well we
 are here we are the equivalent of year one of cinema  this is the lumire brothers
 film that allegedly sent a theater
 full of people running for their lives as they thought a train was coming toward them 
 similar to this early stage of  this medium  in vr we also have to move past the spectacle
 and into the storytelling  
 it took this medium decades to figure out its preferred language of storytelling in the form of a feature film  in vr today we 're more learning grammar
  made fifteen films in the last year at our vr company vrse and we 've learned a few things we
 found that we have a unique direct path into your senses your emotions even your body  
 so let me show you some things for the purpose of this demo we 're going to take every direction that you could possibly look and stretch it
 into this giant rectangle
  camera movement is tricky in vr done wrong it can actually make you sick  we found if you move the camera at a constant speed
 in a straight line you can actually get away with it though the first day in film school they told me you have to learn every single rule
 before you can break one we have
  learned every single rule we 've barely learned any at all but we 're already trying to break them to see what kind of creative things we can accomplish  
 in this shot here where we 're moving up off the ground i added acceleration i did that because
 i wanted to give you a physical sensation of moving up off the ground  in vr 
 i can give that to you 
  music matters a lot in this medium as well  it guides us how to feel in this project we made with the new york times zach richter
 and our friend jr we take
 you up in a helicopter  and even though you 're flying two thousand feet above manhattan you don 't feel afraid you feel triumphant
 for jr 's character the music guides you
  to popular belief there is composition
 in virtual reality  but it 's completely different than in film where you have a rectangular frame composition is now where your consciousness exists
 and how the world moves around you in this film waves of grace which was a collaboration
  we also see the changing role of the close up in virtual reality a close up in vr means you 're actually close up to someone 
 it brings that character inside of your personal space a space that we 'd usually reserve for the people that we love  and you feel an emotional closeness to the character
 because of what you feel to be a physical closeness
  vr is not like
 directing for the rectangle  it 's more of a choreography
 of the viewer 's attention one tool we can use to guide your attention is called spatialized sound i can put a sound anywhere
 in front of you to left or right even behind you  and when you turn your head the sound will rotate
  i can use that to direct your attention to where i want you to see next time you hear someone singing over your shoulder it might be bono 
 vr makes us feel like we are part of something 
 for most of human history  we lived in small family units we started in caves then moved to clans and tribes then villages and towns and now we
  citizens  but i believe that we are still hardwired to care the most about the things that are local to us and vr
 makes anywhere and anyone
 feel local that 's why it works as an empathy machine our film clouds over sidra takes you to a syrian refugee camp  and
 instead of watching a story about people over there it 's now a story
  about us here but
 where do we go from here  the tricky thing is that with all previous mediums the format is fixed at its birth 
 film has been a sequence of rectangles from muybridge and his horses to now  the format has never changed  but vr
 as a format
 as a medium
 's not using physical celluloid or paper or tv signals it actually employs what we use to make sense of the world we
 're using your senses as the paints on the canvas but only
 two right now  
 eventually we can see if we will have all of our human senses employed
  will have agency to live the story in any path we choose  and we call it virtual reality right now
 but what happens when we move past simulated realities 
 what do we call it then what if instead of verbally telling you about a dream  i could let you
 live inside that dream what if instead of just experiencing visiting some reality on earth you could surf gravitational waves on the edge
 of a black hole or create galaxies
  from scratch  or communicate with each other not using words
 but using our raw thoughts that 's not a virtual reality anymore and honestly i don 't know what that 's called
 but i hope you see where we 're going  but here i am intellectualizing a medium  i 'm saying
  let 's experience it in your hands you hopefully hold a piece of cardboard let 's open the flap
 tap on the power button to unlock the phone
 for the people watching at home we 're going to put up a card right now to show you how to download this experience on your phone yourself  and even get a google cardboard of your own to try it with 
 we played in cardboard boxes as kids and as adults  i 'm hoping we can all find a little
  bit of that lightning
 by sticking our head in one again  you 're about to participate in the largest collective vr
 viewing in history  and in that classic old timey style of yesteryear we 're all going to watch something at the exact same time
  on
 the
  please bring peace to the many who have lost loved
 the
  i believe that everyone on earth needs to experience
 what you just experienced that way we can collectively start to shape this not as a tech platform
 but as a humanity platform and to that end  in november of last
  year the new york times and vrse made a vr project called the displaced it launched with one million google cardboards sent out to every sunday subscriber with their newspaper  
 but a funny thing happened that sunday morning a lot of people got them that were not the intended recipients
 on the mailing label and we started seeing this
 all over instagram
  look familiar 
 music led me on a path of searching for what seemed like the unattainable
 for a very long time now  millions of kids just had the same formative experience in their childhood
 that i had
 in mine only i think this
