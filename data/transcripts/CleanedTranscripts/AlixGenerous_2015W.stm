  i want to talk to you about dreams  i have been a lucid dreamer my whole life  and it 's cooler than in the movies 
 laughter beyond flying breathing fire and making hot men spontaneously appear
 i can do things like read and write music 
 fun fact is that i wrote my personal statement to college in a dream  
 and i did accepted so yeah i am a very visual thinker 
 i think in pictures not words to me  words are more like instincts
 and language there are many people like me  nikola tesla for
  example  who could visualize  design test and troubleshoot everything
 all of his inventions in his mind  accurately 
 language is kind of exclusive to our species anyway  i am a bit more primitive like a beta version of google translate
  my brain has the ability to hyper focus on things that interest me 
 for example once i had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages 
 there are some other unusual things about me  
 you may have noticed that i don 't have much inflection in my voice that 's why people often confuse me with a gps
 this can make basic communication a challenge unless you need directions
 a few years ago when i started doing
  i went to get head shots done for the first time the photographer told me to look flirty and
 i had no idea what she was talking about 
 she said do that thing you know with your eyes when you 're flirting with guys
  searching for waldo 
 there 's a reason for this as there is a reason that waldo is hiding 
 laughter i have asperger 's 
  form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display
 it 's made life difficult in many ways and growing up 
 i struggled to fit in socially my friends would tell jokes  but i didn 't understand them 
 my personal heroes were george carlin and stephen colbert
 and they
  my personality switched from being shy and awkward
 to being defiant and cursing out a storm 
 needless to say i did not have many friends i was also hypersensitive to texture 
 the feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles  and so for years i refused to shower  i can assure you that my hygiene
  i had to do a lot to get here  and my parents
 things kind of got out of control when i was sexually assaulted by a peer and
 on top of everything it made a difficult situation worse  and i had to travel two thousand miles across the country to get
  but within days of them prescribing a new medication my life turned into an episode of the walking dead  
 i became paranoid and began to hallucinate that rotting corpses were coming towards me 
 my family finally rescued me
  but by that time  i had lost nineteen pounds in those three weeks as well as developing severe anemia  and was on the verge of suicide
  treatment center that understood my aversions my trauma  and my social anxiety  
 and they knew how to treat it and i got the help i finally needed  and after eighteen months of hard work  
 i went on to do incredible things 
 one of the things with asperger 's is that
  these people have a very complex inner life and i know for myself i have a very colorful personality rich ideas  and
 just a lot going on in my mind but there 's a gap between
 where that stands and how i communicate it with the rest of the world and this can make basic communication a challenge  
 not many places would hire me due to my lack of social skills which is why i applied to waffle
  where you can order your hash browns the many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse
  as social norms would have it you should only go to waffle house at an ungodly hour in the night 
 so one time at two am i was chatting with a waitress  and i asked her what 's the most ridiculous thing that 's happened to you on the job 
 and she told me that one time a man walked in completely naked 
 laughter i said great sign me up for the graveyard shift
  needless to say waffle house did not hire me
 so in terms of having asperger 's it can be viewed as a disadvantage and sometimes it is a real pain in the butt  
 but it 's also the opposite it 's a gift  and it allows me to think innovatively 
 at nineteen i won a research competition for my research on coral
  reefs  and i ended up speaking at the un convention of biological diversity presenting this research
  but consider what i had to do to get here twenty five therapists  eleven misdiagnoses and years of pain and trauma  
 i spent a lot of time thinking if there 's a better way  and i think there 
  technology this technology could play an integral role in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder
 or asd 
 the app podium  released by my company 
  has the ability to independently assess
 and help develop communication skills in addition to this it tracks eye contact through camera and simulates
  one of the great things is that i 've used podium to help me prepare for today  and
 it 's been a great help but it 's more than that there 's more that can be done
  for people with asd it has been speculated that many innovative scientists 
 researchers artists  and engineers have it 
 like for example  emily dickinson jane austen isaac newton and bill gates are some examples  but the problem
 's encountered is that these brilliant ideas often can 't be shared
 if there are communication roadblocks  and
 so many people with autism are being overlooked every day and they 're being taken advantage of so
 my dream for people with autism
 is to change that to remove the roadblocks that prevent them from
  one of the reasons i love lucid dreaming
 is because it allows me to be free 
 without judgment of social and physical consequences 
 when i 'm flying over scenes that i create in my mind i am at peace  
 i am free from judgment  and so i can do whatever i want you know i 'm making out with brad pitt and
 angelina is
  is bigger than that and more important  my goal is to shift people 's perspective of autism and people with 
 asperger 's because there is a lot they can do i mean look at temple grandin
  and by doing so  we allow people to share their talents with this world and move
 this world forward in addition we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the real world in real time  thank you
