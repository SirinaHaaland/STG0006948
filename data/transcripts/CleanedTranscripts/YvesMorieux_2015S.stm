  is not everything  but in the long run  it is
  are not that many things on earth that are almost everything productivity is the principal driver
 of the prosperity of a society  so we have a problem in the largest european economies productivity used to
  less than one percent per annum  the same profile in japan  
 the same profile in the us despite a
  momentary rebound fifteen years ago 
 and despite all the technological innovations around us the internet  the information the new information and communication technologies
 when productivity grows three percent per annum  
 you double the standard of living every generation  every generation is twice as
  per annum  it takes three generations to double the standard of living and in this process  many people will be less well off than their parents  they will have less of everything  
 smaller roofs 
 or perhaps no roof at all 
 less access to education
  to antibiotics to vaccination to everything  think of all
 the problems that we 're facing at the moment all  
 chances are that they are rooted in the productivity crisis
  why this crisis  because
 the basic tenets
 about
  efficiency
 effectiveness in organizations in management
 have become counterproductive for human efforts  everywhere in public services in companies in the way we work the way we innovate invest try to learn to work better 
  they make human efforts derail  there are two ways to look at it to prove it 
 the one i prefer is rigorous
  but the full math version takes a little while  so there is another one  it is to look at a relay race  
 this is what we will do today  it 's a bit more animated more visual
 and also faster
 it 's a race  hopefully it 's faster
  teams in the final  the fastest team is the us team  
 they have the fastest women on earth  they are the favorite team to win  notably if you compare them to an average team say the french team
  individual times
 of the us runners they arrive at the finish line three point two meters
 ahead of the french team and this year the us team is in great shape  based on their best performance this year  they arrive
 six point four meters ahead of the french team  based on the data we are going
  to look at the race  at some point you will see towards the end that torri edwards
 the fourth us runner is ahead not surprising this year she got the gold medal in the 
  100 meter race  and by the way chryste gaines  the second runner in the
  three point five billion women on earth 
 where are the two fastest on the us team  and the two other runners on the us team are not bad either 
 so clearly the us team has won the war for talent  
  the average team is trying to catch up let 's watch the race
  so what happened the fastest team did not win the slower one did 
 by the way i hope you appreciate the deep historical research i did to make the french look good
  but why because of cooperation when you hear this sentence thanks to cooperation the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts 
 this is not poetry this is not philosophy this is math  
 those who carry the baton are
  but their baton is faster 
 miracle of cooperation  
 it multiplies energy intelligence in human efforts it is the essence of human efforts how we work together how 
 each effort contributes to the efforts of others  
 what happens to cooperation when the holy grail
 the holy trinity even of clarity  measurement accountability
 appears 
 clarity  management reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity  compliance audits
  we need more clarity we need to clarify the roles  the processes  
 it is as though the runners on the team were saying let 's be clear
 where does my role really start and end  am i supposed to run for
  to take it or not 
 accountability  
 we are constantly trying to put accountability in someone 's hands who is accountable for this process  we need somebody accountable 
 for this process  so in the relay race  since passing the baton is so important
  somebody clearly accountable for passing the baton  so between each runner  now we will have
 a new dedicated athlete 
 clearly dedicated to taking the baton from one runner  and passing it to the next runner  and we will have at least two
  but for sure  we would have a clear interface a clear line of accountability  we will know who to blame 
 but we 'll never win the race  if you think about it we pay more attention
 to knowing who to blame
 in case we fail  than to creating the conditions
 to succeed 
 all the human intelligence put in organization design urban structures  processing systems what is the real goal  
 to have somebody guilty in case they fail  
 we are creating organizations able to fail
  but in a compliant way with somebody clearly accountable when we fail  and we are quite effective at that
 failing  
 measurement  what gets measured gets done look  to pass the baton  
 you have to do it at the right time in the right hand at the right speed but to do that you have to put energy in your arm
  this energy that is in your arm will not be in your legs  it will come at the expense of your measurable speed 
 you have to shout early enough to the next runner when you will pass the baton to signal that you are arriving  so that the next runner can prepare can anticipate  
 and you have to shout loud
  energy that will be in your throat will not be in your legs  because you know  there are eight people shouting at the same time  so you have to recognize the voice of your colleague 
 you cannot say is it you too late 
 now 
 let 's look at the race in slow motion  
 and concentrate on the third runner look at where she allocates her efforts her energy
 her attention 
 not all in her legs that would be great for her own speed but in also in her throat  arm eye brain that makes a difference in whose legs 
 in the legs of the next runner  but when the next runner runs 
 is it because she made a super effort  or
 because of the way the third runner passed the baton there is no metric on earth that will give us the answer 
 and if we reward people on the basis of their measurable performance  they will put their energy their attention their blood in what can get measured in their legs  
 and the baton will fall and slow down to cooperate is not a super effort  it is how you allocate your effort
  it is to take a risk
  sacrifice the ultimate protection
 granted by objectively measurable individual performance it is
 to make a super difference in the performance of others  with whom we are compared  
 it takes being stupid to cooperate then and people are not stupid they don 't cooperate  you know
  accountability  measurement
 were ok when the world was simpler  
 but business has become much more complex with my teams we have measured the evolution of complexity in business it is much more demanding today to attract and retain customers  
 to build advantage on a global scale 
 to create value
  and the more business gets complex the more in the name of clarity  accountability  measurement
 we multiply structures processes systems 
 you know this drive for clarity and accountability triggers a counterproductive
  that do not only mobilize people and resources but that also add obstacles  
 and the more complicated the organization 
 the more difficult it is to understand what is really happening  so we need summaries  proxies reports 
 key performance indicators metrics so people put their energy
 in what can get measured 
 at the expense of cooperation  and as performance deteriorates  we add even more structure process systems people spend their time in meetings 
 writing reports they have to do undo and redo  based on our analysis 
  teams in these organizations spend between forty and eighty percent of their time wasting their time  
 but working harder and harder longer and longer on less and less value adding activities 
 this is what is killing productivity what makes people suffer at work  our organizations are wasting human
  when people don 't cooperate  don 't blame their mindsets their mentalities their personality
 look at the work situations is
 it really in their personal interest to cooperate or not if when they cooperate  they are individually worse off  
  when we blame personalities
 instead of the clarity  the accountability  the measurement 
 we add injustice to ineffectiveness  
 we need to create organizations in which it becomes individually useful for people to cooperate  
  don 't look for clarity  go for fuzziness fuzziness overlaps  
 remove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance speed the what look at cooperation
  how did you pass the baton did you throw it or did you pass it effectively  
 am i putting my energy in what can get measured
 my legs my speed
 or in passing the baton  
 you 
 as leaders  as managers are you making it individually useful for people to cooperate
  the future of our organizations our companies  our societies
 hinges on your answer to these questions  thank you
