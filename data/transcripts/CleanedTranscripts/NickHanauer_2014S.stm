  probably don 't know me but i am one of those 01 percenters that you hear about and read about and i am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat
  and tonight what i would like to do is speak directly to other plutocrats to my people because it feels like it 's time for us all
 to have a chat 
 like most plutocrats  i too am a proud and unapologetic capitalist i have founded cofounded or funded
 over thirty companies across a range of industries  i was the first non family investor in amazon com 
 i cofounded a company called aquantive
 that we sold to microsoft
  for six point four billion dollars my friends and i we own a bank  i tell you this 
 unbelievable right  i tell you this
 to show
 that my life is like most plutocrats  i have a broad
 perspective on capitalism and business  and i have been rewarded obscenely
 for that
 with a life that
  most of you all can 't even imagine multiple homes a yacht my own plane  etc etc etc 
 but let 's be honest i am not the smartest person you 've ever met i am certainly not the hardest working  
 i was a mediocre student i 'm not technical at all i can 't write a word
  my success is the consequence of spectacular luck of birth of circumstance
 and of timing
  but i am actually pretty good at a couple of things one  i have an unusually high tolerance for risk 
 and the other is i have a good sense a good intuition about what will happen in the future and i think that that intuition about the future
 essence
 of good entrepreneurship so what do i see in our future today you ask  i see pitchforks as in
 angry mobs with pitchforks  because while people like us plutocrats
  fellow citizens are falling farther and farther behind in one thousand nine hundred and eighty  the top one percent of americans shared about eight percent of national [ income ] 
 while the bottom fifty percent of americans shared eighteen percent 
 thirty years later today the top one percent shares over twenty percent of national
  the bottom fifty percent of americans share twelve or thirteen 
 if the trend continues  
 the top one percent will share over thirty percent of national [ income ] in another thirty years  
 while the bottom fifty percent of americans will share just six 
 you see the problem isn 't that we have some inequality 
 some inequality is necessary
 for a
  is at historic highs today
 and it 's getting worse every day  and if wealth power  and income continue to concentrate
 at the very tippy top our society will change from a capitalist democracy to a
 before the revolution and the mobs with the pitchforks  so i have a message for my fellow plutocrats and zillionaires
 and for anyone who lives in a gated bubble world  wake up  wake up  it cannot last 
 because if we do not do something to fix the glaring
 economic inequities in our society the pitchforks will come
  for us 
 for no free and open society can long sustain this kind of rising economic inequality  it has never happened  there are no examples 
 you show me a highly unequal society and i will show you a police state or an uprising  
 the pitchforks will come for us if we do not address this
  it 's not a matter of if it 's when and it will be terrible when they come
 for everyone but particularly
 for people like us plutocrats  i know i must sound like some liberal do gooder i
 'm not i 'm not making a moral argument that economic inequality is wrong
 what i am arguing is that rising economic inequality is stupid and ultimately
 rising inequality doesn 't just increase our risks from pitchforks  but it 's also terrible
 for business too 
 so the model for us rich guys should be henry ford when ford famously introduced the $ five day  which was twice the prevailing wage at the time  
 he didn 't just increase the productivity of his factories
 he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor
 into a thriving middle class who could now afford to buy the products that they made ford intuited
 what we now know is true  that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem
 and characterized by the same kinds of feedback loops you find in a natural ecosystem a feedback
  loop between customers and businesses raising wages
 increases demand which increases hiring  which in turn increases wages
 and demand and profits  and that virtuous cycle of increasing
 prosperity is precisely what is missing from today 's
 economic recovery
  this is why we need to put behind us the  trickle down policies that so dominate both political parties
 and embrace something i call middle out economics
 middle out economics rejects the neoclassical economic idea that economies are efficient
  that they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality that they 're not efficient at all but are effective
 if well managed this 
  allows you to clearly see that capitalism does not work
 by [ efficiently ] allocating existing resources it works
 creating new solutions to human problems the genius of capitalism is that it is an evolutionary
  system  it rewards people for solving other people 's problems
  the difference between a poor society
 and a rich society obviously is
 the degree to which that society has generated solutions in the form of products for its citizens the sum of the solutions
 that we have in our society really is our prosperity and this explains why companies like google and amazon and microsoft and apple and the entrepreneurs
  who created those companies have contributed so much
 to our nation 's prosperity 
 this  21st century
 perspective also makes clear that what we think of as economic growth is best understood as the rate at which we solve problems 
  how many problem solvers diverse able problem solvers we have and thus how many of our fellow citizens
 actively participate  both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions and as customers who consume them  
 but this maximizing participation thing
 doesn 't happen by accident it doesn 't happen by itself it
  requires effort and investment which is why
 all highly prosperous capitalist democracies
 are characterized by massive investments in the middle class and the infrastructure
 that they depend on  we plutocrats
 need to get this
  economics thing behind us this idea that the better we do the better everyone else will do it 's not true 
 how could it be 
 i earn one thousand times the median wage  but i do not buy one thousand times as much stuff do i i
 actually bought two pairs of these pants  what my partner mike calls my manager pants
  i could have bought two thousand pairs but what would i do with them 
 laughter how many haircuts can i get how often can i go out to dinner 
 no matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get we can never drive
 a great national economy only a thriving middle class can do that 
 there 's nothing to be done my plutocrat friends
 might say 
 henry ford was in a different time  maybe we can 't do some things  maybe we can do some things  
 june nineteen  two thousand and thirteen  bloomberg published
 an article i wrote called the capitalists case for a
  the good people at forbes magazine  among my biggest admirers called it nick hanauer 's 
 and yet just three hundred and fifty days after that article was published seattle 's mayor ed murray
 signed into law an ordinance raising the minimum wage in seattle to fifteen dollars an hour more than double what the prevailing federal
  seven point two five rate is 
 how did this happen reasonable people might ask  it happened because a group of us reminded the middle class that they are the source
 of growth and prosperity in capitalist economies  we reminded them that when workers have more money  businesses have more
  and need more employees  
 we reminded them that when businesses pay workers a living wage 
 taxpayers are relieved of the burden of funding the poverty programs like food stamps and medical assistance and rent assistance that those workers need  
 we reminded them that low wage workers
 make terrible taxpayers and that when you raise the minimum wage for all businesses all businesses benefit
  yet all can compete 
 now the orthodox reaction of course is raising the minimum wage costs jobs right  
 your politician 's always echoing that trickle down idea by saying things like well
 if you raise the price of employment guess what happens you get less of it 
 are you sure
  because there 's some contravening evidence since one thousand nine hundred and eighty the
 wages of ceos in our country have gone from about thirty times the median wage to five hundred times 
 that 's raising the price of employment 
 and yet to my knowledge  
 i have never seen a company outsource its ceo 's job automate
  export the job to china 
 in fact we appear to be employing more ceos and senior managers than ever before so too for technology workers
 and financial services workers who earn multiples of the of the median wage and yet we employ more and more of them so clearly
 you can raise the price of employment
 and get more of it i know that most people think that
  minimum wage is this insane  risky economic experiment  we disagree  we believe that the $ fifteen minimum wage in seattle
 is actually the continuation of a logical economic policy it is allowing our city to kick your city 's ass  
  washington state already has the highest minimum wage of any state in the nation  we pay all workers $ nine 
  which is almost thirty percent more than the federal minimum of seven point two five 
 but crucially four hundred and twenty seven percent more than the federal tipped minimum of two point one
 three if trickle down thinkers were right  then washington state should have massive unemployment seattle should be sliding into the ocean  and yet
 seattle is the fastest growing big city in the country  washington state
 is generating small business jobs at a higher rate than any other major state in the nation 
 the restaurant business in seattle booming 
 why  because the fundamental law of capitalism is when workers have more money businesses have more customers
 and need more workers 
 when restaurants pay restaurant workers enough so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants 
 that 's not bad for the restaurant business  that 's good for it despite what some restaurateurs
 may tell you is it more complicated than i 'm making
  a lot of dynamics at play  but can we please stop insisting
 that if low wage workers earn a little bit more unemployment will skyrocket and the economy will collapse  there is no evidence for it 
 the most insidious thing about trickle down economics is not the claim that if the rich get richer everyone is better off 
 it is the claim made by those who oppose any increase in the minimum wage that if the poor get richer  that will be bad for the economy this
  nonsense so can we please dispense with this rhetoric that says that rich guys like me
 and my plutocrat friends
 made our country  we plutocrats know even if we don 't like to admit it in public that if we had been born somewhere else not
  here in the united states we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit it
 's not that they don 't have good entrepreneurs in other places  even very very poor places it 's just that that 's all that those entrepreneurs ' customers can afford 
 so here 's an idea for a new kind
 of economics a new kind of politics
  new capitalism let 's acknowledge that capitalism beats the alternatives  but also
 that the more people we include both as entrepreneurs and as customers the better it works 
 let 's by all means shrink the size of government 
 but not by slashing the poverty programs  but by ensuring that workers are paid enough so that they actually don 't need those programs  
 let 's invest enough in the middle
  class
 to make our economy fairer
 and more inclusive and by fairer more truly competitive  and by more truly competitive more able to generate the solutions
 to human problems that are the true drivers of growth
 and prosperity capitalism is the greatest social technology ever invented for
 prosperity in human societies if it is well managed  
 but capitalism because of the fundamental multiplicative dynamics of complex systems  tends towards inexorably inequality  concentration and collapse  
 the work of democracies
  is to maximize
 the inclusion of the many
 in order to create prosperity not to enable the few to accumulate money  government
 does create prosperity and growth by creating the conditions that allow both entrepreneurs and their customers to thrive  
 balancing the power of capitalists like me
 and workers
 isn 't bad for capitalism it
  essential to it programs like a reasonable minimum wage 
 affordable healthcare paid sick leave and the progressive taxation necessary to pay for the important infrastructure
 necessary for the middle class like education r and d  these are indispensable tools shrewd capitalists should embrace
 to drive growth  because no one benefits from
  it like us 
 many economists would have you believe that their field is an objective science  i disagree  
 and i think that it is equally a tool that humans use to enforce and encode our social and moral preferences and prejudices about status
 and power
  which is why plutocrats like me have always needed to find persuasive stories
 to tell everyone else about why our relative
 relative positions are morally righteous and good for everyone 
 like we are indispensable the job creators  and you are not like
  tax cuts for us create growth  but investments in you
 will balloon our debt and bankrupt our great country that we matter that you don 't 
 for thousands of years these stories were called divine right  today we have
  the united states of america made us not the other way around 
 that a thriving middle class is the source of prosperity in capitalist economies not a consequence of it
  and we should never forget
 that even the best of us in the worst of circumstances are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit 
 fellow plutocrats
 i think it may be time for us to recommit to our country 
 to commit to a new kind of capitalism which is both more inclusive and more effective  a capitalism that will ensure
 that america 's economy remains the most dynamic and prosperous in the world 
 let 's secure the future for ourselves our children and their children 
 or alternatively
  we could do nothing hide in our gated communities and
 private schools  enjoy our planes and yachts and wait for the pitchforks
