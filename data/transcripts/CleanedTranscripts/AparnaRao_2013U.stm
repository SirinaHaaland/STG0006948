  like to share some works in progress  since we are still realizing these works we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery still  
 so i 'm going to try and describe some of the experiences that we 're looking for through each of the works 
 so the first work is called the imperial
  sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall  
 within seconds as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer they appear to panic and sort of
 get into a strict symmetry so this is the sketch of the two states one is total chaos the other is absolute order  and we were interested
  in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state 
 this also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions one is the altar tablets of the  15th century  
 and the other is about one hundred years ago  malevich 's abstract compositions  
 so i 'm just going to take you to a video to give you a sense of scale the largest panel is about two meters high that 's about this much and the smallest one is
  so a viewer enters the space  and they snap to attention 
 and after a while if the viewer continues to remain in the space 
 the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again  
 until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement when they will again snap to attention 
 so here it appears as if it 's the viewer that 's
  of instigating the sense of order among the panels but it could also be the other way around that
 the panels are so stuck within their preconditioned behaviors that they sort of thrust the viewer with the role of a tyrant  
 so this brings me to a quieter small work called handheld 
 the viewer sees a piece of paper that 's mounted on the far end of the wall  but when you go closer you see that
  piece of paper that 's held on either side by two small hands
 that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood 
 the viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly 
 as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time
  and somehow are not managing to
 so this instability in the movement very closely resembles
 the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera  
 so here i 'm going to show you two tandem clips one is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera 
 and you immediately see how the unsteady nature of
 the video
 suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view so we 've just removed the camera
  and transferred that movement onto the panel  so here 's a video you have to imagine the other hand it 's not there yet  but
 to us we 're sort of trying to evoke a self effacing gesture  as if there 's a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper 
 that sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this
 piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front
 the next work is decoy  this is a cardboard model  so the object is about as tall as i am 
 it has a rounded body two arms and a very tall head like antenna  
 and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself  
 so when a viewer passes by it sort of tilts from side
  and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer
  so here is the first test scenario you see the two movements integrated and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation  
 but the idea is that once it 's got the person 's attention it 's no longer interested and it looks for the next person whose attention to get 
 so this is the final fabricated body of
  the decoy  it appears to be 
 like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines  
 because we are always working from a very personal space we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance at least  
 and so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention  but it could also
  be a figure that needs a lot of help 
 the next work is an object that 's also a kind of sound instrument 
 in the shape of an amphitheater that 's scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage  
 so from where i 'm standing each of you appears to be this big and the audience sort of takes the entire
 field of my vision  seated in this audience are nine hundred and
 they 're mechanically enabled to clap of their own free will 
 this means that each of them can decide if and when they want to clap how hard for how long 
 how they want to be influenced by those around them or influence others  and if they want to contribute to innovation
  so when the viewer steps in front of the audience
  there will be a response it could be a few claps or a strong applause  and then nothing happens until the viewer leaves the stage  
 and again the audience will respond it could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience or it could be a very loud
 ovation  so to us i think we 're really looking at an audience as its own object or its own organism
 that 's also got
  quality to it an instrument  
 so the viewer can play it by eliciting quite complex and varied nuanced musical or sound patterns 
 but cannot really provoke the audience into any particular kind of response  so there 's a sense of judgment and capriciousness and uneasiness involved 
 it also has an alluring and trap like quality to it  so here if you see we 're quite excited about the image of the head splitting to form the two hands
 so here 's a small visual animation 
 as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing against each other to kind of make sense of the duality and the tension
  and here is a prototype  
 so we can 't wait to be engulfed by nine hundred and ninety six of them okay
 this is the
  it comes out of
 the idea of a window this is an actual window in our studio  
 and as you can see it 's made up of three different thicknesses of wooden sections  so we used the same window vocabulary to construct our own frame or grid
 that 's suspended in the room and that can be viewed from two sides this grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures they 're also made up of three different sizes 
 as if to suggest a kind of perspective or landscape on the single plain
  each of these figures can also run backward and forward in the track and hide behind two
 adjacent tracks  so in contrast to this very tight grid we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick like quality
 as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path  
 so we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along
 like they 're oblivious and carefree
  and happy go lucky and content  until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide
 behind the fastest wall  
 so to us this work also presents its own contradiction 
 these figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid which is like a prison but also a fortress  
 because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite
  oblivious of the external world 
 so all these real life qualities that i talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration 
 and we were very lucky to collaborate with eth zurich to develop the first prototype  
 so you see they extracted the motion cogs from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the
  really quite small you can see it can fit into the palm of my hand  so imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio and here it
