  to tell you
 about a legal case that i worked on
 involving a man named steve titus titus was a restaurant manager he was thirty one years
  he lived in seattle washington  he was engaged to gretchen about to be married she was the love of his life and one night the couple went out for a romantic
 restaurant meal they were on their way home and they were pulled over by a police officer  you see titus ' car sort of resembled
 a car that was driven
 earlier in the evening by a man who raped a female hitchhiker  and titus kind of resembled
 that rapist so the police took a picture of titus they put it in a photo lineup 
 they later showed it to the victim and she pointed to titus ' photo she said that one 's the closest 
 the police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial  and when steve titus was put on trial for rape the rape victim got on the stand and said
 absolutely positive that 's the man and
 titus was convicted he proclaimed his innocence his family screamed at the jury his fiance collapsed on the floor sobbing  and titus is taken away to jail 
 so what would you do
 at this point
  what would you do  well titus lost complete faith in the legal system 
 and yet he got an idea he called up the local newspaper  he got the interest of an investigative journalist and that journalist actually found the real rapist 
 a man who ultimately confessed to this rape a man who was thought to have committed fifty rapes in that area  and when this information was given to the judge
  judge set titus free  
 and really that 's where this case should should have ended it should have been over titus should have thought of this as a horrible year a year of accusation and trial but over 
 it didn 't end that way 
 titus was so bitter  he 'd lost his job
 couldn 't get it back 
 he lost his fiance she couldn 't put up with his persistent anger  he lost his entire savings  and so he decided to file a lawsuit against the police and others whom he felt were responsible for his suffering  
 and that 's when i really started working on this case trying to figure out how did that victim go from that one 's the closest to i 'm absolutely positive that 's the guy
 well titus was consumed with his civil case
 he spent every waking moment thinking about it and just days before he was to have his day in court  he woke up in the morning  
 doubled over in pain  and died of a stress related heart attack  he was thirty five years old
  i was asked to work on titus ' case
 because i 'm a psychological scientist  i study memory  i 've studied memory for decades  
 and if i meet somebody on an airplane
 this happened on the way over to scotland if i meet somebody on an airplane 
 and we ask each other what do you do what do you do and i say i study memory they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names or they 've got a relative who 's got
  alzheimer 's or some kind of memory problem but i have to tell them
 i don 't study
 when people forget  
 i study the opposite when they remember when they remember things that didn 't happen or remember things that were different from the way they really were  i study false
  steve titus is not the only person
 to be convicted based on somebody 's false memory 
 in one project in the united states information has been gathered on three hundred
 innocent people three hundred defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn 't do they
  thirty years in prison for these crimes and now dna testing has proven that they are actually innocent  
 and when those cases have been analyzed  three quarters of them
 are due to faulty memory faulty eyewitness
 memory  well why 
 like the jurors who convicted those innocent people and the jurors who convicted titus  many people believe that
  works like a recording device you just record the information then you call it up and play it back when you want to answer questions or identify images  
 but decades of work in psychology has shown that this just isn 't true 
 our memories are constructive they 're reconstructive memory works a little bit more like a wikipedia page  you can go in there and change it but
  can other people  i first started studying this constructive memory process in the 
 i did my experiments that involved showing people simulated crimes and accidents and asking them questions about what they
  in one study we showed people a simulated accident
 and we asked people how fast were the cars going when they hit each other  
 and we asked other people how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other  and if we asked the leading smashed question 
 the witnesses told us the cars were going faster  and moreover that leading smashed question caused people to be more likely to tell us that they saw broken glass in the accident
  scene when there wasn 't any broken glass at all 
 in another study we showed a simulated accident where a car went through an intersection with a stop sign  
 and if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign  many witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign at the intersection not a stop sign  
 and you might be thinking well
  you know these are filmed events they are not particularly stressful would the same kind of mistakes be made
 with a really stressful event 
 in a study we published just a few months ago we have an answer to this question because what was unusual about this study is
 we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience the subjects in this study
  were members of the u s military who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise to teach them what it 's going to be like for them if they are ever captured as prisoners of war 
 and as part of this training exercise these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive  
  abusive fashion for thirty minutes
 and later on they have to try to identify the person who conducted that interrogation  and when we feed them suggestive information
 that insinuates it 's a different person many of them misidentify their interrogator  often identifying someone who doesn 't even remotely resemble the real interrogator  
 and so what these studies are
  showing is that when you feed people misinformation
 about some experience that that they may have had you can distort or contaminate or change
 their memory  
 well out there in the real world  misinformation is everywhere  we get misinformation not only if we 're questioned in a leading way but if we talk to other witnesses
  who might consciously or inadvertently feed us some erroneous information or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced 
 all of these provide the opportunity for this kind of contamination of our memory 
 we began to see an even more extreme kind of memory problem
 some patients were going into therapy with one problem maybe they had depression an eating disorder
 and they were coming out of therapy
 with a different problem  
 extreme memories for horrific brutalizations sometimes in satanic rituals sometimes involving
 really bizarre and unusual elements one woman came out of psychotherapy
 believing that she 'd endured years of ritualistic abuse where she was forced into a pregnancy and that the baby was cut from her belly  
 but there were no physical scars or any kind of physical evidence that could have supported her story  
 and when i began looking into these cases  i was
  where do these bizarre memories come from and what i found is that most of these situations involved
 some particular form
 of psychotherapy  
 and so i asked 
 were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy like the imagination exercises or dream interpretation or in some cases hypnosis or in some cases
 exposure to false information were these
  leading these patients to develop these very bizarre unlikely memories 
 and i designed some experiments to try to study
 the processes that were being used in this psychotherapy so i could study the development of these very rich false
  in one of the first studies we did  
 we used suggestion a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases we used this kind of suggestion
 and planted a false memory that when you were a kid five or six years old you were lost in a shopping mall  you were frightened  you were crying you were ultimately 
  rescued by an elderly person and reunited with the family and we succeeded in planting this memory in the minds of
  about a quarter of our subjects  
 and you might be thinking well that 's not particularly stressful  but we and other investigators have planted rich false memories of things that 
  were much more unusual and much more stressful so in a study done in tennessee  researchers planted the false memory that when you were a kid you nearly drowned and had to be rescued
  by a life guard  and in a study done in canada  
 researchers planted the false memory that when you were a kid something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal
 happened to you succeeding with about half of their subjects  and in a study done in italy  researchers planted the false
  when you were a kid  you witnessed demonic possession i do want to add that it might seem like we are
 traumatizing these experimental subjects in the name of science 
 but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation by research ethics boards
 that have made the decision
 that the temporary discomfort that some of these subjects might experience in these studies is outweighed
 by the importance of this problem for understanding memory processes and the abuse of memory that is going on in some places in the world  
 well  to my surprise when i published this work and began to speak out against
 this particular brand of psychotherapy it created some pretty bad
  problems for me 
 hostilities primarily from the repressed memory therapists who felt under attack  and by the patients whom they had influenced 
 i had sometimes armed guards at speeches that i was invited to give people trying to drum up letter writing campaigns to get me
  but probably the worst
 was
 i suspected that a woman was innocent of abuse that was being claimed by her grown daughter she accused her mother
 of sexual abuse based on a repressed memory and this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story to be filmed and presented in public places 
 i was suspicious of this story  and so i started to investigate and eventually found information
  that convinced me that this mother was innocent 
 i published an expos on the case and a little while later the accusing daughter filed a lawsuit 
 even though i 'd never mentioned her name she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy  and i went through nearly
  but finally finally it was over and i could really
 get back
 to my work in the process however i became part of a disturbing trend in america
 where scientists are being sued for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy
  when i got back to my work i asked this question  
 if i plant a false memory in your mind  does it have repercussions does it affect your later thoughts your later behaviors 
 our first study planted a false memory that you got sick as a child eating certain foods hard boiled eggs dill pickles strawberry ice cream and we found that 
  once we planted this false memory  people didn 't want to eat the foods as much at an outdoor picnic 
  necessarily bad or unpleasant if we planted a warm fuzzy memory involving a healthy food like asparagus we could get people to want to eat asparagus 
  more  and so what these studies are showing is that you can plant false memories and they have repercussions that affect behavior long after
  along with this ability to plant memories and control behavior obviously come some important ethical issues 
 like when should we use this mind technology  and should we ever ban its use 
 therapists can 't ethically plant false memories in the mind of their patients even if it would help the patient
  but there 's nothing to stop a parent from trying this out on their
 overweight or obese teenager  and when i suggested this publicly it
 created an outcry again there she goes she 's advocating that parents lie to their children
 a kid with obesity diabetes shortened lifespan  all the things that go with it or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory i know what i would choose for a kid of mine  
 but maybe my work has made me different from most people most people cherish their memories know that they represent their identity who they are where they came from and i appreciate that i feel that way too
  but i know from my work how much fiction
 is already in there 
 if i 've learned anything from these decades of working on these problems it 's this 
 just because somebody tells you something and they say it with confidence just because they say it with lots of detail just because they express emotion when they say it it doesn 't mean that it really happened 
 we can
  reliably distinguish true memories from false memories we need independent corroboration such a discovery has made me more tolerant
 of the everyday memory mistakes that my friends and family members make  such a discovery
 might have saved steve titus the man whose whole
  was snatched away by a false memory
