  ten years ago i had my first exhibition here  i had no idea if it would work
 or was at all possible but with a few small steps and a very steep learning curve  i made my first
  teaming up with a marine biologist and a local dive center  i submerged the work off the coast of grenada in an area decimated by hurricane ivan  
 and then this incredible thing happened it transformed 
 one sculpture became two two quickly became twenty six 
 and before i knew it we had the world 's first underwater sculpture park
 in two thousand and nine i moved to mexico and started by casting local fisherman 
 this grew to a small community 
 to almost an entire movement of people in defense of the sea  and then finally to an underwater museum with over five hundred
  it seems is not just for greenhouses 
 we 've since scaled up the designs 
 ocean atlas in the bahamas rising sixteen feet up to the surface and weighing over forty tons 
 to now currently in lanzarote where i 'm making an underwater botanical garden  the first of its kind in the
  we use materials and designs that help encourage life a
  cement
 provides a stable and permanent platform it is textured to allow coral polyps to attach  
 we position them down current from natural reefs so that after spawning there 's areas for them to settle  
 the formations are all configured so that they aggregate fish on a really large scale
 even this vw beetle has an internal living habitat to encourage crustaceans such as lobsters and sea urchins 
 so why exhibit my work in the ocean  because honestly it 's really not easy when you 're in the middle of the sea under
  trying to lower eight tons down to the sea floor you start to wonder whether i shouldn 't have taken up watercolor painting instead 
 but in the end the results always blow my mind
  incredible exhibition space an artist could ever wish for 
 you have amazing lighting effects changing by the hour  explosions of sand covering the sculptures in a cloud of mystery 
 a unique timeless quality
 and the procession of
  each lending their own special touch to the site
  i 've realized that the greatest thing about what we do 
 the really humbling thing about the work is that as soon as we submerge the sculptures they 're not ours anymore  
 because as soon as we sink them the sculptures they belong to the sea 
 as new reefs form a new world literally starts to evolve a world that continuously amazes me it 's a bit of a
 man made can ever match the imagination of nature  sponges look like veins across the faces  
 staghorn coral morphs the form
 fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed
 tunicates explode from the faces 
 sea urchins crawl across the bodies feeding at night
 coralline algae applies a kind of purple paint  
 the deepest red i 've ever seen in my life lives underwater 
 gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves  
 purple sponges breathe water like air  and grey angelfish glide
  silently overhead 
 and the amazing response we 've had to these works tells me that we 've managed to plug into something really primal  
 because it seems that these images translate across the world 
 and that 's made me focus on my responsibility as an artist and about what i 'm trying to achieve  
 i 'm standing here today on this boat in the middle of the ocean  and this
  couldn 't be a better place to talk about the really really important effect of my work 
 because as we all know our reefs are dying and our oceans are in trouble 
 so here 's the thing the most used searched and shared image of all my work
 thus far is this and i think this is
  at least i hope it is what i really hope is that people are beginning to understand
 that when we think of the environment and the destruction of nature that we need to start thinking about our oceans too 
 since building these sites we 've seen some phenomenal and unexpected results 
 besides creating over eight hundred square meters of new habitats and living reef visitors to the marine park in cancun now divide half their time between the museum and the natural reefs
  providing significant rest for natural overstressed areas 
 visitors to ocean atlas in the bahamas highlighted a leak from a nearby oil refinery  
 the subsequent international media forced the local government to pledge ten million dollars in coastal cleanups 
 the sculpture park in grenada was instrumental in the government
 designating a spot a
  entrance fees to the park now help fund park rangers
 to manage tourism and fishing quotas the site was actually listed as a wonder of the world by national geographic 
 so why are we all here today in this room what do we all have in common 
 i think we all share a fear that we don 't protect our oceans enough and one way of thinking about this is that we don 't regard our oceans as
  sacred  and we should when we see incredible places like the himalayas or the la sagrada famlia or the mona lisa even
 when we see these incredible places and things  we understand their importance  we call them sacred  and we do our best to
 cherish them to protect them and to keep them safe but in order to do that we are the ones that have to
  assign that value  otherwise it will be desecrated by someone who doesn 't understand that value  
 so i want to finish up tonight by talking about sacred things  
 when we were naming the site in cancun we named it a museum for a very important and simple reason  
 museums are places of preservation of
  places where we keep objects of great value to us where we simply treasure them for them being themselves 
 if someone was to throw an egg at the sistine chapel we 'd all go crazy 
 if someone wanted to build a seven star hotel at the bottom of the grand canyon then we would laugh them out of arizona  
 yet every day we dredge pollute and overfish our
  and i think it 's easier for us to do that because when we see the ocean we don 't see the havoc we 're wreaking  because for most people the ocean is like this 
 and it 's really hard to think of something that 's just so plain
 and so enormous as fragile it 's simply too massive too vast too endless 
 and what do you see here i think most people actually look past to the horizon 
 so i think there 's a real danger that we never really see the sea
 and if we don 't really see it if it doesn 't have its own iconography if we miss its majesty then there 's a big danger that we take it for granted 
 cancun is famous for spring break  tequila and foam parties  
 and its waters are where frat boys can ride around on jet skis and banana boats  
 but because of our work there there 's now a little corner of cancun
 that is simply precious for being itself  
 and we don 't want to stop in grenada in cancun or the bahamas just last month  i installed these four horsemen of the apocalypse
 in the thames river 
 in central london right in front of the houses of parliament putting a stark message about climate change in front of the people that have the power to help change
 because for me this is just the beginning of the mission we want to team up with
 other inventors  creators  philanthropists  educators biologists to see better futures for our oceans  and we want to see
 beyond sculpture  beyond art even 
  kid from the city  and you 've never seen the ocean  and instead of getting taken to the natural history museum or an aquarium 
 you get taken out to the ocean 
 to an underwater noah 's ark  
 which you can access through a  dry glass viewing tunnel where you can see all the wildlife of the land be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean  
 clearly it would blow your mind 
 so let 's think big and let 's think deep
 who knows where our imagination and willpower can lead us 
 i hope that by bringing our art into the ocean that not only do we take advantage of amazing creativity and visual impact of the setting but
 that we are also giving something back 
 and by encouraging new environments to thrive and in some way opening up
 a new or maybe it 's a really old way of seeing the seas
 as delicate precious places worthy of our protection our oceans are sacred
