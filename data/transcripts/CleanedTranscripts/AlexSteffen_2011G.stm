  climate change is already a heavy topic and it 's getting heavier because we 're understanding that we need to do more than we are we 're understanding in fact  that those of us who live in the developed world need to be really pushing
  to put it mildly not what 's on the table now  
 and it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face  and when we have overwhelming problems 
  in front of us we tend to seek simple answers  and i think this is what we 've done with climate change 
  out of fossil fuels that we 're burning so therefore the answer must be to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy  
 and while of course we do need clean energy  i would put to you that it 's possible that by looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem we 're in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it 
 and the reason why is that we live on a planet that
  rapidly urbanizing 
 that shouldn 't be news to any of us however it 's hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization 
 by mid century we 're going to have about eight billion perhaps more people living in cities or within a day 's travel of one we will be an overwhelmingly urban species  
 in order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in
  cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global north live in today  we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy 
 it may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy
 so if we 're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet
  we need to look somewhere else for the solution the solution in fact may be closer to hand than we think because all of those cities we 're building
 are opportunities  every city determines to a very large extent
 the amount of energy used by its inhabitants
 we tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing i choose to turn this light switch on but really enormous amounts of our energy use are are predestined by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in 
 i won 't show
  you very many graphs today but if i can just focus on this one for a moment it really tells us a lot of what we need to know which is quite simply that if you look for example at transportation a major category of climate emissions 
 there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is
 and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air and the correlation of course is that denser places tend to
  have lower emissions
 which isn 't really all that difficult to figure out if you think about it basically
  we substitute
  in our lives access to the things we want we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place  and we 're basically using mobility to get the access we need 
 but when we live in a denser
  suddenly what we find of course is that the things we need are close by and since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place
  suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable 
 and it is possible of course to increase the density of the communities around us some places are doing this with new eco districts developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods which is nice work if you can get it 
 but most of the time what we 're talking about is in fact  reweaving the urban fabric that we already have so we 're talking about things like
  development really sharp little changes to where we have buildings where we 're developing 
 urban retrofitting creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there 
 increasingly we 're realizing that we don 't even need to densify an entire city 
 what we need instead is an average density that rises to a level where we don 't drive as much and so on and that can be done by
  raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot so you can think of it as tent poles that actually raise the density of the entire city  
 and we find that when we do that we can in fact have a few places that are really hyper dense within a wider fabric of places that are perhaps a little more comfortable and achieve the same results now we may find that there are places that are really really dense and still hold onto their cars
  but the reality is that by and large what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect where people simply stop driving as much and increasingly more 
  and more people if they 're surrounded by places that make them feel at home give up their cars altogether and this is a huge huge energy savings because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just
  manufacture of the car the disposal of the car all of the parking and freeways and so on when you can get rid of all of those because somebody doesn 't use any of them really you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as ninety percent  
 and people are embracing this all around the world we 're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life people are saying that it 's moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood  
 and when you layer that over with the
  kind of ubiquitous communications that we 're starting to see what you find is in fact  even more access suffused into spaces some of it 's transportation access this is a
  mapnificent map that shows me in this case how far i can get from my home in thirty minutes using public transportation 
 i asked how to do the greater ridgeway  and it told me to go via guernsey it did tell me that this route maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths though 
 but the technologies are getting better and we 're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation and as we just heard earlier of course we 're also learning how to put information on dumb objects things 
  that don 't have any wiring in them at all we 're learning how to include in these systems of notation
  part of what we 're finding with this is that what we thought was the major
 point of manufacturing and consumption
  which is to get a bunch of stuff is not in fact  how we really live best in dense environments what we 're finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things 
 my favorite example is a drill who here owns a drill a home power drill  okay  i do too the average home power drill is used somewhere between six and twenty minutes in its entire lifetime
  depending on who you ask 
 and so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit our cities 
 i would put to you are stockpiles of these surplus capacities and while we could try and figure out new ways to use those capacities
  that in fact  turning those products into services that we have access to when we want them is a far smarter way to go 
 and in fact even space itself is turning into a service we 're finding that people can share the same spaces do stuff with vacant space 
 buildings are becoming bundles of services so we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on like heating cooling
  things that we avoid spending energy on so we light our buildings with daylight we cool them with breezes we heat them with sunshine in fact when we use all these things what we 've found is that 
 in some cases energy use in a building can drop as much as ninety percent  which brings on another threshold effect i like to call furnace dumping  
  than the alternatives now when we look at being able to slash our our product use slash our transportation use slash
 our our building energy use all of that is great but it still leaves something behind  and if we 're going to really truly become sustainable cities we need to think a little differently 
 this is one way to do it this is vancouver 's propaganda about how green a city they are 
 and certainly lots of people have taken to heart this idea that
  sustainable city is covered in greenery so we have visions like this we have visions like this we have visions like this now all of these are fine projects but they really have
 missed an essential point which is it 's not about the leaves above it 's about the systems below  do they for instance capture rainwater so that we can reduce water use 
  energy intensive 
 do they perhaps include green infrastructure so that we can take runoff and water that 's going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees 
 do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by for example connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration 
 do they allow for pollination  pollinator pathways that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities 
 do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food
  and fiber and so forth  and turn it back into soil
 and sequester carbon take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities 
 i would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible they 're being done right now  
 and that it 's a darn good thing 
 because right now our economy by and large operates as paul hawken
  by stealing the future  selling it in the present and calling it gdp 
 and if we have another eight billion or seven billion or six billion even people living on a planet where their cities also steal the future  we 're going to run out of future really fast  
 but if we think differently  i think that in fact we can have cities that are not only zero emissions  but have unlimited possibilities as well 
 thank you very much
