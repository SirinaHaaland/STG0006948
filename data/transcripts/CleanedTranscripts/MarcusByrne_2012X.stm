  and what i want to do today is share my passion for poo with you
 which might be quite difficult  but i think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with poo
  this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice  
 and yet it can do things that you and i couldn 't possibly entertain the idea of doing  and basically it 's all evolved to handle its food source  which is dung  
 so the question is where do we start this story  and it seems appropriate to start at the end
 because this is a waste product that comes out of other
  animals  but it still contains nutrients and there are sufficient nutrients in there for dung beetles basically to make a living  and so dung beetles eat dung  and 
  their larvae are also dung feeders they are grown completely in a ball of dung  
  in africa we 've got two thousand species of dung beetles  and in the world we have about six thousand species of dung beetles 
 so according to dung beetles dung is pretty good
 unless you 're prepared to get dung under your fingernails and root through the dung itself you 'll never see ninety percent of the dung beetle species because they go directly into the dung 
 straight down below it  and then they shuttle back and forth between the dung at the soil surface and a nest they make underground
 so
 the question is how do they deal with this material  and most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort 
 ten percent of the species
 actually make a ball and this ball they roll away from the dung source  usually bury it at a remote place
  they have a very particular behavior by which they are able to roll their balls  so this is a very proud owner
 of a beautiful dung ball you can see it 's a male because he 's got a little hair on the back of his legs there  and he 's clearly very pleased about
 what he 's sitting on there  and then he 's about to become a victim of a vicious
  clear indication
 that this is a valuable resource  
 and so valuable resources have to be looked after and guarded in a particular way  and we think the reason they roll the balls away is because 
  of this because of the competition that is involved in getting hold of that dung  
  and we think it 's the intense competition that makes the beetles
 so well adapted to rolling balls of dung  
 so what you 've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the african veld 
 its head is down  it 's walking backwards  it 's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction  
 and at the same
  it 's got to deal with the heat this is africa  it 's hot  so what i want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used
 to
 investigate how dung beetles
 deal with these problems  so watch this beetle and there 's two things that i would like you to be aware of 
 the first is how it deals with this obstacle that we
  in its way see look it does a little dance  and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place a
 little dance  and then heads off in a particular direction  
 so clearly this animal knows where it 's going and it knows where it wants to go  and that 's a very very important thing because
  the dung pile you 've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line  
 so we gave them some more tasks to deal with  
 and what we did here
 is we turned the world under their feet 
 and watch its response
  so this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet it 's turned by ninety degrees  but it doesn 't flinch it knows exactly where it wants to go and it heads off in that particular direction  
 so our next question then was how are they doing this 
 what are they doing and there was a cue that that was available to us it was that every now and then they 'd climb on top of the ball
  look at the world around them and what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball what are the obvious cues that this animal could use
 to direct its movement  and the most obvious one
 is to look at the sky and so we thought now what could they be looking at in the sky  and the obvious thing to look at
 is the sun  so a classic experiment here  in that what we did was we moved
  we 're going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position  and look at what the beetle does it
 does a little double dance  
 and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went
 in the first place what happens
 now so clearly they 're looking at the sun the sun is a very important cue in the sky for them the thing is the sun is not always
  available to you  because at sunset it disappears below the horizon
 what is happening in the sky here is that there 's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky
 that you and i can 't see it 's the way our eyes are built  but the sun is at the horizon over here and we know
  a huge pathway across the sky of polarized light that we can 't see that the beetles can see  
 so how do we test that well that 's easy what we do is we get a great big polarization filter 
 pop the beetle underneath it and the filter is at right angles to the polarization pattern of the
  beetle comes out from underneath the filter
 and it does a right hand turn because it comes back under the sky that it was originally orientated to
 and then reorientates itself back to the direction it was originally going in 
 so obviously beetles can see polarized light 
 okay  so what we 've got so far is what are beetles doing they 're rolling balls
 how are they doing it well they 're rolling them in a straight line  how are they maintaining it in a particular straight line well they 're looking at celestial cues in the sky some of which 
  you and i can 't see  but how do they pick up those celestial cues that was what was of interest to us next and it was this particular little behavior the dance 
 we thought was important because look it takes a pause every now and then and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in so
 what are they doing when they do this dance  how far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves  and in this experiment here  
 what we did was we forced them into a channel  
 and you can see he wasn 't particularly forced into this particular
  and we gradually displaced the beetle
 by one hundred and eighty degrees
 until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction that it wanted to go in in the first place  and let 's see what his reaction is
 as he 's headed through ninety degrees here 
 and now he 's going to when he ends up down here he 's going to be one hundred and eighty degrees in the wrong direction  and see what his response is he
 does a little dance he turns around and heads back in
 he knows exactly where he 's going  
 he knows exactly what the problem is  and he knows exactly how to deal with it and the dance is this transition behavior that allows them to reorientate themselves  
 so
 that 's the dance  but after spending many years sitting in the african bush watching dung beetles on nice
  we noticed that there was another behavior associated with the dance behavior every now and then when they climb on top of the ball they wipe their face
 and you see him do it again now we thought now what could be going on here
 clearly the ground is very hot and when the ground is hot they dance more often  and when they do this particular dance they wipe the bottom of
  and we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior we thought that maybe what they 're doing is trying to get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face to cool their head down  
 so what we did was design a couple of arenas 
 one was hot one was cold we shaded this one we left that one hot  and then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera  so what you 're looking at
  and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball  
 so the truth is if you look at the temperature over here  dung is cool 
 so
 all we 're interested in here is comparing the temperature of the beetle against the background  so the background here is around about fifty degrees centigrade the beetle itself
  and the ball are probably around about thirty to thirty five degrees centigrade  so this is a great big ball of ice cream that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld  
 it isn 't climbing it isn 't dancing  because its body temperature is actually relatively low it 's about the same as yours and mine  
 and what 's of interest here is that little brain
 is quite cool  but if we contrast now what happens
 in a hot environment 
 look at the temperature of the soil  it 's up around fifty five to sixty degrees centigrade  watch how often the beetle dances  
 and look at its front legs they 're roaringly hot  
 so the ball leaves a little thermal shadow  and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face  and all the time it 's trying to cool itself
  down we think and avoid the hot sand that it 's walking across  and what we did then was put little boots
 on these legs  because this was a way to test if the legs
 were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil 
 and if you look over here  with boots they climb onto the ball far less often when they had no boots on
  so we described these as cool boots it was a dental compound that we used to make these boots  
 and we also cooled down the dung ball  so we were able to put the ball in the fridge gave them a nice cool dung ball and they climbed onto that ball far less often than when they had a hot ball  
 so this is called stilting it 's a thermal behavior that you and i do if we cross the beach we jump onto a
  and then you scuttle across onto somebody else 's towel  and that way you don 't burn your feet and that 's exactly what the beetles are doing here  
 however there 's one more story i 'd like to share with you and that 's this particular species 
 it 's from a genus called pachysoma there are thirteen species in the genus  and they have a particular behavior that i think you will find interesting 
 this is a dung
 watch what he 's doing 
 can you spot the difference 
 they don 't normally go this slowly it 's in slow motion but it 's walking forwards  and it 's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it 
 this is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior there
 's one more interesting aspect of this dung
  behavior that we found quite fascinating  and that 's that it forages and provisions a nest  
 so watch this individual here  and what he 's trying to do is set up a nest 
 and he doesn 't like this first position  but he comes up with a second position  and about fifty minutes later that nest is finished
  and he heads off to forage and provision
 at a pile of dry dung pellets  and what i want you to notice is the outward path compared to the homeward path and compare the two 
 and by and large you 'll see that the homeward path is far more direct than the outward path on the outward path he 's always on the lookout
 for a new blob of dung on the way home he knows where home is and he wants to go straight to it the
  important thing here is that this is not a one way trip 
 as in most dung beetles the trip here is repeated back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site 
 and watch you 're going to see another south african crime taking place right now and
 his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets so what we 're looking at here is a behavior
 called path integration  and what 's taking place is that the beetle
 has got a home spot  it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food  and then when it finds food it heads straight home  it knows exactly where its home is 
 now there 's two ways it could be doing that 
 and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it 's at the foraging site
  if it 's using landmarks  it will find its home  
 if it is using something called path integration  
 it will not find its home it will arrive at the wrong spot  and what it 's doing here if it 's using path integration is it 's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction it knows the bearing home  and it knows it should be in that
  if you displace it it ends up in the wrong place  so let 's see what happens when we put this beetle to the test with a similar experiment so here 's our cunning experimenter  
 he displaces the beetle  
 and now we have to see what is going to take place
  what we 've got is a burrow that 's where the forage was the forage has been displaced to a new position  if he 's using landmark orientation
  should be able to find the burrow because he 'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it 
 if he 's using path integration then it should end up in the wrong spot over here  so let 's watch what happens
 when we put the beetle through the whole test so there he is there he 's about to head home
  it hasn 't a clue  it starts to search for its house in the right distance away from
 the food but it is clearly completely lost  so we know now that this animal uses path integration
 to find its way around  and the callous experimenter leads it top left
 and
  we 're looking at here
 are a group of animals that use a compass and they use the sun as a compass to find their way around  
 and they have some sort of system for measuring that distance  and we know that these species here actually count the steps that 's what they use as an odometer a step counting system 
 to find their way back home  we don 't know yet what dung
  behavior that you and i
