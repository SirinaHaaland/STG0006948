  in two thousand and eight burhan hassan age seventeen  boarded a flight from minneapolis to the horn of africa 
 and while burhan was the youngest recruit he was not alone
  managed to recruit over two dozen young men in their late teens and early  20s with a heavy presence on social media platforms like facebook  
 with the internet and other technologies  they 've changed our everyday lives but they 've also changed recruitment radicalization
 and the front lines of conflict today what about the links connecting twitter google
 and protesters fighting for democracy these numbers
  represent google 's public dns servers effectively the only digital border crossing protesters had and could use to communicate with each other to reach the outside world and to spread viral awareness of what was happening
 in their own country today conflict is essentially borderless  if there are bounds to conflict
  they 're bound by digital not physical geography and under all this is a vacuum of power
 where non state actors individuals and private organizations
 have the advantage
 over slow  outdated military and intelligence agencies  and this is because in the digital age of conflict there exists a feedback loop
 where new technologies platforms like the ones i mentioned and more disruptive ones can be adapted learned and deployed
  deployed
 by individuals and organizations faster than governments can react 
 to understand the pace of our own government thinking on this 
 i like to turn to something aptly named the worldwide threat assessment 
 where every year
 the director of national intelligence in the us looks at the global threat landscape  and he says these are the threats these are the details
 and this is how we rank them 
 in two thousand and seven there was absolutely no mention of cyber security  it took until two thousand and eleven when it came at the end 
 where other things like west african drug trafficking took precedence in two thousand
 and twelve it crept up still behind things like terrorism and proliferation in two
 thousand and thirteen it became the top threat
 what things like that show us is that there is a fundamental inability today on the part of governments to adapt and learn
 in digital conflict where conflict can be immaterial borderless  often wholly untraceable 
 and conflict isn 't just online to offline as we see with terrorist radicalization but it goes the other way as well 
  know the horrible events that unfolded in paris this year with the charlie hebdo terrorist attacks what an individual hacker or a small group of anonymous individuals did
 was enter those social media conversations that so many of us took part in
 on facebook on twitter  on google all sorts of places where millions
  of people myself included were talking about the events and saw images like this the emotional poignant image of a baby with je suis charlie on its wrist  
 and this turned into a weapon 
 what the hackers did was weaponize this image  where unsuspecting victims like all of us in those conversations saw this image  downloaded it
 but it was embedded with malware  and so when you downloaded this image 
  it hacked your system it took six days to deploy a global malware campaign 
 the divide between physical and digital domains today ceases to exist where we have offline attacks like those in paris appropriated for online hacks  
 and it goes the other way as well with recruitment we see online radicalization of teens who can then be deployed globally for offline terrorist attacks 
 with all of this we see that
  there 's a new 21st century battle brewing and governments don 't necessarily take a part so in another case anonymous
 vs los zetas  
 in early september two thousand and eleven in mexico los zetas one of the most powerful drug cartels  
 hung two bloggers with a sign that said this is what will happen to all internet busybodies
  later they beheaded a young girl they severed her head put it on top of her computer with a similar note and taking the digital counteroffensive
 because governments couldn 't even understand what was going on or act anonymous a group we might not associate as the most positive force in the world took action 
 not in cyber attacks but threatening information to be free
  on social media they said we will release information that ties prosecutors and governors to corrupt drug deals with the cartel 
 and escalating that conflict  los zetas said we will kill ten people for every bit of information you release 
 and so it ended there because it would become too gruesome to continue  
  but what was powerful about this
 was that
 anonymous individuals not federal policia not military not politicians could strike fear deep
 into the heart
 of one of the most powerful violent organizations in the world 
 and so we live in an era that lacks the clarity of the past in conflict 
 in who we 're fighting in the motivations behind attacks  in the tools and techniques
  used and how quickly they evolve 
 and the question still remains what can individuals organizations and governments do 
 for answers to these questions it starts with individuals and i think peer to peer security is the answer 
 those people in relationships that bought over
  teens online we can do that with peer to peer security individuals have more power than ever before to affect national and international security  
 and we can create those positive peer to peer relationships on and offline 
 we can support and educate the next generation of hackers like myself instead of saying you can either be a criminal or join the nsa that matters
  and it 's not
 just individuals it 's organizations corporations even they have an advantage to act across more borders more effectively and more rapidly than governments can 
 and there 's a set of real incentives there it
 's profitable and valuable to be seen as trustworthy in the digital age  and will only be more so
 in future generations to come  but we still can 't ignore government because that 's who we turn to
 for collective action to keep us safe
 and secure  
 but we see where that 's gotten us so far 
 where there 's an inability to adapt and learn in digital conflict 
 where at the highest levels of leadership the director of the cia  secretary of defense they say cyber pearl harbor
  but this only makes us more fearful  not more secure  
 by banning encryption in favor of mass surveillance and mass hacking sure gchq and the nsa can spy on you 
 but that doesn 't mean that they 're the only ones that can 
 capabilities are cheap even free technical ability is rising around the world 
 and individuals and small groups have the advantage 
  it might just be the nsa and gchq but who 's to say that the chinese can 't find that backdoor or in another generation some kid in his basement in estonia  
 and so
 i would say that it 's not what governments can do it 's that they can 't 
 governments today need to give up power and control
 in order to help make us more secure
  giving up mass surveillance and hacking and instead fixing those backdoors means that yeah  they can 't spy on us but neither can the chinese or that hacker in estonia a generation from now 
 and government support for technologies like tor and bitcoin mean giving up control  but it means that developers translators anybody with an internet connection in countries like cuba iran and china can sell their
  skills their products in the global marketplace but more importantly sell their ideas show us what 's happening in their own countries  and so it should be
 not fearful  it should be inspiring to the same governments that fought for civil rights free speech and democracy in the great wars of the last century that today for the first time in human
  we have a technical opportunity to make billions of people safer around the world that we 've never had before in human history  it should be inspiring
