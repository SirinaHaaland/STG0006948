  i love my food and i love information  
 my children usually tell me that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other 
 but what i want to do in the next eight minutes or so is to take you through how those
  passions developed the point in my life when the two passions merged 
 the journey of learning that took place from that point and one idea i want to leave you with today
 is what would would happen differently in your life
 if you saw information the way you saw food  
 i was born in calcutta a family where my father and his father before him
 were journalists and they wrote magazines in the english language that was the family business  
 and as a result of that i grew up with books everywhere around the house  and i mean books everywhere around the house  
 and that 's actually a shop in calcutta but it 's a place where we like our
  thousand of them now
 and no kindle in sight  but
 growing up as a child
 with the books around everywhere with people to talk to about those books 
 this wasn 't a sort of slightly learned thing by the time i was eighteen i had a deep passion for books 
 it wasn 't the only passion i had i was a south indian
 brought up in bengal  and two of the things
  about bengal  they like their savory dishes and they like their sweets so by the time i grew up again i had a 
  passion for food now i was growing up in the late ' 60s and early ' 70s and
 there were a number of other passions i was also interested in but these two were the ones that differentiated me
  everything was okay  until i got to
 about the age of twenty six and i went to a movie called short circuit oh some of you have seen it and
 apparently it 's being remade right now and it 's going to be coming out next year it 's the story of this experimental robot which
  got electrocuted and found a life  and as it ran this thing was saying give me input  give me input and i suddenly realized that for a robot
 both information as well as food
 were the same thing  energy came to it in some form or shape  data came to it in some form or shape  and i began to think  
 i wonder what it would be like to start imagining myself
 as if energy and information were the two things i had as
  as if food and information were similar in some form or shape  
 i started doing some research then and this was the 25 year journey and started finding out that actually
 human beings as primates have far smaller stomachs than should be the size for our body weight
 and far larger brains  and as i went to research that even further
 i got to a point where i discovered something called
 the expensive tissue hypothesis that actually for a given body mass of a primate
 the metabolic rate was static what changed was the balance of the tissues available  
 and two of the most expensive tissues in our human body
 are nervous tissue and digestive tissue
 and what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about one thousand nine hundred and ninety five it 's a lady named leslie aiello 
 and the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other if you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large
  you had to live with a smaller gut 
 that then set me off completely to say okay these two are connected
  so i looked at the cultivation of information as if it were food and said so we were hunter gathers of information we moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information  
 does that really explain what we 're seeing with the intellectual property battles nowadays  
  in origin wanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted 
 and those that were in the business of farming information wanted to build fences around it create ownership and wealth and structure and settlement 
 so there was always going to be a tension within that and everything i saw in the cultivation said there were huge fights amongst the foodies between the cultivators and the
  and this is happening here 
 when i moved to preparation this same thing was true 
 expect that there were two schools one group of people said you can distill your information you can extract value separate it and serve it up 
 while another group turned around and said no no you can ferment it you bring it all together and mash it up and the value emerges that way 
 the same is again true with information  
 but consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable because what i
  began to see then was there were so many different ways people would consume this they
 'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients do you cook it do you have it served to you do you go to a restaurant 
 the same is true every time as i started thinking about information 
 the analogies were getting crazy that information had sell by dates 
 that people had misused information that wasn 't dated properly and could really make
  an effect on the stock market on corporate values etc and
 by this time i was hooked  and this is about twenty three years into this process  and i began to start thinking of myself as
 we start having mash ups of fact and fiction  docu dramas mockumentaries  whatever you call it are we going to reach the stage where information has
 a percentage for fact associated with it we start
  labeling information for the fact percentage are we going to start looking at what happens when your information source is turned off as a famine  
 which brings me to the final element of this 
 clay shirky once stated that there is no such animal as information overload there is only filter failure  i put it to you that
  viewed from the point of food is never a production issue you never speak of food overload  fundamentally it 's a consumption issue  
 and we have to start thinking about how we create
 diets within ourselves  exercise within ourselves to have the faculties to be able to deal with information 
 to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly in fact when i saw supersize me i
  what would happen if an individual had thirty one days nonstop fox news would there be
 time to be able to work with it so you start really understanding that you can have
 diseases  toxins a need to balance your diet
  and once you start looking and from that point on everything i have done in terms of the consumption of information the production of information the preparation
  of information  i 've looked at from the viewpoint of food 
 it has probably not helped my waistline any because i like practicing on both sides  
 but i 'd like to leave you with just that question 
 if you began to think of all the information that you consume the way you think of food what would you do differently 
 thank you very much for your time
