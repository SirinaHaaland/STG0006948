  i 've always had stage fright  and not just a little bit it 's a big bit  and
 it didn 't even matter until i was twenty seven that 's when i started writing songs and even then i only played them for myself just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable
  but after a couple of years just writing songs wasn 't enough i had all these stories and ideas and i wanted to share them with people but physiologically  
 i couldn 't do it i had this irrational fear
 but the more i wrote  and the more i practiced the more i wanted to perform so on the week of my 30th birthday i decided i was going to go to this local open
  and put this fear behind me well when i got there it was packed there were like twenty people there 
 and they all looked angry  
 but i took a deep breath  and i signed up to play  and i felt pretty good  pretty good 
 until about ten minutes before my turn when my whole body rebelled and this wave of anxiety just washed over me 
 now when you experience fear your sympathetic nervous system kicks in so you have a rush of
 your heart rate increases your breathing gets faster  next your non essential systems start to shut down like digestion 
 so your mouth gets dry and blood is routed away from your extremities so your fingers don 't work anymore  
 your pupils dilate your muscles contract your spidey sense tingles basically
 your whole body
  that condition
 is not conducive to performing folk music 
 i mean  your nervous system is an idiot really two hundred thousand years of human evolution  and it still can 't tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and twenty folksingers on a tuesday night open mic 
 i have never been more terrified
  then it was my turn  and somehow i get myself onto the stage  i start my song i open my mouth to sing the first line  
 and this completely horrible vibrato you know when your voice wavers comes streaming out and this is not the good kind of vibrato like an opera singer has this is my whole body just convulsing with fear i mean
 it 's a nightmare
  i 'm embarrassed the audience is clearly uncomfortable they 're focused on my discomfort it was so bad
 but that was my first real experience as a solo singer songwriter 
 and something good did happen i had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that i was hoping for and i wanted more but i knew i had to get past
  that night i promised myself i would go back every week
 until i wasn 't nervous anymore  and i did i went back every single week  and sure enough week after week 
 it didn 't get any better the same thing happened every week 
 laughter i couldn 't shake it and that 's when i had an epiphany  and i remember it really well because
 i don 't have a lot of
  all i had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness that only seems authentic when i have stage fright and the more nervous i was the better the song would be 
 easy  
 so i started writing a song about having stage fright first 
 fessing up to the problem the physical manifestations how i would feel how the listener might feel  and then accounting for things like my shaky voice and
 i knew i would be singing about a half octave higher than normal because i was nervous
  by having a song that explained what was happening to me  
 while it was happening that gave the audience permission to think about it they didn 't have to feel bad for me because i was nervous  they could experience that with me  and we were all one big happy nervous uncomfortable family 
 laughter by thinking about my audience by embracing and exploiting my problem i was able to take something that was blocking my progress and turn it into something
  that was essential for my success
  and having the stage fright song let me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance  and then i could move on and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease  
 and eventually
 over time i didn 't have to play the stage fright song at all except for when i was really
  would it be okay if i played the stage fright song for you
  was nervous
