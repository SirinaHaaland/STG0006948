  could i protect my father from the armed islamic group with a paring knife 
 that was the question i faced one tuesday morning in june of one thousand nine hundred and ninety three when i was a law student 
 i woke up early that morning in dad 's apartment on the outskirts of algiers algeria to an unrelenting
  pounding on the front door 
 it was a season as described by a local paper when every tuesday a scholar fell to the bullets of fundamentalist assassins 
 my father 's university teaching of darwin had already provoked a classroom visit from the head of the so called islamic salvation front who denounced dad as an
  before dad had ejected the man  
 and now whoever was outside would neither identify himself nor go away  so my father tried to get the police on the phone  
 but perhaps terrified by the rising tide of armed extremism that had already claimed the lives of so many algerian officers  they didn 't even answer  
 and that was when i went to the kitchen got out a paring knife and took up a position inside the entryway it
 was a ridiculous thing to do really but i
  't think of anything else and so there i stood 
 when i look back now i think that that was the moment that set me on the path was to writing a book called your fatwa does not apply here  untold stories from the fight against muslim fundamentalism 
 the title comes from a pakistani play  
 i think it was actually that moment that sent me on the journey to interview three hundred people of
  muslim heritage from nearly thirty countries from afghanistan to mali 
 to find out how they fought fundamentalism peacefully like my father did and how they coped with the attendant risks  
 luckily back in june of one thousand nine hundred and ninety three our unidentified visitor went away  but other families were so
  and that was the thought that motivated my research 
 in any case someone would return a few months later and leave a note on dad 's kitchen table which simply said consider yourself dead 
 subsequently  algeria 's fundamentalist armed groups would murder as many as two hundred thousand civilians in what came to be known as the dark decade of the 
 including every
 single one of the women that you see here 
 in its harsh counterterrorist response  the state resorted to torture and to forced disappearances  
 and as terrible as all of these events became the international community largely ignored them 
 finally my father an algerian peasant 's son turned professor was forced to stop teaching at the university and to flee his apartment 
 but what i will never forget about
  that like so many other algerian intellectuals he refused to leave the country and he continued to publish pointed criticisms both of the fundamentalists and sometimes of the government they battled 
 for example in a november one thousand nine hundred and ninety four series in the newspaper el watan entitled how fundamentalism produced a
  he denounced what he called the terrorists ' radical break with the true islam as it was lived by our ancestors these were words that could get you killed 
 my father 's country taught me in that dark decade of the 1990s that the popular struggle against muslim fundamentalism is one of the most important and overlooked human rights struggles in the world
  this remains true today nearly twenty years later 
 you see in every country where you hear about armed jihadis targeting civilians 
 there are also unarmed people defying those militants that you don 't hear about and those people need our support to succeed 
 in the west it 's often assumed that muslims generally condone terrorism  
 some on the right think this because they view muslim culture as inherently violent  and some on the left imagine this because
  they view muslim violence fundamentalist violence  solely as a product of legitimate grievances  but both views are dead wrong  
 in fact many people of muslim heritage around the world are staunch opponents both of fundamentalism and of terrorism  and often for very good reason 
 you see they 're much more likely to be victims of this violence than its perpetrators  let me just give
  you one example  
 according to a two thousand and nine survey of arabic language media resources  between two thousand and four and two thousand and eight 
 no more than fifteen percent of al qaeda 's victims were westerners 
 that 's a terrible toll but the vast majority were people of muslim heritage killed by muslim fundamentalists 
 now i 've been talking for the last five minutes
 about fundamentalism and you have a right to know exactly what i mean  
 i cite the definition given by the algerian sociologist marieme helie lucas  and she says that 
 note the s so within all of the world 's great religious traditions 
 are political movements of the extreme right which in a context of globalization manipulate religion in order to
  achieve their political aims sadia abbas has called this the radical politicization of theology 
 now i want to avoid projecting the notion that there 's sort of a monolith out there called muslim fundamentalism that is the same everywhere because these movements also have their diversities  
 some use and advocate violence  some
 do not though they 're often interrelated 
 they take different forms some may be non governmental organizations  even here in britain like cageprisoners  
 some may become political parties like the muslim brotherhood  and some may be openly armed groups like the taliban  
 but in any case these are all radical projects they 're not conservative or traditional approaches  
 they 're most often about changing people 's relationship with islam rather than preserving it 
 what i am talking about is the muslim
  extreme right and the fact that its adherents are or purport to be muslim makes them no less offensive than the extreme right anywhere else  
 so in my view if we consider ourselves liberal or left wing human rights loving or feminist we must oppose these movements and support their grassroots opponents 
  now let me be clear that i support an effective struggle against fundamentalism 
 but also a struggle that must itself respect international law 
 so nothing i am saying should be taken as a justification for refusals to democratize  
 and here i send out a shout out of support to the pro democracy movement in algeria today barakat 
 nor should anything i say be taken as a justification of violations of human rights like the mass death sentences handed out in egypt
  earlier this week  
 but what i am saying is that we must challenge these muslim fundamentalist movements because they threaten human rights across muslim majority contexts  
 and they do this in a range of ways most obviously with the direct attacks on civilians by the armed groups that carry those out but that violence is just the tip of the iceberg 
 these movements as a whole purvey discrimination against religious
  minorities and sexual minorities  they seek to curtail the freedom of religion of everyone who either practices in a different way or chooses not to practice  
 and most  definingly they lead an all out war on the rights of women 
 now faced with these movements in recent years western discourse has most often offered
  the first that one sometimes finds on the right suggests that most muslims are fundamentalist or something about islam is inherently fundamentalist 
 and this is just offensive and wrong  
 but unfortunately on the left one sometimes encounters a discourse that is too politically correct to acknowledge the problem of muslim fundamentalism at all
 or even worse apologizes for it  and this is unacceptable as well so what i 'm seeking is a new way of
  about this all together which is grounded in the lived experiences and the hope of the people on the front lines 
 i 'm painfully aware that there has been an increase in discrimination against muslims in recent years in countries like the 
 and that too is a matter of grave concern  but i firmly believe that telling these
  of people of muslim heritage who have confronted the fundamentalists and been their primary victims is also a great way of countering that discrimination 
 so now let me introduce you to four people whose stories i had the great honor of telling
  and the rafi peer theatre workshop named for his father have for years promoted the performing arts in pakistan 
 with the rise of jihadist violence they began to receive threats to
  call off their events which they refused to heed  
 and so a bomber struck their two thousand and eight eighth world performing arts festival in lahore producing rain of glass that fell into the venue injuring nine people 
 and later that same night the peerzadas made a very difficult decision  
 they announced that their festival would continue as planned the next day 
  at the time if we bow down to the islamists we 'll just be sitting in a dark corner  but they didn 't know what would happen would anyone come 
 in fact thousands of people came out the next day to support the performing arts in lahore  and this simultaneously thrilled and terrified faizan and he ran up to a woman
  who had come in with her two small children and he said you do know there was a bomb here yesterday  and you do know there 's a threat here today 
 and she said i know that but i came to your festival with my mother when i was their age  and i still have those images in my mind 
 we have to be here 
 with stalwart audiences like this the  peerzadas were able to conclude their festival on schedule  
 and then the next year they lost all of their sponsors due to the security risk
  so when i met them in two thousand and ten they were in the middle of the first subsequent event that they were able to have in the same venue  
 and this was the ninth youth performing arts festival held in lahore in a year when that city had already experienced forty four terror attacks 
 this was a time when the pakistani taliban had commenced their systematic targeting of girls ' schools that would culminate in the attack
 what did the peerzadas do in that environment  they staged girls ' school theater 
 so i had the privilege of watching naang wal which was a musical in the punjabi language and the girls of lahore grammar school played all the parts  they sang and 
  danced they played the mice and the water buffalo  and i held my breath wondering
 would we get to the end of this amazing show  
 and when we did the whole audience collectively exhaled  
 and a few people actually wept  and then they filled the auditorium with the peaceful boom of their applause  
 and i remember thinking in that moment that the bombers made headlines here two years before but this night and these people
 are as important a story  
 maria bashir is the first and only woman chief prosecutor in afghanistan 
 she 's been in the post since two thousand and eight and actually opened an office to investigate cases of violence against women which she says is the most important area in her mandate 
 when i meet her in her office in
 surrounded by four large men with four huge guns  in fact she now has twenty three bodyguards because she has weathered bomb attacks that nearly killed her kids and it took the leg off of one of her guards  
 why does she continue 
 she says with a smile that that is the question that everyone asks as she puts it why you risk not living and it is
  simply that for her a better future for all the maria bashirs to come is worth the risk  
 and she knows that if people like her do not take the risk  there will be no better future 
 later on in our interview prosecutor bashir tells me how worried she is about the possible outcome of government negotiations with the taliban the people who have been trying to kill her 
 if we give them a place in the government
  asks who will protect women 's rights and she urges the international community not to forget its promise about women because now they want peace with taliban 
 a few weeks after i leave afghanistan i see a headline on the internet an afghan prosecutor has been assassinated  
  i google desperately and thankfully that day i find out that maria was not the victim  though sadly another afghan prosecutor was gunned down on his way to work  
 and when i hear headlines like that now 
 i think that as international troops leave afghanistan this year and beyond we must continue to care about what happens to people there to all of the maria bashirs 
 sometimes i still hear her voice in my head saying with no bravado whatsoever
 the situation of the women of afghanistan will be better someday  
 we should prepare the ground for this even if we are killed 
 there are no words adequate to denounce the al shabaab terrorists who attacked the westgate mall in nairobi on the same day as a children 's cooking competition in september of two thousand and thirteen  
 sixty seven including poets and pregnant women far away in the american midwest i had the good fortune of meeting 
  were working to counter the efforts of al shabaab to recruit a small number of young people from their city of minneapolis to take part in atrocities like westgate
 abdirizak bihi 's
  nephew burhan hassan was recruited here in two thousand and eight spirited to somalia  and then killed when he tried to come home 
 since that time mr bihi who directs the no budget somali education and advocacy center has been vocally denouncing the recruitment
 and the failures of government and somali american institutions like the abubakar 
  islamic center where he believes his nephew was radicalized during a youth program 
 but he doesn 't just criticize the mosque  he also takes on the government for its failure to do more to prevent poverty in his community 
 given his own lack of financial resources mr bihi has had to be creative 
 to counter the efforts of al shabaab to sway more disaffected youth in the wake of the group 's two thousand and ten attack on world cup viewers in uganda 
 he organized a ramadan
  basketball tournament in minneapolis in response  
 scores of somali american kids came out to embrace sport despite the fatwa against it  
 they played basketball as burhan hassan never would again 
 for his efforts mr bihi has been ostracized by the leadership of the abubakar 
  islamic center with which he used to have good relations 
 he told me one day we saw the imam on tv calling us infidels and saying ' these families are trying to destroy the mosque ' 
 this is at complete odds with how  abdirizak bihi understands what he is trying to do by exposing al shabaab recruitment which is to save the religion i love from a small number of extremists
  now i want to tell one last story that of a 22 year old law student in algeria named amel 
 who had the same dreams of a legal career that i did back in the ' 90s 
 she refused to give up her studies despite the fact that the fundamentalists battling the algerian state back then threatened all who continued their education 
 on january
  amel boarded the bus in algiers where she was studying to go home and spend a ramadan evening with her family and would never finish law school 
 when the bus reached the outskirts of her hometown it was stopped at a checkpoint manned by men from the armed islamic group 
 carrying her schoolbag amel was taken off the bus and killed in the street  
 the men who cut her throat then told everyone else if you go to university
 the day will come when we will kill all of you just like this 
 amel died at exactly five seventeen p m which we know because when she fell in the street her watch broke 
 her mother showed me the watch with the second hand still aimed optimistically upward towards a five eighteen that would
  shortly before her death amel had said to her mother of herself and her sisters nothing will happen to us inshallah  god willing  
 but if something happens you must know that we are dead for knowledge you and father must keep your heads held high 
 the loss of such a young woman is unfathomable  
 and so as i did my research i found myself searching for amel 's hope again and her name even means
  arabic  
 i think i found it in two places 
 the first is in the strength of her family and all the other families to continue telling their stories and to go on with their lives despite the terrorism 
 in fact amel 's sister lamia overcame her grief went to law school and practices as a lawyer in algiers today  something which is only possible because the armed fundamentalists were largely defeated in the country
 and the second place i found amel 's hope was everywhere that women and men continue to defy the jihadis 
 we must support all of those in honor of amel who continue this human rights struggle today  like the network of women living under muslim laws  
 it is not enough as
  told me in algiers it is not enough just to battle terrorism we must also challenge fundamentalism because fundamentalism is the ideology that makes the bed of this terrorism  
 why is it that people like her like all of them are not more well known  
 why is it that everyone knows who osama bin laden was and so few know of all of those standing up to the bin ladens in their own contexts 
 we must change that and so
  i ask you to please help share these stories through your networks 
 look again at amel zenoune 's watch forever frozen  
 and now please look at your own watch and decide this is the moment that you commit to supporting people like amel  
 we don 't have the right to be silent about them because it is easier or because western policy is flawed as well because five seventeen is still coming to too many
  amel  zenounes in places like northern nigeria where jihadis still kill students 
 the time to speak up in support of all of those who peacefully challenge fundamentalism and terrorism in their own communities is now  
 thank you
