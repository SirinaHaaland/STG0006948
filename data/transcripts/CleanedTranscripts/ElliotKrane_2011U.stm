  pediatrician and an anesthesiologist so i put children to sleep for a living 
 and i 'm an academic so i put audiences to sleep for free 
  but what i actually mostly do is i manage the pain management service at the packard children 's hospital up at stanford in palo alto  
 and it 's from the experience from about twenty or twenty five years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning 
 that pain is a disease  
 now most of the time you think of pain as a symptom of a disease and that 's true most of the time it 's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation
  or an operation 
 but about ten percent of the time after the patient has recovered from one of those events pain persists it persists for
 months and oftentimes for years and when that happens it is its own disease  
 and before i tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it i want to show you how it feels for my patients
  so imagine if you will that i 'm stroking your arm with this feather as i 'm stroking my arm right now  
 now i want you to imagine that i 'm stroking it with this please
 keep your seat 
 a very different feeling now what does it have to do with chronic pain  
 imagine if you will  these two ideas together imagine what your life would be like
 i were to stroke it with this feather  but your brain was telling you
 that this is what you are feeling and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain  in fact imagine something even worse imagine i were to stroke your child 's arm with this feather 
 and their brain [ was ] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch 
  she was sixteen years old last year when i met her and she aspired to be a professional dancer and during the course of one of her dance rehearsals she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist 
 now you would probably imagine as she did that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person 's life 
 wrap it in an ace bandage  take some ibuprofen for a week or two and that 's the end of the story  
 but in chandler 's case that was the beginning of the story 
 this is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her
  sprain 
 you can see that the arm is discolored  purplish in color it was cadaverically cold to the touch the muscles were frozen paralyzed dystonic is how we refer to that 
 the pain had spread from her wrist to her hands to her fingertips from her wrist up to her elbow almost all the way to her shoulder  but the worst part was 
 not the spontaneous pain that was there twenty four hours a day
 the worst part was that she had allodynia  the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch  the lightest touch of her arm
 the touch of a hand the touch even of a sleeve of a garment as she put it on caused excruciating burning pain  
 how can the nervous system get this so wrong how can the nervous system
  an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand
 and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame  
 well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house 
 in your house wires run in the wall from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling
 and from the junction box to the light bulb  and when you turn the switch on the light goes on and when you turn the switch off
  light goes off  so people imagine the nervous system is just like that 
 if you hit your thumb with a hammer 
 these wires in your arm that of course we call nerves transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires new nerves take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt
  but the situation of course in the human body is far more complicated than that  
 instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve
 by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters
 in a linear one on one fashion in fact what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions
  up and down in the spinal cord and they start interacting with other adjacent cells  these cells called glial cells 
 were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together like the nerves  
 but it turns out the glial cells have a vital role
 in the modulation  amplification
  in the case of pain the distortion
 of sensory experiences these glial cells become activated their dna starts to synthesize new proteins which spill out and
 interact with adjacent nerves and they start releasing their neurotransmitters and those neurotransmitters spill out and
 activate adjacent glial cells and so on and so forth  until what we have is a positive feedback loop 
  it 's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch the toilet flushed three doors down 
 or your dishwasher went on or your computer monitor turned off 
 that 's crazy  but that 's in fact  what happens with chronic pain  and that 's why pain becomes its own disease the nervous system has plasticity it changes and it morphs in
  response to stimuli  well what do we do about that what can we do in a case like chandler 's 
 we treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time we treat them with
 drugs painkillers which are frankly not very effective for this kind of pain  
 we take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet  
 and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics and most importantly what we do is we use a
 rigorous  and often uncomfortable process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally
 to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life  
 and we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency  despair and
  depression that always accompanies severe chronic pain  
 it 's successful as you can see from this video of chandler  
 who two months after we first met her is now doings a back flip  
 and i had lunch with her yesterday because she 's a college student studying dance at long beach here  and she 's doing absolutely fantastic  
 but the future
 is actually even brighter the future holds the promise
 that new drugs will be developed that are not
  drugs that simply mask the problem as we have now  but that will be 
  drugs
 that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate 
 that spill over and cause this central nervous system
 wind up or plasticity that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain  
 so i have hope that in the future the prophetic words of george carlin will be realized  who said my philosophy  no pain  
 no pain 
 thank you very much
