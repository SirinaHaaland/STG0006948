  'm going to talk about two stories today one is is how we need to use  market based pricing to affect
 demand and use wireless technologies to dramatically
  reduce our emissions in the transportation sector  and the other is that there is an incredible opportunity if we choose the right wireless technologies how we can
 generate a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce c02 in the other sectors i 'm really scared  we need to reduce c02 emissions
 in ten to fifteen years by eighty percent in order to avert catastrophic effects  
 and i am astounded that i 'm standing here to tell you that what are catastrophic effects a three degree centigrade
 climate change rise that will result in fifty percent species extinction 
 it 's not a movie this is real life  and i 'm really worried because when people talk about cars 
 the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking 
  if we started today ten years from now at the end of this window of opportunity
  those fuel efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs
 by four percent 
 that is not enough  but now i 'll talk about some more pleasant things here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes  
 so  zipcar is a company that i founded seven years ago  but it 's an example of something called car sharing
  zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas for members to reserve by the hour and by the day instead of using their own car 
 how does it feel to be a person using a zipcar 
 it means that i pay only for what i need all those hours when a car is sitting idle i 'm not paying for it 
 it means that i can choose a car exactly for that particular trip  so here 's a woman that reserved minimia
 and she had her day  i can take a bmw when i 'm seeing clients  i can
 drive my
 toyota element when i 'm going to go on that surfing trip  and the other
 remarkable thing is it 's i think the highest status of car ownership not only do i have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world that i can have at my beck and call
  forbid i would ever maintain or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it it 's like the car that you always wanted
 that your mom said that you couldn 't have 
 i get all the good stuff and none of the bad so what is the social result of this 
 the social result is that today 's zipcar has one hundred thousand members
 driving three thousand cars parked in three thousand parking spaces  
 instead of driving twelve thousand miles a year  which is what the average city dweller does they drive five hundred miles a year 
 are they happy the company has been doubling in size ever since i founded it or greater 
 people adore the company  and
 it 's better  you know they like it  so  how is it that people went from the twelve thousand miles a year to
 five hundred miles it 's because they said it 's eight to ten dollars an hour and sixty five dollars a day if i 'm going to go buy some ice cream 
 do i really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream or maybe i 'll do without maybe i would have bought the ice cream when i did some other errand so people really respond very quickly to it to 
  prices and the last point i want to make is zipcar would never be possible without technology 
  drive it  
 and for me as a service provider i would never be able to provide you a car for an hour if the transaction cost was anything so without these wireless technologies 
 this as a concept could never happen 
 so here 's another example this company is goloco i 'm launching it in about three weeks
 and i hope to do for ridesharing what i did for car sharing this will apply to people across all of america today
  of the trips are single occupancy vehicles yet twelve percent of trips to work are currently carpool  and i think that we can apply social networks
 and
 online payment systems to completely change how people feel about ridesharing and make that trip much more efficient and so when i think about the future 
 people will be thinking that
 sharing the ride with someone is this incredibly great social
  event out of their day you know
 how did you get to ted  you went with other tedsters how fabulous why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car how did you go food shopping you went with your neighbor what a great social time 
 you know it 's going to really transform how we feel about travel  
 and it will also i think enhance our freedom of mobility  where can i go today and who can i do it with those are the types of things that you will look at and feel 
 and the social benefits
 the rate of single occupancy vehicles is i told you seventy five percent i think we can get that that down to fifty percent the demand for parking of course is down congestion and the co2 emissions 
 one last piece about this of course is that it 's
 enabled by wireless technologies and it 's the cost of driving that 's making people want to be able to do this the average american spends
 nineteen percent of their income on their car and there 's a pressure for them to
  reduce that
 cost yet they have no outlet today  
 so  the last example of this is congestion pricing very famously done in london it 's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads in london the day they turned the congestion pricing on 
 there was a twenty five percent decrease in congestion overnight  and that 's persisted for the four years in which they 've been doing congestion pricing and again do people like the outcome
  ken livingstone was reelected  so
 again we can see that price plays an enormous role in people 's willingness to
 reduce their driving behavior  we 've tripled the miles that we drive since one thousand nine hundred and seventy and doubled them since one thousand nine hundred and eighty two there 's a huge slack in that system with the right pricing
  we can undo that 
 congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world and is again wirelessly enabled you weren 't going to put tollbooths around the city of london and open and shut those gates  
 and what congestion pricing is is that it 's a technology trial and a psychological trial for something called road pricing 
 and road pricing is where we 're all going to have to go because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear
  with gas taxes and
 as we get our cars more fuel efficient that 's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes so we need to charge people by the
 by the mile that they drive whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies
 will be happening with road pricing why do we travel too much car travel is underpriced and therefore we over consumed 
 we need to put this better market feedback  and if we have it you 'll decide how many miles to drive what mode of travel where to live and work 
 and wireless technologies make this real time loop possible so i want to move now to the second part of my story  
 which is 
 when are we going to start doing
 this this congestion pricing road pricing is coming when are we going to do it are we going to wait ten to fifteen years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years
 overnight  and what kind of wireless technology are we going to use  this is my
 big vision there is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide  respond to emergencies get traffic moving 
 provide a new engine for economic growth
 and dramatically reduce co2 emissions in every sector
  this moment you guys are going to be the handsome young guy and i 'm going to be the wise businessman i want to say one word to you just one word
  these are also called mesh networks 
 and in a mesh every device contributes to and expands the network and i think you might have heard a little bit about it before i 'm going to give you some examples you 'll be hearing later today from alan kay 
 these laptops  when a child opens them up they communicate with every single child in the classroom  within that school within that village  
 and what is the cost of that communication system  zero dollars a month
 here 's another example in new orleans  video cameras were mesh enabled so that they could monitor crime in the downtown french quarter 
 when the hurricane happened the only communication system standing was the mesh network volunteers flew in added a whole bunch of devices and for the next twelve months 
 mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening
  three hundred buses and they speak to these smart terminals you can look at the terminal and
 be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street
 and when it 's coming and you can buy your tickets in real time again all mesh enabled monthly communication cost zero  
 so  the beauty of mesh networks  you can have these very
  zero ongoing communication costs  highly scalable you can just keep adding them and as in katrina you can keep subtracting them as long as there 's some we can still communicate 
 they 're resilient their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design 
 what are the incredible weaknesses there isn 't anybody in washington lobbying to make it happen or in those municipalities
  build out their cities with these wireless networks because there 's zero ongoing communications cost so the examples that i gave you are these
 islands of mesh networks and networks are interesting only as they are big how do we create a
 big network are you guys
 ready again the graduate this time you will still play the handsome young thing but i 'll be the sexy woman these are the next two lines in the movie where did you do it
 so you know when you stick this idea 
 where would we expect me robin chase to be thinking
 is imagine if we put a mesh network device in every single car across america  we could have a 
 free wireless communication
  i guess i just want you to think about that 
 and why is this going to happen  because we 're going to do congestion pricing we are going to do road tolls gas taxes are going to become road pricing 
 these things are going to happen 
 what 's the wireless technology we 're going to use  maybe we should use a good one
  when are we going to do it  maybe we shouldn 't wait for the ten or fifteen years for this to happen we should pull it forward 
  to launch the wireless internet interstate wireless mesh system  
 and require that this network be accessible to everyone with open standards right now in the transportation sector  
 we 're creating these wireless devices
 i guess you guys might have fast pass here or easy lane
 that are single purpose devices in these closed networks what is the point we 're transferring just a few little data bits when we 're doing road controlling
  road pricing we have this incredible excess capacity 
 so we can provide the lowest cost means of going wireless coast to coast we can have resilient nationwide communication systems 
 we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero what you can do with that tool 
 we can create an economic engine information should be free and access to information should be
  free  and we should be charging people for carbon 
 i think this is a more powerful tool than the interstate highway act  and i think this is as important and world changing to our economy as electrification  
 and if i had my druthers we would have an open source version in addition to open standards  
 and this open source version means that
 it could be if we did a brilliant job of it it could be
 could be
 used around the world very quickly so going back to one of my earlier thoughts imagine if every one of these buses in lagos
 was part of the mesh network  when i went this morning to larry brilliant 's tedtalk prize
 imagine if
  mesh communications device that can be put into those networks to make all that happen  and we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that
  this little slice of things is going to be for free  we could make billions of dollars on top of it  but this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source
