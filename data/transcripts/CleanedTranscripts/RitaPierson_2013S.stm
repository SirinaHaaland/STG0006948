  i have spent my entire life
 either at the schoolhouse on the way to the schoolhouse  or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse 
 both my parents were educators my maternal grandparents were educators
 and for the past forty years i 've done the same thing and so needless to say over those years i 've had a chance to look at
 education reform from a lot of perspectives some of those reforms have been good some of them have been not so good  
 and we know why kids drop out we know why kids don 't learn
  it 's either poverty low attendance negative peer influences we know why 
 but one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss
 is the value and importance of human connection 
 relationships  
 james comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship  
 george washington carver says all learning is understanding
  relationships  everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult 
 for years i have watched people teach i have looked at the best and i 've looked at some of the worst 
 a colleague said to me one time they don 't pay me to like the kids 
 they pay me to teach a lesson the kids should learn it i should teach it they should learn it case closed
 well  i said to her you know kids don 't learn from people they don 't like
  people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship or you don 't 
 i think stephen covey had the right idea he said you ought to just throw in a few simple things like seeking first to understand as opposed to being understood 
 simple things like apologizing  
 you ever thought about that tell a kid you 're sorry they 're in shock 
 i taught a lesson once on
  ratios i 'm not real good with math but i was working on it 
 and i got back and looked at that teacher edition i 'd taught the whole lesson wrong 
 so i came back to class the next day and i said look guys  i need to apologize i taught the whole lesson wrong i 'm so sorry they said that 's okay
  you were so excited we just let you go 
 i have had classes that were so low 
 so academically deficient that i cried 
 i wondered how am i going to take this group in nine months from where they are to where they need to be and it was difficult
  it was awfully hard 
 how do i raise the self esteem of a child and his academic achievement at the same time 
 one year i came up with a bright idea i told all my students you were chosen
 to be in my class
 because i am the best teacher and you are the best students they put us all together so we could show everybody else how to do it one of the students
 classes how to do it so when we walk down the hall people will notice us so you can 't make noise you just have to strut 
 laughter and i gave them a saying to say i am somebody i was somebody when i came i 'll be a better somebody when i leave  i am powerful and i am strong  i deserve the education that i get here  i have
  say it long enough it starts to be a part of you
  because you 're on a roll you got two right you didn 't miss them all
  for years i watched my mother
 take the time at recess to review go on home visits in the afternoon buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers to put
  in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn 't smell so good see it 's hard to teach kids who stink 
 and kids can be cruel  and so she kept those things in her desk and
 years later after she retired  i watched some of those same kids come through and say to her you know ms walker you made a difference in my life 
 you made it work for me you made me feel like i was somebody when i knew
  the bottom i wasn 't and i want you to just see what i 've become and when my mama died two years ago at ninety two 
 there were so many former students at her funeral it brought tears to my eyes not because she was gone but because she left a legacy
 of relationships that could never disappear 
 can we stand to have more relationships  absolutely will you like all your
  children of course not and you know your toughest kids are never absent never 
 you won 't like them all and the tough ones show up for a reason it 's the connection
 become great actors and great actresses  and we come to work when we don 't feel like it  and we 're listening to policy that doesn 't make sense  and we teach anyway
  we teach anyway because that 's what we do teaching and learning should bring joy  
 how powerful would our world be if we had kids who who were not afraid to take risks
  who were not afraid to think and who had a champion  every child deserves a champion an adult who will never give up on them who understands the power of connection  and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be 
 is this job tough you betcha  oh god  
 you betcha  
 but it is not
 impossible we can do this we 're educators we 're born to make a difference thank you
