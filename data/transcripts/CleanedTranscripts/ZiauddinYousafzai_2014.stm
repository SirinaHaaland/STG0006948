  in many patriarchal societies and tribal societies  fathers are
 usually known by their sons  but i 'm
 one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter and i am proud
  started her campaign for education and stood for her rights in two thousand and seven  and when
 her efforts were honored in two thousand and eleven and
 she was given the national youth peace prize  and she became a very famous very popular young girl of her country
 before that she was my daughter  but now i am her father  
 ladies and gentlemen if we glance to human history the story of women
 is the story of injustice
  patriarchal societies 
 right from the very beginning  when a girl is born 
 her birth is not celebrated  she is not welcomed  neither by
  neighborhood comes and commiserates with the mother and nobody congratulates the father 
 and a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child  
 when she gives birth to the first girl child first daughter  she
  to the second daughter  she is shocked  
 and in the expectation of a son  when she gives birth to a third daughter  
 she feels guilty like a criminal 
 not only the mother suffers  but the daughter  the newly born daughter when she grows old  she suffers too
  age of five  
 while she should be going to school  
 she stays at home and her brothers are admitted in a school  
 until the age of twelve  somehow  she has a good life  
 she can have fun  she can play with her friends in the streets  and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly
 but when she enters her teens  
 when she becomes thirteen years old she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort  
 she is confined under the four walls of her home 
 she is no more
  she becomes the so called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family 
 and if she transgresses the code of that
  does not only affect the life of a girl  it also affects the life of the male members of the family  
 i know a family of
 seven sisters and one brother 
 and that one brother  he has migrated to the gulf countries to earn a living for his seven sisters
 and parents  because
 he thinks that it will be humiliating
 if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of the home and earn some livelihood  
 so this brother he sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters
 at the altar of so called honor  and there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies
 that is called obedience
 a good girl is supposed to be very quiet very humble
 and very submissive
 it is the criteria the role model good girl should be very quiet  
 she is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to
 accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders even
 if she does not like them if she is married to a man she doesn 't like or if
  married to an old man she has to accept  because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient  
 if she is married very early  she has to accept  otherwise she will be called disobedient  
 and what happens at the end in the words of a poetess she
  and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters
  and it is the irony of the situation that this mother  
 she teaches the same lesson of obedience to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her sons 
 and this vicious cycle goes on 
  ladies and gentlemen this plight of millions of women could be changed
 if we think differently if women and men think differently  
 if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries
  if they can break a few norms of
 family and society
  society  if they can abolish the discriminatory laws
 of the systems in their states  which go against the basic human rights of the women  
 dear brothers and sisters when malala was born  
 and for the first time  believe me i
  't like newborn children to be honest  
 but when i went and i looked into her eyes  believe me
  i got extremely honored  
 and long before she was born  i thought about her name  
 and i was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter
  in afghanistan her name was malalai of maiwand  
 and i named my daughter after her a
 few days after malala was born my daughter was born 
 my cousin came and it was a coincidence he came to my home
 and he brought a family tree
  family tree of the yousafzai family 
 and when i looked at the family tree  it traced back to three hundred years of our ancestors  
 but when i looked all were men and i picked my pen  drew a line from my
  and when she grow old  
 when she was four and a half years old  i admitted her in my school  
 you will be asking then why should i mention about the admission of a girl in a school  yes i must mention it  
 it may be taken for granted in canada in america in many developed countries
  but in poor countries  in patriarchal societies in tribal societies  it 's a big event for the life of girl 
 enrollment in a school means
 recognition of her identity
 and her name  admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and
  aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life 
 i have five sisters and none of them could go to school  and you will be astonished
 two weeks before when i was filling out the canadian visa form  and i was filling out the family part of
  the form  i could not recall
 the surnames of some of my sisters 
 and the reason was that i have never never seen the names of my sisters written on any document 
 that was the reason that i valued my daughter
  what my father could not
 give to my sisters and to his daughters  i thought
 i must change it  i used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance
 of my daughter  i encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come  i encouraged her to go with me to different
  meetings  
 and all these good values  i tried to inculcate in her personality  
 and this was not only she only malala 
 i imparted all these good values to my school girl students and boy students as well  
 i used education
  taught my girl students to unlearn the lesson of obedience  i taught my boy students
 to unlearn the lesson of
  for women 
 and we were struggling to have more more and more space for the women in society  
 but we came across a new phenomenon  
 it was lethal to human rights and particularly to women 's rights  it was called talibanization
 a complete negation of women 's participation in all political  economical
 and social activities  hundreds of schools were lost  girls were
 prohibited from going to school 
 women were forced to wear veils and
  were stopped from going to the markets  musicians were silenced  girls were flogged
 and singers were killed  
 millions were suffering but few few spoke  and it was the most scary thing
 when you have all around
 such people
  kill and who flog  and you speak for your rights it 's really the most scary thing 
 at the age of ten malala
 stood and she stood for the right of education  
 she
 wrote a diary for the bbc blog  she volunteered herself for the new york times documentaries
 and she spoke from every platform she could 
 and her voice was the most powerful voice 
 it spread like a crescendo all around the world 
 and that was the reason the taliban could not tolerate
  two thousand and twelve  she was shot in the head at
 point blank range  it was a doomsday for my family and for me 
 the world turned into a big black hole  
 while my daughter was on the verge of life and death  i whispered into the ears of my wife
  should i be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter 
 and she abruptly told me please don 't blame yourself you stood
 for the right cause you put your life at stake for the cause of truth for the cause of
  and for the cause of education and your daughter in inspired from you and she joined you 
 you both were on the right path and god will protect her 
 these few words meant a lot to me  and i didn 't ask this question again 
 when malala was in the hospital  and she was going through the severe pains
 and she had had severe headaches because her facial
  nerve was cut down  i used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife  
 but my daughter never complained
 she used to tell us i 'm fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in my face i 'll be okay please don 't worry
 she was a solace for us  and she consoled us  
 dear
 brothers and sisters 
 we learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times  and i 'm glad to share with you
 that
 despite being an icon
 for the rights of children and women  she is like any 16 year old girl 
 she cries
 when her homework is incomplete  she quarrels with her brothers and i am very happy for that 
 people ask me what special is in my mentorship
 which has made malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised  
 i tell them don 't ask me
 what i did ask me what i did not do i did not clip
