  across europe and central asia  approximately one million children live in large residential institutions usually known as orphanages 
 most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children  others know more about the living conditions
  there but still think they 're a necessary evil after all  where else would we put all of those children who don 't have any parents  
 but sixty years of research has demonstrated that separating children from their families and placing them in large institutions seriously harms their health and development 
 and this is particularly true for young babies 
 as we know babies are born
 without their full muscle development 
 and that includes the brain  
 during the first three years of life the brain grows to its full size with most of that growth taking place in the first six months  
 the brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation 
 every time a young baby learns something new
  to focus its eyes to mimic a movement or a facial expression to pick something up 
 to form a word or to sit up new synaptic connections are being built in the brain 
 new parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning  they are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children 's cleverness  
 they communicate their delight to their children who respond with smiles
  desire to achieve more and to learn more 
 this forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical  social  language  cognitive and psychomotor development  
 it is the model for all future relationships with friends with partners and with their own children  
 it happens so naturally in most families that we don 't even notice it most of us are unaware of its importance to human
  and by extension to the development of a healthy society  and it 's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children 
 in august one thousand nine hundred and ninety three i had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale
 the impact on children of institutionalization and the absence of parenting those of us who remember the newspaper reports
  that came out of romania after the one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine revolution
 will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions i was asked to help the director of a large institution to
 help prevent the separation of children from their families housing five hundred and fifty babies this was ceausescu 's show orphanage and so i 'd been told the conditions were
  having worked with lots of young children i expected the institution to be a riot of noise  but it was as silent as a convent 
 it was hard to believe there were any children there at all  
 yet the director showed me into room after room each containing row upon row of cots 
 in each of which lay a child staring into space 
 in a room of forty newborns
  not one of them was crying  yet i could see soiled nappies and i could see that some of the children were distressed but the only noise was a low continuous moan  
 the head nurse told me proudly you see our children are very well behaved 
 over the next few days  i began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional  
 the newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours but their demands were not met and so eventually they learned not to bother  within a few days they were listless
 and staring into space like all the others  
 over the years many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children 
 but often one member of staff is caring for ten twenty and even forty children  hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program
  the children must be woken at seven and fed at seven thirty at eight their nappies must be changed so a staff member may have only thirty minutes to feed ten or twenty children  
 if a child soils its nappy at eight thirty  he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again 
 the child 's daily contact with another human being is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing  
 and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling  the walls
 or the bars of their cots
  since my first visit to ceausescu 's institution i 've seen hundreds of such places across eighteen countries from the czech republic to sudan 
 across all of these diverse lands and cultures the institutions and the child 's journey through them is depressingly similar  
 lack of stimulation often leads
  rocking back and forth or aggression 
 and in some institutions psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children  whilst in others children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others 
 these children are quickly labeled as having disabilities and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities most of these children will never leave the institution again
  for those without disabilities at age three they 're transferred to another institution and at age seven to yet another 
 segregated according to age and gender  they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings often without even a chance to say goodbye 
 there 's rarely enough to eat  they are often hungry  the older children bully the little ones  they learn to survive they learn to defend themselves or they go
  when they leave the institution  they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society 
 in moldova  young women raised in institutions are ten times more likely to be trafficked than their peers  
 and a russian study found that two years after leaving institutions young adults twenty percent of them
 had a criminal record fourteen percent were involved in prostitution and ten percent had taken their own lives
 but why are there so many orphans in europe
 when there hasn 't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years 
 in fact more than ninety five percent of these children have living parents 
 and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children but research shows that most parents want their children  and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty disability and
  ethnicity 
 many countries have not developed inclusive schools  
 and so even children with a very mild disability are sent away to a residential special school at age six or seven 
 the institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home if the family 's poor they find it difficult to visit and gradually the
  relationship breaks down 
 behind each of the million children in institutions 
 there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they 've run out of options 
 like natalia in moldova  who only had enough money to feed her baby  and so had to send her older son to the institution 
 or desi in bulgaria who looked after her four children at home until her
  but then she had to go out to work full time and with no support felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution 
 or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents they 're pregnant who leave their babies in a hospital
  or the new parents the young couple who have just found out that their firstborn child has a disability 
 and instead of being provided with positive messages about their child 's potential are told by the doctors
  her leave her in the institution go home and make a healthy one 
 this state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable 
 every child has the right to a family deserves and needs a family 
 and children are amazingly resilient 
 we find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving families early on they recover their developmental delays and go on to lead normal happy lives
 it 's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions 
 one study suggests that a family support service costs ten percent of an institutional placement  whilst good quality foster care
 costs usually about thirty percent 
 if we spend less on these children but on the right services we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality
 residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs 
 across europe a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care
 to community based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential  
 when i first started to work in romania nearly twenty years ago there were two
  hundred thousand children living in institutions and more entering every day  
 now there are less than ten thousand and family support services are provided across the country 
 in moldova  despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects of the global financial crisis the numbers of children in institutions has reduced by more than fifty percent in the last five years  
 and the resources are being redistributed to
  support services and inclusive schools  
 many countries have developed national action plans for change  the european commission and other major donors are finding ways to divert money from institutions towards 
  family support empowering communities to look after their own children 
  level of society people need to know the harm that institutions cause to children  and the better alternatives that exist 
 if we know people who are planning to support orphanages we should convince them to support family services instead 
 together  this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime  thank you
