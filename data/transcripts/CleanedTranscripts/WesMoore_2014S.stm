  i 'm excited to be here to speak about vets because i didn 't join the army because i wanted to go to war i didn 't join the army because i had a lust
 or a need to go overseas and fight  
  i joined the army because
 college is really damn expensive and they were going to help with that  and i joined the army
 because it was what i knew  and it was what i knew that i thought i could do well  
 i didn 't come from a military family i 'm not a military brat no one in my family ever had joined the military at all 
 and how i first got introduced to the military was when i was thirteen years old and i got sent
  because my mother had been threatening me with this idea of military school ever since i was eight years old i had some issues when i was coming up and
 my mother would always tell me she 's like you know if you don 't get this together i 'm going to send you to military school and i 'd look at her and i 'd say mommy i 'll work harder 
 and then when i was nine years old she started giving me brochures to show me she wasn 't playing around so i 'd look at the brochures and i 'm like okay mommy i can see you 're serious and i 'll
  and then when i was ten and eleven  my behavior just kept on getting worse 
 i was on academic and disciplinary probation before i hit double digits
  and i first felt handcuffs on my wrists when i was eleven years old 
 and so when i was thirteen years old my mother came up to me and she was like i 'm not going to do this anymore i 'm going
 to send you to military school and i looked at her and i said mommy  i can see you 're upset
 and that was how i first got introduced to this whole idea of the military because she thought this was a good idea 
 i had to disagree with her wholeheartedly when i first showed up there  
 because literally in the first four days i had already run away five times from this school they had these big black gates that surrounded the school and every time they would turn their backs i would
 simply run out of the black gates and take them up on their offer that if we don 't want to be there we can leave at any time  so i just said well if that 's the case then i 'd like to leave 
 laughter and it never worked  
 and i kept on getting lost
  but then eventually after staying there for a little while and after the end of that first year at this military school  i realized that
 i actually was growing up
  i realized the things that i enjoyed about
 this school and the thing that i enjoyed about the structure
 was something that i 'd never found before 
 the fact that i finally felt like i was part of something bigger  part of a team  and it actually mattered to people that i was there  
 the fact that leadership wasn 't just a punchline there but that it was a real actually core
 part of the entire experience and so when it was time for me to actually finish up high school
  thinking about what i wanted to do 
 and just like probably most students had no idea what that meant or what i wanted to do  and i thought about the people who i respected and admired  
 i thought about a lot of the people in particular a lot of the men in my life
 who i looked up to they all happened to wear the uniform of the united states of america  so for me the question and the answer really became pretty
  easy  the question of what i wanted to do was filled in very quickly with saying i guess i 'll be an army officer  
 so the army then went through this process and they trained me up 
 and when i say i didn 't join the army because i wanted to go to war  the truth is i joined in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six there really wasn 't a whole lot going on  
 i didn 't ever feel like i was in danger when i went to my mom i first joined the army when i was seventeen years old so i literally needed parental permission
 to join the army  so i kind of gave the paperwork to my mom and she just assumed it was kind of like military school she was like well it was good for him before so i guess i 'll just let him keep doing it 
 having no idea that the paperwork that she was signing
 was actually signing her son up
 to become an army officer  and i went through the process and again the whole time still just thinking this is great maybe i 'll
 serve on a weekend or two weeks during the year
 do drill  and then a couple years after
 i signed up a couple years after my mother signed those papers the whole world changed
  and after nine eleven  there was an entirely new context about the occupation that i chose 
 when i first joined i never joined to fight
 but now that i was in this is exactly what was now going to happen  
 and i thought about so much about the soldiers
 who i eventually had to end up leading i remember when when we first right after nine eleven three weeks after nine eleven i was on a plane heading overseas but i wasn 't heading overseas with the military i was heading overseas because i got a scholarship to go overseas i received
 the scholarship to go overseas and and to go study and live overseas
  and i was living in england and that was interesting but at the same time the same people who i was training with 
 the same soldiers that i went through all my training with and we prepared for war they were now actually heading over to it 
 they were now about to find themselves in the middle of places the fact is the vast majority of people the vast majority of us as we were training couldn 't even point out on a map
  i spent a couple years finishing graduate school and the whole entire time while i 'm sitting there in buildings at oxford that were that were literally built hundreds of years before the united states was even founded  and i 'm sitting there talking to dons
 about the assassination of archduke ferdinand  and how that influenced the start of
  the entire time my heart and my head were on my soldiers
 who were now throwing on  kevlars and grabbing their flak vests and figuring out how exactly do i change around or how exactly do i clean a machine gun in the darkness 
 that was the new reality  
 by the time i finished that up and i rejoined
 my military unit
 were getting ready to deploy to afghanistan there were soldiers in my unit who were now on their second and third deployments before i even had my first i remember walking out with my unit for the first time and when you join the army
  and you go through a combat tour everyone looks at your shoulder because on your shoulder is your combat patch  
  stared at it 
 but you get a chance to talk to your soldiers and you ask them why did they sign up 
 i signed up because college was expensive 
 a lot of my soldiers signed up for completely different reasons  
 they signed up because of a sense of obligation they signed up because they were angry and they wanted to do something about it they signed up because their
 their family said this was important they signed up because they wanted some form of revenge  they signed for a whole collection of different reasons  
 and now we all found ourselves overseas fighting in these conflicts 
 and what was amazing to me was that i very naively started hearing this statement that i never fully understood
  because right after nine eleven you start hearing this idea where people come up to you and they say well thank you for your service 
 and i just kind of followed in and started saying the same things to all my soldiers this is even before i deployed  but i really had no idea what that even meant 
 i just said it because it sounded right i said it because it sounded like the right thing to say to people who had served
  thank you for your service but i had no idea what the context was or what that even what it even meant to the people who heard it 
 when i first came back from afghanistan  
 i thought that if you make it back from conflict then the dangers were all over  
 i thought that if you made it back from a conflict zone that somehow you could kind of wipe the sweat off your brow and say whew i 'm glad i dodged that
 without understanding that for so many people as they come back home  
 the war keeps going it keeps playing out in all of our minds it plays out in all of our memories 
 it plays out in all of our emotions  
 please forgive us
 if we don 't like being in big crowds
  forgive us
 when we spend one week
 in a place that has one hundred percent light discipline  
 because you 're not allowed to walk around with white lights because if anything has a white light it can be seen from miles away versus if you use little green or little blue lights they cannot be seen from far away 
 so please forgive us if out of nowhere we go from having one hundred percent light discipline
  we have a difficult time adjusting to that 
 please forgive us
 when you transition back to a family who has completely been maneuvering without you 
 and now when you come back it 's not that easy to fall back into a sense of normality  because the whole normal has
  sometimes there 's this fear and there 's this apprehension that if i say anything i 'm afraid i 'll offend or i 'm afraid i 'll trigger something so the common default is just saying nothing  
 the problem with that
 is then it feels like your service was not even acknowledged like no one even cared 
 thank you for your service and we move on
 what i wanted to better understand
 was what 's behind that and why thank you for your service  isn 't enough 
 the fact is we have
 literally two point six million men and women who are veterans of iraq or afghanistan who are all amongst us
  sometimes we know who they are sometimes we don 't 
 but there is that feeling the shared experience the shared bond
 where we know that that experience and that chapter of our life  while it might be closed 
 it 's still not over 
 we think about thank you for your service and people say so what does ' thank you for your service ' mean to you well thank you for your service
  me it means acknowledging our stories 
 asking us who we are 
 understanding the strength
 that so many people so many people who we serve with have and why that service means so much 
 thank you for your service means acknowledging the fact
  that just because we 've now come home and we 've taken off the uniform does not mean our larger service to this country is somehow over 
 the fact is there 's still a tremendous amount
 that can be offered and can be given 
 when i look at people like our friend taylor urruela 
 who in iraq loses his leg had two big dreams in his life one was to be a soldier the other was to be a baseball player he loses his leg
  in iraq 
 he comes back
 and instead of deciding that that well now since i 've lost my leg that second dream is over he decides that he still has that dream of playing baseball and he starts this group called vetsports which now works with veterans all 
 over the country and uses sports as a way of healing 
 people like tammy duckworth who was a helicopter pilot and with
  helicopter that she was flying you need to use both your hands and also your legs to steer and her helicopter gets hit  and she 's trying to steer the chopper but the chopper 's not reacting to her instructions and to her 
  commands she 's trying to land the chopper safely  but the chopper doesn 't land safely and the reason it 's not landing safely is because it 's not responding to the commands that her legs are giving because her legs were blown off 
 she barely survives
 medics come and they save her life  
 but then as she 's doing her recuperation back at home  she realizes that my job 's still not done 
 and now she uses her voice as a congresswoman from illinois
 to fight and advocate
 for a collection of issues to include veterans issues 
 we signed up because
  we love this country we represent 
 we signed up because we believe in the idea and we believe in the people to our left and to our right 
 and the only thing we then ask is that thank you for your service  needs to be more than just a quote break that 
  thank you for your service means honestly digging in
 to the people
 who have stepped up simply because they were asked to 
 and what that means for us not just now not just during combat operations but long after the last the last
 vehicle has left and after the last shot has been taken 
 these are the people who i served with and these are the people who i honor  so thank you for your service
