  to be honest by personality i 'm just not much of a crier  
 but i think in my career that 's been a good thing i 'm a civil rights lawyer and
 i 've seen some horrible things in the world  i began my career working police abuse cases in the united states and then
 in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four i was sent to rwanda to be the director of the u n ' s genocide investigation  
 it turns out that
 tears just aren 't much help when you 're trying to investigate a genocide the things i had to
 see and feel and touch
 were pretty
  unspeakable what i can tell you is this that the rwandan genocide was
 one of the world 's greatest failures of simple compassion  that word compassion actually comes from two latin words
  i saw and experienced in rwanda as i got up close to human suffering it did  in moments move me to tears  
 but i just wish that i and the rest of the world had been moved earlier  
 and not just to tears but to actually stop the genocide now by contrast
 i 've also been involved with one of the world 's greatest successes
 of compassion  
 and that 's the fight against global poverty  it 's a cause that probably has involved all of us here 
 i don 't know if your first introduction might have been choruses of we are the world or
 maybe the picture of a sponsored child on your refrigerator door  or maybe the birthday you donated for fresh water
  i don 't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was but i do remember the most jarring it was when i met venus
 she 's a mom from zambia she 's got three kids and she 's a widow when i met her she had walked
 about twelve miles in the only garments she owned to come to the capital city and to share her
  she sat down with me for hours just ushered me in to the world of poverty  
 she described what it was like when the coals on the cooking fire
 finally just went completely cold when that last drop of cooking oil finally ran out 
 when the last of the food  despite her best efforts
  she had to watch her youngest son peter suffer from malnutrition 
 as his legs just slowly bowed into uselessness as his eyes grew cloudy and dim  and then as peter
 finally grew cold 
 for over fifty years stories like this have been moving us to compassion  we whose kids have plenty
  to eat 
 and we 're moved not only to care about global poverty but to actually try to do our part to stop the suffering now
 there 's plenty of room for critique that we haven 't done enough  and what it is that we 've done hasn 't been effective enough  
 but the truth is this 
 the fight against global poverty is probably the broadest longest running manifestation
 of the human phenomenon of compassion
 in the history of our species  and so i 'd like to share
 a pretty shattering insight that might forever change the way you think about that struggle but first let me begin with what you probably already know
 thirty five years ago when i would have been graduating from high
  they told us that forty thousand kids every day died because of poverty 
 that number today is now down to seventeen thousand 
 way too many of course  but it does mean that every year 
 there 's eight million kids who don 't have to die from poverty  
 moreover the number of people in our world who are living in extreme poverty which is defined as living off about a dollar and a quarter a day that has
  fallen from
 fifty percent to only fifteen percent  
 this is massive progress and this exceeds everybody 's expectations
 about what is possible and i think you and i i think honestly that we can
 we can feel proud and encouraged to see the way that compassion actually has the power
 to succeed in stopping the suffering of millions  but here 's the part
 that you might not hear very much about 
 if you move that poverty mark just up to two dollars a day  
 it turns out that virtually the same two billion people who were stuck in that harsh poverty when i was in high school  are still stuck there
  so why why are so many billions still stuck in such harsh poverty  
 well let 's think about venus for a moment now for decades my wife and i have been moved by common compassion to
 sponsor kids to fund microloans to support generous levels of foreign aid but until i had actually talked to venus 
 i would have had no idea that none of those approaches
 actually addressed why she had to watch her son die 
 we were doing fine 
 venus told me until brutus started to cause trouble 
 now brutus is venus ' neighbor and cause trouble is what happened the day after
  husband died 
 when brutus just came and threw venus and the kids out of the house stole all their land  and robbed their market stall 
 you see  venus was thrown into destitution by violence  
 and then it occurred to me of course that none of my child sponsorships  none of the microloans  none of the traditional
  were going to stop brutus because they weren 't meant to 
 this became even more clear to me when i met griselda 
 she 's a
 a marvelous young girl living in a very poor community in guatemala  and one of the things we 've learned over the years is that perhaps the most powerful thing
  that griselda and her family can do
 to get griselda and her family out of poverty is to make sure that she goes to school  the experts call this
 the girl effect  
 but when we met griselda she wasn 't going to school in fact
 she was rarely ever leaving her home 
 days before we met her while she was walking home from church with her family in broad daylight
  men from her community just snatched her off the street and violently raped her 
 see griselda had every opportunity to go to school
 it just wasn 't safe for her to get there 
 and griselda 's not the only one around the world poor women and girls between the ages of fifteen and
  they are when victims of
 the everyday violence of domestic abuse
 and sexual violence those two forms of violence account for more death and disability
 than malaria than car accidents than war combined
  the poor of our world are trapped in whole systems of violence in south asia for instance i could drive past this rice mill
 and see this man hoisting these 100 pound sacks of rice upon his thin back  
 but i would have no idea until later that he was actually a slave held by violence in that rice mill since i was in high school
  programs right in his community were never able to rescue him or any of the hundred other slaves from the
 beatings and the rapes and the torture of violence inside the rice mill  
 in fact half a century of anti poverty programs
 have left more poor people in slavery than in any other time in human history  experts tell us that there 's about
  million people in slavery today  that 's about the population of the entire nation of canada where we 're sitting today  
 this is why over time i have come to call this epidemic of violence the locust effect  
 because in the lives of the poor it just descends like a plague and it
  in fact now when you survey very very poor communities  residents will tell you that their greatest fear
 is violence  but notice the violence that they fear
 is not the violence of genocide or the wars  it 's everyday violence  
 so for me as a lawyer of course my first reaction was to think well of course we 've got to change all the laws  we 've got to make all this violence against the poor illegal  
 but then i found out  it already
  is the problem is not that the poor don 't get 
  that they don 't get law enforcement 
 in the developing world basic law enforcement systems are so broken that recently the u n issued a report that found that most poor people live outside
  now honestly you and i have
 just about no idea of what that would mean because we have no first hand experience of it 
 functioning law enforcement for us is just a total assumption  in fact nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers
 which of course is the number for the emergency police operator here in canada and in the united states  where the average response time to a police nine
  emergency call is about ten minutes  so we take this just completely for granted but what if there was no law enforcement
 to protect you 
 a woman in oregon recently experienced what this would be like she was home alone in her dark house on a saturday night 
 when a man started to tear his way into her home 
 this was her worst
  nightmare because
 this man had actually put her in the hospital from an assault just two weeks before  
 so terrified she picks up that phone and does what any of us would do she calls nine hundred and eleven but only to learn that because of budget cuts
 in her county law enforcement wasn 't available
  can you ask him to go away
  call the sheriff 's office tomorrow obviously if he comes in and unfortunately
  choked and raped because this is what it means to live outside the rule of law  
 and this is where billions of our poorest live 
 what does that look like in bolivia for example if a man sexually assaults a poor child statistically
  he 's at greater risk of slipping in the shower and dying than he is of ever going to jail for that crime  
 in south asia 
 if you enslave a poor person you 're at greater risk of being struck by lightning than ever being sent to jail for that crime  
 and so the epidemic of everyday violence it just rages on and it devastates our
  efforts to try to help billions of people out of their 
 hell 
 because the data just doesn 't lie  
 it turns out that you can give all manner of goods and services to the poor 
 but if you don 't restrain the hands of the violent bullies from taking it all away you 're going to be very disappointed in the long term
  impact of your efforts  
 so you would think that the disintegration of basic law enforcement in the developing world would be a huge priority for the global fight against poverty  
 but it 's not 
 auditors of international assistance recently couldn 't find even one percent of aid
 going to protect the poor from the lawless chaos of everyday violence
 and honestly when we do talk about
  violence against the poor sometimes it 's in the weirdest of ways 
 a fresh water organization tells a heart wrenching story of girls who are raped on the way to fetching water  and then celebrates the
 solution of a new well that drastically shortens their walk end of story  
 but not a word about the rapists who are still
  right there in the community 
 if a young woman on one of our college campuses was raped on her walk to the library 
 we would never celebrate the solution of moving the library closer to the dorm 
 and yet for some reason this is okay for poor people 
 now the truth is the traditional experts in economic development and poverty
  alleviation they don 't know how to fix this problem and so what happens  they don 't talk about it 
 but the more fundamental
 reason that law enforcement for the poor in the developing world is so neglected is because the people inside the developing world with
  need it 
 i was at the world economic forum not long ago talking to corporate executives who have massive businesses in the developing world
 and i was just asking them how do you guys protect all your people and property from all the violence 
 and they looked at each other and they said practically in unison we buy it
  private security forces in the developing world
 are now four five and seven times larger than the public police force  
 in africa  the largest employer on the continent now
 is private security  but see the rich can pay for safety and can keep getting richer but the
  left totally unprotected and they keep getting thrown to the ground  this is a
 a massive and scandalous outrage and it doesn 't have to be this way 
 broken law enforcement can be fixed 
 violence can be stopped almost all criminal justice systems they start out broken and corrupt but they can be
  transformed by fierce effort and commitment  the path forward is really pretty clear number one  we have to start making
 stopping violence indispensable to the fight against poverty  in fact any conversation about global poverty that doesn 't include the problem of violence must be deemed not serious  
 and secondly we have to
 begin to seriously invest resources and share expertise to support the developing world as they
 new public systems of justice not private security that give everybody a chance to be safe 
 these transformations are actually possible and they 're happening today  
 recently the gates foundation funded a project in the second largest city of the philippines 
 where local advocates and local law enforcement were able to transform
  corrupt police and broken courts so drastically 
 that in just four short years they were able to measurably reduce the commercial sexual violence against poor kids
 by seventy nine percent 
 you know from the hindsight of history what 's always most inexplicable and inexcusable
  are the simple failures of compassion 
 because i think history convenes a tribunal of our grandchildren
 and they just ask us grandma grandpa  where were you  
 where were you grandpa when the jews were fleeing nazi germany and were being
  where were you and grandma where were you when they were marching our 
  neighbors off to internment camps  and grandpa where were you when they were beating our african american neighbors just because they were trying to register to vote 
 likewise 
 when our grandchildren ask us grandma grandpa  
 where were you when two billion of the world 's poorest were drowning in a lawless chaos
  of everyday violence 
 i hope we can say
 that we had compassion  
 that we raised our voice  
 and as a generation  we were moved to make the violence stop  
 thank you very
  really powerfully argued talk to us a bit about some of the things that have actually been happening to for example  boost
 police training how hard a process is that
  well one of the glorious things that 's starting to happen now is that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious  there 's actually now political will to do that 
 but it just requires now an investment of resources and transfer of expertise there 's a political will struggle that 's going to take place as well but those are winnable fights because we 've done some examples around the world at international justice mission that
  encouraging ca so just tell us in one country  how much it costs to make a material difference to
 police for example i know that 's only one piece of it gh 
 in guatemala for instance we 've started a project there with the local police and court system prosecutors to retrain them so that they can actually effectively bring these cases and we 've seen prosecutions
 against perpetrators of sexual violence increase by
  than one thousand percent this project has been very modestly funded at about a million dollars a year  and the kind of bang you can get for your buck in terms of
 leveraging a criminal justice system that could function if it were properly trained and motivated and led and these countries especially a middle class
  is seeing that there 's really no future with this total instability and total privatization of security i think there 's an opportunity a window for change ca 
 but to make this happen you have to look at each part in the chain the the police who else gh so that 's the thing about law enforcement it starts out with the police they 're the front end of the pipeline of justice but they hand if off to the prosecutors
  and the prosecutors hand it off to the courts  and the survivors of violence have to be supported by social services all the way through that so you have to do an approach that pulls that all together in the past 
 there 's been a little bit of training of the courts  but they get crappy evidence from the police or a little police intervention that has to do with narcotics or terrorism but nothing to do with treating the common poor person with excellent law enforcement  so it 's about pulling that
  and you can actually have people in very poor communities experience law enforcement like us  which is imperfect in our own experience for sure but boy is it a great thing to sense that you can call nine hundred and eleven and maybe someone will
 will protect you ca gary i think you 've done a spectacular job of bringing this to the world 's attention in your book and right here today  thanks so much  gary haugen
