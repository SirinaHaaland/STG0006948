  being a child and sort of crawling around the house i remember these turkish carpets
  and there were these scenes these battle scenes these love scenes
  i mean look this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this from this soldier and
 my mom took these pictures actually
  last week of our carpets and i remember this to this day there was another object this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity
 pretty scary stuff when you 're a little kid what i remember today from this is that
 objects tell stories so storytelling
 has been a really strong influence in my work and then there was
  influence i was a teenager and at fifteen or sixteen i guess like all teenagers we want to just do what we love and what we believe in and so 
  i fused together the two things i loved the most which was skiing and windsurfing those are pretty good escapes from the the drab weather in
  in switzerland  so
 created this compilation of the two i took my skis and i took a board and i put a mast foot in there and
 some foot straps and some metal fins  and here i was going really fast on frozen lakes
 it was really a death trap i mean it was incredible it worked incredibly well but it was really dangerous  and i realized then i had to go to design school
 laughter so i went to design school  and
 it was the early ' 90s when i finished and i saw something extraordinary happening in silicon valley so i wanted to be there and i saw that the computer was coming into our homes 
 that it had to change in order to to
 be with us
  in our homes  and
 so i got myself a job and i was working for a consultancy and we would get in to these meetings and these managers would come in
  and they would say well what we 're going to do here is really important you know and they would give the projects code names you
 know mostly from star wars actually 
 things like 
  yoda luke 
  in anticipation i would be this young designer in the back of the room and i would raise my hand and i would ask questions  i mean in retrospect probably stupid questions 
 but things like 
 what 's this caps lock key for
  't really want to change the legacy stuff they didn 't want to change the insides they were really looking for us the designers to create the skins
  to put some some pretty stuff outside of the of the box  and i didn 't want to be a
  what i wanted to do i didn 't want to be a stylist in this way  and then i saw this quote advertising is the price
 companies pay for being unoriginal 
 so i had to start on my own so i moved to san francisco and i
 started a little company fuseproject and what i wanted to work on is important stuff  and i wanted to
  not just work on the skins but i wanted to work on the entire human experience  and
 so the first projects were sort of humble but they took technology and maybe made it into into things that people
 would would use in a new way and maybe finding some new functionality  this is a watch we made for mini cooper  
 the car company right when it launched  and it 's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical
  and that allows me to check my timer discretely here without bending my elbow and other projects which were really about transformation about
 matching the human need this is a little piece of furniture for an italian manufacturer and it ships completely flat  and then it folds into
 a coffee table and a stool and whatnot and something a little bit more experimental  this is a
  light fixture for swarovski and what it does is it changes shape so it goes from a circle to a round to a square to a figure eight 
 and just by drawing on a little
 computer tablet the entire light fixture adjusts to what what shape you want  
 and then finally the leaf lamp for herman miller  this is a pretty involved process it took us about four and a half years but i really was looking for creating
 a unique experience of light a new experience of light  so we had to design both
 the light
 and the light bulb and that that 's a unique opportunity i would say in design and the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from
 a warm sort of glowing kind of mood light all the way to a bright work light so the light
  bulb actually does that it allows the person to switch and to mix these two colorations and it 's done in a very simple way one just touches the base 
 of the light and on one side you can mix the brightness  and on the other the
  and i think as designers we need to really think about how
 we can create a different relationship between our work and the world
 whether it 's for business or as i 'm going to show on some civic type projects because i think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value
 value to business  value to
  but i think it 's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater
 the greater value and the values we bring can be
 about environmental issues about sustainability about lower power consumption you
 know they can be about function and beauty  they can be about business strategy but designers are really the glue
  is a project that you 're familiar with  and
 it has a humanistic technology  it feels your skin  it rests on your skin and it knows when it is you 're talking  and
 by knowing when it is you 're talking it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about which is the the environmental noises 
 but the other thing that is humanistic about jawbone is that we really decided to
 take out all the
  techie stuff  and all the nerdy stuff out of it and try to make it as beautiful as as we can i mean think about it the care we take in
 selecting sunglasses or jewelry  or accessories is is really
 important so if it isn 't beautiful it really doesn 't belong on your face  and
 this is what we 're pursuing here  but how
  we work
 on jawbone is really unique 
 i want to point at something here on the left 
 this is the board this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work  but this is the design process there 's somebody changing the board  putting tracers on the board 
 changing the location of the ics as the designers on the other side are doing the work so it 's not about slapping skins  anymore on a technology
 it 's really about designing from the inside out and then on the other side of the room  the designers are making small adjustments sketching drawing by hand
  putting it in the computer  and
 it 's what i call being design driven you know there is some push and pull but design is really
 helping define the whole experience from the inside out and then of course  design is never done
  done  and this is the other new way that is unique in how we work is because it 's never done you have to do  all this other stuff the packaging and the website and you need to continue to really touch
 the user in many ways  but how do you retain somebody when it 's never done
  really understands that
 you need a different structure so in a way  the different structure is that we 're partners it 's a partnership
 we can continue to work and and dedicate ourselves to this project  and then we also share in the rewards  and here 's another
  this is called y water  and it 's this guy from
 from los angeles thomas arndt  austrian originally  who came to us  and all he wanted to do was to create
 a healthy drink or an organic drink
 for his kids to replace the 
  sodas that he 's trying to get them away from 
  we worked on this bottle and it 's completely symmetrical in every dimension  and this allows the bottle to turn into
 a game the bottles connect together and you can create different shapes 
 different forms thank you 
 and then while we were doing this 
 the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a y  and then we thought well
  words why and why not are probably the most important words that kids ask so we called it y water  
 and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room the three dimensional design
  the ideas  the branding it all becomes deeply connected  and then the other thing about this project is
  intellectual property  we bring a marketing approach we bring all this stuff but i think at the end of the day what we bring is these values and these values create a soul for the companies we work with  
 and it 's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor when others can be creative and do more with it 
 here 's another project which i think really
  is incredible in nigeria people carry their most precious belongings on their heads this girl is going to school with a laptop on her head i mean to me 
 it just means so much
  but when nicholas negroponte and he has spoken about this project
  about two and a half years ago  there were some clear ideas  he wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology and those are pillars of his life but also pillars of the mission of of
 one laptop per child  but the the third pillar that he that he talked
  wasn 't really working on computers i didn 't really want to from the previous adventure but what he said was was really significant is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product how we were going to make it low cost robust
  and
 plus he said he was going to get rid of the caps lock key and
 the num lock key
 we designed it to be iconic to look different to look like it 's for a kid but not like a toy  
 and then the integration of all these great technologies which you 've heard about the wi fi antennas that allow the kids to connect 
 the screen which you can read in sunlight 
 the keyboard
 which is made out of rubber and it 's protected from the environment you know all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and
 the olpc people and the engineers they fought the suppliers they fought
  projects like this one
 allows the process from not destroying the original idea  and i think this is something really important  
 so  now you get these pictures you get up in the morning and you see the kids in nigeria and you see them in uruguay
 with their computers and in mongolia
  and we went away from obviously the beige i mean it 's colorful it 's fun in fact you can see each logo is is a little bit different 
 it 's because we were able
 to to run during the manufacturing process twenty colors for the x and the o which is the name of the
 computer  and by mixing them on on the manufacturing floor you get twenty times twenty you get four hundred different
  there so the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible  but this is my nephew anthony in switzerland 
 and he had the laptop for for an afternoon and i had to take it back it was hard 
 and it was a prototype and a month and a half later i come back to switzerland  and there he is playing playing with his own version
 like paper paper and cardboard so i 'm
 going to finish with one one last project and this is a little bit more of adult play 
 some of you might have heard about the new york city condom  it 's
  actually launched on valentine 's day february fourteen  about ten days ago  so  the department of health
 in new york came to us  and they needed a way to
 distribute thirty six million condoms for free to the citizens of new york so a pretty big endeavor  
 and
  you have to know where it is
 and what it does and we also designed the condoms themselves  and i was just in new york at the launch
  and i went to see all these places where they 're installed this is at a puerto rican
 little mom and pop store  at a bar in christopher street at a pool hall
  i mean they 're being installed in homeless clinics everywhere of course  clubs and discos 
 too and here 's the public service announcement for this project
  this is really where design is able to create a conversation
  it was breaking the ice  it was getting over a stigma and i think that 's also what design can do 
 so i was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot  but i 'm not sure it 's the
  i have more you can always ask me for for some some more later 
 and if anybody asks why you 're carrying a condom you can just say you like the design
  the companies we work with  and it 's
