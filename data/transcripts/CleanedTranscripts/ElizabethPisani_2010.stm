  stupid things that 's what spreads hiv 
 this was a headline in a u k newspaper the guardian not that long ago  i 'm curious show of hands who agrees with it well 
  one or two brave souls 
 this is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who 's been in field of hiv for fifteen years worked on four continents and you 're looking at her 
 and i am now going to argue that this is only half true 
 people do get hiv because they do stupid things  but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons now rational
  is the dominant paradigm in public health  and if you put your public health nerd glasses on you
 'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what 's good for them and what 's bad for them if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information and a little bit of motivation 
 people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives  wonderful that 's
  poverty and gender inequality and if you were at ted ' seven it 's about coffee prices 
 actually hiv 's about sex and drugs  and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational they are erections and addiction laughter
 so 
 let 's start with what 's
  i remember speaking to an indonesian friend of mine frankie we were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail
 in bali for a drug injection
 it was someone 's birthday and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail  and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his
 colleagues and so everyone lined up all the smackheads in a row  and the guy whose
 whose birthday it was was filled up the fit and he went down and started injecting people
  he injects the first guy and then he 's wiping
 the needle on his his shirt and he injects the next guy  and frankie says  i 'm number twenty two in line 
 and i can see the needle coming down towards me and there is blood all over the place it 's getting blunter and blunter and a small part of my brain is thinking
  my brain is thinking ' please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me  please let there be some left '
 and then telling me this story frankie said you know god 
 drugs really make you stupid and you know you can 't fault him for accuracy
  at that time was a heroin addict and he was in jail so his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high  and if there 's one place you really want to get high it 's when you 're in jail  
 but i 'm a scientist and i don 't like to make data out of anecdotes so let 's look at some data
  we talked to six hundred drug addicts in three cities in
  nearly one hundred percent yeah by sharing needles 
 and do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that oh yeah hundred percent we 're smackheads we know where to get clean needles 
 so are you carrying a needle we 're actually interviewing people on the street in the places where they 're hanging out and taking drugs are you carrying clean needles 
 one in four
  so no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in ten and the other 
 nine in ten are sharing so you 've got this massive mismatch everyone knows that if they share they 're going to get hiv but they 're all sharing anyway  
  want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you 're sleeping with there 's just kind of an ick factor there no 
 we share needles because we don 't want to go to jail 
 so in indonesia at this time 
 if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up they could put you into jail and that changes the equation slightly doesn 't it because
 your choice now is either i use my own needle now
 or i could i could share a needle now and and get a disease that 's going to possibly kill me ten years from now  or i could use my own needle now and
 go to jail tomorrow  
 and while junkies think that it 's a really bad idea to expose themselves to hiv  they think it 's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they 'll probably end up in frankie 's situation and expose themselves to hiv
 anyway  so suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles  
 now let 's look at it from a policy maker 's point of view this is a really easy problem for once your incentives are aligned we 've got what 's rational for public health 
 you want people to use clean needles and junkies want to use clean needles  so we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of
  arrest now the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well known bleeding heart liberal margaret thatcher
 and she put in the world 's first national needle exchange program  and other countries followed suit australia the netherlands and few others and in all of those countries you can see not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with hiv
  't do this new york city for example  moscow jakarta we 're talking at its peak one in two injectors infected 
  with this fatal disease now  margaret thatcher didn 't do this because she has any great love for junkies she did it because she ran a country that had a national health service so if she didn 't invest in effective prevention
  she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on and obviously those are much higher so she was making a politically rational decision  
 now  if i take out my public health nerd glasses here
 and and look at these data  it seems like a 
  where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens we 've taken a very different approach
 so what we 've been doing in the united states is reviewing the data endlessly reviewing the data  so these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big
 muckety mucks of the scientific pantheon in the united states and these are the studies that show needle programs are
  effective quite a lot of them now the ones that show that needle programs aren 't effective you think that 's one of these annoying dynamic slides and i 'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it 's going to come up but no that 's the whole slide 
 there is nothing on the other side  
 so  completely irrational you would think  except that wait a minute politicians
  and they 're responding to what they think the voters want  so what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this
 and not quite so well to things like this 
 so it becomes quite rational to to deny services to injectors now let 's talk about
  are we any more rational about sex well i 'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the catholic church who think somehow that if you give out condoms
 everyone 's going to run out and have sex i don 't know if pope benedict watches tedtalks online but if you do i 've got news for you benedict
 i carry
  hiv is actually not that easy to transmit sexually  so it depends on how much virus
  there is in your blood and in your body fluids  and what we 've got is a very very high level of virus right at the beginning when you 're first infected then you start making antibodies  and then it bumps along 
  at quite low levels for a long time ten or twelve years you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection but basically nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic aids 
  and by that stage you 're not looking great you 're not feeling great you 're not having that much sex  
  by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia  now  this makes people crazy
 because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups and that 's considered stigmatizing
 i 've always been a bit curious about that because i think stigma is a bad thing whereas lots of sex is
 quite a good thing but
 we 'll leave that be 
 the truth is that twenty years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time 
 and those groups are globally people who sell sex and their more regular partners they are gay men on the party scene who have on average three times more partners than straight
 people on the party scene and they
  are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy  and almost all of those countries are in east or southern 
 africa  and that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today  you can see these horrifying figures from africa these are all countries in southern africa where between one
  the rest of the world we 've got basically nothing going on in the general population very very low levels
 but we have extraordinarily high levels of hiv in these other populations who are at highest risk drug injectors sex workers and gay men and you 'll note that 's the local
  percent prevalence among gay men of course you can 't get hiv just by having unprotected sex  you can only hiv by having unprotected sex with a
 positive person 
 in most of the world these few prevention failures notwithstanding  we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex 
  condom use rates are between eighty and one hundred percent in commercial sex in most countries and again
  because of an alignment of the incentives what 's rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it 's really bad for business to have another sti
 no one wants it and actually clients don 't want to go home with a drip either so essentially you 're able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex  but in intimate relations it 's much more difficult because with your wife or
  your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things 
 we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy  and nothing is quite so unromantic as the my condom or yours darling question so
 in the face of that you really need quite a strong incentive
  gentleman is called joseph he 's from haiti and he has aids 
 and he 's probably not having a lot of sex right now  but he is a reminder in the population of why you might want to be using
 condoms  this is also in haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex perhaps
  now  funnily enough this is also joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment
 not for nothing do we call it the lazarus effect 
 but it is changing the equation of what 's rational in sexual
 so 
 what we 've got some people say oh it doesn 't matter very much because actually treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit hiv
  if you look at the viremia thing again  if you do start treatment when you 're sick well what happens your viral load comes down 
 but compared to what what happens if you 're not on treatment 
 well  you die so your viral load goes to zero 
 and all of this green stuff here including the spikes which are because you couldn 't get to the pharmacy or you ran out of drugs or you went on a three day party binge and
  forgot to take your drugs or because you 've started to get
 resistance or whatever all of that is virus that wouldn 't be out there except for treatment now am i saying oh well great prevention strategy 
 let 's just stop treating people of course not of course not we need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can but what i am doing is calling into question those people who say
  we need that 's simply
 not necessarily true and i think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on fifteen years now and what we 've seen 
 is that actually condom use rates which were very very high the gay community responded very rapidly to hiv
  extremely little help from public health nerds i would say
 that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really one is the assumption of oh well if he 's infected he 's probably on meds and his viral load 's going to be low so i 'm pretty safe 
 and the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of hiv as they were of aids  and rightly so  aids was a disfiguring disease that killed you and hiv is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day
 and that 's boring  
 but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex no matter how drunk you are no matter how many poppers you 've taken  whatever 
 if we look at the data we can see that the answer to that question is 
 mmm so these are data from scotland
 you see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program then it came
  way down and both in heterosexuals mostly in commercial sex and in drug users you 've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins  and that 's because of that alignment of incentives that i talked about earlier  
 but in gay men you 've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available this is of new infections what does that mean it means that the combined
  effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population more people living longer healthier lives more likely to be getting laid with hiv is outweighing the effects of lower viral load 
 and that 's a very worrisome thing  what does it mean it means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have is that what 's happening no and i call it the
  compassion conundrum we 've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days and what 's happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good 
 sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers  unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies  
  to condone to being aids victims we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives  it doesn 't make any sense from a public health point of view 
 i want to give what 's very nearly the last word to ines  ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of jakarta she 's a chick with a dick
  why does she do that job well of course 
 because she 's forced into it because she doesn 't have any better option etc etc and if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a
  factory all would be well  
 this is what factory workers earn in an hour in indonesia on average twenty cents it varies a bit province to province i do speak to sex workers fifteen thousand of them for this particular slide
  and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour  so it 's not a great job but for a lot of people it really is
  when you get to politics
  nothing makes sense so from the point of view of a sex worker  politicians are making no sense from the point of view of a public health nerd junkies are doing dumb things 
 the truth is that everyone has a different rationale there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet  and that 's one of the glories of
  those ways of being rational are not independent of one another so it 's rational for
 a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that 's made by a politician and it 's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision
 because they 're responding to what they think the voters want  
 but here 's the thing  we are the voters we 're not all of them of course but ted is a community of opinion leaders and everyone who 's in this
  room  and everyone who 's watching this out there on the web i think has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence
 and on common sense  it 's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what 's rational for every frankie and every ines out there 
 but you can at least use your vote
 to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread hiv
  thank you
