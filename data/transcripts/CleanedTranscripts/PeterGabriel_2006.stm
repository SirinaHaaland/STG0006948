  i love trees  and i 'm very lucky because we live near a wonderful arboretum  and
 sundays  usually i 'd go there with my wife and now with my four year old and we 'd climb in the trees we 'd play hide
  the second school i was at
 had big trees too had a fantastic tulip tree i think it was the biggest in the country  
 and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it around the playing fields 
 one day i was
 grabbed by some of my classmates and taken in the bushes i was stripped i was attacked i was abused  and this came
  the reason i say that because afterwards i was thinking well i went back into the school
 i felt dirty i felt betrayed  i felt ashamed
  but mainly mainly i felt powerless  
 and thirty years later i was sitting in an airplane next to a lady called veronica who came from
  and we were on a human rights tour  and she was starting to tell me
 what it was like to be tortured and from my very privileged position this was the only reference point that i had
  and
 it was an amazing learning experience because for me human rights have been something in which i had you know a part time interest but mainly it was something that happened to other people
  as you know he 's a great singer  but he 's a magnificent hustler and a
 very hard guy to say no to and
 he was saying you know just after i 'd done the biko song we 're going to do a tour for amnesty you have to be on it and really that was the
  that i 'd been out and started meeting people
 who 'd watched their family being shot in front of them who 'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean and suddenly
 this world of human rights
 arrived in my world  and i couldn 't really walk away in quite the same way as before so i got
 involved with this tour which was for
  i took over bono 's job
 trying to learn how to hustle i didn 't do it as well but
 we managed to get youssou n 'dour sting tracy chapman and bruce springsteen
 to go ' round the world for amnesty and it was an amazing experience and once again i got
 an extraordinary education  and it was the first time really that i 'd met a lot of these people in the different countries  and
 these human rights stories became
  became very physical and  again i couldn 't really
 walk away
 quite so comfortably  but the thing that really amazed me that i had no idea was that you could suffer in this way
 and then have your whole experience your story  denied 
  and it seemed that whenever there was a camera around or a video or film camera it was a great deal harder to do
 for those in power
 to bury the story and reebok set up a foundation after these human rights now tours and
  and
  there was a decision then
 well we made a proposal for a couple of years about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists
 it didn 't really get anywhere  and then the rodney king incident happened and people thought ok if you have a camera in the right place at the right time or perhaps the wrong time  
 depending who you are
  then you can actually
 start doing
 doing something and campaigning and being heard
  and telling people about what 's going on so witness was started in ' ninety two and it 's since given
 cameras out in over sixty countries  and we campaign with activist groups
 and help them tell their story and in fact  i will show you in a moment
 one of the most recent campaigns and i 'm afraid it
 's a story from
 uganda  and although we had a wonderful story from uganda yesterday this one isn 't quite so good in the north of uganda 
 there are something like one point five million
 internally displaced people people who
 are not refugees in another country but because of the civil war which has been going on for about twenty years they have nowhere to live
 twenty thousand kids have been taken away to become child soldiers 
 and the international criminal court is going after five of the leaders of the
 now what 's it called  i forget the name of the of the army it 's lord 's resistance army i believe
  have a clean sheet so if we could run the first video
  just after i
  in the middle
 of the
  torture is not
 something that always happens on
 other soil 
 in my country  it was we had been looking at pictures of british soldiers beating up young iraqis 
 we 've got abu ghraib we 've got guantanamo bay i had a driver on my way to newark airport  and
 he told me a story that in the middle of the night
 'd been taken out of his home in queens
 taken to a place in the midwest that he was interrogated and tortured and returned
 to the street four weeks later because he had the same he was middle eastern and he had the same name as one of the nine eleven
  that may or may not be true i didn 't think he was a liar though  and i think  if we look around the world 
 as well as the polar ice caps melting human rights which have been fought for for many hundreds of years in some cases 
 are also eroding very fast
 and that is
  one of our partners
 was at van jones and the books not bars project
 they have managed with their footage in california to change the
 youth correction systems employed and it 's much
 much i think more humane methods are being looked
  at how you should lock up
 young kids and that 's
 questionable to start off and as the story of mr morales just down the road  
 excuse me mr gabriel  would you mind if we
 delayed your execution a little bit no not at all no problem take your time  but this surely
 whoever that man is
  he 's done this is cruel and unusual punishment 
 anyway  witness has been
 trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world with cameras and i 'd like to show you just a little more of that thank you
  who
 the
 the
  witness was born of technological
 technological innovation in a sense the the small portable dv cam was really what allowed it to come into being
  and we 've also been trying to get computers out to the world  so that groups can communicate much more effectively campaign much more effectively  
 but now
 we have the
  which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it because that is cheap it 's ubiquitous and it 's moving fast
 all around the world
  and it 's very exciting for us
  who was defiling
