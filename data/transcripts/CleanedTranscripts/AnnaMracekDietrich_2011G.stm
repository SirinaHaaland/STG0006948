  it about flying cars  
 we 've wanted to do this for about a hundred years and there are historic attempts that have had some level of technical success 
  't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really truly seamlessly integrates the two dimensional world that we 're comfortable in with the three dimensional sky above us that i don 't know about you but i really enjoy spending time in 
 we looked at the historical attempts that had been out there and realized that despite the fact that we have a lot of modern innovations to draw on today that weren 't available previously we have modern composite materials we have aircraft
  engines that get good fuel economy and have better power to rate ratios than have ever been available 
 we have glass cockpit avionics that bring the information you need to fly directly to you in the cockpit
 but without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective we realized that we were going to be getting the same result that people had been getting for the last hundred
  which isn 't where we want to be right now so instead of trying to make a car that can fly we decided to try to make a plane that could drive  
 and the result is the terrafugia transition it 's a 
  airplane that works just like any other small airplane you take off and land at a local airport  then once you 're on the ground you fold up the wings  drive it home  park it in your garage  
 and it works after two years of an innovative design and construction process the proof of
  concept made its public debut in two thousand and eight 
 now like with anything that 's really different from the status quo it didn 't always go so well testing that aircraft and we discovered that it 's a very good thing that 
 when you go home with something that 's been broken you 've actually learned a lot more than when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives the first time through 
  build in the air 
 off the ground like it was supposed to be and on our third high speed testing deployment on a bitter cold morning in upstate new york we got to do that for the first time  
 the picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time and we were all very flattered to see that image become a symbol of accomplishing something that people had thought was impossible really the world over
 the flight testing that followed that was as basic and low risk as we could make it 
 but it still accomplished what we needed to to take the program to the next step and to gain the credibility that we needed within our eventual market the general aviation community and with the regulators that govern the use of design of aircraft particularly in the states 
  about a year ago gave us an exemption for the transition to allow us to have an additional one hundred and ten lbs within the light sport aircraft category 
 now that doesn 't sound like a lot but it 's very important because being able to deliver the transition as a light sport aircraft makes it simpler for us to certify it 
 but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it 
 a sport pilot can be certificated in as little as twenty hours of flight time 
 and at one hundred and ten lbs that 's very important for solving the other side of the equation
  driving 
 it turns out that driving with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles is actually a harder problem to solve than flying 
 for those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground this may be counter intuitive 
 but driving has potholes  cobblestones pedestrians other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with 
 fortunately
  necessity remains the mother of invention and a lot of the design work that we 're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground
 everything from a 
  transmission and liquid based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop and go traffic 
 to a custom designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you 're flying or the wheels on the ground 
 to the automated wing folding mechanism that we 'll see in a moment
 to crash safety features  we have a carbon fiber safety cage that protects the occupants for less than ten percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car 
 now this also as good as it is wasn 't quite enough  the regulations for vehicles on the road weren 't written with an airplane in mind 
 so we did need a little bit of support from the national highway
  you may have seen in the news recently they came through with us at the end of last month with a few special exemptions that will allow the transition to be sold in the same category as as suvs and light trucks 
 as a multi purpose passenger vehicle it is now officially designed for occasional off road use 
 now let 's see it in action you
  the wings folded up just along the side of the plane you 're not powering the propeller you 're powering the wheels  
 and it is under seven feet tall so it will fit in a standard construction garage  
 and that 's the automated wing folding mechanism that 's real time
 you just push a few buttons in the cockpit and the wings come out once they 're fully deployed there 's a mechanical lock that goes into place again from inside the cockpit
 they 're now fully capable of handling any of the loads you would see in flight just like putting down your convertible top and you
 're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that
  all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop  and our test pilot gave us the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight  which was that it was remarkably unremarkable
  he would go onto tell us that the transition had been the easiest airplane to land that he 'd flown in his entire 30 year career as a test pilot 
 so despite making something 
  that is seemingly revolutionary we really focused on doing as little new as possible 
  out of the box we use an incremental design build test redesign cycle that lets us reduce risk in baby steps  
 now since we started terrafugia about six years ago we 've had a lot of those baby steps we 've gone from being three of us working in the basement at mit while we were still in graduate school to about two dozen of us working in an initial production facility outside of boston  
 we 've had to overcome challenges like keeping the weight below the light sport limit that i talked about figuring out how to
  politely respond when a regulator tells you but that won 't fit through a toll booth with the wings extended 
 to all of the other associated durability and engineering issues that we talked about on the ground  
 still if everything goes to our satisfaction with the testing and
 construction of the the two production prototypes that we 're working
  have reserved an airplane at this point should begin at the end of next year the transition will cost in line with other small airplanes and i 'm certainly not out to replace your chevy  
 but i do think that the transition should be your next airplane 
 here 's why 
 while nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports there is a huge underutilized resource out there there are thousands of local airstrips that don 't see
  nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could on average there 's one within twenty to thirty miles of wherever you are in the united states  
 the transition gives you a safer more convenient and more fun way of using this resource 
 for those of you who aren 't yet pilots there 's four main reasons why those of us who are don 't fly as much as we 'd like to
 door to door travel time and mobility at your destination 
 now bad weather comes in just land fold up the wings drive home  doesn 't matter if it rains a little you have a windshield wiper 
 instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger  park it in your garage  and the unleaded automotive fuel that we use is both cheaper and better for the environment than traditional avgas
  travel time is reduced because now instead of lugging bags finding a parking space taking off your shoes
 or pulling your airplane out of the hanger  you 're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go 
 and mobility to your destination is clearly solved just fold up the wings and keep going 
 the transition simultaneously expands our horizons while making the world a smaller more accessible place it also continues
  to be a fabulous adventure 
 i hope you 'll each take a moment to think about how you could use something like this to give yourself more access to your own world and to make your own travel more convenient and more fun  
 thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you
