  this wish to think about when you 're a little kid and all your friends ask you if a genie could give you one wish in the world what would it be 
 and i always answered well i 'd want the wish to have the wisdom to know exactly what to wish for
  because you 'd know what to wish for and you 'd use up your wish and now since we only have one wish unlike last year they had three wishes i 'm not going to wish for that so let 's get to what i
 would like which is world peace  and i know what you 're thinking you 're thinking the poor girl up there she thinks she 's at a beauty pageant she 's not
  but i really do think it makes sense
  and i think that the first step to world peace is for people to meet each other i 've met a lot of different people over the years and i 've filmed some of them from a
 dotcom executive in in new york who wanted to take over the world to a military press officer in qatar who would rather not take over the
  what i 'd like to talk about today is a way for people to travel to meet people in a different way than than
 because you can 't travel all over the world at the same time and
  a long time ago well about forty years ago my mom had
 an exchange student and i 'm going to show you slides of the exchange student this is donna this is donna at the statue of liberty 
 this is my mother and aunt teaching donna how to ride a bike 
 this is donna eating ice cream and this is donna teaching my aunt how to do a filipino dance
  i really think as the world is getting smaller it becomes more and more important that we learn each other 's dance moves that we meet each other we get to know each other we are able to figure out a 
  way to to cross borders to understand each other to understand people 's hopes and dreams what makes them laugh and cry and i know that we can 't all do exchange programs and i can 
  't force everybody to travel i 've already talked about that to chris and amy and they said that there 's a problem with this you can
  force people free will and i totally support that so we 're not forcing people to travel  but i 'd like to talk about another way to travel that doesn 't require a ship or an airplane and just requires a movie camera a projector
 and a screen  and
 that 's what i 'm going to talk to you about
  i was asked that i speak a little bit about where i personally come from and cameron i don 't know how you managed to get out of that one  but i
 i think that building bridges is important to me because of where i come from i 'm
 the
 daughter of an american mother  and an egyptian lebanese syrian father so i 'm the living product of two cultures
  american with a persian name the middle east peace crisis so maybe me starting to take pictures was some kind of way to bring both sides of my family together
 a way to take the worlds with me a way to tell stories
 visually  it all kind of started that way but i think that i really realized the power of the image when i first went to the
 garbage collecting village in egypt when i was about sixteen 
 my mother took me there  she 's somebody who believes strongly in community service and decided that this was something that i needed to do and so i went there and
 i met some amazing women there  there there was a
 center there where they were teaching people how to read and and write and get vaccinations against the many diseases you can get from sorting through garbage
 and i began teaching there i taught english and i met some incredible women there i met
 people that live seven seven people to a room  
 barely can afford their evening meal yet lived with this strength of spirit and sense of humor and just incredible qualities  i got drawn into this community and i began to take pictures there
 i took pictures of
 weddings
 and
 older family members things that they wanted memories of about two years after i started taking these pictures the 
 un conference on population and development asked me to show them at the conference so i was eighteen i was very
  it was my first exhibit of photographs and
 they were all put up there and
 after about
 two days 
 they all came down except for three people were very upset very angry that i was showing these dirty sides of cairo and why didn 't i cut the dead donkey out of the frame and as i sat there i got very depressed i looked at this
 big empty wall with
 three lonely photographs that were you know very pretty photographs and
 i was like i failed at this but i was looking at this
 intense emotion and intense feeling that had come out
 of people just seeing these photographs here i was this 18 year old pipsqueak that nobody listened to and all of a sudden i put these photographs on the wall and there were arguments and they had to be taken down and i saw the power
  of the image and it was it was incredible and i think the most important reaction that i saw there was actually from people that would never have gone to the garbage village themselves that would never have seen that the human 
  spirit could thrive in such difficult circumstances  and i think it was at that point that i decided i wanted to use photography and film
  a couple of music films but in two thousand and three when the war in iraq was about to start
  it was a very surreal feeling for me because before the war started there was kind of this media war that was going on and i was watching television in new york and there seemed to be just one point of view that was coming across and 
 the the coverage went from the us state department to embedded troops and what was coming across on the news was that
 there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings and the iraqis would be
  the americans as liberators and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of baghdad  
 and i knew that there was a completely other story that was that was taking place in the middle east where my parents were i knew that there was a completely other story being told and i was thinking how 
  are people supposed to communicate with each other when they 're getting completely different messages and nobody knows what the other 's being told how are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding
  or know how to move together into the future  so i knew that i had to go there  i just wanted to be in the center i had no plan i had no funding
  i didn 't even have a camera at the time i had somebody bring it there
  because i wanted to get access to al jazeera george bush 's favorite channel  and
 a place which i was very curious about because it 's
 disliked by many
  governments across the arab world and also
 called the mouthpiece of osama bin laden by
 some people in the us government so i was thinking  this station that 's hated by so many people has to be doing something right i 've got to go
 see what this is all about
  and i also wanted to go see central command which was ten minutes away and that way i could get access to how this news was being created
 on the arab side reaching the arab world and on the us and western side reaching the us and when i went there and sat there and met these people that were in the center of it 
 and sat with these characters
 i met some surprising very complex people and i 'd like to share with
  of that experience of of when you sit with somebody and you film them and you listen to them and you allow them more than a
  to change the arab nightmare into the american dream 
 i still have that dream maybe i will never be able to do it but
  have plans for my children 
 when they finish high school i will send them to america to study there  i will pay for their study  
 and they will stay there josh rushing 
 the night they showed
 the pows and the dead soldiers al jazeera showed them it was powerful because america doesn 't show those kinds of images
  most of the news in america won 't show really gory images and this showed american soldiers in uniform strewn about a floor a cold tile floor  and it was
 revolting  it was absolutely revolting it made me sick at my stomach  and then what hit me was the night before  
 there had been some kind of bombing in basra  
 and al jazeera had shown
 images of the people
 and they were equally if not more horrifying the images were  and i remember having seen it in the al jazeera office and thought to myself 
 that 's bad and then going away and probably eating dinner or something and it didn 't affect me as much so the impact that had on me me
  al jazeera office must have felt the way i was feeling that night  and it upset me
 on a profound level that i wasn 't as bothered as much the night before
 it makes me hate war  
 but it doesn 't make me believe that we 're in a world that can live without war yet jehane noujaim i was overwhelmed by the response of the film we didn 't know whether it would be able to get out there we had no funding for it we were incredibly lucky
  that it got picked up  and when we showed the film
 in both the united states and the arab world we had such incredible reactions it was amazing to see how people were moved by this film in the arab world
  and it 's not really by the film it 's by the characters i mean  josh rushing was this incredibly complex person who was thinking about things and
  i showed the film in the middle east people wanted to meet josh he kind of redefined us as an american population people started to
 ask me where is this guy now al jazeera offered him a job 
 laughter and samir on the other hand was also quite an interesting character for the arab world to see because it brought out the complexities of this
  that the arab world has with the west  in the united states i was blown away 
  by the motivations the positive motivations of the american people when when they 'd see this film  you know we 're criticized abroad for 
 believing we 're the saviors of the world in some way but the flip side of it is that actually when people do see what is happening abroad and people
  reactions to some of our policy abroad we feel this this power that we need to we feel like we have to get the power to change things and i saw this with audiences this woman  woman came up to me after the screening and said 
 you know i know this is crazy i saw the bombs being loaded on the planes i saw the military going out to war but you don 't understand people 's anger towards
  us until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war and how do we get out of this bubble how do we understand what the other person
 is thinking now  i don 't know whether a film can change the world but 
 i know the power of it i know that it starts people thinking about how to change the world  now i 'm not a philosopher so i feel like i shouldn 't go
  great depth on this but let film speak for itself and take you to this other world because i believe that film has the ability to take you across borders i 'd
 like you to just sit back
 and experience for a couple of minutes being taken into another world and these couple clips take you inside
 of two of the most difficult conflicts that we 're faced with today
  i showed
 the
  to get
 that 
  the streets fighting screaming free nelson mandela it 's about
 those unions who put down their tools and demanded freedom
  what i 'd like to talk about today is
  robert wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person 's humanity then they will have an appreciation for ours  and that 's what this is about 
 it 's about connecting people through film getting these independent voices out there 
  who are trying to use film for change and there are incredible organizations that are out there doing this already 
 there 's witness  that you heard from earlier  there 's just vision that are working with palestinians and israelis who are working together for peace and documenting that process and 
  getting interviews out there and using this film to take to congress to show that it 's a powerful tool to show that this is a woman who 's had her
  daughter killed in an attack and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this there 's
 working films and there 's current tv which is an incredible platform for people around the world to be able to put
 their yeah it 's amazing  i 've watched it and i 'm blown away by it and its potential to bring bring voices from around the world independent voices from around the world and create a truly
  democratic global television  
 so what can we do to create a platform for these organizations to create some momentum to get everybody in the world involved in this movement 
 i 'd like for us to imagine for a second imagine a day
 when you have everyone coming together from around the world
 you have towns and villages and
 theaters
 all from around the world  getting together  and sitting in the dark and sharing a communal experience
 of watching a film  or a couple of films together  watching a film which maybe highlights a character that
  fighting to live or just a character that defies stereotypes makes a joke sings a song comedies documentaries shorts 
 this amazing power can be used to change people and to bond people together to cross borders and have people feel like they 're having a communal experience  
 so if you imagine this day when all
  and places where we project films if you imagine projecting from times square to tahrir square square in cairo  the same film in ramallah the same film in jerusalem
  you know we 've been talking to a friend of mine about using the side of the great pyramid and the great wall of china
  in terms of where you can project films and where you can have this communal experience  
 and i believe that this one day if we can create it this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices  there 
  an organization which is connecting the independent voices of the world to get out there and yet i 'm hearing throughout this conference that the biggest challenge in our future is understanding the other
  having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders and if film can do that and if we can get all of these different locations in the world to watch these films together
 this could be an incredible day  so we 've already made a partnership  set up through somebody from the
  introduced me to steven apkon from the jacob burns film center  and we started calling up everybody and in the last week there have been so many people that have responded to us from
 as close as palo alto  to mongolia and to india there are people that want to be a part of this global day of film to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there
 now we 've thought about a name for this day  
 and i 'd like to share this with you now the most amazing part of this whole process has been
 sharing sharing ideas and wishes and so i invite you to give brainstorms onto 
 how does this day echo into the future how do we use technology to make this day echo into the future so that we
  can build community and have these communities working together through the internet
  there was a time many many years ago when all of the continents were stuck together  
 and we call that landmass pangea  so what we 'd like to call this day of film is pangea cinema day  
 and if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching
 then
 i think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better  i know that it 's very intangible touching people 's hearts and souls  but the only 
  way that i know how to do it the only way that i know how to reach out to somebody 's
  and that 's my wish i guess i 'm supposed to give you my my 
  wish but we 're way out of time chris anderson that is an incredible wish 
 pangea cinema the day the world comes together jn it 's more tangible than world peace and it 's certainly more immediate  but
 it would be the day that the world comes together through film
