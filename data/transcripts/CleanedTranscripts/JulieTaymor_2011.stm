  that 's a few samples of the theater opera and films that i have done over the last twenty years
 but what i 'd like to begin with right now is to take you back to a moment that
  went through in indonesia
 which is a seminal moment in my life and like all myths these stories need to be retold and told lest we forget them
 and when i 'm in the turbulent times as we know that i am right now through the crucible and the fire of transformation which is what all
 all of you do actually anybody who creates knows there 's that point
 where it hasn
 quite become the phoenix or the burnt char laughter
 and i am right there on the edge which i 'll tell you about another story i want to go back to indonesia where i was about twenty one twenty two years a long time ago on a fellowship
 and i found myself after two years there and performing and learning on the island of bali
 on the edge
  of a crater gunung batur and
 i was in a village where there was an initiation ceremony for the young men a rite of passage little did i know that it was mine as well
 and as i sat in this temple square under this gigantic beringin banyan tree
 in the dark there was no electricity just the full moon
 down in this empty square
 and i heard the most beautiful sounds like a charles ives concert
 as i listened to the gamelan music from all the different villagers that came for this once every five years ceremony
 and i thought i was alone in the dark under this tree
 and all of a sudden out of the dark from the other end of the square i saw the glint of mirrors lit by the moon
 and these twenty
 old men who i 'd seen before all of a sudden stood up
 in these full warrior costumes with the headdress and the spears and no one was in the square and i was hidden in the shadows
 no one was there and they came out and they did this incredible dance
  their bodies and they came forward and the lights bounced off these costumes
 and i 've been in theater since i was eleven years old
 and performing creating and i went who are they performing for with these elaborate costumes these extraordinary headdresses
 and i realized that they were performing for god
 whatever that means
 but somehow
 it didn 't matter about the publicity there was no money involved
 it wasn 't going to be written down it was no news and there were these incredible artists that felt for me like an eternity as they performed
 the next moment
 as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows a young man with a propane lantern came on hung it up on a tree
 set up a curtain the village square was filled with hundreds of people and they put on an opera all night long human beings needed the light
 they needed the light to see
 so what i gained and gathered from this incredible seminal moment in my life as a young artist
 was that you must be true
 to what you believe as an artist all
  the way through but you also
 have to be aware that the audience is out there in our lives at this time and they also need the light and it 's this incredible balance
 that i think that we walk when we are creating something that is breaking ground that 's trying to do something you 've never seen before that imaginary
  imaginary world where you actually don 't know where you 're going to end up that 's the fine line on the edge of a crater that i have walked my whole life
 what i would like to do now is to tell you a little bit
 about how i work let 's take the lion king you saw many examples of my work up there but it 's one that people know
 i start with the notion of the ideograph an ideograph is like a brush painting a japanese brush painting three strokes you get the whole bamboo forest
 i go to the concept of the lion king and i say what is the essence of it what is the abstraction if i were to reduce this entire story into one image what would it be
 the circle
 the circle it 's so obvious the circle of life the circle of mufasa 's mask
 the circle that when we come to act ii and there 's a drought how do you
  express drought it 's a circle of silk on the floor that disappears into the hole in the stage floor
 the circle of life comes in the wheels of the gazelles that leap
 and you see the mechanics and being a theater person what i know and love about the theater is that when the audience comes in and they suspend their disbelief when you see men walking or women walking with a
  platter of grass on their heads you know it 's the savanna you don 't question that
 i love the apparent truth of theater i love that people are willing to fill in the blanks the audience is willing to say oh i know that 's not a real sun
 you took pieces of sticks you added silk to the bottom you suspended these pieces you let it fall flat on the floor and as it
  rises with the strings i see that it 's a sun but the beauty of it is that it 's just silk and sticks and in a way
 that is what makes it spiritual
 that 's what moves you it 's not the actual literal sunrise that 's coming it 's the art of it so
  as much as the story is critical and the book and the language the telling
 of the story how it 's told the mechanics the methods that you use is equal to the story itself
 and i 'm one who loves high tech and low tech so i could go from
 for instance i 'll show you some spider man later these incredible machines that move people along but the fact is without the dancer
  who knows how to use his body and swing on those wires it 's nothing so now i 'm going to show you
 some clips from the other big project of my life this year the tempest it 's a movie i did the tempest on a stage three times
 in the theater since one thousand nine hundred and eighty four eighty six and i love the play i did it always with a male prospero
 and all of a sudden i thought well who am i gonna get to play prospero why not helen mirren
 she 's a great actor why not and this material really did work for a woman equally as well so now let 's let 's take a look at some of the images from the tempest
  performed to the point the tempest that i bade thee ariel i boarded the king 's ship in every cabin
 i flamed amazement prospera at
  both in either 's powers trinculo misery acquaints a man with strange
  thou shalt have cramps antonio here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon sebastian draw thy sword and i the king shall love thee prospera
 i will plague them all even to roaring
  so i went from theater
  the tempest on the stage in a very low budget production many years ago and i love the play and i also think it 's shakespeare 's last play
 and it really lends itself as you can see to cinema
 but i 'm just going to give you a little example about how one stages it in theater and then how one takes that same
 idea or story and moves it into cinema
  the ideograph that i talked to you about before what is it for the tempest what
 if i were to boil it down would be the one image that i could
 hang my hat on for this
 and it was the sand castle
 the idea of nurture versus nature that we build these civilizations
 she speaks about it at the end helen mirren 's prospera we build them but
 under nature under the grand tempest these cloud capped towers these gorgeous palaces will fade and
 there will leave not a rack behind
 so in the theater i started the play it was a black sand rake
 white cyc and there was a little girl miranda on the horizon building a drip castle a sand castle
  she was there on the edge of that stage two stagehands all in black
 with watering cans ran along the top
 and started to pour water on the sand castle
 and the sand castle started to drip and sink but before it did the audience saw
 the black clad stagehands the medium was
  apparent it was banal we saw it
 but as they started to pour the water the light changed from showing you the black clad stagehands to focusing this rough magic that we do in theater it focused right on the water itself
 and all of a sudden the audience 's perspective changes
 it becomes something magically large it becomes
 the rainstorm
 the masked actors the puppeteers they disappear and the audience makes that leap into this world into this imaginary world of the tempest actually happening
 now the difference when i went and did it in the in the cinema i started the actual movie with a close up
 of a sand castle a black sand castle
  and what cinema can do is by using
 camera
 perspective and also long shots and close ups it started on a close up of the sand castle and as it pulled away you saw that it was a miniature sitting in the palm of the girl 's hands
 and so i could play with the medium and why i move
  move from one medium to another is to be able to do this now i 'm going to take you to spider man
  're trying to do everything in live theater that you can 't do in two dimensions in film and television
  looking at new york from a spider man point of view spider man is not bound by gravity manhattan in the show is not bound by gravity either
  i give enough movement in the sculpture
 they 're mythologies they 're modern
 myths these comic book heroes
 circus rock n roll drama what the hell are we doing up there on that stage
 well one last story very quickly after i was in that village i crossed the lake and i saw that the volcano was erupting on the other side gunung batur 
  and there was a dead volcano next to the live volcano i didn 't think i 'd be swallowed by the volcano and i am here
  rocks and climb up there and you get to the top and i was with a good friend who was an actor and we said let 's go up there let 's see if we can come close to the edge of that live 
  volcano and we climbed up and we got to the very top and we 're on the edge on this precipice
 precipice did you hear the lyrics
 i 'm on the precipice looking down into a dead volcano to my left
 to my right is sheer shale it 's coming off i 'm in thongs and sarongs it was many years ago
 and no hiking boots and he 's disappeared this mad french gypsy actor off in the smoke
 and i realize i can 't go back
  way that i 've come i can 't
 so i throw away my camera i throw away my thongs and i looked at the line straight in front of me
 and i got down on all fours like a cat
 and i held with my knees to either side of this line in front of me for thirty yards or thirty feet i don 't know the wind was massively blowing
 and the only way i could get to the other side was to look at the line straight in front of me i know you 've all been there
 i 'm in the crucible right now it 's my trial by fire
 it 's my company 's trials by fire we survive because our theme song is rise above
 boy falls from the sky rise above it 's right there in the palm of both of our hands of all of my
  company 's hands i have beautiful collaborators and we as creators only get there all together i know you understand that
 and you just stay going forward and then you see this extraordinary thing in front of your eyes thank you
