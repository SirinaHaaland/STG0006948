  i 'm going to try to make the case that inviting a loved one a friend or even a stranger to record a meaningful interview with you
 just might turn out to be one of the most important moments in that person 's life  and in yours when i was
 twenty two years old i was lucky enough to find my calling when i fell into making radio stories 
 at almost the exact same time i found out that my dad who i was very very close to 
 was gay i was taken completely by surprise we were a very tight knit family  
 and i was crushed 
 at some point in one of our strained conversations my dad mentioned the stonewall riots
  told me that one night in 
 a group of young black and latino drag queens fought back against the police at a gay bar in manhattan called the stonewall inn 
 and how this sparked the modern gay rights movement 
 it was an amazing story  and it piqued my interest  
 so i decided to pick up my tape recorder and find out more with the help of a young archivist
  named michael shirker we tracked down all of the people we could find who had been at the stonewall inn that night 
 recording these interviews  i saw how the microphone gave me the license to go places i otherwise never would have gone
 and talk to people i might not otherwise ever have spoken to 
 i had the privilege of getting to know some of the most amazing fierce and courageous human beings
  i had ever met 
 it was the first time the story of stonewall had been told to a national audience  i dedicated the program to my dad it changed my relationship with him  
 and it changed my
 life  over the next fifteen years i made many more radio documentaries  working to shine a light on
 people who are rarely heard from in the media 
 over and over again  i 'd see how this simple act of being interviewed could mean so much to people particularly those who had been told that their stories didn 't matter 
 i could literally see people 's back straighten as they started to speak into the microphone 
 in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight i made a documentary about the last flophouse hotels on the bowery in manhattan 
 guys stayed up in these cheap hotels for decades they lived in cubicles the size of prison cells covered
  with chicken wire so you couldn 't jump from one room into the next later i wrote a book on the men with the photographer harvey wang  
 i remember walking into a flophouse with an early version of the book and showing one of the guys his page 
 he stood there staring at it in silence then he grabbed the book out of my hand
  became the clarion call for storycorps this crazy idea that i had a dozen years ago  the thought was to take documentary work and turn it on its head 
  broadcast documentary has been about recording interviews to create a work of art or entertainment or education that is seen or heard by a whole lot of people 
 but i wanted to try something where the interview itself was the purpose of this work and see if we could give many many many people the chance to be listened to in this way 
 so in grand central terminal eleven years ago  we built a booth
 where anyone can come to honor someone else by interviewing them about their
  their life  
 you come to this booth and you 're met by a facilitator who brings you inside  you sit across from say your grandfather for close to an hour and you listen and you talk 
 many people think of it as if this was to be our last conversation what would i want to ask of and say to this person who means so much to me 
 at the end of the session  you walk away with a copy of the interview and another copy goes to the
  folklife center at the library of congress so that your 
  can someday get to know your grandfather through his voice and story  
 so we open this booth in one of the busiest places in the world and invite people to have this incredibly intimate conversation with another human being i had no idea if
  but from the very beginning it did people treated the experience with incredible respect and amazing conversations happened inside 
 i want to play just one animated excerpt from an interview recorded at that original grand central booth 
 this is 12 year old joshua littman interviewing his mother sarah josh has asperger 's syndrome as you may know kids with asperger 's are incredibly
  but have a tough time socially 
 they usually have obsessions in josh 's case it 's with animals  so this is josh talking with his mom sarah at grand central nine years ago josh littman 
 from a scale of one to ten  do you think your life would be different without animals sarah littman i think it would be an eight without animals because they add so much pleasure to life jl how else do you think your life would be different
  i could do without things like cockroaches and snakes jl well i 'm okay with snakes as long as they 're not venomous or constrict you or anything sl yeah i 'm not a big snake person jl but cockroach is just the insect we love to hate sl yeah
 it really is jl have you ever thought you couldn 't cope with having a child 
 sl i remember when you were a baby  you had really bad colic so you would just cry and cry jl what 's colic sl 
 it 's when you get this stomach ache and
  you were pretty loud but amy 's was more high pitched jl 
 i think it feels like everyone seems to like amy more like she 's the perfect little angel sl well  
 i can understand why you think that people like amy more  and i 'm not saying it 's because of your asperger 's syndrome  but being friendly comes easily to amy 
 whereas i think for you it 's more
  that 's a girl thing honey  the important thing for you is that you have a few very good friends and really that 's what you need in life jl 
 did i turn out to be the son you wanted when
  born did i meet your expectations sl 
 you 've exceeded my expectations sweetie because sure you have these fantasies of what your child 's going to be like but
 you have made me grow so much as a parent  because you think
  parenting books  
 i really had to learn to think outside of the box with you  and it 's made me much more creative as a parent and as a person 
 and i 'll always thank you for that jl and that helped when amy was born sl and that helped when amy was born but
 you are so incredibly special to me 
 and i 'm so lucky to have you as my son
  after this story ran on public radio josh received hundreds of letters telling him what an amazing kid he was his mom sarah bound them together in a book and when josh got picked on at school they would read the letters together  
 i just want to acknowledge that two of my heroes are here with us tonight  sarah littman and her son josh who is now an honors student
 a lot of people talk about crying when they hear storycorps stories  
 and it 's not because they 're sad most of them aren 't 
 i think it 's because you 're hearing something authentic and pure at this moment when sometimes it 's hard to tell what 's real and what 's an advertisement 
 it 's kind of the
  nobody comes to storycorps to get rich  nobody comes to get famous it 's simply an act of generosity and love 
 so many of these are just everyday people talking about lives lived with kindness courage decency and dignity  and when you hear that kind of story  it can sometimes feel like you 're walking on holy ground  
 so this experiment in grand central worked
  and we expanded across the country 
 today more than one hundred thousand people in all fifty states in thousands of cities and towns across america have recorded storycorps interviews  
 it 's now the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered 
 we 've hired and trained hundreds of facilitators to help guide people through the experience most serve a year or two with storycorps traveling the
  country  gathering the wisdom of humanity they call it bearing witness  
 and if you ask them 
 all of the facilitators will tell you that the most important thing they 've learned from being present during these interviews is that people are basically good 
 and i think for the first years of storycorps you could argue that there was some kind of a selection bias happening but after tens of thousands of interviews with every kind of person in
  every part of the country rich  poor five years old to one hundred and five  eighty different languages across the political spectrum
 you have to think that maybe these guys are actually onto something 
 i 've also learned so much from these interviews  i 've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen
 like this interview
 between a betting clerk in brooklyn named danny perasa who brought his wife annie to storycorps to talk about his love for her danny perasa you see 
 the thing of it is 
 i always feel guilty when i say i love you to you and i say it so often i say it to remind you that as dumpy as i am it 's coming from me  it 's like
  a beautiful song from a busted old radio  
 and it 's nice of you to keep the radio around the house annie perasa if i don 't have a note on the kitchen table i think there 's something wrong  you write a love letter to me every morning dp well the only thing that
 could possibly be wrong is i couldn 't find a silly pen ap 
 to my princess the weather outside today is extremely rainy i 'll
 call you at eleven twenty in the morning dp it 's a romantic weather report ap and i love you  i love you
 when a guy is happily married  no matter what happens at work no matter what happens in the rest of the day  there 's a shelter when you get home there 's a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you downstairs and saying get your hands off me
 being married is like having a color television set you never want to go back to black and white di 
 danny was about five feet tall with crossed eyes
  and one single snaggletooth but danny perasa had more romance in his little pinky than all of hollywood 's leading men put together 
 what else have i learned 
 i 've learned about the almost unimaginable capacity for the human spirit to forgive i 've learned about resilience and i 've learned about strength 
  israel and mary johnson 
 when oshea was a teenager he murdered mary 's only son laramiun byrd in a gang fight 
 a dozen years later  mary went to prison to meet  oshea and find out who this person was who had taken her son 's life  
 slowly and remarkably they became friends  and when he was finally released from the penitentiary oshea actually moved in next door to mary 
 this is just a short excerpt of a conversation they
  had soon after oshea was freed mary johnson 
 my natural son is no longer here  
 i didn 't see him graduate and now you 're going to college  i 'll have the opportunity to see you graduate i
 didn 't see him get married  hopefully one day i 'll be able to experience that with you
  just to hear you say those things and to be in my life in the manner in which you are is my motivation  it motivates me to
 make sure  that i stay on the right path  
 you still believe in me 
 and the fact that you can do it despite how much pain i caused you it 's amazing mj 
 i know it 's not an easy thing  to be able to share our story together  even with us sitting here looking at each other right now i know it 's not an easy thing
  i admire that you can do this oi i love you lady mj i love you too son 
 and i 've been reminded countless times of the courage and goodness of people 
 and how the arc of history
 truly does bend towards justice 
 like the story of alexis martinez  who was born arthur martinez in the harold ickes projects in chicago 
 in the interview she talks with her daughter lesley about joining a gang as a young man 
 and later in life transitioning into the woman she was always meant to be 
 this is alexis and her daughter lesley
  difficult things for me was i was always afraid that i wouldn 't be allowed to
 be in my granddaughters ' lives and you blew that completely out of the water you and your husband 
 one of the fruits of that is in my relationship with my granddaughters  they fight with each other sometimes over whether i 'm he or she  lesley martinez but they 're free to talk about
  have to tiptoe we
 're not going to cut you off and that
 's something i 've always wanted you to just know that you 're loved am 
 you know i live this every day now i walk down the streets as a woman and i really am at peace with who i am i mean i wish i had a softer voice maybe  
 but now i walk in love
 and i try to live that way every day
 now i walk in love i 'm
 going to tell you a secret about storycorps 
 it takes some courage to have these conversations 
 storycorps speaks to our mortality  participants know this recording will be heard long after they 're gone 
  who has worked closely with us on recording interviews with people who are dying 
 he wrote a book called the four things that matter most about the four things you want to say to the most important people in your life before they or you die  
 thank you  i love you  forgive me i forgive you 
 they 're just about the most powerful words we can say to one another and often that 's what happens in a storycorps booth  it 's a chance to have a sense of
  closure with someone you care about no regrets  nothing left unsaid  and it 's hard
 and it takes courage  but that 's why we 're alive right 
 so the ted prize  when i first heard from ted and chris a few months ago about the possibility of the
  i was completely floored 
 they asked me to come up with a very brief wish for humanity no more than fifty words  so i thought about it  i wrote my fifty words and a few weeks later chris called and said go for it 
 so here is my wish that you
 will help us take everything we 've learned through storycorps
 and bring it to the world
 so that anyone anywhere can easily record a
  meaningful interview with another human being which will then be archived for history how are we going to do that with
 this 
 we 're fast moving into a future where everyone in the world will have access to one of these  and it has powers i never could have imagined eleven years ago when i started storycorps 
 it has a microphone 
 it can tell you how to do things
 and it can send audio files those are the key ingredients so the first part of the wish is already underway 
 over the past couple of months the team at storycorps has been working furiously to create an app that will bring storycorps out of our booths so that it can be experienced by anyone 
 anywhere
  storycorps has always been two people and a facilitator helping them record their conversation which is preserved forever  but at this very moment we 're releasing a public beta version of the storycorps app 
 the app is a digital facilitator that walks you through the storycorps interview process helps you pick questions and gives you all the tips you need to record a meaningful storycorps interview 
 and then with one tap upload it to our
  archive at the library of congress that 's the easy part the technology  the real challenge is up to you 
 to take this tool and figure out how we can use it all across america and around the world so that instead of recording thousands of storycorps interviews a year we could 
  potentially record tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or maybe even more
 imagine 
 for example a national homework assignment where every high school student studying u s history across the country records an interview with an elder over thanksgiving 
  so that in one single weekend an entire generation of american lives and experiences are captured
  or imagine
 mothers on opposite sides of a conflict somewhere in the world sitting down not to talk about that conflict but to find out who they are as people and in doing so begin to build bonds of trust 
 or that someday it becomes a tradition all over the world that people are honored with a storycorps interview on their  75th birthday 
 or that people in
  your community go into retirement homes or hospitals or homeless shelters or even prisons armed with this app to honor the people least heard in our society and 
  ask them who they are what they 've learned in life  and how they want to be remembered 
 ten years ago i recorded a storycorps
  interview with my dad who was a psychiatrist and became a well known gay activist this is the picture of us at that interview 
 i never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago when my dad who seemed to be in perfect health and was still seeing patients forty hours a week was diagnosed with cancer  
 he passed away very suddenly a few days later  it was june
 two thousand and twelve  the anniversary of the stonewall riots  
 i listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning on the day that he died 
 i have a couple of young kids at home  and i knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person who was such a towering figure in my life would be through that
  i thought i couldn 't believe in storycorps any more deeply than i did 
 but it was at that moment that i fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings
