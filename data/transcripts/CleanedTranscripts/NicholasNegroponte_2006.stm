  i 've
  been at mit for forty four years i went to ted i there 's only one other person here i think who did that 
  lab was doing which today has almost five hundred people in it 
 and if you read the press last week it actually said i quit the media lab i didn 't quit the media lab i stepped down as chairman
 which was a kind of ridiculous title but
 someone else has taken it on and one of the things you can do as a professor is you stay on as a professor and i will now do for the rest of my life the one laptop per
  which i 've sort of been doing for a year and a half anyway  
 so i 'm going to tell you about this use my eighteen minutes to tell you why we 're doing it  
 how we 're doing it  and then what we 're doing and at some point i 'll even pass around
 what the $ one hundred laptop might be like 
 i was asked by chris to talk about some of the big issues and so i figured i 'd
 i 'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this and the first is pretty obvious
 it 's amazing when you meet a head of state and you say what is your most precious natural resource they will not say children 
 at first and then when you say children they will pretty quickly
 agree with you and so that isn 't very hard 
 everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems  they include
  education  
 sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education 
 so that 's certainly part of it and the third is a little bit less obvious
  and that is that we all in this room learned how to walk how to talk not by being
 taught how to talk or taught
  how to walk  but by interacting with the world by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something or being able to stand up and reach it  whereas
 at about the age six we were told to stop learning that way and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching whether it 's people standing up like i 'm doing now or a book or something  but it was really through teaching  
 and
 one of the things in general
  that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more like walking and talking in the sense that a lot of it is driven
 by the
 learner himself or herself  so with those as the principles some of you may know seymour papert this is back in
  and eighty two when we were working in senegal because some people
  laptop just happened
 a year ago or two years ago or we were struck by lightning this actually has gone back a long time  and in fact back to the ' 60s 
  here we 're in the ' 80s steve jobs had given us some laptops we were in senegal
  alphabet barely was their language  but they could just swim like fish they could play these like pianos a
 little bit more recently  i got involved
 personally and these are two anecdotes one was in cambodia in a village that has no electricity no water no
  but has broadband internet now and these kids their first english word is google 
 and they only know skype they 've never heard of telephony   they just use skype  and they go home at night they 've got a broadband connection in a
 hut that doesn 't have electricity the parents love it because when they open up the laptops it 's the brightest light source in the house  and talk about
  this is the actual school in parallel with this seymour papert got the governor of maine
 to legislate one laptop per child in the year two thousand and two 
 now at the time i think it 's fair to say that eighty percent of the teachers were
 let me say apprehensive really they were actually against it  and they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries more schools whatever and
  now three and a half years later  guess what  they 're reporting five things drop
 of truancy to almost zero  
 attending  parent teacher meetings which nobody did and now almost everybody does drop in discipline problems increase in student participation teachers are now saying it 's kind of fun to teach
  fifth which interests me the most is that the servers have to be turned off at certain times at night because the teachers are getting too much email from the kids asking them for help  
 so when you see that kind of thing this is not something that you have to test the days of pilot projects are over when people say we 'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works 
 screw you go to the back of the line and someone else will do it and then when you figure out
  this works you can join as well  and this is what we 're doing 
 so one laptop per child was formed about a year and a half ago
  it 's a nonprofit association it raised about twenty million dollars to do the
 the engineering to just get this built 
  and then have it produced afterwards scale is truly important and it 's not important because
 you can buy components at a lower price ok  
 it 's because you can go to a manufacturer and i will leave the name out but we wanted
 a small display doesn 't have to have perfect color uniformity it can even have a pixel or two missing
 it doesn 't have to be that bright  and this particular
  manufacturer said we 're not interested in that we 're interested in the living room we 're interested in perfect color uniformity we 're interested in big displays bright displays you
 're not part of our strategic plan and i said that 's kind of too bad because we need one hundred million units a year 
 and they said oh
 well maybe we could become part of your
  that 's why scale counts  
 and that 's why we will not launch this without five to ten million units in the first run  
 and the idea is to launch with enough scale that the scale itself helps bring the price down  and that 's why i said i said seven to ten million there
  and we 're doing it
 without a sales and marketing team i mean you 're looking at the  sales and marketing team  we will do it by going to seven large countries and getting them to agree
 and launch it and then the others can can follow we have partners  it 's not hard to guess google would be one the others
 are all playing to pending  
 and this has been in the press a great deal it 's the so called green machine that we introduced with kofi annan
 in november at the world summit that was held in tunisia now
 once people start looking at this they say ah this is a laptop project well no it 's not a laptop project it 's an education project  and
 the fun part and i 'm quite focused on it i tell people i used to be a light bulb but now i 'm a laser
 i 'm just going to get that thing built and it turns out it 's not so hard  because laptop economics are the following
 i say fifty percent here it 's more like sixty sixty percent of the cost of your laptop is sales marketing distribution and profit  
 now we have none of those ok  none of those figure into our cost because first of all we sell it
 at cost and the governments distribute it it gets distributed to the school system
 like a textbook so that piece disappears then you have display
 and everything else now the display on your laptop costs in rough numbers
  ten dollars a diagonal inch  that can drop to eight it can drop to seven but it 's not going to drop to two or to one and a half unless we do some some pretty clever things
  it 's the rest that little brown box that is pretty fascinating because the rest of your laptop
 is devoted
 to itself 
 it 's a little bit like an obese person having to use most of their energy to move their obesity  
 and we have a situation today which is incredible
 i 've been using laptops since their inception 
 and my laptop runs slower less reliably and less pleasantly
 than it ever has before
 and this year is worse 
 people clap  sometimes you even get standing ovations and i say what the hell 's wrong with you why are we all sitting there and somebody to
  remain nameless called our laptop a gadget recently  and i said god our laptop 's going to go like a bat out of hell when you open it up it 's going to
 when you bought an apple
 macintosh five hundred and twelve it worked really well  and we 've been going steadily downhill now
 people ask all the time what it is that 's what it is 
 the two pieces
 that are probably notable
  be a mesh network so when the kids open up their laptops they all become a network  and then just need one or two points of backhaul you can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits 
 so you really can bring into a village and then the villages can connect themselves and you really can do it
 quite well  the dual mode display the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors
 isn 't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight well you can 't see it 
 and one of the reasons you can 't see it is because it 's backlighting most of the time most cell phones now what we 're doing is we 're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit  and whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software
 is to be seen  but when it 's backlit it 's color and when it 's
  's black and white at three times the resolution 
 is it all worked out no 
 that 's why a lot of our people are more or less living in taiwan right now and in about thirty days we 'll know for sure whether this works
 probably the most important piece there is that the kids really can do the maintenance  and this is again something that people
  don 't believe but i really think it 's quite true that 's the machine we showed
 in tunis this is more the direction that we 're going to go and it 's something that we didn 't think was possible  now i 'm going to pass this around 
 this isn 't a design ok
  this is just a mechanical engineering
 sort of embodiment of it for you to play with 
 and it 's clearly just a model the working one is at mit 
 i 'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman at least you can decide whether it goes left
  that it could transform into an electronic book  so it 's sort of an electronic book this is where when you go outside it 's in black and white 
 the games buttons are missing  but it 'll also be a games machine book machine 
 set it up this way and it 's a television set etc etc is
 that enough for simulcast  ok sorry
  let jim decide which way to send it afterwards  ok  seven countries 
 i say maybe for massachusetts because they actually have to do a bid
 by law you 've got to bid and so on and so forth so i can 't quite name them in the other cases they don 't have to do bids
  they can decide it 's the federal government in each case 
 it 's kind of agonizing because a lot of people say let 's do it at the state level because states are more nimble than
 than the feds just because of size
  and yet we count we 're really dealing with the federal government we 're really dealing with ministries of education and if you look at governments around the world ministries 
  of education tend to be the most conservative and also the ones that have huge payrolls
  really hard and so it it 's certainly the hard road if you look at the countries 
 distributed have they all agreed no not completely probably thailand brazil and nigeria are the three that are the most active and most agreed we 're purposely not signing anything with anybody
 until we actually have the working ones and since i visit each one of those countries within at least
  every three months i 'm just going around the world every three weeks here 's sort of the schedule and i put at the bottom we might might give some away free
 in two years
 at this meeting everybody says it 's a $ one hundred laptop you can 't do it well guess what we 're not we 're coming in probably at one hundred
  to start then drift down and that 's very important because so many things hit
 the market at a price and then drift up it 's kind of the loss leader  and then as soon as it looks interesting  
 it can 't be afforded or it can 't be scaled out so we 're targeting fifty dollars in two thousand and ten the gray market 's a big issue 
 and one of the ways just one but one of the ways to
 help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is
  so utterly unique it 's a little bit like the fact that
 automobiles thousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the united states not one single  post office truck is stolen  
 and why because there 's no market for post office trucks it looks like a post office truck you can spray paint it you can do anything you
  i just learned recently in south africa no white volvos are stolen period none zero  so we want to make it very much like a white volvo 
 each government has a task force this perhaps is less interesting but we 're trying to get the governments to all work together
 and it 's not easy  the economics of this is to start with the
  subsequently go to other
 whether it 's child to child funding so a child in this country buys one for a child in the developing world  maybe of the same gender maybe of the same age  an
  uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present i mean there are all sorts of things that will happen
  i say it 's an education project
  are we providing the software  the answer is the
 system certainly has software but no we 're not providing the education content that is really done
 in the in the countries but we are certainly constructionists and we certainly believe in learning by doing and everything from logo which was started
  like scratch if you 've ever even heard of it  are very very much part of it  and that 's the rollout
  are we dreaming is this real
 it actually is real  
 the only criticism and people really don 't want to criticize this because it is a humanitarian effort 
  the one thing
 that people could criticize was great idea 
 but these guys can 't do it 
 and that could either mean these guys  professors and so on couldn 't do it or that it 's not possible well on december twelve
  a company called quanta agreed to build it and since they make about one third of all the laptops on the planet today 
 that question disappeared  so it 's not a matter of whether it 's going to happen
 it is going to happen  and
 if it comes out at one hundred and thirty eight dollars so what if it comes out six months late so what that 's a pretty soft landing  thank you
