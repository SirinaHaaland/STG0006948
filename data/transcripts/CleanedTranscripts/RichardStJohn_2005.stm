  this is really a two hour presentation i give to high school students cut down to three minutes and it all started one day on a plane on my way to ted seven years ago 
 and in the seat next to me was a
 high school student a teenager
  and she came from a really poor family  and she
 wanted to make something of her life and she asked me a simple little question she said what leads to success 
 and i felt really badly because i couldn 't give her a good answer 
 so i get off the plane and i come to ted  and i think jeez i 'm in the middle of a room of successful people so why don 't i ask them what helped them succeed and pass it on to kids 
 so here we are seven years five hundred interviews later  and i 'm going to tell you what really leads to success
 and makes tedsters tick  and the first thing is passion 
 freeman thomas says i 'm driven by my passion 
 tedsters do it for love they don 't do it for money carol coletta says i would pay someone to do what i do and
 the interesting thing is if you do it for love the money comes anyway 
 work rupert murdoch said to me it 's all hard work nothing comes easily but i have a lot of fun did he say
  fun rupert yes 
 tedsters do have fun working and they work hard i figured they 're not workaholics they 're workafrolics 
 good 
 alex garden says to be successful put your nose down in something and get damn good at it there 's no magic it 's practice practice practice
  and it 's focus norman jewison said to me i think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing 
 and push  
 david gallo says push yourself  physically mentally you 've got to push push push 
 you 've got to push through shyness and self doubt goldie hawn says i always had  self doubts i wasn 't good enough i wasn 't smart enough i didn 't think i 'd make it 
 now it 's not always easy to push yourself and that 's why they
  it was a privilege to serve as a doctor 
 a lot of kids want to be millionaires the first thing i say is ok well you can 't serve yourself you 've got to serve others something of value  because that 's the way people really get rich
  i had an idea  founding the first micro computer software company i 'd say it was a pretty good idea 
 and there 's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas it 's just doing some very simple things and i give lots of evidence persist 
 joe kraus says persistence is the number one reason for our success you 've got to persist through failure you 've got to
  the answer to this question
 is simple pay four thousand bucks and come to ted 
 or failing that do the eight things and trust me these are the big eight things that lead to success  thank you tedsters for
