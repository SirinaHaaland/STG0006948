  what keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life  if you were going to invest now
 in your future best self where would you put your time and your energy  there was a recent survey of millennials asking
  them what their most important life goals were and over eighty percent said that a major life goal for them
 was to get rich  and another fifty percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal
 was to become famous
  in to work to push harder
 and achieve more we
 're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life 
 pictures of entire lives of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them 
 those pictures are almost impossible to get 
 most of what we know about
  human life we know from asking people to remember the past and as we know hindsight is anything but twenty twenty  
 we forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life  and sometimes memory is downright creative  but
 what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time what if we could study
  people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age
 to see what really keeps people happy and healthy 
 we did that the harvard study of adult development may be the longest study of adult life that 's ever been done
  we 've tracked the lives of seven hundred and twenty four men 
 year after year asking about their work their home lives their health and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out 
 studies like this are exceedingly rare almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade
 because too many people drop out
  of the study or funding for the research dries up 
 or the researchers get distracted or they die  and nobody moves the ball further down the field 
 but through a combination of luck
 and the persistence of several generations of researchers this study has survived 
 about sixty of our original seven hundred and twenty four men
 are still alive
 still participating in the study most of them in their 90s and we are now beginning to study the more than two thousand children
 of these men and i 'm the fourth director of the study 
 thousand nine hundred and thirty eight we 've tracked the lives of two groups of men  the first group started in the study when they were sophomores at harvard college
  they all finished college during world war ii and then most went off to serve in the war 
 and the second group that we 've followed was a group of boys from boston 's poorest neighborhoods 
 boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the boston of the
  without hot and cold running water 
 when they entered the study all of these teenagers
 were interviewed they were given medical exams  we went to their homes and we interviewed their parents  
 and then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life 
 they became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and
  doctors one president of the united states 
 some developed alcoholism a few developed schizophrenia some
 climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top  and some made that journey in the opposite direction  
  the founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that i would be standing here today
  years later telling you that the study still continues  
 every two years our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives  
  many of the inner city boston men ask us why do you keep wanting to study me my life just isn 't that interesting 
 the harvard men never ask that question 
 to get the clearest picture of these lives  we don 't just send them
  interview them in their living rooms we get their medical records from their doctors  we draw their blood  we scan their brains  we talk to their children 
 we videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns  
 and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study  many of the women said
  come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we 've generated
 on these lives  well the lessons aren 't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder 
 the clearest message
 that we get from this 
  study is this good relationships keep us happier
  and healthier  period  
 we 've learned three big lessons about relationships  
 the first is that social connections are really good for us and that loneliness kills  
 it turns out that people who are more socially connected
 to family to friends to community
  are happier they 're physically healthier and they live longer
 than people who are less well connected  
 and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic people who are more isolated than they want to be from others
 find that they are less happy 
 their health declines earlier in midlife their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives
 than people who are not lonely
  and the sad fact is that at any given time more than one in five americans will report
 that they 're lonely  
 and we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage 
 so the second big lesson that we learned is that it 's not just the number of friends you have and it 's not whether or not you 're in a committed relationship but it 's the quality of
  close relationships
 that matters  
 it turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health
 high conflict marriages for example without much affection  turn out to be very bad for our health perhaps worse than getting divorced 
 and living in the midst of good warm
  once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s we wanted to look back at them at midlife
 and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy healthy octogenarian
 and who wasn 't and when we gathered together everything we knew about them
 at age fifty it wasn 't their middle age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old  it was how satisfied they
  were in their relationships the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age fifty were the healthiest
 at age eighty 
 and good close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old our most happily partnered men
  that on the days when they had more physical pain their mood stayed just as happy  
 but the people who were in unhappy relationships on the days when they reported more physical pain  it was magnified
 by more emotional pain  and the third big lesson that we learned
 about relationships and our health is that good relationships don 't just protect our bodies they protect our brains
  out that being in a securely attached relationship
 to another person in your 80s
 is protective that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need those people 's memories stay sharper longer  
 and the people in relationships where they feel they really can 't count on the other one those are the people who experience earlier
  memory decline  
 and those good relationships they don 't have to be smooth all the time some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out 
 but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough 
 those arguments
 didn 't take a toll on their memories  so
 this message that
 good close relationships are good for our health and well being 
 this is wisdom that 's as old as the hills  why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore
  well we 're human what we 'd really like is a quick fix something we can get
 that 'll make our lives good
  and keep them that way 
 relationships are messy and they 're complicated and the the hard work of tending to family and friends  it 's not sexy or glamorous 
 it 's also lifelong  it never ends 
 the people in our 75 year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new
  just like the millennials in that recent survey  many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed
 that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life 
 but over and over over these seventy five years our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships 
 with family with friends 
 with community
 so what about you let 's say you 're 
 or you 're forty or you 're sixty what might leaning in to relationships even look like 
 well the possibilities are practically endless  it might be something as simple as
 replacing screen time with
 people time
 or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together long walks or date nights 
 or reaching out to that family member who you haven 't spoken to in years  because those all too common family feuds
 take a terrible toll
 on the people who hold the grudges i 'd
 like to close
  with a quote from mark twain 
 more than a century ago  he was looking back on his life  and he wrote this 
 there isn 't time 
 so brief is life for bickerings apologies heartburnings callings to account  
 there is only time for loving  and but an instant so to speak for that
  good life is built with good relationships
