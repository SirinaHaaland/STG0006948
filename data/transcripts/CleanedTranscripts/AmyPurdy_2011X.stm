  if your life were a book
 and you were the author how would you want your story to go that 's the question that changed my
  growing up in the hot last vegas desert all i wanted was to be free  i would daydream
 about traveling the world  living in a place where it snowed 
 and i would picture all of the stories that i would go on to tell 
 at the age of nineteen the day after i graduated
  i moved to a place where it snowed
 and i became a massage therapist 
 with this job all i needed were my hands and my massage table by my side and i could go anywhere 
 for the first time in my life i felt free  independent
 and completely
 in control of my
  that is until my life took a detour  
 i went home from work early one day with what i thought was the flu  
 and less than twenty four hours later i was in the hospital on life support
 with less than a two percent chance of living it wasn 't until days later as i lay in a coma
 that the doctors diagnosed me with
  bacterial meningitis
  blood infection 
 over the course of two and a half months
 i lost my spleen my kidneys the hearing in my left ear
 and both of my legs below the knee when my parents wheeled me out of the hospital
 i felt like i had been pieced back
  together like a patchwork doll  i thought the worst was over
 until weeks later when i saw my new legs for the first time the calves were
 bulky blocks of metal with pipes bolted together for the ankles and a yellow rubber foot
 with a raised rubber line from the toe
  to the ankle to look like a vein i didn 't know what to expect  but i wasn 't expecting that 
 with my mom
 by my side
 and tears streaming down our faces  i strapped on these chunky legs
 and i stood up they were
  so painful
 and so confining
 that all i could think was 
 how am i ever going to travel the world in these things  
 how was i ever going to live the life full of adventure and stories as i always wanted  
 and how was i going to snowboard again
  i went home  i crawled into bed and this is what my life looked like for the next few months 
 me passed out escaping from reality  with my legs resting by my side 
 i was absolutely
 physically
 and emotionally
 broken  
 but i knew that in order to
  forward  i had to let go of the old amy
 and learn to embrace the new amy 
 and that is when it dawned on me that i didn 't have to be five foot five anymore i could be as tall as i wanted
  or as short as i wanted  depending on who i was dating 
 and
 if i snowboarded again  my feet aren 't going to get cold 
 and best of all i thought  i can make my feet the size of all the shoes that are on the sales
  and i did so there were benefits here  it was this moment that i asked myself that 
  question if my life were a book
 and i were the author  
 how would i want the story to go and i began to daydream  i daydreamed like i did as a little girl
 and i imagined myself walking gracefully
 helping other people through my journey
 and snowboarding again  
 and i didn 't just see myself carving down a mountain of powder
  i could actually feel it i could feel the wind against my face and the beat
 of my racing heart as if it were happening in that very moment  and that
  is when
 a new chapter in my life began  
 four months later i was back up on a snowboard  although things didn 't go quite as expected 
 my knees and my ankles wouldn 't bend and at one point
 i traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift when
 i i fell and my legs still attached to my snowboard
 went flying down the mountain 
 and i was on top of the mountain still  i was so shocked i was just as shocked as everybody else and i was
 so discouraged but i knew that if i could find the right pair of feet that i would be able to do this again  
 and this is when i learned that our borders
  and our obstacles can only do two things one stop us in our tracks
 or two force us to get creative  
 i did a year of research  still couldn 't figure out what kind of legs to use couldn 't find any resources that could help me so i decided to make a pair
  my leg maker and i put random parts together and we made a pair of feet that i could snowboard in 
 as you can see  rusted bolts  rubber wood and neon pink duct tape
  and yes i can change my toenail polish
  it was these legs and the best 21st birthday gift i could ever receive a new kidney from my dad that allowed me to follow my dreams again
 i started snowboarding  
 then i went back to work then i went back to school  then in two thousand and five i cofounded a nonprofit organization for youth and young adults with physical disabilities so they could get involved with action sports 
 from there  i had the opportunity to go to south africa 
 where i helped to put shoes on thousands of children 's feet so they could attend school  
 and just this past february
  i won two back to back world cup gold medals 
 which made me the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder in the world
  eleven years ago when i lost my legs  i had no idea what to expect  but if you ask me today if i would ever want to change my situation 
 i would have to say no 
 because my legs haven 't disabled me if anything they 've enabled me they 've forced me to rely on my imagination and to believe in the possibilities 
  and that 's why i believe that our imaginations can be used as tools for
  breaking through borders because in our minds we can do anything and we can be anything 
 it 's believing in those dreams and facing our fears head on
 that allows us to live our lives beyond our limits  
 and although today is about innovation
  i have to say that in my life innovation has only been possible because of my borders  
 i 've learned that borders are where the actual ends  but also where the imagination and the story begins
