  i was fourteen years old
 inside of a bowling alley  burglarizing an arcade game  
 and upon exiting the building a security guard grabbed my arm so i ran i ran down the street and i
 i jumped on top of a fence and when i got to the top the weight of three thousand quarters in my book bag pulled me back down to the ground  
 so when i came to the security guard was standing on top of me and he said  next time you little punks steal something you can carry 
 laughter i was taken to juvenile hall
 and when i was released into the custody of my mother the first words my uncle said was how 'd you get caught 
  were small what am i supposed to do 
 and ten minutes later  he took me to burglarize another arcade game we needed gas money to get home that was my life  
 i grew up in oakland california with my mother and members of my immediate family addicted to crack cocaine my environment consisted of
 living with family  friends and homeless shelters
  shelters  oftentimes  dinner was served in breadlines and soup kitchens the big homey told me this money rules the world
 and everything in it  and in these streets money is king  and if you follow the money it 'll lead you to the bad guy or the good guy  
 soon after  i committed my first
  and it was the first time that i was told that i had potential and felt like somebody believed in me 
 nobody ever told me that i could be a lawyer  doctor or engineer  
 i mean how was i supposed to do that i couldn 't read write or spell  i was illiterate  so i always thought crime was my way to go  
 and then one day
 i was talking to somebody and he was telling me about this robbery that we could do  and we did it the reality was
  was that i was growing up in the strongest financial nation in the world  the united states of america  while i watched my mother stand in line at a blood bank
 to sell her blood for forty dollars just to try to feed her kids  she still has the needle marks on her arms to day to show for that  
 so i never
  care about my life  everybody there was doing what they were doing to take what they wanted the drug dealers the robbers the blood bank  
 everybody was taking blood money  so i got mine by any means necessary i got mine 
 financial literacy really did rule the world 
 and i was a child slave to it
 following the bad guy 
 at seventeen years old i was arrested for robbery and murder
  and i soon learned that finances in prison rule more than they did on the streets  so i wanted in 
 one day i rushed to grab the sports page of the newspaper so my cellie could read it to me 
 and i accidentally picked up the business section 
 and this old man said  hey youngster you pick stocks and i said what 's that he said that 's the place where white folks keep all their money 
 and it was the first time
 that i saw a glimpse of hope a future  he gave me this brief description of what
  stocks were but it was just a glimpse  
 i mean how was i supposed to do it i couldn 't read write or spell  
 the skills that i had developed to hide my illiteracy no longer worked in this environment  
 i was trapped in a cage prey among predators  fighting for freedom i never had i was lost
  and i was out of options  so at twenty years old  i did the hardest thing i 'd ever done in my life i picked up a book  
 and it was the most agonizing time of my life  
 trying to learn how to read  the ostracizing from my family  the homeys 
 it was rough man it was
  but little did i know i was receiving the greatest gifts i had ever dreamed of self worth 
 knowledge  discipline  
 i was so excited to be reading that i read everything i could get my hands on  candy wrappers clothing logos street signs everything 
  i mean i can actually now for the first time in my life read  the feeling that i got from it was amazing  and then at
  i picked up the business section of the newspaper i wanted to find these rich white folks 
 so i looked for that glimpse  
 as i furthered my career in teaching others how to financially manage money and invest i soon learned that i had to take responsibility for my own actions  true
  i grew up in a very complex environment but i chose to commit crimes  and i had to own up to that i had to take responsibility for that and i did 
 i was building a curriculum that could teach incarcerated men how to manage money through prison employments 
 properly managing our lifestyle would provide transferrable tools that we can use to manage money when we reenter society like the majority of people did who didn 't commit crimes then
 i discovered
 that according to marketwatch
  sixty percent of the american population has under one thousand dollars in savings 
 sports illustrated said that over sixty percent of nba players and nfl players go broke  forty percent of marital problems derive from financial issues  
 what the hell 
 you mean to tell me that people worked their whole lives buying
  and material stuff but were living check to check 
 how in the world were members of society going to help incarcerated individuals back into society if they couldn 't manage they own stuff
  we screwed 
 i needed a better plan  
 this is not going to work out too well  so 
  i now had an obligation to meet those on the path
 and help  and it was crazy because
 i now cared about my community  wow imagine that i cared about my community  
 financial illiteracy is a disease that has crippled minorities and the lower class in our society for generations and generations 
 and we should be furious about that 
 ask yourselves this how can fifty percent
 of the american population be financially illiterate in a nation driven by financial prosperity  
 our access to justice our social status living conditions transportation and food are all dependent on money that most people can 't manage it 's crazy it
 's an epidemic and a bigger danger to public safety than any other issue  
 according to the
  department of corrections  over seventy percent of those incarcerated have committed or have been charged with money related crimes  robberies  burglaries fraud  larceny  extortion
 and the list goes on check this out a typical incarcerated person would enter the california prison system
 with no financial education  earn thirty cents an hour
  hour  over eight hundred dollars a year with no real expenses and save no money 
 upon his parole he will be given two hundred dollars gate money and told hey good luck stay out of trouble don 't come back to prison 
 with no meaningful preparation or long term financial plan  what does he do 
 at sixty 
 get a good job or go back
  to the very criminal behavior that led him to prison in the first place 
 you taxpayers you choose  well his education already chose for him probably  so how do we cure this disease 
 i cofounded a program that we call financial empowerment emotional literacy we call
  and it teaches how do you separate your emotional decisions from your financial decisions 
 and the four timeless rules to personal finance the proper way to save  
 control your cost of living 
 borrow money effectively
 and diversify your finances by allowing your money to work for you instead of you working for it incarcerated people need these life skills before we reenter society 
 you can 't have full rehabilitation
 without these life skills 
 this idea that only professionals can invest and manage money is absolutely ridiculous  and whoever told you that is lying 
 a professional
 is a person who knows his craft better than most and nobody knows how much money you need have or want better than you
 which means you are the professional financial literacy is not a skill ladies and gentlemen it 's a lifestyle 
 financial stability is a byproduct of a proper lifestyle 
 a financially sound incarcerated person can become a taxpaying citizen 
 and a financially sound taxpaying citizen can remain one this allows us to create a bridge between those people
  who we influence family  friends and those young people who still believe that crime and money are related  
 so let 's lose the fear and anxiety of all the big financial words and all that other nonsense that you 've been out there hearing  
 and let 's get to the heart of what 's been crippling our society from taking care of your responsibility to be better life managers
 and let 's provide a simple and easy to use curriculum that gets to the heart the heart of what financial empowerment and emotional literacy really is
