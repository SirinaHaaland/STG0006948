  there are things we say when we catch the eye of a stranger or a neighbor walking by 
 we say hello how are you it 's a beautiful day how do you feel 
  these sound kind of meaningless right and in some ways they are they have no semantic meaning it
 doesn 't matter how you are or what the day is like  they have something else  they have social meaning  
 what we mean when we say those things is i see you there  
 i 'm obsessed with talking to strangers  i make eye contact
  i get all kinds of stories 
 about seven years ago  i started documenting my experiences to try to figure out why  
 what i found was that something really beautiful was going on this is almost poetic 
 these were really profound experiences  they were unexpected pleasures
  they were genuine emotional connections  they were liberating moments  
 so one day i was standing on a corner waiting for the light to change which  i 'm a new yorker so that means i was actually standing in the street
 on the storm drain 
 as if that could get me across faster  and there 's an old man standing next to me so he 's wearing like a long overcoat and sort of an old man hat  and
 he looked like somebody from a movie  and he says to me don 't stand there
 you might disappear 
 so this is absurd right but i did what he said i stepped back onto the sidewalk  
 and he smiled and he said good you never know i might have turned around  and zoop you 're gone 
 this was weird  and also really wonderful he was so warm  and he was so happy that he 'd saved me
  we had this little bond for a minute i felt like my existence as a person had been noticed 
 and i was worth saving  
 the really sad thing is in many parts of the world we 're raised to believe that strangers are dangerous by default 
 that we can 't trust them that they might hurt us  
 but most
  strangers aren 't dangerous we 're uneasy around them because we have no context  we don 't know what their intentions are 
 so instead of using our perceptions and making choices  we rely on this category of stranger 
 i have a four year old when i say hello to people on the street  she
  it 's just good to be friendly 
 i think twice every time i say that to her 
 because i mean it but as a woman particularly i know that not every stranger on the street has the best intentions 
 it is good to be friendly  and it 's good to learn when not to be but none of that means we have to be afraid
 there are two huge benefits to using our senses instead of our fears  
 the first one is that it liberates us 
 when you think about it using perception instead of categories is much easier said than done 
 categories are something our brains use when it comes to people it 's sort of a
  shortcut for learning about them  
 we see male  female young old black brown  white stranger friend 
 and we use the information in that box it 's
 quick  it 's easy and it 's a road to bias and it means we 're not thinking about people
  i know an american researcher who travels frequently in central asia and africa  alone  she 's entering into towns and cities
 as a complete stranger  she has no bonds no connections  she 's a foreigner 
 her survival strategy is this get one stranger to see you as a real individual person if
 you can do that it 'll help other people see you that way
 the second benefit of using our senses has to do with intimacy  
 i know it sounds a little counterintuitive intimacy and strangers
  but these quick interactions can lead to a feeling that sociologists call fleeting intimacy 
 so it 's a brief experience that has emotional
  it 's the good feeling i got from being saved from the death trap of the storm drain by the old man 
 or how i feel like part of a community when i talk to somebody on my train on the way to work  
 sometimes it goes further  researchers have found that people often feel
 more comfortable
 being honest and open about their inner selves with strangers than they do with their friends and their
  families
 that they often feel more understood by strangers  
 this gets reported in the media with great lament strangers communicate better than spouses 
 it 's a good headline right  
 i think it entirely misses the point  
 the important thing about these studies is just how significant these interactions
  can be how this special form of closeness
 gives us something we need as much as we need our friends and our families  
 so how is it possible that we communicate so well with strangers  
 there are two reasons  the first one is that it 's a quick interaction
  has no consequences it 's easy to be honest with someone you 're never going to see again right that makes sense  
 the second reason is where it gets more interesting we have a bias when it comes to people we 're close to 
 we expect them to understand us  we assume they do  and we expect them to read our minds  
 so imagine you 're at a party  and you can 't believe that your friend or your spouse
 isn 't picking up on it that you want to leave early
 you 're thinking i gave you the look 
 with a stranger we have to start from scratch  we tell the whole story  
 we explain who the people are how we feel about them  we spell out all the inside jokes and guess what sometimes they do understand us a little better 
  now that we know that talking to strangers matters how does it work  
 there are unwritten rules we tend to follow the rules are very different depending on what country you 're in what culture you 're in 
 in most parts of the us  the baseline expectation in public is that we maintain a balance between civility and privacy 
 this is known as civil inattention so imagine two people are walking towards
  each other on the street they
 'll glance at each other from a distance that 's the civility  the acknowledgment and then as they get closer they 'll look away 
 to give each other some space 
 in other cultures people go to extraordinary lengths not to interact at all 
 people from denmark tell me
 that many danes are so averse to talking to strangers
 that they would rather miss their stop on the bus than say excuse me to someone that they need to get around 
 instead there 's this elaborate shuffling of bags and using your body to say that you need to get past 
 instead of using two words 
 in egypt i 'm told
  it 's rude to ignore a stranger and there 's a remarkable culture of hospitality 
 strangers might ask each other for a sip of water 
 or if you ask someone for directions  they 're very likely to invite you home for coffee  
 we see these unwritten rules most clearly when they 're broken 
 or when you 're in a new place and you 're trying to figure out what the right thing to do is 
 sometimes breaking the rules a
  little bit is where the action is 
 in case it 's not clear  i really want you to do this  ok  
 so here 's how it 's going to go  find somebody who is making eye contact that 's a good signal  the first thing is a simple smile  
 if you 're passing somebody on the street or in the hallway here smile see what happens  another is
  triangulation there 's you there 's a stranger  there 's some third thing that you both might see and comment on 
 like a piece of public art or somebody preaching in the street
 or somebody wearing funny clothes give it a try make a comment about that third thing and see if starts a conversation  
 another is what i call noticing this is usually giving a compliment
 i 'm a big fan of noticing people 's shoes  i 'm actually not wearing fabulous shoes right now but
 shoes are fabulous in general 
 and they 're pretty neutral as far as giving compliments goes 
 people always want to tell you things about their awesome shoes 
 you may have already experienced the dogs and babies principle it can be awkward to talk to someone on the street you don 't know how they 're going to
  respond but you can always talk to their dog or their baby 
 the dog or the baby is a social conduit to the person  and you can tell by how they respond whether they 're open to talking more 
 the last one i want to challenge you to is disclosure 
 this is a very vulnerable thing to do  and it can be very rewarding  so next time you 're talking to a stranger
 and you
  feel comfortable 
 tell them something true about yourself something really personal 
 you might have that experience i talked about of feeling understood 
 sometimes in conversation it comes up people ask me what does your dad do or where does he live 
 and sometimes i tell them the whole truth which is that he died when i was a kid 
 always in those moments
  they share their own experiences of loss we tend to meet disclosure with disclosure even with strangers  
 so here it is 
 when you talk to strangers you 're making beautiful interruptions into the expected narrative of your daily life
  you 're making unexpected connections  if you don 't talk to strangers you 're missing out on all of that 
 we spend a lot of time teaching our children about strangers 
 what would happen if we spent more time teaching ourselves  
 we could reject all the ideas that make us so suspicious of each other 
 we could make a space for change  thank you
