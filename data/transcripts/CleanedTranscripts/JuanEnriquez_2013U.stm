  all right so let 's take four subjects that obviously go together  big data tattoos immortality
 and the greeks right now the issue about tattoos
  so you don 't have to say a lot
  and tattoos tell you a lot of stories if i can ask an indiscreet question how many of you have tattoos 
 a few but not most 
 what happens if facebook google twitter linkedin cell phones gps foursquare yelp travel advisor all these things you deal with every day
 turn out to be electronic tattoos
  and what if they provide as much information about who and what you are
 as any tattoo ever would what 's ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state
 or as a great celebrity
 is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are tweeting blogging following you watching your credit scores
 and what you do to yourself  and electronic tattoos also shout
  you 're thinking of the consequences of that it 's getting really hard to hide from this stuff among other things because it 's not just the electronic tattoos it 's facial recognition
 that 's getting really good so you can take a picture with an iphone and get all the names  although again  sometimes it does make mistakes 
 but that means you can take a typical bar scene like this take a picture say of
  this guy right here get the name and download all the records
 before you utter a word or speak to somebody 
 because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos  
 and so there 's companies like face com that now have about eighteen billion faces
 online 
  there are other companies that will place a camera like this this has nothing to do with facebook
 they take your picture they tie it to the social media they figure out you really like to wear black dresses 
 so maybe the person in the store comes up and says hey we 've got five black dresses that would just look great on you 
 so what if andy was wrong here 's andy 's theory
 for fifteen minutes 
 laughter well  then  because of electronic tattoos  maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality  
 because these tattoos will live far longer than our bodies will 
 and if that 's true then what we want to do is we want to go through four lessons from the greeks
 and one lesson from a latin american  why the greeks
 well the greeks thought about what happens when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time  
 so lesson number one sisyphus remember
 he did a horrible thing  condemned for all time to roll this rock up it would roll back down roll back up roll back down it 's a little like your reputation  once
  get that electronic tattoo you 're going to be rolling up and down for a long time so as you go through this stuff  just be careful what you post 
 myth number two  orpheus wonderful guy  charming to be around great partier  
 great singer  loses his beloved  charms his way into the underworld only person to charm his way into the underworld  
 charms the gods of the underworld  they release his beauty
 on the condition he never look at her until they 're out
 so he 's walking out and walking out and walking out and he just can 't resist he looks at her loses her forever 
 with all this data out here it might be a good idea not to look too far
 into the past of those you love 
 lesson number three atalanta greatest runner  she would challenge anybody if you won she would marry you
  if you lost you died  
 how did hippomenes beat her well
 he had all these wonderful little golden apples and she 'd run ahead and he 'd roll a little golden apple  
 she 'd run ahead and he 'd roll a little golden apple she kept getting distracted  he eventually won the race 
 just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples come and reach you and you want to post about them or tweet about them or send a
 and then of course there 's narcissus  nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with narcissus 
 but as you 're thinking about narcissus  just don 't fall in love with your own reflection
  last lesson from a latin american this is the great poet jorge luis borges when he was threatened by the thugs of the argentine military junta
  he came back and said oh come on how else can you threaten other than with death 
 the interesting thing  the original thing would be to threaten somebody with immortality 
 and that of course is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos  thank you
