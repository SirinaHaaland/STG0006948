  africa is booming per capita incomes since the year two thousand have doubled  
 and this boom is impacting on everyone  
 life expectancy has increased by one year every three years for the last decade 
 that means if an african child
  born today  rather than three days ago they will get an extra day of life at the end of their lifespan  it 's that quick  
 and hiv infection rates are down twenty seven percent  
 six hundred thousand less people a year are getting hiv in sub saharan africa  
 the battle against malaria is being won 
 with deaths from malaria down
 according to the latest world bank data and malaria nets actually are playing a role in that 
 this shouldn 't surprise us because actually  everybody grows  if you go back to imperial rome in the year one a d there was admittedly about one thousand eight hundred years where there wasn 't an awful lot of growth  
 but then the people that
  the romans would have called scottish barbarians  my ancestors were actually part of the industrial revolution and in the  19th century growth began to accelerate  
 and you saw that get quicker and quicker 
 and it 's been impacting everyone  it doesn 't matter if this is the jungles of singapore or the tundra of northern finland  
 everybody gets involved it 's just a matter of when the inevitable happens  
 among the reasons i think it 's happening right now is the quality of the leadership
  across africa  i think most of us would agree that 
 the greatest politician in the world
 was african 
 but i 'm meeting brilliant people across the continent the entire time  and they 're doing the reforms which have transformed the economic situation for their countries  
 and the west is engaging with that the west has given debt forgiveness programs which have halved
 from about seventy percent of gdp down to about forty at
 the same time our debt level 's gone up to one hundred and twenty and we 're all feeling slightly miserable as a result  politics gets weaker when debt is high 
 when public sector debt is low governments don 't have to choose between investing in education and health and paying interest
  on that debt you owe and
 it 's not just the public sector which is looking so good the private sector as well  
 again in the west we have private sector debt of two hundred percent of gdp in spain the u k and the u s that 's
 an awful lot of debt 
 africa  many african countries are sitting at ten to thirty percent of gdp 
 if there 's any continent that can do what china has done
 china 's at about one hundred and thirty percent of gdp on that chart
  if anyone can do what china has done in the last thirty years it 'll be africa in the next thirty  
 so they 've got great government finances great private sector debt does anyone recognize this in fact they do 
 foreign direct investment has poured into africa in the last fifteen years back in the ' 70s 
 no one touched the continent with a barge pole  
 and this investment is actually
  we hear a lot about china  and they do lend a lot of money  
 but sixty percent of the fdi in the last couple of years has come from europe america australia  canada ten percent 's come from india  
 and they 're investing in energy africa produces ten million barrels a day of oil now it 's the same as saudi arabia
 or russia  and they 're investing in telecoms  shopping malls
  and this very encouraging story i think is partly 
 and it 's not just about african demographics i 'm showing you the number of 15 to 
 in various parts of the world and the blue line is the one i want you to focus on for a second ten years ago  say you 're foxconn setting up an
  by chance you might choose china  which is the bulk of that east asian blue line where there 's two hundred million young people 
 and every year until two thousand and ten that 's getting bigger 
 which means you 're going to have new guys knocking on the door saying give us a job and i don 't need a big pay rise just please give me a job 
 now that 's completely changed now this decade we 're going to see a
  so where do you set up your new factory you look at south asia and people are they 're looking at pakistan and bangladesh and
 they 're also looking at africa  
 and they 're looking at africa because that yellow line is showing you that the number of young africans is going to continue to get bigger decade after decade after decade
  i think one of the crucial factors is how educated is that demographic
 if you look at the red line here what you 're going to see is that in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five just nine percent of kids were in secondary school education
  nobody else did they chose instead turkey and mexico
 to set up the textiles factories  because their education levels were twenty five to thirty percent today
 at the levels that turkey and mexico were at
 in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five they will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty
 and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth 
 so what 's africa looking like today this is how i look at africa it 's a bit odd because i 'm an economist each little box is about a billion dollars and you see that i pay an awful lot of attention to nigeria sitting there in the middle 
 south africa is playing a role but when
 i 'm thinking about the future i 'm actually most interested
 in central western and southern africa  if i look at africa by population east africa stands out as so much potential  
 and i 'm showing you something else with these maps i 'm showing you democracy versus autocracy  
 fragile democracies is the beige color  strong democracies are the orange color
 and what you 'll see here is that most africans are now living in democracies
  why does that matter because what people want
 is what politicians try they don 't always succeed but they try and deliver  
 and what you 've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on in ghana in the elections in december two thousand and twelve  the battle between the two candidates was over
 education one guy offered free secondary school education to all
  just thirty percent  the other guy had to say i 'm going to build fifty new schools  he won by a margin 
 so democracy is is encouraging governments to invest in education education is helping growth and investment and that 's giving budget revenues which is giving governments more money  
 which is
 helping growth through education it 's a positive virtuous circle
  asked this question and this particular question
 makes me quite sad it 's but what about corruption how can you invest in africa when there 's corruption 
 and what makes me sad about it is that this graph here is showing you that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth 
 when you 're poor corruption is not your biggest priority  and the countries on the right hand side
 you 'll see the per capita gdp basically every country
 with a per capita gdp of say less than five thousand dollars has got a corruption score of roughly what 's that about three 
 three out of ten that 's not good  every poor country is corrupt every rich country
 is relatively uncorrupt
  how do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption you see the middle class grow  and the way
 to do that is to invest not to say i 'm not investing in that continent because there 's too much corruption  
 now i don 't want to be an apologist for corruption i 've been arrested because i refused to pay a bribe
  what i 'm saying here is that we can make a difference and we can do that by investing  now i 'm going to let you 
 economists aren 't great at forecasting  because the question really is what happens next and if you go back to the year two thousand what you 'll find is the economist had a
 very famous cover the hopeless continent and what they 'd done is they 'd looked at growth in africa over the previous ten years two percent
  and they said what 's going to happen in the next ten years they assumed
 two percent and that made it a pretty hopeless story because population growth was two and a half 
 people got poorer in africa in the 1990s now two thousand and twelve the economist has a new cover and what does that new cover show that
  new cover shows well africa rising because the growth over the last ten years has been about five and a half percent
 i would like to see if if you can all now become economists  because
 if growth for the last ten years has been five and a half percent what do you think the imf is forecasting for the next five years of growth in in africa 
 very good i think you 're secretly saying to your head probably five and a half percent you 're all economists and i think like most economists
  offense 
 what i like to do is try and find the countries that are doing exactly what africa has already done 
 and it means that jump from one thousand eight hundred years of nothing to whoof suddenly shooting through the roof 
 india
 is one of those examples this is indian growth from one thousand nine hundred and sixty to two thousand and ten
 ignore the scale on the bottom for a second
  actually for the first twenty years the ' 60s and ' 70s india didn 't really grow it grew at two percent
 when population growth was about two and a half if
 that 's familiar that 's exactly what happened in sub sahara in the ' 80s and the ' 90s and then something happened in one thousand nine hundred and eighty  boom 
 india began to explode it wasn 't a hindu rate of growth
  if i lay sub saharan growth on top of the indian growth story  it 's remarkably similar 
 twenty years of not much growth and a trend line which is actually telling you that sub saharan african growth is slightly better than india  
 and if i then lay developing asia on top of this i 'm saying india is twenty years ahead of africa  i 'm saying developing asia is ten years
  india i can draw out some forecasts for the next thirty to forty years
 which i think are better than the ones where you 're looking backwards  
 and that tells me this that africa is going to go from a $ two trillion economy today
 to a $ twenty nine trillion economy by
  now that 's bigger than europe and america put together
 in today 's money  life expectancy is going to go up by
 thirteen years the population 's going to double from one billion to two billion so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold
 in the next thirty five years  and when i present this in africa nairobi  lagos
  i think they 've got a point  am i really saying that there can be nothing learned  yes from the positives in asia
 and india  but also the negatives perhaps africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made surely the technologies that we 're talking about here this
  surely some of these can perhaps help africa grow even faster 
 and i think here we can play a role because technology does let you help you can go and download some of the great african literature
 from the internet now no not right now just thirty seconds 
 you can go and buy some of the great tunes my ipod 's full of them 
 buy african products go on holiday and see for yourself the change that 's happening invest
  perhaps hire people give them the skills that they can take back to africa and their companies will grow an awful lot faster than most of ours here in the west  and then you
 and i can help
 make sure that for africa the 21st century is their century thank you very much
