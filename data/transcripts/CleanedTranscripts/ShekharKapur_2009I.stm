  and we 're all talking about this great english icon and saying she 's a fantastic woman she does everything how are we going to introduce her so we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer and they came
  we hire him for and the third said 
 let 's find another director i thought i had better change so we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce elizabeth and i said ok maybe i am too bollywood maybe
 elizabeth this great icon dancing what are you talking about 
 so i rethought the whole thing  and then we all came to a consensus and here was the introduction of this great british icon
  innocent and saw great joy in her life  and she was youthful and
 how many of you did not get that that 's the power of visual storytelling that 's the power of dance that 's the power of music  
 the power of not knowing when i go out to direct a film every day we prepare too much we think too much
  in the quicksand of of
 experience 
 so i come up  and i say what am i going to do today i 'm not going to do what i planned to do  and i put myself into absolute panic  it 's my one way of getting rid of my mind  
 getting rid of this mind that says hey you know what you 're doing you know exactly what you 're doing you 're a director
  and be in complete panic  it 's a symbolic gesture i tear up the script i go and
 i panic myself  i get scared i 'm doing it right now you can watch me i 'm getting nervous i don 't know what to say i don 't know what i 'm doing i don 't want to go there and as i go there
 i 'm allowing myself to go into chaos because out of chaos  i 'm hoping some some moments of truth will come 
 all preparation is preparation  i don 't even know if it 's honest  i don 't even know if it 's truthful the truth of it all comes on the moment  organically  and if you get
  five great moments of great organic stuff in your storytelling in your film your film audiences will get it
  moments  and i 'm standing there and saying 
 i don 't know what to say so  ultimately everybody 's looking at you two hundred people at seven in the morning who got there at quarter to seven and you arrived at seven  and everybody 's saying 
 hey  
 what 's the first thing what 's going to happen 
 and you put yourself into a state of panic where you don 't know  and so you don 't know and so because you don 't know you 're praying to the universe because you 're praying to the universe that something i 'm going to try and access
  the universe the way einstein
 say a prayer
 accessed his equations the same source i 'm looking for the same source because creativity comes from absolutely the same source that you meditate somewhere outside yourself 
 outside the universe  you 're looking for something that comes and hits you until that hits you you 're not going to do the first shot so what do you do so
  great actor and i like
 to give to my actors why don 't you show me what you want to do 
 what am i doing  i 'm trying to buy time i 'm trying to buy time  so the first thing about storytelling that i learned  and i follow all the time is panic panic is the great access of creativity because that 's the only way to get rid of your mind
  rid of your mind
  get out of it get it out and let 's go to the universe because there 's something out there that is more truthful than your mind that is more truthful than your universe [ unclear ] 
 you said that yesterday i 'm just repeating it because that 's what i follow constantly to find the shunyata somewhere the emptiness out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity  so that 's what i do  
  used to live we used to call it a chhat or the khota khota 's now become a bad word it means their terrace and we used to sleep out at night 
 at school i was being just taught about physics  and i was told that that
 if there is something that exists then it is measurable 
 if it is not measurable  it does not exist  and at night i would lie out looking at the unpolluted
  sky as delhi used to be at that time when i was a kid  and i used to stare at the universe and say how far does this universe go my father was a doctor  
 and i would think 
 daddy how far does the universe go and he said son it goes on forever so i said please measure forever
 because in school they 're teaching me that if i cannot measure it it does not exist
  into my frame of reference 
 so how far does eternity go  what does forever mean  and i would lie there crying at night because my imagination could not touch creativity  so what did i do  
 at that time at the tender age of seven i created a story  what was my story  
 and i don 't know why  but i remember the story there was a woodcutter
  who 's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood  and the whole galaxy is one atom of that
 ax and when that ax hits that piece of wood 
 that 's when everything will destroy and the big bang will happen again but all before that there was a woodcutter  and then when i would run out of that story i would imagine
  that woodcutter 's universe
 is one atom
 in the ax of another woodcutter so every time  i could tell my story again and again and get over this problem  and so i got over the problem how did i do it 
 tell a story  so what is a story  a story is
 our all of us
 we are the stories we tell ourselves  in this
  where we live with this duality of whether we exist or not and who are we the stories we tell ourselves are the stories that 
 define the potentialities of our existence  we are the stories we tell ourselves
 so that 's as wide as we look at stories a story is the relationship that you develop between who you are or who you
  are and the infinite world and that 's our mythology 
 we tell our stories and a person without a story does not exist so
 einstein told a story
 and followed his stories and came up with theories and came up with theories and then came up with his equations  alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him  and he went out to conquer the world we all
  everybody has a story that they follow we tell ourselves stories so i will go further and i say 
 i tell a story and therefore i exist i exist because there are stories and if there are no stories we don 't exist  we create stories to define our existence if we do not create the stories we
  i don 't know  i 'm not sure  but that 's what i 've done all the time now a
 film 
 a film tells a story  i often wonder when i make a film i 'm thinking of making a film of the buddha and i often wonder 
 if buddha had all the elements that are given to a director
 if he had music  if he had visuals if he had a video camera would we get
 buddhism better but that puts some kind of burden on me  i have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way but
  have the potential it 's called subtext  when i first went to hollywood they said
 i used to talk about subtext and my agent came to me would you kindly not talk about subtext and
 i said why he said because nobody is going to give you a film if you talk about subtext  just talk about plot and say how wonderful you 'll shoot the film
  when i look at a film here 's what we look for we look for a story on the plot level  
 then we look for a story on the psychological level  
 then we look for a story on the political level  then we look at a story on a mythological level  
 and i look for stories on each level  now  it is not necessary that these stories
 agree with each other  what is wonderful is at many times
  the stories will contradict with each other  so when i work with rahman who 's a great musician i often tell him don 't follow what the script already says find that which is not find the truth for yourself  and when you find the truth for yourself  
 there will be a truth in it but it may contradict the plot but don 't worry about it
  here was a story that
 the writer was telling a woman
 who was threatened by philip ii and was going to war and was going to war fell in love with walter raleigh because she fell in love with walter raleigh she 
  was giving up the reasons she was a queen  and then walter raleigh fell in love with her lady
  and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted here
 's the story i was telling the gods up there 
 there were two people there was philip ii who was divine
 because he was always praying and there was elizabeth  who was divine  but not quite divine because she thought she was divine but
 the blood of being mortal flowed in her  but the divine one was unjust
  so the gods said ok  what we need to do is help the just one 
 and so they helped the just one and what they did was they sent walter raleigh down to physically separate her mortal self from her spirit self 
 and the mortal self was the girl that walter raleigh
 was sent and gradually he separated her so she was free to be
  divine  and the two divine people fought and the gods were on the side of divinity of course all the british press got really upset 
 we won the armada but i said but the storm won the armada  the gods sent the storm so what was i doing  
 i was trying to find a mythic reason to make the film 
 of course when i asked cate blanchett i said what 's the film about
  she said the film 's about a woman coming to terms with growing older 
 psychological the writer said it 's about history plot 
 i said it 's about mythology  the gods so let me show you a film
 a piece from that film and how a camera also so this is a scene where in my mind  she was at the depths of mortality
 she was discovering what mortality actually means  and if she is at the depths of mortality  what really happens  and she 's recognizing the dangers of mortality 
  and why she should break away from mortality  remember in the film to me  both her and her lady in waiting were parts of the same body one the mortal self and one
  you go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business is it his tell me say it
 this man has seduced a ward of the queen and she has
 married without royal consent 
 these offenses are punishable by law
  her own sense of jealousy her own sense of mortality  what am i doing with the architecture the architecture is telling a story
  the architecture is telling a story about how even though she 's the most powerful woman in the world at that time there is the other  the architecture 's bigger 
 the stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic it 'll survive her so it 's telling you to me stone is part of her destiny 
 not only that why is the camera looking down the camera 's looking down at her because she 's in the well she 's in the absolute
  well of her own sense of
 of
 being mortal  that 's where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality come in release her spirit and that 's the moment where in my mind  both elizabeth and bess are the same person  
 but that 's the moment she 's surgically removing herself from that 
 so the film is operating on many many levels in that
  scene  and how we tell stories visually with music with actors  and at each level it 's a different sense and sometimes contradictory to each other
  so
 how do i start all this  what 's the process of telling a story about ten years ago i heard this little thing from a politician not a
  politician that was very well respected in india  
 and he said that that these people in the cities in one flush
  expend as much water as you people in the rural areas don 't get for your family for two days that
 struck a chord and i said that 's true i went to see a friend of mine  and he made me wait
 in his apartment in malabar hill on the twentieth floor
  a really really upmarket area in mumbai  and he was having a shower for twenty minutes i got bored and left and as i drove out i drove past the slums of bombay as you always do  
 and i saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun of women and children with buckets waiting for a tanker to come and give them water  
 and an idea started
  so how does that become a story  i suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster so my next film is called paani which means water  
 and now out of the mythology of that i 'm starting to create a world  
 what kind of world do i create and where does the idea the design of that come so in my mind in the future they started to build
 flyovers you understand flyovers
  they started to build flyovers to get from a to b faster but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth to another area of relative wealth  
 and then what they did was they created a city above the flyovers  and the rich people moved to the upper city and left the poorer people in the lower cities about ten to twelve percent
 of the people have moved to the upper city now where
  it says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders and survive on the shoulders of the poor so from that mythology the upper city and lower city come so the design has a story 
 and now  what happens is that the people of the upper city they suck up all the water remember the word i said  suck up
 they suck up all the water keep to themselves  and they drip feed the lower city and if there 's any revolution they cut off the water and because democracy still exists  there 's a democratic way in which you say well  
 if you give us what [ we want ] we 'll give you water 
 so okay my time is up  but i can go on about telling you how we evolve stories and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated
  into the particular discipline that i am in which is film  but ultimately what is a story  it 's a contradiction  
 everything 's a contradiction 
 the universe is a contradiction  and all of us are constantly looking for harmony when you get up the night and day is a contradiction but you get up at four a m that first blush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each
  harmony is the notes that mozart didn 't give you but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that all contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony  
 it 's the effect of looking for harmony in the contradiction that exists in a poet 's mind a contradiction that exists in a storyteller 's mind  in a storyteller 's mind it 's a contradiction of moralities  
 in a poet 's mind it 's a conflict of words in the universe 's mind between day and night in the mind of a man and a woman
  constantly at the contradiction between male and female we 're looking for harmony within each other 
 the whole idea of contradiction  but the acceptance of contradiction is the telling of a story  not the resolution  the problem with a lot of the storytelling in hollywood 
  and many films  and as [ unclear ] was saying in his that we try to resolve the contradiction harmony
  is not resolution  harmony is the suggestion of a thing that is much larger than resolution  harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal
  and and of eternity and of the moment resolution is something that is far more limited it is finite harmony is infinite  so that storytelling 
 like all other contradictions in the universe is looking for harmony and infinity in moral resolutions resolving one but letting another go letting another go
  go and creating a question that is really important
