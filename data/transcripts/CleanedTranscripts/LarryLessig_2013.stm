  a place called lesterland  
 now lesterland looks a lot like the united states 
 like the united states it has about three hundred and eleven million people and of that three hundred and eleven million people it turns out
 hundred and forty four thousand are called lester  
 if matt 's in the audience i just borrowed that i 'll return it in a second this character from your from your series so one hundred and forty four thousand are called lester which means about 
  percent is named lester now lesters in lesterland have this extraordinary power there are two elections every election cycle in lesterland one is called the
 election  the other is called the lester election  
 and in the general election it 's the citizens who get to vote but in the lester election it 's the lesters who get to vote and here 's the trick in order to run in the general election  
 you must do extremely well
 in the lester election you don 't necessarily have to win but you must do extremely well now  what can we say about democracy
  in lesterland 
 what we can say number one as the supreme court said in citizens united that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials  because after all there is a general election  
 but only after the lesters have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in the general election and number two  obviously this dependence upon the lesters
 is going to produce a subtle
  we could say camouflaged bending to keep the lesters happy  
 okay  so we have a democracy  no doubt 
 but it 's dependent upon the lesters and dependent upon the people it has competing dependencies we could say conflicting dependencies depending upon who the
  now there are three things i want you to see now that i 've described lesterland number one the united states is lesterland the
 united states is lesterland the united states also looks like this also has two elections one we called the general election the second we should call the money election  
 in the general election it 's the citizens who get to vote if you 're over eighteen in some states if you have an id in the money election it 's the funders who get to vote the
  who get to vote and just like in lesterland the trick is to run in the general election you must do extremely well in the money election you don 't necessarily have to win there is jerry brown but you must do 
 extremely well  and here 's the key  there are just as few relevant funders in 
 as there are
  the numbers from two thousand and ten 26 percent of america
 gave two hundred dollars or more to any federal candidate 05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate 01 percent the one percent of the one percent gave ten thousand dollars or more to federal
  gave sixty percent of the super pac money spent in the cycle we have just seen ending  
 so i 'm just a lawyer i look at this range of numbers and i say it 's fair for me to say it 's 
  percent who are our relevant funders in america  in this sense the funders are our lesters
 now what can we say about this democracy in usa land well as the supreme court said in citizens united we could say of course the people have the ultimate influence
 over the elected officials we have a general election  
 but only after the funders have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in that general election
  this dependence upon the funders
 produces a subtle  understated camouflaged bending to keep the funders happy  
 candidates for congress and members of congress
 spend between thirty and seventy percent of their time raising money to get back to congress or to get their party back into power  
 and the question we need to ask is what does it do to them these humans as they spend their time behind the telephone
  calling people they 've never met but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent as anyone would as they do this they develop a sixth sense  
 a constant awareness about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money they become in the words of the 
 as they constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money not on issues one to ten
  eleven to one thousand leslie byrne a democrat from virginia describes that when she went to congress she was told by a colleague always lean to the green 
 then to clarify she went on he was not an environmentalist 
 so here too we have a democracy a democracy dependent upon the funders and dependent upon the people competing dependencies 
 possibly conflicting
  dependencies depending upon who the funders are okay  the united states is lesterland  point number one here 's point number two the
 united states is worse than lesterland  
 worse than lesterland because you can imagine in lesterland if we lesters got a letter from the government that said hey you get to pick who gets to run in the
  we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of lesters you know there are lesters from every part of social society there are rich lesters poor lesters black lesters white lesters 
 not many women lesters but put that to the side for one second we have lesters from everywhere we could think what could we do to make lesterland better it 's at least possible the lesters would act for the good of lesterland  
 but in our land  in this land 
  there are certainly some sweet lesters out there many of them in this room here today but the vast majority of lesters act for the lesters  
 because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the 05 percent are not comprising it for the public interest it 's for their private interest in this sense the usa is worse than lesterland and finally point number three 
 whatever one wants to say about lesterland against the background of its history its traditions in our land in
 lesterland is a corruption a corruption 
 now by corruption i don 't mean brown paper bag cash secreted among members of congress i don 't mean rod blagojevich sense of corruption i don 't mean any criminal act the corruption i 'm talking about is perfectly legal  
 it 's a corruption relative to the framers ' baseline for this republic the framers gave
  us what they called a republic  
 but by a republic they meant a representative democracy  
 and by a representative democracy they meant a government as madison put it in federalist fifty two that would have a branch that would be dependent upon the people alone 
 so here 's the model of government they have the people and the government
 with this exclusive dependency  but the problem here
 is that congress has evolved a different dependence no longer a dependence upon the people alone increasingly a dependence upon the funders  now
 this is a dependence too  
 but it 's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone so long as the funders are not the people this is
  there 's good news and bad news about this corruption one bit of good news is that it 's bipartisan equal opportunity corruption  
 it blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about it blocks the right too as it makes principled arguments of the right increasingly
  impossible  so the right wants smaller government when al gore was vice president his team had an idea for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry the chief policy man took
  this idea to capitol hill  and as he reported back to me the response was hell no if we deregulate these guys  how are we going to raise money from them 
 this is a system that 's designed to save the status quo including the status quo of big and invasive government it works against the left and the right and that you might say is good news but here 's the bad news  
  pathological
  corruption  
 because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election that means the tiniest number of us 
 the tiniest tiniest number of us can block reform  i know that should have been like a rock or something i can only find cheese i 'm sorry so there
  there is an economy here an economy of influence an economy with lobbyists at the center which feeds on polarization 
 it feeds on dysfunction the worse that it is for us  
 the better that it is for this fundraising 
 henry david thoreau there are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root
  this is the
 root  okay  now  every single one of you knows this 
 you couldn 't be here if you didn 't know this yet you ignore it you ignore it 
 this is an impossible problem you focus on the possible problems  like eradicating polio from
  the world or taking an image of every single street across the globe or building the first real universal translator or building a fusion factory in your 
  garage these are the manageable problems so you ignore 
 so you ignore this corruption  but we cannot ignore this
  a government that works 
 and not works for the left or the right but works for the left and the right the citizens of the left and right because there is no sensible reform 
 possible until we end this corruption  so i want you to take hold to grab the issue you care the most about climate change is mine but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax
  system or inequality grab that issue sit it down in front of you look straight in its eyes and tell it there is no christmas this year  there will never be a christmas we will never 
 get your issue solved until we fix this issue first so it 's not that mine is the most important issue it 's not 
  but mine is the first issue the issue we have to solve before we get to fix the issues you care about no sensible reform and we cannot afford
 a world  a future with no sensible reform  okay  so how do we do it 
 turns out the analytics here are easy simple 
 if the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of america  the solution is to have them spend less
  time fundraising but fundraise from a wider slice of americans to spread it out to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea of dependence upon the people alone  
 and to do this does not require a constitutional amendment changing the first amendment to do this would require a single statute  
 a statute establishing what we think of as small dollar funded elections  a statute of
 citizen funded campaigns and there 's any number of these proposals out there fair elections now act  the american 
  act an idea in my book that i call the grant and franklin project to give vouchers to people to fund elections an idea of john sarbanes called the grassroots democracy act each of these
 would fix this corruption
  by spreading out the influence
 of funders to all of us the analytics are easy here it 's the politics that 's hard  
 indeed impossibly hard  because this reform would 
 shrink k street  and capitol hill  
 as congressman jim cooper  a democrat from tennessee put it has become a farm league for k street
 a farm league for k street members and staffers and bureaucrats have an increasingly common business model in their head a business model focused on their life after government their life as lobbyists  
 fifty percent of the senate between one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight and two thousand and four left to become lobbyists forty two percent of the house those numbers have only gone up  and as united republic
 calculated last april the average increase in salary for those who they tracked was one thousand four hundred and 
 percent  so it 's fair to ask how is it possible
 for them to change this now
 i get this skepticism  i get this cynicism i get this sense of impossibility 
 but i don 't buy it 
 this is a solvable issue
 if you think about the issues our parents tried to solve in the 20th century 
 issues like racism or sexism or the issue that we 've been fighting in this century  homophobia  those are hard issues 
 you don 't wake up one day no longer a racist it takes generations to tear that intuition that dna out of the soul of a people
  but this is a problem of just incentives just incentives change the incentives and the behavior changes and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen overnight
 a change in the practice when connecticut adopted this system in the very first year seventy eight percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took
  it 's solvable 
 not by being a democrat not by being a republican it 's solvable by being citizens by being citizens by being
 tedizens  because if you want to kickstart reform  look i could kickstart
 reform at half the price
 of fixing energy policy i could give you back a republic
 even if you 're not yet with me  
 even if you believe this is impossible  
 what the five years since i spoke at ted has taught me as i 've spoken about this issue again and again is even if you think it 's impossible that is irrelevant 
 i spoke at dartmouth once and a woman stood up after i spoke i write in my book and she said to me
  convinced me this is hopeless hopeless there 's nothing we can do 
 when she said that i scrambled i tried to think how do i respond to that hopelessness what is that sense of hopelessness and what hit me was an image of my six year old son 
 and i imagined a doctor coming to me and
  your son has terminal brain cancer  and there 's nothing you can do 
 nothing you can do so
 would i do nothing would i just sit there accept it okay nothing i can do i 'm going off to build google glass 
 of course not i would do everything i could and i would do everything i could because this is what love means 
 that the odds are irrelevant and that you do
  the hell you can the odds be damned and then i saw the obvious link because even we liberals
 love this country 
 and so when the pundits and the politicians say that change is impossible  what this love of country says back is
 everyone in this room loves and cherishes if we lose this republic and so we act
 with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong  so here 's my question 
 do you
 have that love do you
  have that love because if you do  then what the hell are you what are the hell are we doing  
 when ben franklin was carried from the constitutional convention
 in september of one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven he was stopped in the street by a woman who said mr franklin what have you wrought 
 franklin said a republic madam if you can keep it
  a representative democracy a government dependent upon the people alone  
 we have lost that republic all of us have to act
 to get it back
