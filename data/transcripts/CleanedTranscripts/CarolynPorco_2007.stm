  in the next eighteen minutes i 'm going to take you on a journey  and
 it 's a journey that you and i have been on for many years now and it began some fifty years ago when humans first stepped off
  and in those fifty years not only did we literally physically set foot set foot on the moon  but we have dispatched robotic
 spacecraft to all the planets all eight of them
 and we have landed on asteroids we have rendezvoused with comets and at this point in time we have a spacecraft
 on its way to pluto  the body formerly known as a planet
  and all of these robotic missions are part
 of a bigger human journey  a voyage to
 understand something 
 to get a sense of our cosmic place to understand something of our origins and how earth our planet  and we living on it came to be 
 and of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search
 for answers to questions like this there 's saturn
  and we have been to saturn before we visited saturn in the early 1980s but our investigations of saturn have become far more in depth in detail since
 the cassini spacecraft traveling across interplanetary space for seven years  
 glided into orbit around saturn in the summer of two thousand and four  and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established
  around the sun  now  the saturn system
 is a rich planetary system it offers mystery 
 scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare  
 and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach  in fact  just studying the rings alone we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas
 that we call the spiral
  galaxies and here 's a beautiful picture of the andromeda nebula which is our closest largest spiral galaxy to the milky way  and then here 's a beautiful composite of the whirlpool galaxy 
 taken by the hubble space telescope so the journey back to saturn
 is really part of and is also a metaphor
 for a much larger human voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us  and also
  how humans fit into that picture  and it pains me that i can 't tell you all that we have learned with cassini
 can 't show you all the beautiful pictures that we 've taken in the last two and a half years because i simply don 't have the time so i 'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged
 out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around saturn
 and have been for the past two and a half years 
 saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons they range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the u s most of the beautiful 
  pictures we 've taken of saturn in fact  show saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons here 's saturn with dione 
  thin they are with the moon enceladus now two of the forty seven moons that saturn has are standouts  and those are titan
 and enceladus titan is saturn 's largest moon and until cassini had arrived there was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar
  and it is a body that has long intrigued people who 've watched the planets  it
 has a very large  thick atmosphere  and in fact its surface environment was believed to be more like
 the environment we have here on the earth or at least had in the past than any other body in the solar system its
 atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen like you are breathing here in this room except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials
  like methane and propane and ethane  and these molecules high up in the atmosphere of titan get broken down and their products join together to make haze particles 
 this haze is ubiquitous it 's completely global and enveloping titan and that 's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum but these haze particles it was surmised before we got
  there with cassini
 over billions and billions of years gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge so like the equivalent the titan 
  equivalent of tar  or oil or what we didn 't know what but this is what we suspected and these molecules especially methane and ethane 
 and so
 it turns out that methane is to titan what water is to the earth  it 's a condensable in the atmosphere and so recognizing this circumstance
 brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities you can have methane clouds  ok and above those clouds you have this hundreds of
 kilometers of haze which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface the temperature at the surface is some three hundred and fifty degrees below zero fahrenheit 
 but despite that cold you could have rain falling down on the surface of titan and doing on titan what rain does on the earth it carves gullies it forms 
  rivers and cataracts  it can create canyons it can pool in large basins and craters
  it can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills down into the lowlands so stop and think for a minute try to imagine what the surface of titan
 might look like it 's dark 
 high noon on titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the earth  it 's cold it 's eerie  it 's misty it might be raining and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint thinner 
 laughter that is
 the view that we had of the surface of titan before we got there with cassini and i can
  tell you
 that what we have found on titan though it is not the same in detail is every bit as fascinating as that story is and for us it has been like the cassini people it has been like a jules verne adventure come true 
 as i said it has a thick extensive atmosphere this is a picture of titan  backlit by the sun with the rings as a beautiful backdrop
 and yet another moon there i don 't even know which one it is
 's a very extensive atmosphere we have
 instruments on cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere  and my camera system is one of them and we have taken pictures like this and what you see 
 is bright and dark regions and that 's about as far as it got for us it was so mystifying we couldn 't make out what we were seeing
  when you look closer at
 this region  
 you start to see things like sinuous channels we didn 't know you see a few round things this we later found out is in fact a crater but there are very few craters on the surface of titan  meaning it 's a very young surface 
 and there are features that look tectonic they look like they 've been pulled apart  whenever you see anything linear on a planet  it means there 's been a fracture  like a
  and so it 's been tectonically altered but we couldn 't make sense of our images  until six months after we got into orbit 
 an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of cassini 's investigation of titan and that was the deployment
 of the huygens probe the  european built huygens probe that cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system 
 we deployed it to the atmosphere of titan  it took two and a half hours to descend  and it landed on the surface and i just want to
  emphasize how significant an event this is this is a device of human making  
 and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history  it is so significant
 that in my mind  this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the u s and europe  and
  it was significant for another reason this is an international mission and this event was celebrated in europe in germany  and the celebratory presentations were given
 in english accents  and american accents  and german accents  and french and italian and dutch accents  
 it was a moving demonstration of what the words united nations are supposed
  to mean a true union of nations joined together in a
 colossal effort for good and in this case it was a massive undertaking
 to explore a planet  and to come to understand a planetary system that for all of human history had been unreachable and now humans had actually touched it 
 so it was i mean i 'm getting goose goose bumps just talking about it it was a tremendously emotional
  it 's something that i will personally never forget and you shouldn 't either 
 but anyway the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down and it also took panoramic pictures and i can 't tell you what it was like
 to see the first pictures of titan 's surface from the probe and this is what we saw  
 and it was a shocker because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be it
  an unambiguous
 pattern a geological pattern it 's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids  and you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge 
 and they converge into this channel here which drains into this region you are looking at a shoreline was this a shoreline of fluids we didn 't know  but this is somewhat of a shoreline this picture is taken at sixteen kilometers
  this is the picture taken at eight kilometers ok again the shoreline  okay now sixteen kilometers eight kilometers this is roughly
 an airline altitude if you were going to take an airplane trip across the u s you would be flying at these altitudes so this is the picture you would have
 at the window of titanian airlines as you fly across the surface
  and then finally the probe came to rest on the surface 
 and i 'm going to show you ladies and gentlemen the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system  and here is the horizon 
 ok these are probably water ice pebbles yes 
 and obviously
  it landed in one of these flat dark regions and it didn 't sink out of sight so it wasn 't fluid
 that we landed in what
 the probe came down in was basically the titan equivalent of a mud flat  this is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane
 and it 's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of
 titan through these channels that we saw and has drained over billions of years to fill in
 that is what the huygens probe landed in but still there was no
 sign in our images or even in the huygens ' images of any large open bodies of fluids  where were they it got even more puzzling when we found dunes  
 ok so this is our movie of the equatorial region of titan showing these dunes  these are dunes that are one hundred meters tall
  separated by a few kilometers and they go on for miles and miles and miles there 's hundreds up to a one thousand or one thousand two hundred miles of dunes  this is the saharan desert 
 of titan it 's obviously a place which is very dry  or you wouldn 't get dunes so again it got puzzling that there were no
  until finally we saw lakes in the polar regions and there is a lake scene in the south polar region of titan it 's about the size of lake ontario  and 
  then only a week and a half ago we flew over the north pole of titan and found again we found a
  during at least this season are apparently at the poles of
 titan and i think you would agree that we have found titan is a
 remarkable  mystical place  it 's exotic it 's alien  but yet strangely earth like and having earth like geological formations and a tremendous
 geographical diversity and
 is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the earth itself  and so now we
  go onto enceladus enceladus is a small moon it 's about a tenth the size of titan and you can see it here next to england just to show you the size this is not meant to be a threat 
 and enceladus is very white it 's very bright and its surface is obviously wrecked
 with fractures it is a very geologically active body but the mother lode of discoveries on enceladus
 was found at the south pole
 and we 're looking at the south pole here where we found this system of fractures and they 're a different color because they 're a different composition they are coated 
 these fractures are coated with organic materials 
 moreover this whole entire region  the south polar region has elevated temperatures it 's the hottest place on the planet
  on the body that 's as bizarre as finding that the antarctic on the earth is hotter than the tropics and then when we took
 additional pictures we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space and when we color code this image to bring out the faint light levels  
 we see
 that these jets feed a plume that in fact  we see in other images goes thousands of miles into the space above enceladus
  team and i have examined images like this and like this one and have
 thought about the other results from cassini  and we have arrived at the the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of enceladus  
 so we have possibly
  liquid water organic materials and excess heat in other words we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration or 
  in other words an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms and i don 't think i need to tell you
  in our solar system then that means by inference it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its thirteen point seven billion year history
  right now earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life it is precious  it is unique  it is still so far the only home we 've ever
  any of you were alert and coherent during the  1960s and
 we 'd forgive you if you weren 't  ok you would remember this very famous picture taken by the apollo eight astronauts in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight 
 it was the first time that earth was imaged from space and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe and
 our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet well we on cassini have taken an equivalent
  first a picture that no human eye has ever seen before it is a total eclipse of the sun seen from the other side of saturn  
 and in this impossibly beautiful picture 
 you see the main rings backlit by the sun you see the refracted image of the sun and you see this ring
 created in fact by the exhalations of enceladus  but as if that weren 't brilliant enough
 we can spot in this beautiful image sight of our own planet  cradled in the arms of saturn 's rings
