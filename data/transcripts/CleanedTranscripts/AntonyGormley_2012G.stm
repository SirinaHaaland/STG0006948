  tell you about
 why i became a sculptor  
 and you may think that sculptors well they deal with meta they deal with objects  they deal with
  what i care about most is
 making space and that 's what i 've called this talk making space 
 space that exists within us 
 and without us so when i was
 a child i don 't know how many of you grew up in the ' 50s but i was sent upstairs for an enforced rest
 's a really bad idea  i mean after lunch you 're you know you 're six and you want to
 go and climb a tree  but i had to go upstairs this tiny little room that was actually made out of an old balcony so it was incredibly hot  
 small and light 
 and i had to lie there it
 was ridiculous but anyway for some reason i promised myself that i wasn 't going to move
  that i was going to do this thing that mummy wanted me to do 
 and there i was lying there in this tiny space hot  dark claustrophobic
  behind my eyes  but it was really weird like after this went on for days weeks
  that space would get bigger and darker and cooler
 until i really looked forward to that half an hour
 of enforced immobility and rest  and i really looked forward
 to going to that place of darkness do
  if we do something completely different can we all just close our eyes for a minute now this isn 't going to be freaky it isn 't some cultic thing it 's just 
 it 's just i just would like us all to go there so i 'm going to do it too we 'll all be there together  so close your eyes for a minute 
 here we are in a space  the subjective collective space
 of the darkness of the body
  i think of this as the place of imagination 
 of potential  but what are its qualities  
 it is objectless there are no things in it 
 it is dimensionless it is limitless it is
 that 's the space that i think
 sculpture which is a bit of a paradox sculpture that is about making material propositions
 but i think that 's the space
 that sculpture can connect us with 
 so imagine we 're in the middle of america  you 're asleep  
 you wake up
 and without lifting your head from the earth on your sleeping bag you can see
 for seventy miles  
 this is a dry lake bed 
 i was young  
 i 'd just finished art school  i wanted to do something that was working directly with the world  
 directly with place this was a wonderful place
  it was it was a place where you could imagine that you were the
 the first person to be there it was a place where
 nothing very much had happened anyway  bear with me  i picked up a
 threw it as far as i was
  i then cleared all the stones within that radius and made a a pile 
 and that was the pile by the way  and then i stood on the pile  
 and threw all of those rocks out again  
 and here is
  doesn 't look very different from when he when he started 
 laughter what 's all the fuss about in fact chris was worried and said look don 't show them that slide because they 're just going to think you 're another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn 't do much 
 but the fact is this is
 evidence of a living body on other bodies
  rocks that have been the subject of
 geological formation  erosion  the action of time on objects  
 this is a place in a way that i just would like you to in a way look at differently
 because of this event that has happened in it a human event and in general it just asks us to look again
 at this world  so different from in a way  the world that we have been sharing with each other the technological world 
 to look again at the elemental world 
 the elemental world that we all live in is that space that we all visited together  the darkness of the body
  i wanted to start again with that environment  the environment of the intimate  subjective space that each of us lives in 
 but from the other side of appearance  
 so here is a
 daily activity of the studio you can see i don 't do much i 'm just standing there again with my eyes closed  
  this is an indexical register of a lived moment of a body in time can we
 map
 that space  using the language of neutrinos or cosmic rays  
 taking the bounding condition of the body as its limit  but in complete reversal
 of in a way the most traditional greek
  idea of pointing in the old days they used to take a lump of
 pentelic marble and drill from the surface in order to identify the skin  the appearance  what aristotle
 defined as the distinction between substance and appearance  the thing that makes things visible 
 but here we 're working from the other side 
 or can we do it
  an exclusive membrane this is a lead case made around
 the space that my body occupied  but it 's now void this is a work called learning to see it 's
 a bit of  
 well we could call it night
  that we don 't know about  dark matter 
 placed in space anyway  another version of a human space in space at large but i don 't know if you can see the eyes are
 indicated they 're closed it 's called learning to see because it 's about
 an object that hopefully works reflexively and talks about that
  vision or connection with the darkness of the body that i see as a space of potential  
 can we do it another way  using the language of particles around a nucleus  and talk about the body
 as an energy center no longer about statues no longer having to take that duty of standing the standing of a human body  or the standing of a statue release
  it allow it to be
 an energy field a space in space that talks about human human life 
 between becoming an entropy
 as a sort of concentration of attention 
 a human place of possibility in space at large 
 is there another way
 dark matter now placed
 against a horizon  if minds live in bodies if bodies live in clothes and then in rooms and then
 in buildings and then in cities 
 do they also have a final skin and is that
  trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon  
 can we use  in a way  a body
 as an empty catalyst for a kind of empathy with the experience of 
 as it is lived as
  as i am standing here in front of you
 trying to feel and make a connection
 in this space time that we are sharing 
 can we use at it were the memory of a body 
 of a human space in space to catalyze an experience  again  firsthand experience of elemental time 
 human time
 industrial time  tested against the time of the tides in which these memories of
 a particular body that could be any body  multiplied as in the time of
 mechanical reproduction many times  placed over three square miles
  in different conditions of day and night  you can see this work it 's on on the mouth of the mersey just outside liverpool  
 and there you can see what a liverpool sea looks like on a typical afternoon  
 the pieces appear and disappear  but maybe more importantly this is just looking north from the center of the installation
 they create a field a field that involves living and the surrogate bodies
 in a kind of relation a relation with each other
 and a relation with that limit  the edge  the horizon 
 just moving
  the first body  the biological body with the second the body of architecture and the built environment  this is a work called room for the great australian desert 
 it 's in an undefined location and i 've never published where it is it 's an object for the
  the darkness of the body  now held within this bunker shape of the minimum position that a body needs to occupy a crouching
 body there 's a hole
 at the anus  penis level there are holes at ears there are no holes at the eyes there 's a slot for the mouth  it 's two and a half inches thick  concrete
  this is just simply asking again as if we had arrived
 for the first time what is the relationship of the human project to time and
  taking that idiom of as it were the darkness of the body transferred
 to architecture can you use architectural space not for living but as a metaphor 
 and use its systolic diastolic
 smaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of firsthand somatic narrative
 for a journey through
  space light and darkness  this is a work of
 some proportion and some weight
 that makes the body into a city an aggregation of cells that are all interconnected
 and that allow certain visual access at certain places
  the
 last work that i just wanted to share with you is blind light which is perhaps
 the most open work  
 and in a conference of radical openness i think maybe this is as radical as i get  
 using light and water vapor as my materials 
 here is a box
 filled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure with a cloud
 and with very bright light  as you walk towards the  ever open threshold you disappear  
 both to yourselves
 and to others if you hold your hand out in front of you you can 't see it if you look down
  down you can 't see your feet  you are now consciousness
 without an object freed from the dimensionful and measured
 way in which life links us to the obligatory
  but this is a space that is actually
 filled with people disembodied voices and out of that ambient
 environment  when people come close to your own
 body zone very close they appear to you as representations  when they appear close to the edge  they are
  representations in which the viewers have become the viewed
