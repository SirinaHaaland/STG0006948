  racing is a funny old business we make a new car every year and then we spend the rest of the season trying to understand what it is we 've built
 to make it better to make it faster and then the next year we start again now the car you see in front of
  you is quite complicated
 the chassis is made up of about eleven thousand components the engine another six thousand the electronics about eight and a half thousand
 so there 's about twenty five thousand things there that can go wrong
 so motor racing is very much about attention to detail
 the other thing about formula one in particular is
  we 're always changing the car we 're always trying to make it faster
 so every two weeks we will be making about five thousand new components to fit to the car
 five to ten percent of the race car will be different every two weeks of the year
 so how do we do that well we start our life with the racing car we have a lot of sensors on the car to
  measure things
 on the race car in front of you here there are about one hundred and twenty sensors when it goes into a race it 's measuring all sorts of things around the car
 that data is logged we 're logging about five hundred different parameters within the data systems about thirteen thousand health parameters
 and events to say when things are not working the way they should do
  and we 're sending that data back to the garage using telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second
 so during a two hour race each car will be sending seven hundred and fifty million numbers
 that 's twice as many numbers as words that each of us speaks in a lifetime it 's a huge amount of data
 but it 's not enough just to to have data and measure it you need to be able to do something with it
  so we 've spent a lot of time and effort in turning the data into stories
 to be able to tell what 's the state of the engine how are the tires degrading what 's the situation with fuel consumption
 so all of this is taking data and turning it into knowledge that we can act upon
  okay so let 's have a look at a little bit of data let 's pick a bit of data from another three month old patient this is a child
 and what you 're seeing here is real data and on the far right hand side where everything starts getting a little bit catastrophic
 that is the patient going into cardiac arrest it was deemed to be an unpredictable event
 this was a heart attack that no one could see coming
 but when we look at the information there we can
  see that things are starting to become a little fuzzy about five minutes or so before the cardiac arrest
 we can see small changes in things like the heart rate moving these were all undetected by normal thresholds which would be applied to data
 so the question is why couldn 't we see it
 was this a predictable event
 can we look more at the patterns in the data to be able to do
  things better
 so
 this is a child about the same age as the racing car on stage three months old
 it 's a patient with a heart problem now when you look at some of the data on the screen above things like heart rate
 pulse oxygen respiration rates
 they 're all unusual for a normal child but they 're quite
  for the child there
 and so one of the challenges you have in health care is how can i look at the patient in front of me
 have something which is specific for her and be able to detect when things start to change when things start to deteriorate
 because like a racing car any patient when things start to go bad you have a short time to make a difference
 so what we
  did is we took a data system which we run every two weeks of the year in formula one
 and we installed it on the hospital computers at birmingham children 's hospital
 we streamed data from the bedside instruments in their pediatric intensive care
 so that we could both look at the data in real time and more importantly to store the data so that we could start to learn from it
  and then we applied an application on top
 which would allow us to tease out the patterns in the data in real time so we could see what was happening so we could determine when things started to change
 now in motor racing we 're all a little bit ambitious audacious a little bit arrogant sometimes
 so we decided we would also look at the the children as they were being
  to intensive care why should we wait until they arrived in the hospital before we started to look
 and so we installed a real time link between the the ambulance and the hospital just using normal three g telephony
 to send that data so that the ambulance became an extra bed in intensive care
 and then we started looking at the data
  so the wiggly lines at the top all the colors this is the normal sort of data you would see on a monitor heart rate pulse oxygen within the blood
 and respiration
 the lines on the bottom the blue and the red these are the interesting ones the red line is showing an automated version of
  the early warning score that birmingham children 's hospital were already running they 'd been running that since two thousand and eight
 and already have stopped cardiac arrests and distress within the hospital
 the blue line is an indication of when patterns start to change
 and immediately before we even started putting in clinical interpretation we can see that the data is speaking to us it 's telling us that something is going wrong
 the plot with the red and the green blobs
 this is plotting different components of the data against each other
 the green is us learning what is normal for that child we call it the cloud of normality
 and when things start to change when conditions start to deteriorate we move into the red line
 there 's no rocket science here it is displaying data that exists already in a different way
 to amplify it to provide cues to the doctors to the nurses so they can see what 's happening
 in the same way that a good racing driver relies on cues to decide when to apply the brakes when to turn into a corner
 we need to help our physicians and our nurses to see when things are starting to go wrong
 so we have a very ambitious program
  think that the race is on to do something differently
 we are thinking big it 's the right thing to do
 we have an approach which if it 's successful there 's no reason why it should stay within a hospital it can go beyond the walls
 with wireless connectivity these days there is no reason why patients doctors and nurses always have to be in the same place at the same time
 and meanwhile
  meanwhile we 'll take our little three month old baby keep taking it to the track keeping it safe and making it faster and better
 thank you very much
