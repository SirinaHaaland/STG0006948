  was walking to market that morning ran towards where the gunshot had come from and found a young man writhing in agony
  on the floor  clearly shot by a dueling wound  
 the young man 's name was evariste galois  he was a  well known revolutionary in paris at the time 
 galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother  
 and the last words he said to his brother were don 't cry for me alfred i need all the courage i can muster to die at the age of
  twenty 
 it wasn 't in fact revolutionary politics for which galois was famous  
 but a few years earlier while still at school he 'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time  
 and he wrote to the academicians in paris trying to explain his theory  but the academicians couldn 't understand anything that he
  this is how he wrote most of his mathematics 
 so the night before that duel he realized this possibly is his last chance to try and explain his great breakthrough  
 so he stayed up the whole night  writing away  trying to explain his ideas  and as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny he left this pile of papers on the table
 for the next generation  maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed  but contained inside
  those documents
 was a new language a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science namely symmetry 
 now symmetry is almost nature 's language it helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world 
 for example molecular structure what crystals are possible we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry 
 in microbiology you really don 't want to get a
  symmetrical object because they are generally rather nasty the swine flu virus at the moment is a symmetrical object  and it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well  
 but on a larger scale of biology actually symmetry is very important because it actually communicates genetic information i 've taken two pictures here and i 've made them artificially symmetrical
  and if i ask you which of these you find more beautiful you 're probably drawn to the lower two 
 because it is hard to make symmetry and if you can make yourself symmetrical you 're sending out a sign that you 've got good genes you 've got a good upbringing and therefore you 'll make a good mate so symmetry is a language which can help to communicate genetic information 
 symmetry can also help us to explain what 's happening in the large hadron collider in cern or what 's not happening in the large hadron collider in cern to be able to make predictions about the
  particles we might see there  it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape in a higher dimensional space  
 and i think galileo summed up very nicely the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us he wrote the universe cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written 
 it is written in mathematical language and the letters are triangles
  circles and other geometric figures  without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word 
 but it 's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry  artists too love to play around with symmetry
 they also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it here is thomas mann talking about symmetry in the magic mountain he has a character describing the snowflake  
 and he says he shuddered at its perfect precision
  found it deathly the very marrow of death 
 but what artists like to do is to set up expectations of symmetry and then break them  
 and a beautiful example of this i found actually when i visited a colleague of mine in japan professor kurokawa  and he took me up to the temples in nikko  and just after this photo was taken 
 we walked up the stairs  and the gateway you see behind has eight columns with beautiful symmetrical designs on
 are exactly the same  and the eighth one is turned upside down  and i said to professor kurokawa wow the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that
 they 'd made a mistake and put this one upside down and he said no no no it was a very deliberate act and he referred me to this lovely quote from the japanese essays in idleness from the 14th century 
 in which the essayist
  in everything uniformity is undesirable leaving something incomplete makes it interesting and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth 
 even when building the imperial palace they always leave one place unfinished  
 but if i had to choose
 one building in the world to be cast out on a desert island to live the rest of my life being an addict of symmetry  i would probably choose the alhambra in granada this is a palace celebrating symmetry  recently i took my family we do these rather kind of
  nerdy mathematical trips  which my family love this is my son tamer you can see he 's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the alhambra  
 but i wanted to try and enrich him i think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn 't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in  
 so i wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the alhambra
 you see it already immediately you go in the reflective symmetry in the water
  water  but it 's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening the moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls so they explored a more geometric art  
 and so what is symmetry the alhambra somehow asks all of these questions  what is symmetry  
 when [ there ] are two of these walls do they have the same symmetries can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the alhambra  
 and it was galois who produced a language
  to be able to answer some of these questions
 for galois 
 symmetry unlike for thomas mann which was something still and deathly for galois symmetry was all about motion  what can you do to a symmetrical object  move it in some way so it looks the same as before you moved it 
 i like to describe it as the magic trick moves what can you do to something you close your eyes i do something put it back down again it looks like it did before it started
 so for example the walls in the alhambra i can take all of these tiles and fix them at the yellow place rotate them by ninety degrees put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there and if you open your eyes again you wouldn 't know that they 'd moved  
 but it 's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry inside the alhambra  
 but it 's also about producing a language to describe this and the power of mathematics is often to to change one thing
  into another to change geometry into language so i 'm going to take you through  perhaps push you a little bit mathematically so brace yourselves
 push you a little bit to understand how this language works which enables us to capture what is symmetry so
 let 's take these two symmetrical objects here  let 's take the twisted six pointed starfish  what can i do to the starfish which makes it look the same well there i rotated it by a sixth of a turn  and still it looks
  like it did before i started  i could rotate it by a third of a turn  or a half a turn  or put it back down on its image or two thirds of a turn  
 and a fifth symmetry i can rotate it by five sixths of a turn  and those are things that i can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before i started  
 now for galois there was actually a sixth symmetry 
 can anybody think what else i could do to this which would leave it
  like i did before i started  
 i can 't flip it because i 've put a little twist on it haven 't i it 's got no reflective symmetry  
 but what i could do is just leave it where it is pick it up and put it down again 
 and for galois this was like the zeroth symmetry  actually the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept seventh century a d 
  it seems
 mad to talk about nothing  and this is the same idea this is a symmetrical so everything has symmetry where you just leave it where it is so this object has six symmetries 
 and what about the triangle  well i can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise or a third of a turn anticlockwise  but now this has some reflectional symmetry  i can reflect it in the line through x or the line through y  
  five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry where i just pick it up
 and leave it where it is 
 so both of these objects have six symmetries 
 now i 'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport  and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it so here is a little question for you and i
 'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk for the person who gets closest to the answer 
  how many symmetries does a rubik 's cube have how many things can i do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube okay 
 so i want you to think about that problem as we go on and count how many symmetries there are and there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end  
 but let 's go back down
 to symmetries that i got for these two objects what galois realized it isn 't just the individual symmetries but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object
  if i do one magic trick move followed by another  the combination is a third magic trick move 
 and here we see galois starting to develop a language to see the substance of the things unseen the sort of abstract idea of the symmetry underlying this physical object 
 for example what if i turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn  and then a third of a turn  so i 've given names the capital letters a
 f are the names for the rotations b for example rotates the little yellow dot to the b on the starfish  and so on so what if i do b  which is a sixth of a 
  turn  followed by c  which is a third of a turn  well let 's do that a sixth of a turn  
  the algebra of these symmetries work i do one followed by another the answer is it 's rotation d half a turn  
 what i if i did it in the other order would it make any difference let 's see let 's do the third of the turn first  and then the sixth of a turn of course it doesn 't make any difference  it still ends 
  up at half a turn  and there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other 
  let 's see what happens if we do two symmetries with the triangle one after the other let 's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise and reflect in the line through x well
 the combined effect is as if i had just done the reflection in the line through z to start with 
 now let 's do it in a different order  
 let 's do the reflection in x first  followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise  the combined effect the triangle ends up somewhere
  completely different it 's as if it was reflected in the line through  y now it matters what order you do the operations in 
 and this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects they both have six symmetries so why shouldn 't we say they have the same symmetries  but the way the symmetries interact 
 enable us we 've now got a language to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different  and you can try this when you go down to the pub later on
  take a beer mat and rotate it by a
 quarter of a turn  then flip it and then do it in the other order  and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction 
 now galois produced some laws for how these tables how symmetries interact it 's almost like little sudoku tables you don 't see any symmetry twice in any row or column 
 and using those rules he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects
 with six symmetries 
 and they 'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle  or the symmetries of the six pointed starfish 
 i think this is an amazing development it 's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry in the front here i 've got one two three people sitting on one two three chairs  the people and the chairs are very different
  but the number  the abstract idea of the number is the same  
 and we can see this now we go back to the walls in the alhambra  here are two very different walls very different geometric pictures but using the language of galois we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same 
 for example let 's take this beautiful wall with the triangles with a little twist on them you can rotate them by a sixth of a turn if you ignore the colors  
  're not matching up the colors but the shapes match up if i rotate by a sixth of a turn around the point where all the triangles meet what about the center of a triangle  i can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle  and everything matches up 
 and then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge where i can rotate by one hundred and eighty degrees 
 and all the tiles match up again  
 so rotate along halfway along the edge and they all match up  
 now let 's move to the very
  wall in the alhambra  and we find the same symmetries here and the same interaction so there was a sixth of a turn a third of a turn where the z pieces meet  
 and the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars  
 and although these walls look very different galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same  and it 's a symmetry we call 
  is another example in the alhambra  this is a wall a ceiling and a floor they all look very different but this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical 
  abstract object which we call 4 4 2 nothing to do with football but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn  and one by half a turn 
  it turns out they almost did you can prove using galois ' language there
 are actually only seventeen different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the alhambra  
 and they if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one  it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these seventeen 
 but these are things that we can see and the power of galois ' mathematical language is it also allows us to create symmetrical objects
 in the unseen world beyond the 
 all the way through to the four or five or infinite dimensional space  and that 's where i work i create mathematical objects symmetrical objects using galois ' language 
 in very high dimensional spaces so i think it 's a great example of things unseen which the power of mathematical language allows you to
  like galois i stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you and i 've got a picture of it here  well  unfortunately it isn 't really a picture if i could have my 
  board at the side here  great excellent here we are unfortunately i can 't show you a a picture of this symmetrical object  but here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact 
 craters on the moon or new species of animals  so i 'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object which hasn 't been named before and this thing
  species die away and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode but this mathematical object will live forever  it will make you immortal in order to win this symmetrical
  what you have to do is to answer the question i asked you at the beginning how many symmetries does a rubik 's cube have
  okay i 'm going to sort you out rather than you all shouting out i want you to count how many digits there are in that number  okay  
 if you 've got it as a factorial you 've got to expand the factorials  okay  now if you want to play  i want you to stand up  okay if you think
 you 've got an estimate for how many digits right we 've already got one competitor here
 if you all stay down he wins it automatically
 excellent so we 've got four here  five six great excellent that should get us going all right 
 anybody with five or less digits you 've got to sit down because you 've underestimated  five or less digits 
 tens of thousands you 've got to sit down  sixty digits or more you 've got to sit down you 've overestimated
  how many digits are there in your number two so you should have sat down earlier
 the other ones who sat sat down during the twenty up again okay  if i told you twenty or less stand up because
 this one i think there were a few here the people who just last sat down  okay how many
  okay good how many do you have in yours 
 eighteen so it goes to this lady here twenty one is the closest it actually has the number of symmetries in the rubik 's cube has twenty five digits so now i need to name this object 
 so what is your name
  i need your surname symmetrical objects generally
  there we go that 's your new symmetrical object you are now immortal
  in everything uniformity is undesirable leaving something incomplete makes it interesting
  and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth
