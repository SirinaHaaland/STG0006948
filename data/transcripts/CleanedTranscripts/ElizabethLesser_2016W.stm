  many of us  i 've had several careers in my life and although they 've been varied 
 my first job set the foundation for all of them  i was a
 valuable and sometimes surprising things like how to start a car at 2am when it 's ten degrees below zero 
 or how to revive a father who 's fainted at the sight of blood 
 or how to cut the umbilical cord just so to make a beautiful belly button 
 but those aren 't the things that stuck with me or guided me when i stopped being a midwife
 other jobs what stuck with me was this bedrock belief that each one of us comes into this world with a unique worth  
 when i looked into the face of a newborn i caught a glimpse of that worthiness that
 sense of unapologetic selfhood that unique spark
  i use the word soul to describe that spark because it 's the only word in english that comes close to naming what each baby brought into the room
  every newborn was as singular as a snowflake a matchless mash up of biology
  and then that baby grows up and in order to fit into the family to conform to the culture to the community to the gender 
 that little one begins to cover its soul layer by layer  
 we 're born this way but but
 as we grow a lot of things happen to us that make us
  to hide our soulful eccentricities and authenticity we 've all done this everyone in this room is a former baby 
 with a distinctive birthright  
 but as adults we spend so much of our time uncomfortable in our own skin like we
 not yet  their message to me was uncover your soul and look for that
 in everyone else it 's still there  
 and here 's what i learned from laboring women  their message was about staying open  even when things are
  a woman 's cervix normally looks like this it 's a tight little muscle at the base of the uterus 
 and during labor it has to stretch from this
 to this ouch  if you fight against that pain 
 you just create more pain and you block what wants to be born i
 'll never forget the magic that would happen
 when a woman stopped resisting the pain
 and opened  it was as if the forces of the universe took notice
 and sent in a wave of help  
 i never forgot that message and now when difficult or painful things happen to me in my life or my work of course at first i resist them  but then i remember what i learned from the mothers
  curious ask the pain what it 's come to deliver something new wants to be born 
 and there was one more big soulful lesson and that one i learned from albert einstein he wasn 't at any of the births but 
 it was a lesson about time 
 at the end of his life  albert einstein concluded that our normal
  experience of life
 is an illusion  we run round and round faster and faster trying to get somewhere  and all the while  
 underneath surface time is this whole other dimension
 where the past and the present and the future
  there 's nowhere to get to albert einstein called this state this
 only being and he said when he experienced it he knew sacred awe  
 when i was delivering babies i was forced off the hamster wheel sometimes i had to sit for
 days  hours and hours just breathing with the parents just being
 and i got a big dose of sacred awe 
 so those are the three lessons i took with me from midwifery one uncover your soul 
 when things get difficult or painful  try to stay open  and three  every now and then step off your hamster wheel
 into deep time
 those lessons have served me throughout my life  but they really served me recently when i took on
 the most important job of my life thus far  two years ago my younger sister
 came out of remission from a rare blood cancer and the only treatment left for her was a bone marrow transplant and
  against the odds  we found a match for her who turned out to be me 
 i come from a family of four girls and when
 my sisters found out that i was my sister 's perfect genetic match their reaction was
  society there 's lots of things there 's love and there 's friendship and there 's protection but there 's also jealousy
 and competition
 and rejection and attack  in 
 that 's where we start assembling many of those first layers that cover our soul when i discovered i was my sister 's match
  i went into research mode  and i discovered that
 the premise of transplants is pretty straightforward you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy  
 and then you replace that marrow with several million healthy marrow cells from a
  and then you do everything you can to make sure that those new cells engraft in the patient  
 i also learned that bone marrow transplants are fraught with danger 
 if my sister made it through the 
 chemotherapy  she still would face other challenges my cells might
  and her body might reject my cells they call this rejection or attack  and both could kill her 
 rejection attack  those words had a familiar ring in the context of being siblings 
 my sister and i had a long history of love  but we also had a long history of rejection and attack 
 from minor misunderstandings to bigger betrayals  
 we didn 't have
  the kind of the relationship where we talked about the deeper stuff 
 but like many siblings and like people in all kinds of relationships we were hesitant to tell our truths  to
 reveal our wounds  to admit our wrongdoings  but when i learned about
 the dangers of rejection or attack i thought it 's time to change this
  what if we left the bone marrow transplant
 up to the doctors but did something that we later came to call our soul marrow transplant 
 what if we faced any pain we had caused each other and instead of rejection or attack  could we listen 
 could we forgive could we merge would that teach our
  cells to do the same 
 to woo my skeptical sister i turned to my parents ' holy text the new yorker magazine 
 i sent her a cartoon from its pages
 as a way of explaining why we should visit a therapist before having my bone marrow harvested and transplanted into her body here it
 i have never forgiven him for that thing i made up in my head 
 i told my sister
 we had probably been doing the same thing  carting around made up stories
 in our heads that kept us separate  and i told her that after the transplant all of the blood flowing in her veins would be
  my blood made from my marrow cells  
 and that inside the nucleus of each of those cells is a complete set of my dna 
 i will be swimming around in you for the rest of your life i told my slightly horrified sister 
 i think we better clean up our relationship a health crisis
  makes people do all sorts of risky things  like quitting a job or jumping out of an airplane
 and in the case of my sister saying yes 
 to several therapy sessions  during which we got down to the marrow 
 we looked at and released years of stories and assumptions about each other
  and blame and shame until all that was left was love 
 people have said i was brave to undergo the bone marrow harvest but i don 't think so 
 what felt brave to me was that other kind of harvest and transplant the soul
  emotionally naked with another human being putting aside pride and defensiveness  lifting the layers
 and sharing with each other our vulnerable souls  
 i called on those midwife lessons  uncover your soul 
 open to what 's scary and painful  look for
  here i am with my marrow cells after the harvest that 's they call it harvest like it 's some kind of bucolic 
 which i can assure you it is not  
 and here is my brave brave sister receiving my cells 
 after the transplant we began to spend more and more time together it was as if we were little girls again
  the past and the present merged  we entered deep time  
 i left the hamster wheel of work and life to join my sister
 on that lonely island
 of illness and healing  we spent months together in the isolation unit in the hospital and in her home
  our fast paced society does not support
 or even value this kind of work  we see it as a disruption of real life and important work  
 we worry about the emotional drain and the financial cost and yes 
 there is a financial cost but i was paid
 in the kind of currency our culture seems to have
  forgotten all about i was paid in love  i was paid in soul  i was paid in my sister 
 my sister said the year after transplant was the best year of her life which was surprising she suffered so much  
 but she said life never tasted as sweet  and that because of the
 soul baring and the truth telling we had done with each other she became more unapologetically herself with everyone 
 she said things she 'd always needed to say she did things she always wanted to do 
 the same happened for me i became braver about being authentic with the people in my life  
 i said my truths
  truths  but more important than that i sought the truth of others
  it wasn 't until the final chapter of this story that i realized just how well midwifery had trained me 
 after that best year of my sister 's life the cancer came roaring back 
 and this time there was nothing more the doctors could do they gave her just a couple of months to
  live 
 the night before my sister died  
 i sat by her bedside  she was so small and thin 
 i could see the blood pulsing in her neck it was my blood 
 her blood our blood  
 when she died part of
  tried to make sense of it all how becoming one with each other
 had made us more ourselves our soul selves  and how by
 facing and opening to the pain of our past we 'd finally been delivered to each other 
 and how by stepping out of time  we would now be connected forever 
 my sister left
  me with so many things  and i 'm going to leave you now with just one of them  you don 't have to wait for a 
  situation to clean up the relationships that matter to you to offer the marrow of your soul
 and to seek it in another  we can all do this  we can be like a new
  kind of first responder like the one to take the first courageous step
 toward the other and to do something or try to do something other than rejection or attack  
 we can do this with our siblings and our mates
 and our friends
  we can do this with the disconnection and the discord all around us  we can do this for the soul of the world
