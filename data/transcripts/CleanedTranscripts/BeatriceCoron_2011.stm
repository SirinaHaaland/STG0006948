  i cut stories  so my process is very straightforward
  i take a piece of paper  i visualize my story 
 sometimes i sketch sometimes i don 't  and as my image is already inside the paper  
 i just have to remove what 's not from that story  
 so i didn 't come to papercutting in a straight line 
 in fact  i see it more as a spiral  
 i was not born with a blade
  in my hand  
 and i don 't remember papercutting as a child 
 as a teenager  i was sketching  drawing  and i wanted to be an artist  
 but i was also a rebel  
 and i left everything and went for a long series of
  i have been a shepherdess a truck driver 
 a factory worker a cleaning lady  i worked in tourism for one year in mexico 
 one year in egypt  i moved for two years in taiwan  
 and then i settled in new york
 where i became a tour guide  and i still worked as a tour leader
  leader  traveled back and forth in china tibet and central asia  
 so of course it took time and i was nearly forty  and i decided it 's time to start as an artist
  and you can use it in a lot of different ways  and i chose the language of silhouette
 because graphically it 's very efficient  and it 's also just getting to the essential of things  
 so the word silhouette comes from a minister of finance etienne de silhouette
  and he slashed so many budgets
 that people said they couldn 't afford paintings anymore  and they needed to have their portrait
 and people told me like these thirty six views of the empire state building they told me you 're making artist books 
 so artist books have a lot of definitions they come in a lot of different shapes  
 but to me they are fascinating objects to
  they can be with words or without words  
 and i have a passion for images and for words  
 i love pun and the relation to the unconscious  
 i love oddities of languages  and everywhere i lived i learned the languages but never mastered them  
 so i 'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in
  different languages  so as you can guess my mother tongue is french 
 and my daily language is english  
 so i did a series of work where it was identical words in french and in english  
 so one of these works is the spelling spider 
 so the spelling spider is a cousin of the spelling bee
  bee but it 's much more connected to the web and
 this spider spins a bilingual alphabet  so you can read
 and substantives  so if you don 't know one of these languages  it 's instant learning  
 and one ancient form of the book is scrolls 
 so scrolls are very convenient  because you can create a large image
  so the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image
 so it makes a very freestyle architecture  
 and i 'm making all those kinds of windows  
 so it 's to look beyond the surface it 's to have a look at different worlds and very often i 've been an outsider so
  i want to see how things work and what 's happening  so each window
 is an image and is a world
 that i often revisit  and i revisit this world thinking about the image
 about what we want to do and what are the
  that we have with the expressions  it 's all if  so what if
 we were living in balloon houses  
 it would make a very uplifting world  
 and we would leave a very low footprint on the planet it would be so light  
 so sometimes i view
 from the inside like
  egocentricity
 and the inner circles 
 sometimes it 's a global view to see our common roots and how we can use them to catch dreams  
 and we can use them also as a safety net  and my
  'm influenced by everything i read  everything i see i have some stories that are humorous
  of sugar
 with some sweet moments in between  
 and sometimes i have an emotional response to news such as the two thousand and ten haitian earthquake 
 other times it 's not even my stories
  they have a place to go back to look at their life and its possibilities  i call them freudian cities  
 i cannot speak for all my images so
  just go through a few of my worlds just with the title
  and at one point i had to do the whole nine yards
 so it 's actually a papercut that 's nine yards long 
 so in life and in papercutting  everything is connected one story leads to another 
 i was also interested in the physicality of this format because you have to walk to see it 
 and parallel to my cutting is my running  i started with small
 images i started with a few miles larger images i started to run marathons  then i went to
  papercutting marathon at the museum of arts and design in new york city 
 the result is hells and heavens it 's two panels thirteen ft high  they were installed in the museum on two floors
  but in fact it 's a continuous image and i call it hells and heavens because it 's daily hells and daily heavens  there is no border in between some people are born in hells 
 and against all odds they make it to heavens  other people make the opposite trip 
 that 's the border you have sweatshops in hells you have people renting their wings in the heavens  
 and then you have all those individual stories where sometimes we
  even have the same action and the result puts you in hells or in heavens  
 so the whole hells and heavens is about free will
 and determinism  and in papercutting you have the drawing as the structure itself
  so you can take it off the wall  
 here it 's an artist book installation called identity project 
 it 's not autobiographical identities  
 they are more our social identities  
 and then you can just walk behind them and try them on  so it 's like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity
 that 's another artist book project in fact in the picture you have two of them 
 it 's one i 'm wearing and one that 's on exhibition at the center for books arts in new york city  
 why do i call it a book it 's called fashion statement and there are quotes about fashion so you can
  definition of artist book is very generous  
 so artist books you take them off the wall you take them for a walk you can also install them as public art  
 here it 's in scottsdale  arizona and it 's called floating memories so it 's regional memories  
 and they are just randomly moved by the wind
  i love public art  and i entered
 competitions for a long time 
 after eight years of rejection  i was thrilled to get my first commission with the percent for art in new york city  
 it was for a merger station for emergency workers and firemen 
 i made an artist book
 that 's in stainless steel instead of paper  i called it working in the same direction 
 but i added weathervanes on both sides to show that they cover all directions 
 with public art  i could also make cut glass here it 's faceted glass in the bronx 
 and each time i make public art i want something that
  's really relevant to the place it 's installed so for the subway in new york i saw
 a correspondence between riding the subway and reading  
 it is travel in time travel on time 
 and bronx literature it 's all about bronx writers and their stories
  another glass project is in a public library in san jose  california  
 so i made a vegetable point of view of the growth of san jose  so i started in the center with the acorn
 for the ohlone indian civilization then i have the fruit from europe for the ranchers  and then the fruit of the world
 for silicon valley today  and it 's still growing  
 so the technique it 's cut sandblasted  etched and printed glass into architectural glass 
 and outside the library i wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind  i took
  in their title
 and i used them to make an orchard walk with these fruits of knowledge  
 i also planted the bibliotree  
 so it 's a tree  and in its trunk you have the roots of languages  
 and it 's all about international writing systems  and on the branches you have library material
  you can also have function and form with public art  so in aurora colorado it 's a bench  but you have a bonus with this bench  
 because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts you will walk away with
 temporary branding of the story element on your thighs 
 another functional work it 's in the south
  side of chicago for a subway station  and it 's called seeds of the future are planted today 
 it 's a story about transformation and connections  
 so it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the commuter  and not to have objects falling on the rails 
 to be able to change fences and window guards
 into flowers it 's fantastic  
 and here i 've been working for the last three years with a south bronx developer to bring art to life to low income buildings and affordable housing  
 so each building has its own personality  and sometimes it 's about a legacy
 of the neighborhood like in morrisania about the jazz
  history  and for other projects like in paris it 's about the name of the street it 's called rue des prairies
 prairie street  so i brought back the rabbit the dragonfly 
 to stay in that street  and in two thousand and nine  i was asked
 to make a poster to be placed in the subway cars in new york city for a year
  so that was a very captive audience  and i wanted to give them an escape  
 i created all around town 
 it is a papercutting  and then after i added color on the computer  so i can call it
  kind of making papercuttings and adding other techniques  
 but the result is always to have stories  so the stories they have a lot of possibilities  they have a lot of scenarios 
 i don 't know the stories  i take images from our global imagination from clich from things we are thinking about from history  
  and everybody 's a narrator because everybody has a story to tell but more important is everybody has to make a story to make sense of the world 
 and in all these universes it 's like imagination is the vehicle to be transported with  but the destination is our minds
 and how we can reconnect with the essential and with the magic  and it 's what story cutting is all about
