  i decided to create
 an art piece in manshiyat naser 
 the neighborhood of the cairo garbage collectors in egypt  i never thought this project would be the most amazing human experience that i would ever live 
  this humanist intention
 of beautifying a poor and neglected neighborhood by bringing art to it
 and hopefully shining light on this isolated community  
 the first time i heard about this christian coptic community was in two thousand and nine when the egyptian authorities under the regime of hosni mubarak decided to slaughter three hundred thousand pigs using the pretext of
  are pig breeders their pigs and other animals are fed with the organic waste that they collect on a daily basis this event killed their livelihood  the first time
 it felt like a maze  
 i was looking for the st simon monastery on the top of the muqattam mountain so you go right then straight then right again then left to reach all the way to the top  
 but to reach there you must dodge
  with garbage and slalom between the tuk tuks the fastest vehicle to move around in the neighborhood  
 the smell of the garbage unloaded from those trucks was intense and the noise of the traffic was loud and overbearing  add to it
 the din created by the crushers in those warehouses along the way from outside it looks chaotic  but everything is perfectly organized
  collecting the garbage of cairo and sorting it in their own neighborhood for decades  they have developed one of the most efficient and highly profitable systems on a global 
 the place is perceived as dirty marginalized and segregated because of their association with the trash  so my initial idea was to create an
  a piece that you can only see from one vantage point i wanted to challenge myself artistically by painting over several buildings and
 having it only fully visible from one point on the muqattam mountain the muqattam mountain is the pride of the community this is where they built the st simon monastery a 
 cave church that they carved into the mountain itself so the first time i stood on top of the mountain and i looked at the neighborhood i asked myself
 on earth will i convince all those owners to let me paint on their buildings and then magd came magd is a
 guide from the church he told me the only person i needed to convince was father samaan who is the leader of the community  
 but to convince father samaan i needed to convince mario who is a polish artist who moved to cairo twenty years ago and who created all the artwork of the cave church
 am really grateful to mario  he was the key of the project  
 he managed to get me a meeting with father samaan and surprisingly  he loved the idea  he asked me about where i painted before and how i will make it happen  and he was mainly concerned by what i was going to write 
 in every work that i create i write messages with my style of arabic
  i make sure those messages are relevant to the place where i am painting
 but have this universal dimension so anybody around the world can relate to it 
 so for manshiyat naser i decided to write in arabic the words of  st athanasius of alexandria a coptic bishop from the third century who said
  community felt connected to the words and for me this quote was perfectly reflecting the spirit of the project  
 so father samaan blessed the project  and his approval brought all the residents on board
 hundreds of liters of paint 
 a dozen blue manual lifts  several trips back and forth to cairo a strong and solid team from france north africa  middle east and the us and after a year of planning and
  there we are my team and some members from the local community creating a piece that will spread over fifty buildings some
 filling up the space of the calligraphy that i trace with colors  here some blue there some yellow there some orange some others carrying some sand bags and putting them on the top of the buildings to hold those manual
  assembling and disassembling those same lifts and moving them around the different buildings 
 at the beginning of the project
 i numbered all those buildings on my sketch  and there was no real interaction with the community people didnt get the point of all this 
 but fast enough those building numbers became family names  
 the first building was the house of uncle ibrahim
  such an enthusiastic person he was always singing and making jokes  and
 his daughters and sons
 saved me from his bull who wanted to attack me on the fourth floor 
 actually the bull saw me from the window and came out on the balcony yeah 
 uncle ibrahim was always hanging out on the balcony and talking to me while i was painting  
 i remember him saying that he didnt go to the mountain for ten years
 and that he never takes a day off he said that if he stopped working who will stop the garbage  but surprisingly 
 at the the end of the project  he came all the way to the mountain to look at the piece  he was really proud to see his house painted  and he said that this project was a project of peace and
  his perception towards the project changed
  perception
 towards the community changed also and towards what they do 
 all the garbage that everybody is disgusted by is  not theirs  they just work out of it actually they dont live in the garbage they live from the garbage  so i started doubting myself and wondering what was the real purpose of
 this whole project 
  was not about beautifying a place by bringing art to it it was about switching perception
 and opening a dialogue on the connection that we have with communities that we dont know  
 so day after day the calligraphy circle was taking shape  
 and we were always excited to go back on the mountain to look at the piece  
 and standing exactly at this point every day made my realize the symbolism behind this anamorphic piece if you want to see the real image of somebody maybe you should change
 your angle
  there was doubts and difficulties like fears and stress it wasn 't simple to work in such environments sometimes having pigs under you while you paint or climbing a stack of garbage to reach a lift  
 but we all got over the fear of the heights  the swinging lifts  the strength of the smell and also the stress of not finishing on time 
 but the kindness of all those people made us forget everything  
 the building number three was the house of uncle
 in egyptian they have this expression that says ahsen nas which means the best people they were the best people we used to take our break in front of their houses  and all the 
  kids of the neighborhood used to join us  i was impressed and amazed by the kids of manshiyat naser
  she told me they teach their kids to refuse anything from somebody that they don 't know because maybe this person needs it more than they do  
 so at this exact point i realized actually  actually the zaraeeb community was the ideal context to raise the topic of perception 
 we need to question our level of misconception and judgment we can have as a society
 upon communities based on their differences  
 i remember how we got delayed on uncle ibrahim 's house when his pigs that are bred on the rooftop were eating the sand bags that hold the lifts 
 the house of uncle  bakheet and aunty fareeda was this kind of meeting point everybody used to gather there 
 i think this is what uncle ibrahim meant when he said that was a project of peace and unity
 because i really felt that people were coming together  everyone was greeting us with a smile offering us a drink or inviting us into their own house for lunch
 the first level of a building and somebody opens his window and offers you some tea  and then the same thing happens on the second floor and you keep going all the way to
  i think i never drink as much tea as i did in egypt 
 and to be honest with you we could have finished earlier but i think it took us three weeks because of all those tea breaks 
 in egypt  they have another expression which is
 i used a white glow in the dark paint for the calligraphy so at the end of the project we rented some black light projectors
 and lit up the whole neighborhood  surprising everybody around we wanted to tell them that they are the ones who brought light to us
  and they know their value  
 the people of cairo call them the zabaleen which means the people of the garbage but ironically  the people of manshiyat naser call the people of cairo the zabaleen they say they are the ones who produce the garbage
  the goal was to leave something to this community but i feel that they are the ones who left something in our lives you know the art project was just a pretext for this amazing human experience  the art piece at some point will disappear 
 vanish  and actually there is somebody who is building a second floor in front of uncle ibrahim 's house so it 's covering part of the of the painting so i might need to go back and paint over it
  it was about the experience about the story about the moment 
 from the streets of the neighborhood  
 the painting appears in fragments isolated from one another standing alone  but connected with the sign of calligraphy that today reveals the powerful message that we should all think about before we want to judge somebody  
 anyone who wants to see the sunlight clearly needs to wipe his eyes first  thank you
