  in my free time outside of twitter i experiment a little bit with telling stories online experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools and in my job at twitter i actually 
  spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well helping to expand out the bounds of
 what people are experimenting with and i want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that i think are really fascinating
 using flexible identity and anonymity on the web
 and blurring the lines between fact and fiction  but i want to start and go back to the  1930s 
 long before a little thing called twitter radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions
  of people to single points of broadcast and from those single points
 emanated stories some of them were familiar stories  some of them were new stories  and for a while they were familiar formats but then radio began to evolve its own 
  unique formats specific to that medium think about episodes that happened live on radio combining the live play and
  serialization of written fiction you get this new format and the reason why i bring up radio is that i think radio is a great example of how a new medium
 defines new formats which then define new stories and of course today we have an entirely new medium to play with which is this online world
  this is the map of verified users on twitter and the connections between them there are thousands upon thousands of them 
 every single one of these points is its own broadcaster we 've gone to this this world of many to many where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting  
 and i think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn
  how to tell stories in this new medium  
 i actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation if you will that we 've explored and begun to settle this wild land 
  of the internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it and those structures are the new formats of storytelling
  example people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e readers digital marketplaces
  one writer  hugh howey  experimented with short stories on amazon by releasing one very short story called wool and he actually says that he didn 't
  to become a series but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more  and so he gave them more he gave them wool two which was a little bit longer than the first one wool three which was even longer culminating in wool five which was a 
  novel i think howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e books he was able to write and
 publish in relatively short order  there was no mediator between him and the audience it was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him 
 so this whole project was an experiment it started with the one short story  and i think the experimentation actually became a part of howey 's format 
 and that 's something that this medium enabled was experimentation being a part of the format itself 
 this is a short story by the author
  jennifer egan called black box it was originally written specifically with twitter in mind  egan convinced the new yorker to start a new yorker fiction account 
  from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created now twitter of course has a 
  140 character limit egan mocked that up just writing
  physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet  and those tweets
 ended up becoming over six hundred of them that were serialized by the new yorker every night at eight p m 
 you could tune in to a short story from the new yorker 's fiction account i think that 's pretty exciting
  the experience of egan 's story of course like anything on twitter there were multiple ways to experience it you could scroll back through it 
 but interestingly if you were watching it live there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets 
 you had no control over when you would read them they were coming at a pretty regular clip 
 but as the story was
  a reader you control how fast you move through a text but in this case the new yorker did  and they were sending you bit by bit by bit and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line
 another great example of fiction and the short story on twitter elliott holt is an author who wrote a story called evidence it
 began with this tweet on november twenty eight at ten thirteen p m a woman identified as miranda brown
  her death from the roof of a manhattan hotel it
 begins in elliott 's voice  but then elliott 's voice recedes  and we hear the voices of elsa  margot and simon characters that elliott created on twitter 
  specifically to tell this story a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at ten thirteen
  when this woman falls to her death these three characters
 brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives 
 one reviewer called elliott 's story twitter fiction done right because she did she captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time 
 interestingly though  
 it wasn 't just twitter as a distribution mechanism  it was also twitter as a production mechanism elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs
  she laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line line by line  i think that this kind of spontaneous 
  creation of what was coming out of the characters ' voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on twitter 
  flexible identity online it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world things like invisible obama or the famous binders full of women that came up during the
 two thousand and twelve election cycle or even the fan fiction universe of west wing twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters
  the bird that taps at josh lyman 's window in one single episode 
 all of these are rapid iterations on a theme they are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible 
  in this medium you look at something like west wing twitter in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world they comment on politics they
  in mind they 're all democrats
  and they engage with the real world they respond to it 
 so once you take flexible identity  anonymity  engagement with the real world and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story that 's when things get really interesting
  during the chicago mayoral election there was a parody account  it was mayor emanuel  it gave you everything you wanted from rahm emanuel  particularly in the expletive department 
 this foul mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race providing commentary as it went it followed all of the natural tropes of a good solid twitter parody account
  then started to get weird  and as it progressed it moved from this commentary to a 
 science fiction epic in which your protagonist rahm emanuel  engages in 
  travel on election day which is it didn 't actually happen i double checked
  and then very interestingly it came to an end this is something that doesn 't usually happen with a twitter parody account it ended a true narrative conclusion
 and so the author dan sinker who was a journalist who was completely anonymous this whole time  i think dan
 it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book because it was a narrative format in the end and i think that turning it into a book is representative of this
  idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats 
 one of my favorite examples of something that 's happening on twitter right now actually is the very absurdist crimer show
 crimer show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo with all of the tropes of a
  television show crimer show 's creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show
 in the u k but man is it weird  
 and there are all these times where crimer the supercriminal does all of these tv things he 's always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera
  these things just happen in text i think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each crimer show as an episode spelled
 presenting them as episodes really it creates something new there is a new eppasod of crimer show
 on twitter pretty much every day
  and they 're archived that way and i think this is an interesting experiment in format something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television 
 i think in nonfiction real time storytelling there are a lot of really excellent examples as well
  is an account that documents what was happening on this day sixty years ago in exceptional detail as if you were reading the news reports from that day  
 and the author teju cole has done a lot of experimentation
  with putting a literary twist on events of the news in this particular case he 's talking about drone strikes
  i think that in both of these examples you 're beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content
 that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling
  blurring the lines between fact and fiction the real world and the digital world flexible identity anonymity
 these are all tools that we have accessible to us and i think that they 're just the building blocks they are the bits that we use to create the structures the frames 
 that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation
