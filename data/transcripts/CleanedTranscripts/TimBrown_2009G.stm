  a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design
 to design thinking  now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project i was ever hired to do
  it 's a woodworking machine or at least a piece of one 
 and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern a little bit easier to use  i thought at the time i did a pretty good job  
 unfortunately not very long afterwards the company went out of business 
 this is the second project that i did it 's a fax machine i put an attractive shell around some new technology  
 again  eighteen months later the product was obsolete  
 and now of course the whole technology
  is obsolete  
 now i 'm a fairly slow learner but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn 't all that important
 making things more attractive making them a bit easier to use  making them more marketable by focusing on a
  maybe just a single product i was being incremental
 and not having much of an impact  but i think this small view of design is a relatively recent phenomenon  and in fact really emerged
 in the latter half of the 20th century
 as design became a tool of consumerism  
 so when we talk about design today and particularly when we read about it in the popular press we 're often talking about products like these amusing yes
 important 
 not so very 
 but this wasn 't always the way  and i 'd like to suggest that if we take a different view of design and focus less on the object
 and more on design thinking as an approach that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact  
  kingdom brunel designed many great things in his career in the 19th century  including the clifton suspension bridge in bristol
 and the thames tunnel at rotherhithe both
 great designs and actually very innovative too his greatest creation
 runs actually right through here in oxford it 's called the great western railway  and as a kid i grew up very close to here  and
 one of my favorite
  things to do was to
 cycle along by the side of the railway waiting for the great big express trains to roar past you can see it represented here in j m w turner 's painting rain steam and speed 
 now what brunel said that he wanted to achieve
 for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside  
  and to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made which meant building
 long viaducts across river valleys this is actually the viaduct across the thames at maidenhead and long tunnels
 such as the one at box in wiltshire  
 but he didn 't stop there he didn 't stop with just trying to design the best railway journey 
 he imagined an integrated transportation system
 in which it would be possible for a
  passenger to embark on a train in london
 and disembark
 from a ship in new york one journey from london to new york 
 this is the s s great western that he built to take care of the second half of that journey  
 now brunel was working one hundred years before the emergence of the design
  but i think he was using design thinking
 to solve problems and to create world changing innovations  
 now design thinking begins with what roger martin the business school professor at the university of toronto calls integrative thinking and that 's the ability to exploit opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions 
 in the case of
  what humans need with technical feasibility  and economic viability 
 with innovations like the great western we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit  
 so somehow  we went from this
 to this 
 systems
 systems thinkers who were reinventing the world to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses working on small things 
 as
 our industrial society matured so design became a profession
 and it focused on an ever smaller canvas until it came to stand for aesthetics  image and fashion now
 i 'm not trying to throw stones here i 'm a fully paid up member of that priesthood and somewhere in here i have my designer glasses
 but i do think that perhaps design is getting big again  and that 's happening through
 the application of design thinking to new kinds of problems
 to global warming to education  healthcare  security  
 clean water  whatever  and as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems
  are some basic ideas that i think we can observe that are useful and i 'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes 
 the first of those is that design is human centered 
 it may integrate technology and economics  but it starts with what humans need  or might need 
 what makes life easier more enjoyable what makes technology useful and usable 
  more than simply good ergonomics putting the buttons in the right place 
 it 's often about understanding culture and context before we even know where to start to have ideas  
 so when a team was working on a new vision screening program in india  
 they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children
 to understand how they might play a role
 in screening their parents
 conversion sound has developed a high quality ultra low cost digital hearing aid for the developing world 
 now in the west
 we rely on highly trained technicians to fit these hearing aids in places like india those technicians simply don 't exist  
 so it took a team working in india with patients and community health workers to understand how a
 a pda and an application on a pda might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service 
 instead of starting with technology the team started with people and culture  
 so if human need is the place to start then design thinking rapidly moves on to learning by making 
 instead of thinking about what to build building in order to think
  now prototypes speed up the process of innovation  because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses  and the faster we do that the faster our ideas evolve  
 now much has been said and written about the aravind eye institute in madurai india  
 they do an incredible job of serving very poor patients by taking the revenues from those who can afford
  to pay to cross subsidize those who cannot now they are very efficient  but they are also very innovative 
 when i visited them a few years ago  what really impressed me was their willingness to prototype their ideas very early 
 this is the manufacturing facility for one of their
  they make their own intraocular lenses these are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts  
 and i think it 's partly their prototyping mentality that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough  because they brought the cost down
 from $ two hundred a pair  down to just $ four a pair  
 partly they did this by instead of building a
  they used the basement of one of their hospitals and instead of installing the large scale machines
 used by western producers  they used low cost cad cam prototyping technology they
 are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world and have recently moved into a custom factory  
 so if human need is the place to start and prototyping a vehicle for progress then there are also some questions to ask about the destination
  instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation
 the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful productive
 and profitable 
  so i 'd like to take the idea that rory sutherland talked about this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things and take that a little bit further and say that
 i think the design of participatory systems in which
 many more forms of value beyond
 simply cash are both created and measured 
 is going to be the major theme not only for design but also for our economy as we go forward  
 so william beveridge when he wrote the first of his famous reports
 created what became britain 's welfare state
 in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well being 
 by the time he wrote his third report  he confessed that he had failed
 and instead had created a society of welfare
  charlie leadbeater and hugo manassei of participle have taken this idea of participation and in their manifesto entitled beveridge four point zero  
 they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state 
 so in one of their projects called southwark circle
  they worked with residents in southwark south london
 and a small team of designers to develop
 a new membership organization to help the elderly with
 household tasks designs were refined
 and and developed with one hundred and fifty older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year  
 we can take this idea of
 participation perhaps to its logical conclusion and say that design may have its greatest impact when it 's taken out of the hands of designers and put into the hands of everyone
 nurses and practitioners at u s healthcare system
 kaiser permanente study the topic of improving the patient experience  and
 particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge and change shift through a program of
  brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping they 've developed a completely new way to change shift 
 they went from retreating to the nurse 's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients using a simple software tool 
 by doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients down from forty minutes to twelve minutes on average  they increased patient confidence and nurse happiness 
 when you multiply that
  by all the nurses in all the wards in forty hospitals in the system it resulted actually in a pretty big impact  and this is just one of thousands
 of opportunities in healthcare alone  
 so these are just some of the kind of basic ideas around design thinking and some of the
  new kinds of projects that
 they 're being applied to 
 but i 'd like to go back to brunel here  and suggest a connection that might explain why this is this is happening now and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool  
 and that connection is change in times of change we need new alternatives  new ideas 
 now brunel worked at the height of the industrial revolution when all of life and our economy was being reinvented
 now
 the industrial systems of brunel 's time have run their course and indeed they are part of the problem today  but again we are in the midst of massive change  
 and that change is forcing us to question quite fundamental aspects of our society how we keep ourselves healthy how we govern ourselves  how we educate ourselves how we keep
  and in these times of change we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete  
 so why design thinking  because it gives us a new way of tackling problems  instead of
 defaulting to our normal convergent approach where we make the best choice out of available alternatives  
 it encourages us to take a divergent approach to explore new alternatives new solutions new ideas
 that have not existed before 
 but before we go through that process of divergence there is actually quite an important first step  and that is what is the question that we 're trying to answer 
 what 's the design brief  now brunel may have asked a question like this how do i take a train from london to new york 
 but what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today  so these are some that we 've been
  asked to think about recently  
 and one in particular is one that we 're working on with the acumen fund in a project that 's been funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation 
 how might we improve access to safe drinking water
 for the world 's poorest people and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers
  so instead of having a bunch of american designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate we took a sort of more open
 collaborative and participative approach  
 we teamed designers and investment experts up with eleven water organizations across india  
 and through workshops they they developed innovative new products services and business models  
 we hosted a competition
 and then funded five of those organizations
 to develop their ideas  so they developed and iterated these
  ideas and then ideo and acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new
 social marketing campaigns community outreach strategies business models new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water 
 some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market and the same process is just getting underway with ngos in east africa  so for me this
  project shows kind of how far we can go from
 some of those sort of small things that i was working on at the beginning of my career 
 that by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly by
 getting the process out of the hands of designers
  getting the active participation of the community we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions and just like brunel by focusing on systems  we can have a bigger impact  
 so
 that 's one thing that we 've been working on i 'm actually really quite interested and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks
 we could work on what kinds of questions do do we think
 design thinking could be used to tackle and if you 've got any ideas then
  feel free you can post them to twitter there is a hash tag there that you can use # cbdq  and
 the list looked something like this a little while ago  and of course you can search to find the questions that you 're interested in by using the same hash code
