  when i do my job people hate me in fact the better
 i do my job the more people hate me 
 and no i 'm not a meter maid  and i 'm not an undertaker  i am a progressive lesbian talking head on fox news
 so y 'all heard that right just to make sure right i am a gay talking head on fox news i am going to tell you how i do it 
 and the most important thing i 've learned  
 so i go on television i debate people who
 literally want to obliterate everything i believe in in some cases who don 't want me and people like me to even exist 
 it 's sort of like thanksgiving with your conservative uncle
 on steroids
 with a live television audience of millions it 's totally almost just like that
  and that 's just on air the hate mail i get is unbelievable last week alone i got two hundred and thirty eight pieces of nasty email
 and more hate tweets than i can even count  i was called an idiot a traitor a scourge a cunt and an ugly man and
  was just in one email 
 so
 what have i realized being on the receiving end of all this ugliness  well my biggest takeaway
 is that for decades we 've been focused on political correctness  but what matters more is emotional correctness
 let me give you a small example  i don 't care if you call me a dyke i really don 't  i care
  about two things one i care that you spell it right 
 applause just quick refresher it 's 
 you 'd totally be surprised  
 and second i don 't care about the word i care about how you use it are you being friendly are you just being naive or do you really want to hurt me personally
  emotional correctness
 is the tone the feeling how we say what we say the respect and compassion we show one another  
 and what i 've realized is that political persuasion doesn 't begin with ideas or facts or data 
 political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct  
 so when i first went to go work at fox news true confession i
  expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle dragging 
 that by the way in case you 're paying attention is not emotionally correct
  but liberals on my side  
 we can be self righteous we can be condescending we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn 't agree with us in other words we can be politically
  that means that people don 't like us  right
  now here 's the kicker  
 conservatives are really nice 
 i mean not all of them and not the ones who send me hate mail but you would be surprised  sean hannity is one of the sweetest guys i 've ever met 
 he spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates  and i know that if i ever had a problem
 he would do anything he could to help  
 now 
 i think sean hannity is  ninety nine percent politically wrong  but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive  and that 's why people listen to him 
 because you can 't get anyone to agree with you
 if they don 't even listen to you first we spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements
  and if we can start to find compassion for one another  then we have a shot at building common ground 
 it actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here  but when you try to put it in practice it 's really powerful so
 someone who says they hate immigrants i try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they 've always known or someone who says
  they don 't like teachers ' unions i bet they 're really devastated to see their kid 's school going into the gutter and they 're just looking for someone to blame 
 our challenge
 is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us that is emotional correctness i 'm not saying it 's easy
  an average of like five point six times per day i have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities
  this whole
 finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a 
 practice for me and i ain 't the dalai lama i 'm not perfect  but what i am
  because i don 't just get hate mail 
 i get a lot of really nice letters  lots of them and one of my all time favorites begins i am not a big fan of your political leanings
 or your sometimes tortured logic 
 laughter but i 'm a big fan of you as a person now this guy doesn 't agree with me yet
  he 's listening
 not because of what i said but because of how i said it and somehow even though we 've never met we 've managed to form a connection 
 that 's emotional correctness  and that 's how we start the conversations that really lead to change  thank you
