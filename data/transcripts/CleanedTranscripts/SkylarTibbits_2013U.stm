  this is me
 building a prototype for six hours straight this is slave labor to my own project 
 this is what the diy and maker
  movements really look like 
 and this is an analogy for today 's construction and manufacturing world with brute force assembly techniques  
 and this is exactly why i started studying how to program physical materials to build themselves  
 but there is another world today at the micro and nanoscales there 's an unprecedented revolution happening  
 and this is the ability to program physical and biological materials to change shape change properties
  and even compute outside of silicon based matter 
 there 's even a software called cadnano that allows us to design three dimensional shapes like nano robots or drug delivery systems and use dna to self assemble those functional structures  
 but if we look at the human scale  there 's massive problems that aren 't being addressed by those nanoscale technologies if we look at construction and manufacturing
 there 's major inefficiencies energy consumption
 and excessive labor techniques in infrastructure let 's just take one example take piping 
 in water pipes we have fixed capacity water pipes
 that have fixed flow rates  except for expensive pumps and valves  we bury them in the
  anything changes if the environment changes the ground moves or demand changes we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them  
 so i 'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials and the built environment 
 and i don 't mean automated machines i don 't just mean smart machines that replace humans  but i mean programmable materials that build themselves  
 self assembly which is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure through only local interaction
  so what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale  we need a few simple ingredients 
 the first ingredient is materials and geometry  and that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source and you can use
  and then you need smartly designed interactions and those interactions allow for error correction and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state 
 so now i 'm going to show you a number of projects that we 've built from
  is that you take the three dimensional structure of a protein
 in this case it 's the crambin protein
 you take the backbone so no cross linking no environmental interactions
 and you break that down into a series of components  
 and then we embed elastic  and when i throw this up into the air and catch it it has the full three dimensional structure of the protein 
 all of the intricacies and this gives us a tangible model
 of the  three dimensional protein and how it folds and all of the intricacies of the geometry  so we can study this as a physical intuitive model  
 and we 're also translating that into two dimensional systems
 so flat sheets that can self fold into three dimensional structures in three dimensions we did a project last year at
  tedglobal with autodesk and arthur olson where we looked at autonomous parts so individual parts not pre connected that can come together on their own  
 and we built five hundred of these glass beakers they had different molecular structures inside and different colors that could be mixed and matched  and we gave them away to all the tedsters 
 and so these became intuitive models to understand how molecular  self assembly works at the human scale  this is the
 polio virus you shake it hard and it breaks apart  and then you shake it randomly and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own  
 and this is demonstrating that through random energy we can build non random shapes
 we even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale last year at ted long beach we built an installation that builds installations the
  so we built a large rotating chamber and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower adding energy to the system
 and getting an intuitive understanding of how  self assembly works and how we could use this as a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products  
 so remember i said 4d so today for the first time we 're unveiling a new project
  which is a collaboration with stratasys  and it 's called 4d printing the idea behind 4d printing is that you take
  printing so you can deposit multiple materials
 and you add a new capability which is transformation that right off the bed the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own  
 and this is like robotics without wires or motors so you completely print this part and it can transform into something else  
 we also worked with
  autodesk on a software they 're developing called project cyborg  and this allows us to simulate this self assembly behavior and try to optimize which parts are folding when 
 but most importantly we can use this same software for the design of nanoscale  self assembly systems and human scale  self assembly systems 
 these are parts being printed
  here 's the first demonstration a single strand dipped in water
 that completely self folds on its own into the letters m i t 
 i 'm biased 
 this is another part single strand dipped in a bigger tank
 that self folds into a cube a three dimensional structure on its own so no human interaction  
 and we think this is the first time that a program and transformation has been embedded directly into the materials
  themselves  and it also might just be the manufacturing technique that allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future  
 so i know you 're probably thinking okay that 's cool but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment  
 so i 've started a lab at mit  
 and it 's called the self assembly lab  and we 're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials for the built environment  and we think there 's a few key sectors that have fairly
  near term applications one of those is in extreme environments 
 these are scenarios where it 's difficult to build our current construction techniques don 't work it 's too large it 's too dangerous it 's expensive too many parts 
 and space is a great example of that we 're trying to design new scenarios for space that have fully reconfigurable and self assembly structures that can go from highly functional systems from one to another  
 let 's go back to
  infrastructure in infrastructure we 're working with a company out of boston called geosyntec  and we 're developing a new paradigm for piping  
 imagine if water pipes could expand or contract to change capacity or change flow rate 
 or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves  
 so this isn 't expensive pumps or valves this is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own
  so i want to remind you today
 of the harsh realities of assembly in our world these are complex things built with complex parts that come together in complex ways  
 so i would like to invite you from whatever industry you 're from
 to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale  
 so that we can go from a world like this
 to a world that 's more like this 
 thank you
