  let 's talk about billions  let 's talk about past
 and future
 billions  we know
 that about one hundred and six billion people have ever lived  and we know that most of them are dead
  and we also know that most of them
 live or lived in asia and we also know that most of them were or are very poor did not live
 for very long let 's talk about billions  let 's talk about the one hundred and
  billion dollars of wealth
 in the world today we know that most of that wealth was made
 after the year one thousand eight hundred and we know that most of it is currently owned by people
 we might call westerners europeans north americans 
  of its wealth economic historians call this the great
 divergence and this slide here is the best simplification of the great divergence story i can offer you 
 it 's basically two ratios
 of per capita gdp per capita gross domestic product so average income one
  red line is the ratio of british to indian
 per capita income and the blue line is the ratio of american to chinese  and this chart goes back to one thousand five hundred 
 and you can see here that there 's an exponential great divergence they start off pretty close together in fact in
  the average chinese was richer than the average north american when you get to the 
  which is where this chart ends the average briton is more than ten times richer than the average indian and that 's allowing
 for differences in the cost of living  it 's based on purchasing power parity  
 the average american is nearly twenty times richer than the average chinese by
  so why 
 this wasn 't just an economic story if you take the ten countries that went on to become
 the western empires in one thousand five hundred they were really quite tiny five percent of the world 's land surface  sixteen percent of its population maybe twenty
  these ten countries plus the united states controlled vast global empires
  fifty eight percent of the world 's territory about the same percentage of its population  
 and a really huge nearly three quarters share of global economic output and notice  most of that went to the motherland to the imperial metropoles not to their colonial possessions
  now you can 't just blame this on imperialism though many people have tried to do so for two reasons 
 one  empire was the least original thing that the west did after one thousand five hundred  everybody did empire 
 they beat preexisting oriental empires like the mughals and the ottomans so it really doesn 't look like empire is a great
  explanation
 for the great divergence in any case as you may remember  the great divergence reaches its zenith in the 1970s some considerable time after decolonization 
 this is not a new question  samuel johnson  the great lexicographer [ posed ] it through his character
  by what means are the europeans thus powerful or why  since they can so easily visit asia and africa for trade or conquest cannot the asiaticks 
  and africans invade their coasts  plant colonies in their ports  
  's a great question  
 and you know what it was also being asked at roughly the same time by the resterners by the people in the rest of the world like ibrahim muteferrika 
 an ottoman official  the man who introduced printing very belatedly to the ottoman empire
 who said in a book published
  why do christian nations which were so weak in the past compared with muslim nations
 begin to dominate so many lands in modern times and even defeat the once victorious ottoman armies 
 unlike rasselas  muteferrika had an answer to that question  which was correct 
 he said it was because they have laws and rules
  it 's not
 geography you may think we can explain the great divergence in terms of geography  we know that 's wrong because we conducted two great natural experiments in the  20th century to see if geography mattered more than institutions we took all the germans  
 we divided them roughly in two  and we gave
 the ones in the east communism  and you see the result within an incredibly short period of time
  people living in the german democratic republic produced trabants  the trabbi one of the world 's worst ever cars  
 while people in the west produced the mercedes benz 
 if you still don 't believe me we conducted the experiment also in the korean peninsula and we decided we 'd take koreans in roughly the same geographical place
 with notice the same basic traditional
 culture and we divided them in two and we gave the northerners communism
  and the result
 is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in germany  
 not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly but in almost every other respect it 's a huge divergence  
 which leads me to think that neither geography nor national character popular
  explanations for this kind of thing are really significant 
 it 's the ideas  it 's the institutions  
 this must be true because a scotsman said it and i think i 'm the only scotsman here at the edinburgh ted so
 let me just explain to you that the smartest man ever was a scotsman
 he was adam smith not billy connolly not sean connery
 though he is very smart indeed
 laughter smith and i want you to go and bow down before his statue in the royal mile it 's a wonderful statue smith 
 in the wealth of nations published in one thousand seven hundred and seventy six that 's the most important thing that happened that year 
 you bet there was a little local difficulty in some of our minor colonies
 china seems to have been long stationary and probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions  
 but this complement may be much inferior to what with other laws and institutions the nature of its soil climate and situation might admit of that is so right and so cool and he said it such a long time ago  but you know
 this is a ted audience and if i keep talking about institutions  you 're going to turn off so i 'm going to translate this into language that you can understand 
 let 's call them the killer apps 
 i want to explain to you that there were six killer apps that set the west apart from the rest
 and they 're kind of like the apps on your phone in the sense that they look quite simple
  just icons you click on them but behind the icon there 's complex code it 's the same with institutions  there are six which i think
 explain the great divergence one competition two the scientific revolution three property rights four
 modern medicine five
  the consumer society and six the work ethic you can play a game and try and think of one i 've missed at or try and boil it down to just four  
 but you 'll lose 
 let me very briefly tell you what i mean by this synthesizing the work of many
 economic historians in the process 
 competition means not only were there a hundred different political units in europe in one thousand five hundred but within each of these units there was competition between corporations as well as sovereigns
 the ancestor of the modern corporation the city of london corporation existed in the 12th century 
 nothing like this existed in china where there was one monolithic state covering a fifth of humanity  and anyone with any ambition had to pass one standardized examination which took 
  three days and was very difficult and involved memorizing vast numbers of characters
  the scientific revolution was different from the science that had been achieved in the oriental world in a number of crucial ways the most important being
 that through the experimental method it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before example benjamin robins 's
 extraordinary application of newtonian physics to
  once you do that your artillery becomes accurate 
 think of what that means that really was a killer application 
 meanwhile there 's no scientific revolution anywhere else the ottoman empire 's not that far from europe but there 's no scientific revolution there in fact they demolish 
 taqi al din 's observatory because it 's considered blasphemous to inquire into the mind of god 
  not the democracy folks  it 's having the rule of law based on private property rights  that 's what makes the difference between north america and south america 
 you could turn up in north america having signed a deed of indenture saying i 'll work for nothing for five years you just have to feed me 
 but at the end of it you 've got a hundred acres of land that
  the land grant on the bottom half of the slide  that 's not possible in latin america
 where land is held onto by a tiny elite descended from the conquistadors and you can see here the huge divergence that happens in property ownership between north and south most people in rural north america owned some land
 by one thousand nine hundred hardly anyone in south america did 
 that 's another killer app modern medicine in the late 19th century began to make major breakthroughs against the infectious
  diseases that killed a lot of people and this was another killer app the very opposite of a killer because it doubled and then more than doubled human life expectancy it even did that in the european empires 
 even in places like senegal  beginning in the early  20th century there were major breakthroughs in public health and life expectancy began to
  it doesn 't rise any faster after these countries become independent the empires weren 't all bad  
 the consumer society is what you need for the industrial revolution to have a point 
 you need people to want to wear tons of clothes  you 've all bought an article of clothing in the last month i guarantee it  
 that 's the consumer society  and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself 
 japan was the first non western society to embrace it the alternative
  which was proposed by mahatma gandhi was to institutionalize and make poverty permanent 
 very few indians today wish that india had gone down mahatma gandhi 's road 
 finally the work ethic  
 max weber thought that was peculiarly protestant  he was wrong  
 any culture can get the work ethic if the institutions are there to create the incentive to
  work we know this
 because today the work ethic is no longer a protestant  western phenomenon in fact the west has lost its work ethic 
 today the average korean works a thousand hours more a year than the average german
 a thousand
  and this is part of a really extraordinary phenomenon and that is the end
 of the great divergence  who 's got the work ethic now take a look at mathematical attainment by fifteen year olds 
 at the top of the international league table according to the latest pisa study 
 is the shanghai district of china the gap between shanghai and the united kingdom and the united states is as big as the gap
  between the u k and the u s and albania and tunisia  
 you probably assume that because the iphone was designed in california but assembled in china that the west still leads in terms of technological innovation you 're wrong 
 in terms of patents there 's no question that the east is ahead not only has japan been ahead for some time south korea has gone into third place
  and china is just about to overtake germany  
 why  because the killer apps can be downloaded it 's open source 
 any society can adopt these institutions  and when they do they achieve what the west achieved after one thousand five hundred only faster 
 this
  and it 's the biggest story of your lifetime because it 's on your watch that this is happening  
 it 's our generation that is witnessing the end of western predominance  the average american used to be more than twenty times richer than the average chinese now it 's just five times and soon it will be two point five times 
 so i want to end with three questions
 for the future billions
  when the united states will lose its place as number one economy to china 
 the first is can you delete these apps and are we in the process of doing so
 in the western world the second question is does the sequencing of the download matter 
 and could africa get
  that sequencing wrong 
 one obvious implication of modern economic history is that it 's quite hard to transition to democracy before you 've established secure private property rights  
 warning  
 that may not work 
 and third can china do without killer app number three  that 's the one that john locke systematized when he said that freedom
 was rooted in private property rights and the protection of law
  that 's the basis for the western model of representative government now
 this picture shows the demolition of the chinese artist ai weiwei 's studio in shanghai earlier this year 
 he 's now free again having been detained as you know for some time but i don 't think his studio has been rebuilt 
 winston churchill once
  defined civilization in a lecture he gave in the fateful year of 
 and i think these words really nail it 
 it means a society based upon the opinion of civilians  it means that violence the rule of warriors and despotic chiefs the conditions of camps and warfare of riot and tyranny 
 give place to parliaments where laws are made and independent courts of justice in which over long periods those laws
  laws are maintained that is civilization and in its soil grow continually freedom  
 comfort and culture what all tedsters care about most 
 when civilization reigns in any country a wider
 and less harassed life is afforded to the
  that 's so true 
 i don 't think the decline of western civilization is inevitable because i don 't think history operates in this kind of 
  model beautifully illustrated by thomas cole 's course of empire paintings  that 's not the way history works  that 's not the way the west rose
  i don 't think it 's the way the west will fall 
 the west may collapse very suddenly  complex civilizations do that because they operate most of the time 
 on the edge of chaos  that 's one of the most profound insights to come out of the historical study of complex institutions like civilizations 
 no we may hang on despite the huge burdens of debt that we 've accumulated  despite the evidence that we
  've lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical mojo  but one thing is for sure  the great divergence
 is over folks  thanks very much
  take on the other region of the world that 's booming which
  i really am not just talking about
 the rise of the east i 'm talking about the rise of the rest and that includes south america i once asked one of my colleagues at harvard hey is south america part of the west 
 he was an expert in latin american history he said i don 't know i 'll have to think about that 
 that tells you something really important i think if you look at what is happening in brazil
  in particular but also chile which was in many ways the the one that
 led the way in in transforming the institutions of economic life 
 there 's a very bright future indeed so my story really is as much about that convergence in the americas as it 's a convergence story in in eurasia bg 
 and there is this impression that
 north america and europe are not really paying attention to these
  mostly they 're worried about each other the americans think that the european model is going to crumble tomorrow the europeans think that the american budget is going to explode tomorrow  and
 that 's all we seem to be caring about recently nf 
 i think the fiscal crisis that we see in the developed world right now both sides of the atlantic is essentially the same thing taking different
 forms in terms of political culture  and it
  it 's a crisis that has its
 its structural facet it 's partly to do with demographics but it 's also of course to do with the massive crisis that followed excessive leverage excessive borrowing in the private 
  sector  that crisis which has been the focus of so much attention including by me i think is an epiphenomenon the financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon 
  which has just accelerated this huge shift which ends half a millennium of western ascendancy i think that 's its real importance
