  the greatest innovations and developments
 in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields  so tonight i 'd like to tell you about the intersection that i 'm most excited about at this very moment which is entertainment
  if we 're trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society  maybe we should look to some of the human professionals of artificial emotion and personality 
 that occur in the dramatic arts i 'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts
  marilyn monrobot  i would like to use art to create tech 
 so we 're based in new york city and if you 're a performer that wants to collaborate with an adorable robot 
 or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation please contact me the
  the bot our rising celebrity also has his own twitter account
 @ robotinthewild i 'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots data he 's named after the star trek character  i think he 's going to be super popular  
 we 've got the robot in his head is a database of a lot of jokes now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes so it knows something about the subject it knows about the length it knows how much it 's moving
  and so it 's going to try to watch your response i actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today laughter
 it can also learn from you about  the quality of its jokes and cater things  sort of like netflix style over longer term to different communities or audiences  
 children versus adults different cultures you can learn something from the robot about the community that you 're in and also i can use each one of you as the acting coach to our future robot companions
 some of you in this middle section you have red green
 paddles 
 if you like what 's going on 
 show the green if you don 't like the subject or or the performance you can hold the red  now don 't be shy 
 it 's just a robot it doesn 't have feelings
  count you still matter there 's also a microphone that 's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause and booing i hope not
 to help make some of its next decisions
  it 's an honor to be here
  a doctor says to his patient i have bad news and worse news the bad news is that you only have
  pretty lucky for them ever see that little swiss army knife they have to fight with come on
 buddy  i have the toe clippers right here you get past me the guy behind me has a spoon
  woods one of them falls to the ground  he does not seem to be breathing the other guy whips out his cell phone and calls nine
 he gasps to the operator my friend is dead what can i do 
 the operator says just take it easy i can help first
  's make sure he 's dead 
 there is a silence and the operator hears a shot 
 the guy 's voice comes back on the line okay now what question 
 why is television called a medium  anyone
 because it 's neither rare nor well done but to be completely honest with you i kind of love television  any of you like television
  find it incredibly educational actually as soon as someone turns it on i go into the other room and read 
 that 's all for now was that okay for my first time
  the first time we 've ever done live audience feedback
 to a performance  so thank you all for being a part of it there 's a lot more to come and we hope to learn a lot about robot expression thank you very much
