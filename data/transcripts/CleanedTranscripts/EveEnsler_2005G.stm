  i think it 'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others that i 'm not going to talk about vaginas today 
 i began the vagina monologues because i was worried about vaginas i 'm very worried today about
  this notion this world this prevailing
 kind of force of security  i see this word hear this word feel this word everywhere  real security security checks security watch security clearance  
 why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure 
 what does anyone mean when they talk about real security  and why have we as americans particularly become a nation that strives for security above all else  
 in fact i think that
  security is elusive  it 's impossible we all die we all get old we all get sick people leave us  people change us  
 nothing is secure  and that 's actually the good news 
 this is of course unless your whole life is about being secure  
 i think that when that is the focus of your life these are the things that happen  you can 't travel very far or venture too far outside
  a certain circle you can 't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time as they might confuse you or challenge you 
 you can 't open yourself to new experiences new people new ways of doing things they might take you off course  
 you can 't not know who you are so you cling to hard matter identity  you become a
  heterosexual or a homosexual or you never have sex or at least that 's what you say when you identify yourself  
 you become part of an us in order to be secure  you defend against them 
 you cling to your land because it is your secure place  you must fight anyone who encroaches upon it  
 you become your nation you become your religion you become whatever it is that will freeze you numb you and protect you from doubt or change but all this does actually
  is shut down your mind in reality it does not really make you safer 
 i was in sri lanka for example three days after the tsunami  
 and i was standing on the beaches and it was absolutely clear that in a matter of five minutes a 30 foot wave could rise up and desecrate a people a population and lives 
 all this striving for security in fact has made you much more insecure
 because now
  you have to watch out all the time there are people not like you
 people who you now call enemies you have places you cannot go thoughts you cannot think worlds that you can no longer inhabit 
 and so you spend your days fighting things off  defending your territory and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking 
 your days become devoted to protecting yourself this becomes your mission that is all you do 
 ideas get shorter they become
  sound bytes there are evildoers and saints  criminals and victims there are those who if they 're not with us are against us  
 it gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what 's inside them  it gets easier to lock them up force them to be naked humiliate them  occupy them invade them and kill them because they are only obstacles now to your security  
 in six years  i 've had the extraordinary privilege through v day a global movement against
  women to travel probably to sixty countries  and spend a great deal of time in different portions i 've met
 women and men all over this planet 
 who through various circumstances war  poverty  racism multiple forms of violence have never known security  or have had their illusion of security forever devastated 
 i 've spent time with women in afghanistan under the
  taliban who were essentially brutalized and censored 
 i 've been in bosnian refugee camps i was with women in pakistan who have had their faces melted off with acid  
 i 've been with girls all across america who were date raped or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night 
 one of the amazing things that i 've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species i loved when he was talking about this other world that
  right next to this world i 've discovered these people who in v day world we call vagina warriors these particular people rather than getting
  or weapons of mass destruction or machetes 
 in the spirit of the warrior have gone into the center the heart of pain of loss  they have grieved it they have died into it and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine they
  have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy towards another mission and another trajectory 
 these warriors now devote themselves and their lives to making sure what happened to them doesn 't happen to anyone else  there are thousands if not millions of them on the planet 
  i venture there are many in this room they have a fierceness and a freedom that i believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm 
  out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator 
 their own personal security is not their end goal  and because of that because  rather than
 worrying about security because the transformation of suffering is their end goal  i actually believe they are creating real safety and a whole new idea of security
  i want to talk about a few of these people that i 've met  tomorrow i am going to cairo 
 and i 'm so moved that i will be with women in cairo who are v day women who are opening the first safe house for battered women in the middle east 
 that will happen because women in cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in egypt 
 and were willing to
  and through their work over the last years this is not only happening that this house is opening but it 's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it 
 women in uganda this year who put on the vagina monologues during v day 
 actually evoked the wrath of the government and i love this story so much there was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents to talk
  could come to uganda 
 and in this meeting it went on for weeks in the press two weeks where there was huge discussion the government finally made a decision that the vagina monologues could not be performed in uganda  
 but the amazing news was that because they had stood up these women and because they had been willing to risk their security  
 it began a discussion that not only happened in uganda but all of africa 
  as a result this production which had already sold out every single person in that
 audience except for ten people made a decision to keep the money  they raised ten thousand dollars on a production that never occurred  
 there 's a young woman named carrie  rethlefsen in minnesota she 's a high school student  
 she had seen the vagina monologues and she was really moved and as a result she wore an i heart my vagina button to her high school
 in minnesota
 she was basically
 threatened to be expelled from school they told her she couldn 't love her vagina in high school 
 that it was not a legal thing that it was not a moral thing that it was not a good thing  
 so she really struggled with this what to do because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion so what she did is she got all her friends together
 one hundred and fifty students all wore i love my vagina t shirts and the boys wore i love her vagina t shirts to school 
 now this seems like a fairly you
 know frivolous but what happened as a result of that 
 is that that school now is forming a sex education class  it 's beginning to talk about sex it 's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young
  high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly
  i know i 've talked about agnes here before but i want to give you an update on agnes i met agnes three years ago in the rift valley  when she was a young girl she had
 been mutilated
 against her will that mutilation of her clitoris had actually obviously impacted her life and changed it in a way that was devastating
  she made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard but to to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls 
 for eight years she walked through the rift valley she had this amazing box that she carried and it had a torso of a woman 's body in it a half a torso and she would teach people everywhere she went what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like 
 in the years that she walked she educated parents mothers fathers
  she saved one thousand five hundred girls from being cut when v day met her we asked her how we could support her and she said well if you got me a jeep i could get around a lot faster 
 so we bought her a jeep  in the year she had the jeep she saved four thousand five hundred girls from being cut 
 so we said what else could we do she said if you help me get money  i could open a house 
  a safe house in africa to stop mutilation when she began
 her mission eight years ago she was reviled she was detested she was completely slandered in her community i am proud to tell you that
 six months ago  she was elected the deputy mayor of narok 
  i think what i 'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security  
 and if that 's all you 're focusing on what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people  but you make yourself far more insecure  
 real security is contemplating death not pretending it doesn 't exist not running from loss but entering grief
  surrendering to sorrow  
 real security is not knowing something when you don 't know it  
 real security is hungering for connection rather than power  it cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs it is deeper  it is a process it is acute 
 awareness that we are all utterly inter bended and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere 
  but hungering for them and only trusting a situation when they are present 
 something happened when i began traveling in v day eight years ago i got lost i remember being on a plane going from kenya to
 south africa and i had no idea where i was i didn 't know where i was going where i 'd come from and i panicked i had a total anxiety attack 
 and then i suddenly realized that it absolutely didn 't matter
 where i was going or where i had come from
 because
 we are all essentially permanently displaced people all of us are refugees we come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time moving towards a new place 
 freedom means i may not be identified as any one group  but that i can visit and find
  myself in every group  it does not mean that i don 't have values or beliefs  but it does mean i am not hardened around them 
 i do not use them as weapons in the shared future 
 it will be just that shared 
 the end goal will [ be ] becoming vulnerable  realizing the place of our connection to one another rather than becoming secure  in control
 and alone
  on a typical day do you wake up with hope or or gloom eve ensler you know i think carl jung once said that
 in order to survive the twentieth century we have to live with two existing thoughts  opposite thoughts at the same time  and i think
 part of what i 'm learning in this process is that
 one must allow oneself
 to feel grief  and i think as long as i keep grieving  and weeping and then moving on i 'm fine when i start to pretend that what i 'm seeing isn 't impacting me and isn 't changing my heart then i get in trouble 
 because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place country to country and city to city the degree to which women for example are violated  and the epidemic of it
  the kind of ordinariness of it is so devastating to one 's soul that you have to take the time or i have to take the time now to process that
