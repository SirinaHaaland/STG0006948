  i am failing as a woman  i am failing as a feminist  i have passionate opinions about gender equality but
 i worry that to freely accept the label of feminist would not be fair to good feminists i 'm a feminist but i 'm a rather bad one
  so i call myself a bad feminist  
 or at least i wrote an essay  and then i wrote a book called bad feminist and then in interviews people started calling me the bad feminist 
 so what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself
 and a willful provocation has become a thing let me take a step back when i was younger mostly in my teens and
 i had strange ideas about feminists as hairy angry 
  women as if those are bad things 
 these days i look at how women are treated the world over  and anger in particular seems like a perfectly reasonable response  but
  back then i worried about the tone people used when suggesting i might be a feminist the feminist label was an accusation it was an f word and not a nice one 
 i was labeled a woman who doesn 't play by the rules who expects too much who thinks far too highly of myself by daring to believe i 'm equal superior to a man 
 you don 't want to be that rebel woman until you realize that you very much are that woman and cannot imagine being anyone else
 as i got older i began to accept that i am indeed a feminist and a proud one  i hold certain truths to be self evident women are equal to men 
 we deserve equal pay for equal work
  we have the right to move through the world as we choose  free from harassment or violence  we have the right
  affordable access to birth control and reproductive services  
 we have the right to make choices about our bodies free from legislative oversight or evangelical doctrine  
 we have the right to respect  
 there 's more when we talk about the needs of women  we have to consider the other identities we inhabit we are not just women 
 we are people with different bodies  gender
  class backgrounds abilities and so much more  
 we need to take into account these differences and how they affect us as much as we account for what we have in common  
 without this kind of inclusion our feminism is nothing  
 i hold these truths to be self evident but let me be clear i 'm a mess i am full of contradictions 
 there are many ways in which i 'm doing feminism wrong  
 i have another confession when i drive
  to work i listen to thuggish rap at a very loud volume 
 even though the lyrics are degrading to women these lyrics offend me to my core
 the classic yin yang twins song salt shaker it is amazing 
 make it work with your wet t shirt bitch you gotta shake it ' til your camel starts to hurt
  think about it 
 poetry right i am utterly mortified by my music choices 
 i firmly believe in man work which is anything i don 't want to do including 
 all domestic tasks  but also bug killing trash removal lawn care and vehicle maintenance
  i want no part of any of that 
 pink is my favorite color  i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things  
 i watch the bachelor and romantic comedies and i have absurd fantasies about fairy tales coming true  
 some of my transgressions are more flagrant  if a woman wants to take her husband 's name that is her choice
  and it is not my place to judge 
 if a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children i embrace that choice too 
 the problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice the problem is that our society is set up to make women economically vulnerable when they choose let 's deal with that 
 i reject the mainstream feminism that has historically ignored or deflected the
  needs of women of color working class women queer women and transgender women in favor of supporting white 
  straight women listen if that 's good feminism i am a very bad feminist 
 there is also this as a feminist i feel a lot of pressure  we have this tendency to put visible feminists on a pedestal
  we expect them to pose perfectly 
 when they disappoint us we gleefully knock them from the very pedestal we put them on 
 like i said  i am a mess consider me knocked off that pedestal before you ever try to put me up there 
 too many women particularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders are afraid to be labeled as feminists they 're afraid to stand up and say yes  i am a feminist
  for fear of what that label means for fear of being unable to live up to unrealistic expectations 
 take for example beyonc or as i call her the goddess 
 she has emerged in recent years as a visible feminist 
 at the two thousand and fourteen mtv video music awards she performed in front of the word feminist ten feet high 
 it was a glorious spectacle to see this pop star openly embracing feminism and letting young women and men
  know that being a feminist is something to celebrate 
 as the moment faded cultural critics began endlessly debating whether or not beyonc was indeed a feminist  
 they graded her feminism instead of simply taking a grown  accomplished woman at her word
  we are still fighting for so much  we want so much  we need so damn much  we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dissecting any given woman 's feminism tearing it apart until there 's nothing left  
 we do not need to do that 
 bad feminism or really more inclusive feminism is a starting
  what happens next  we go from acknowledging our imperfections to accountability  or walking the walk  and being a little bit brave  
 if i listen to degrading music i am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy to contribute a limitless supply 
 these artists are not going to change how they talk about women in their songs until we demand that change by affecting their bottom
  it is difficult  why must it be so catchy 
 it 's hard to make the better choice  and it is so easy to justify a lesser one  but
 when i justify bad choices i make it harder for women to achieve equality the equality that we all deserve and i need to own that 
 i think of my nieces  
  ages three and four they are gorgeous and headstrong brilliant girls who are a whole lot of brave  
 i want them to thrive in a world where they are valued for the powerful creatures they are 
 i think of them and suddenly the better choice becomes far easier to make  
 we can all make better choices  we can change the channel when a television show treats sexual violence against women like sport game of
  we can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women as nothing  
 we can spend our box office dollars elsewhere when movies don 't treat women as anything more than decorative objects  
 we can stop supporting professional sports where the athletes treat their partners like punching bags 
  and especially straight white men can say no i will not publish with your magazine or participate in your project or otherwise work with you until you include a fair number of women both as participants and decision makers  
 i won 't work with you until your publication or your organization is more inclusive of all kinds of difference 
 those of us who are underrepresented and invited to participate in such projects can also decline to be included until more of us are invited through
  the glass ceiling and we are tokens no more  without these efforts  without taking these stands our accomplishments are going to mean very little  
 we can commit these small acts of bravery and hope that our choices trickle upward to the people in power
 editors  movie and music producers  
  the people who can make bigger braver choices to create lasting  meaningful change  
 we can also boldly claim our feminism good bad or anywhere in between 
 the last line of my book bad feminist says i would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all 
 this is true for so many reasons but first and foremost i say this because once upon a time my voice was stolen from me and feminism helped me to get my voice back
  back 
 there was an incident i call it an incident so i can carry the burden of what happened  
 some boys broke me when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break a girl 
 they treated me like i was nothing  i began to believe i was nothing they stole my voice and in the after i did not dare to believe that anything i might say could matter  but
 i had writing
 and there i wrote myself back together  i wrote myself toward a stronger version of myself  
 i read the words of women who might understand a story like mine  and women who looked like me and understood what it was like to move through the world with brown skin  
 i read the words of women who showed me i was not nothing
  i learned to write like them  and then i learned to write as myself i found my voice again and i started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond measure 
 through writing and feminism i also found that if i was a little bit brave  another woman might hear me and see me and recognize that none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are 
 in one hand  i hold the power to accomplish anything and in my other  i hold the humbling
  reality that i am just one woman
