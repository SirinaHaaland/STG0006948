  prejudice and bias we tend to think about stupid and evil people doing stupid and evil things 
 and this idea is nicely summarized by the british critic william hazlitt who wrote
  prejudice is the child of ignorance i want to try to convince you here that this is mistaken 
 i want to try to convince you that prejudice and bias are natural they 're often rational and they 're often even moral 
 and i think that once we understand this we 're in a better position to make sense of them when they go wrong when they have horrible consequences  and we 're in a better position to know what to do when this happens 
 so start with stereotypes you look at me  you know my
  name you know certain facts about me  and you could make certain judgments  you could make guesses about my ethnicity 
 my political affiliation my religious beliefs  and the thing is these judgments tend to be accurate we 're very good at this sort of thing  
 and we 're very good at this sort of thing because
 our ability to stereotype people is not some sort of arbitrary quirk
  it 's a specific instance of a more general process which is that we have experience with things and people in the world that fall into categories  and we can use our experience to make generalizations about novel 
  instances of these categories so everybody here has a lot of experience with chairs and apples and dogs  
  the dog will bark  
 now we might be wrong the chair could collapse if you sit on it the apple might be poison  the dog might not bark and in fact this is my dog tessie who doesn 't bark
 but for the most part we 're good at this  for the most part we make good guesses both in the social domain and and the non social domain and if we weren 't able to do so if we weren 't able to make guesses about new instances
  that that we encounter  we wouldn 't survive  and in fact hazlitt later on in his wonderful essay concedes this  he writes without the aid of prejudice
 and custom i should not be able to find my way my across the room  nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances  nor what to feel in any relation of life 
 or take bias now sometimes we break the world up into us versus them into in group versus out group and sometimes when we do this we know we 're doing something wrong and we 're kind of ashamed of it  
  other times we 're proud of it we openly acknowledge it 
 and my favorite example of this is a question that came from the audience in a republican debate prior to the last election  anderson cooper 
 gets to your question the question in the hall 
 on foreign aid yes ma 'am woman 
 the american people are suffering in our country right now why do we continue to send foreign aid to other
  each of the people onstage agreed with the premise of her question  which is as americans we should care more about americans than about other people
 and in fact in general people are often swayed by feelings of solidarity loyalty  pride patriotism towards their country or towards their ethnic group regardless of your politics many people feel
  to be american and they favor americans over other countries residents of other countries feel the same about their nation
 and we feel the same about our ethnicities now some of you may reject this  some of you may be so cosmopolitan that you think that ethnicity and nationality should hold no moral sway  
 but even you sophisticates accept that there should be some pull
  in the domain of friends and family of people you 're close to and so even you make a distinction between us versus them 
 now this distinction is is natural enough and often moral enough  but it can go awry  and this was part of the research of the great social psychologist henri 
  was born in poland in one thousand nine hundred and nineteen nineteen  he left to go to university in france because as a jew he couldn 't go to university in poland
  and then he enlisted in the french military in world war ii he was captured and ended up ended up in a prisoner of war camp  
 and it was a terrifying time for him because if it was discovered that he was a jew  he could have been moved to a concentration camp where he most likely would not have survived  and in fact when the war ended and he was released most of his friends and family were dead 
 he got involved in different pursuits he helped out the war orphans but he had a long lasting
  science of prejudice and so when a prestigious british scholarship on stereotypes opened up he applied for it and he won it 
 and then he began this amazing career  and what started his career is an insight that the way most people were thinking about the holocaust was wrong  
 many people most people at the time  viewed the holocaust as sort of representing some tragic flaw on the part of the germans some genetic
  what we see in the holocaust is
 just an exaggeration of normal psychological processes that exist in every one of us  
 and to explore this he did a series of classic studies with british adolescents  and in one of his studies what he did was he asked the british adolescents all sorts of questions  
 and then based on their answers he said i 've looked at your
  and based on the answers i have determined that you are either he told half of them a kandinsky lover  you love the work of kandinsky or a klee lover  you love the work of klee 
 it was entirely bogus their answers had nothing to do with kandinsky or klee they probably hadn 't heard of the artists  he just
 arbitrarily divided them up 
 but what he found was these categories mattered so when he later gave the subjects money they would prefer to give the money to members of their own group
 than members of
  group worse  they were actually most interested in establishing a difference
 between their group and other groups  so they would give up money for their own group if by doing so they could give the other group even less  
 this bias seems to show up very early  so my colleague and wife karen wynn at yale has done a series of studies with babies where she exposes babies to puppets and the
  have certain food preferences so one of the puppets might like green beans the other puppet might like graham crackers  
 they test the babies own food preferences  and babies typically prefer the graham crackers  but the question is does this matter to babies
 in how they treat the puppets  and it matters a lot  they tend to prefer the puppet who has the same food tastes
  they actually prefer puppets who punish the puppet with the different food taste 
 laughter we see this sort of in group out group psychology all the time we see it in political clashes within groups with different ideologies we see it in its extreme 
 in cases of of war where the out group isn 't merely given less  but dehumanized
  as in the nazi perspective of jews as vermin or lice or the american perspective of of japanese as rats 
 stereotypes can also go awry  so often they 're rational and useful but sometimes they 're irrational they give the wrong answers and other times
 they lead to plainly immoral consequences  and the case
 that 's been most studied is the case of race  there was a fascinating study prior to the two thousand and eight election where social psychologists
 looked at the extent to which the candidates were associated with america as in an unconscious association with the american flag  
 and in one of their studies they compared obama and mccain and they found mccain is thought of as more american
 than obama and to some extent people aren 't that surprised by hearing that mccain is a celebrated war hero and many people would explicitly say he has more of an american story than obama 
 but they also compared
 obama to british prime minister tony blair  and they found that blair was also thought of as more american than obama 
 even though subjects explicitly understood that he 's not american at all 
 but they were responding of course to the color of his skin
  these stereotypes and biases have real world consequences both subtle and very important  in one recent study
 researchers
 put ads on ebay for the sale of baseball cards some of them were
 were held by white hands  
 others by black hands they were the same baseball cards the ones held by black hands got substantially smaller bids than the ones held by white hands 
 in research done at stanford
  of a white person it turns out holding everything else constant you are considerably more likely to be executed if you look like the man on the right than the man on the left
  and this is in large part because
 the man on the right looks more prototypically black
 and this apparently influences people 's decisions over what to do about him  so now that we know about this  how do we combat it and there are
  avenues one avenue is to appeal to people 's emotional responses to appeal to people 's empathy  and we often do that through stories 
 so if if you are a liberal parent and you want to
 encourage your children to believe in the merits of nontraditional families  you might give them a book like this
 stories can turn anonymous strangers into people who matter  
 and the idea that that we care about people when we focus on them as individuals is an idea which has shown up across history so stalin 
 a single death is a tragedy a million deaths is a statistic and mother teresa said if i look at the mass i will never act if i look
  in one study people were given a list of facts about a crisis  and it was seen how much they would donate
 to solve this crisis  and another group was given no facts at all
 but they were told of an individual and given a name
 and given a face  and it turns out that they gave far more 
 none of this i think is a secret to the people who are engaged in charity work people don 't tend to deluge
  people with facts and statistics rather you show them faces you show them
 people it 's possible that by extending our sympathies to an individual they can spread to the group that the individual belongs to 
 this is harriet beecher stowe the story perhaps apocryphal is that president lincoln invited her to the white house in the middle of the civil war
 and said to her so you 're the little lady who started this great war
 and he was talking about uncle tom 's cabin uncle tom 's cabin is not a great book of philosophy or of theology or or perhaps not even literature but it does a great job 
 of getting people to put themselves in the shoes of people they wouldn 't otherwise be in the shoes of 
  several decades
  there 's some reason to believe that shows like the cosby show 
 radically changed american attitudes towards african americans while shows like will and grace and modern family changed american attitudes towards gay men and women 
 i don 't think it 's an exaggeration to say that the major catalyst in america for moral change has been a situation comedy 
  but it 's not all emotions  and i want to end by appealing to the power of reason
  at some point in his wonderful book the better angels of our nature steven pinker says  the old testament says
 love thy neighbor  and the new testament says love thy enemy  but i don 't love either one of them not really  but i don 't want to kill them  
 i know i have obligations to them but my moral feelings
  my moral beliefs about about how i should behave towards them 
 aren 't grounded in love what they 're grounded in is the understanding of human rights a belief that their life is as valuable to them as my life is to me  
 and to support this he tells a story
 by the great philosopher adam smith  and i want to tell this story too though i 'm going to modify it a little bit for modern times
 so adam smith starts by asking you to imagine the death of thousands of people and imagine that the
  thousands of people are in a country you are not familiar with it could be china or india or a country in africa  
 and smith says how would you respond and you would say  well that 's too bad and you
 'd go on to the rest of your life if you were to open up the new york times online or something and discover this  and in fact this happens to us all the time  we go about our lives 
 but imagine instead smith says you were to learn that tomorrow you were to have your little finger chopped
  smith says that would matter a lot you would not sleep that night wondering about that so this raises the question 
 would you sacrifice thousands of lives to save your little finger now answer this in the privacy of your own head  
 but smith says  absolutely not what a horrid thought 
 and so this raises the question 
 and so as smith puts it when our passive feelings are almost always so sordid and so selfish how comes it that our active principles should often be so generous and so noble
 smith 's answer is it is reason principle conscience [
 this ] calls to us with a voice capable of astonishing the most presumptuous of our passions that we are but one of the multitude in no respect better than any other in it 
 and this last part is what is often described as the principle
 of impartiality  and this principle of impartiality manifests itself in all of the world 's religions in all of the different versions of the golden
  rule  and in all of the world 's moral philosophies which differ in many ways but share the presupposition that we should judge morality from sort of an impartial
 point of view 
 the best articulation of this view is actually for me it 's not from a theologian or from a philosopher  but from humphrey bogart at the end of casablanca so spoiler alert he 's
  telling his lover that they have to separate for the more general good 
 and he says to her and i won 't do the accent but he says to her it doesn 't take much to see that the problems of three little people don 't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world 
 our reason could cause us to override our passions 
 our reason could motivate us to extend our empathy could motivate us to write a book like uncle tom 's cabin or read a book like uncle tom 's cabin and our reason can motivate us to create
 customs and taboos and laws that will constrain us
  upon our impulses when as rational beings we feel we should be constrained this is what a constitution is 
 a constitution is something which was set up in the past that applies now in the present and what it says is no matter how much we might to reelect a popular president for a third term  
 no matter how much white americans might choose to feel that they want to reinstate the institution of slavery we can 't we have bound ourselves  and we bind ourselves in other
  ways as well we know that when it comes to choosing somebody for a job
 for an award we are strongly biased by their race  
 we are biased by their their gender  we are biased by how attractive they are and sometimes we might say well fine that 's the way it should be but other times we say this is wrong 
  we don 't just try harder  
 but rather what we do is we set up situations where these other sources of information can 't bias us which is why many orchestras audition musicians behind screens  
 so the only information they have is the information they believe should matter 
 i think prejudice and bias
 illustrate a fundamental duality of human nature  we have gut
  and they affect our judgments and our actions
 for good and for evil 
 but we are also capable of rational deliberation and intelligent planning  
 and we can use these to in some cases accelerate and nourish our emotions  and in other cases staunch them  
 and it 's in this way that reason helps us create a better world
