  what you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure wind and temperature readings that were recorded of hurricane noel in two thousand and seven 
 the musicians played off a three dimensional graph of weather data like this every single bead every single colored band represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical
  note  
 i find weather extremely fascinating weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us  so i use sculpture and music to make it not just visible but also tactile and audible 
 all of my work begins very simple i extract information from a specific environment using very low tech
 data collecting devices generally anything i can find in the hardware store  i then compare my information
  to the things i find on the internet satellite images weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys that 's both historical as well as real data and then i compile all of these 
  numbers on these clipboards that you see here these clipboards are filled with numbers and from all of these numbers i start with only two or three variables that begins my translation process 
  vertical elements when i assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements i can use the changes of those data points over time
 to create the form  
 i use natural reed  because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that i cannot fully control that means that it is the numbers that control the form not me 
 what i come up with are forms like these these forms are completely made up of weather data or science data
 every colored bead every colored string represents a weather element and together these elements not only construct the form but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two dimensional graph 
 when you step closer you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers the vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the
  so all the way around you have a 24 hour timeline but it 's also used to assign a temperature range on that grid i can then weave the high tide readings water temperature air temperature and moon phases  
 i also translate weather data into musical scores and musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it so all of these 
  scores are made up of weather data every single color dot every single line is a weather element and together these variables construct a score
 i use these scores to collaborate with musicians this is the one thousand nine hundred and thirteen trio performing one of my pieces at the milwaukee art museum  
 meanwhile i use these scores as blueprints
 to translate into sculptural forms like this that function still in the sense of being a three dimensional weather visualization but now they 're
 embedding the visual matrix of the musical score so it can actually be read as
  a musical score  
 what i love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art versus science this piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it 
  you place it in an art museum it becomes a sculpture you place it in a science museum it becomes a three dimensional visualization of data you place it in a music hall it all of a sudden becomes a musical score  
 the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music the other reason why i really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point point into the complexity of science 
 and not everyone has a ph d in science so for me that was my way into it thank you
