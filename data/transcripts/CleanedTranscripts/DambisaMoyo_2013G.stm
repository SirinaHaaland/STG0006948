  give me liberty
 or give me death 
 when patrick henry the governor of virginia said these words in one thousand seven hundred and seventy five 
 he could never have imagined just how much they would come to resonate with american generations to come 
 at the time these
  words were earmarked and targeted against the british  but over the last two hundred years they 've come to embody what many westerners believe 
 that freedom
 is the most cherished value  and that the best systems of politics and economics have freedom embedded in them who could blame them over the
  the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapult the united states and western countries to new levels of economic development 
 in the united states over the past hundred years  incomes have increased thirty times  and hundreds of thousands of people have been moved out of poverty  
 meanwhile  american ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization
 and also helped in the creation
  and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets  
 it 's no surprise then that even at the depths of the private capitalism crisis  president obama said 
 the question before us is not whether the market is a force for good or
  its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is unmatched 
 thus there 's understandably a deep seated presumption among westerners that the whole world will decide to adopt private capitalism 
 as the model of economic growth liberal democracy and will continue to prioritize political rights over economic rights  
  in the emerging markets this is an illusion and even though the universal declaration of human rights which was signed in 
 was unanimously adopted what it did was to mask a schism
 that has emerged between developed and developing countries and the ideological beliefs between political and economic rights 
 this schism has only grown
  many people who live in the emerging markets where ninety percent of the world 's population lives 
 believe that the western obsession with political rights is beside the point 
 and what is actually important is delivering on food  shelter education and healthcare 
 give me liberty or give me death is all well and good if you can afford it 
 but if you 're living on less than one dollar a day you 're far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family
  than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy  
 now i know many people in this room and around the world will think well actually this is hard to grasp 
 because private capitalism and liberal democracy are held sacrosanct  
 but i ask you today  what would you do if you had to
  what if you had to choose between a roof over your head and the right to vote 
 over the last ten years i 've had the privilege to travel to over sixty countries 
 many of them in the emerging markets in latin america  asia  and my own continent of africa  
 i 've met with presidents dissidents  policymakers  lawyers teachers doctors and the man on the street  
 and through these conversations it 's become clear to me
 that many people in the emerging markets believe that there 's actually a split
 occurring between what people believe ideologically in terms of politics and economics in the west and that which people believe in the rest of the world  
 now don 't get me wrong i 'm not saying people in the emerging markets don 't understand democracy  
 nor am i saying that they wouldn 't ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders of course they would
 however  i am saying that on balance they worry more about where their living standard improvements are going to come from and how it is their governments can deliver for them 
  than whether or not the government was elected by democracy  
 the fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because
  there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the western ideological systems of politics and economics  and this is a system that is embodied by china 
 and rather than have private capitalism  they have state capitalism  instead of liberal democracy they have 
  the democratic system and they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights 
  i put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by china that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow 
 because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time 
 if you will indulge me  i will spend a few moments explaining to you first why economically they 've come to this belief 
 first of all
 's china 's economic performance over the past thirty years  she 's been able to produce record economic growth and meaningfully move many people out of poverty  
 specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty by moving over three hundred million people out of indigence  
 it 's not just in economics  but it 's also in terms of living standards we see
  that in china twenty eight percent of people had secondary school access today it 's closer to eighty two percent 
 so in its totality economic improvement has been quite significant  
 second 
 china has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct
  the united states and china are the two leading economies in the world  they have vastly different political systems and different economic systems one with private capitalism  another one broadly with state capitalism  
 however  these two countries have the identical gini coefficient which is a measure of income equality 
 perhaps what is more disturbing is that china 's income equality has been improving in recent times  whereas that of the united states has been declining
 thirdly 
 people in the emerging markets look at china 's amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout  
 this is not just about china building roads and ports and railways in her own country she 's been able to build eighty five thousand kilometers of road network in china and surpass that of the united states
 but even if you look to places like africa
 china has been able to help tar the distance of cape town to cairo  which is nine thousand miles or three times the distance of new york to california  
 now this is something that people can see and point to 
 perhaps it 's no surprise that in a two thousand and seven pew survey  when surveyed
  africans in ten countries said they thought that the chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins by as much as ninety eight percent  
 finally  
 china is also providing innovative solutions to  age old social problems that the world faces 
 if you travel to mogadishu  mexico city or mumbai you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics
  to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas  
 however through a network of state owned enterprises the chinese have been able to go into these rural areas  using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions 
 ladies and gentlemen it 's no surprise that around the world people are pointing at what china is doing and saying i like that i want that i want to be able to do what china 's doing that is the system that seems to work 
 i 'm here to also
  tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what china is doing in the democratic stance 
 in particular 
 there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets  when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth 
 in fact countries like
  not just china have shown that actually it 's economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy 
 in a recent study  
 the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last 
 the study found that if your per capita income is about one thousand dollars a year your democracy will last about eight and a half years  
 if your per capita income is between two thousand and four thousand dollars
  per year  then you 're likely to only get thirty three years of democracy and only if your per capita income is above six thousand dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water 
 what this is telling us is that we need to first establish a middle class that is able to hold the government accountable 
 but perhaps it 's also telling us that we should be worried about going around the world and shoehorning
  democracy  because ultimately we run the risk of ending up with illiberal democracies democracies that in some sense could be worse than the authoritarian governments that they seek to replace  
 the evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing freedom house finds that although fifty percent of the world
  countries today are democratic seventy percent of those countries are illiberal in the sense that people don 't have free speech or freedom of movement  
 but also we 're finding from freedom house in a study that they published last year that freedom has been on the decline every year for the past seven years  
 what this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy is we 've got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of
  democracy in a liberal way  and that has its roots in economics  
 but it also says that as china moves toward being the largest economy in the world something that is expected to happen by experts in two thousand and sixteen that 
  this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the west and the rest is likely to widen 
 the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism  greater protectionisms of 
 but also as i just pointed out a moment ago
 political rights and individual rights  the question that is left for us in general is what then should the west be
  i suggest that they have two options the west can either compete
 or cooperate  
 if the west chooses to compete with the chinese model and in effect go around the world and continue to try and push an agenda of private capitalism and liberal democracy  
 this is basically going against headwinds  but it also would be a natural stance for the west to take because in many ways it is the antithesis of the
 de prioritizing democracy and state capitalism  
 now the fact of the matter is if the west decides to compete  it will create a wider schism 
 the other option is for the west to cooperate  
 and by cooperating i mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility to figure out in an organic way
  what political and economic system works best for them  
 now i 'm sure some of you in the room will be thinking well this is like ceding to china 
 and this is a way in other words for the west to take a back seat  but i put it to you
 that if the united states and european countries want to remain globally influential they may have to consider cooperating in the short term in order to compete  
 and by that they might have to focus more aggressively on economic outcomes to help create the middle
  class and therefore be able to hold government accountable and create the democracies that we really want 
 the fact of the matter is that instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with china 
 the west should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions  
 instead of criticizing china
 for bad behavior the
  west should be showing how it is that their own system of politics and economics is the superior one  
 and instead of shoehorning democracy around the world  perhaps the west should take a leaf out of its own history book
 and remember that it takes a lot of patience in order to develop the models and the systems that you have today  
  the supreme court justice stephen breyer reminds us that it took the united states nearly one hundred and seventy years from the time that the constitution was written
 for there to be equal rights in the united states 
 some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights in fact there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law 
 at its very best the western model speaks for itself it 's the model that put food on the
  table  it 's the refrigerators it put a man on the moon  
 but the fact of the matter is although people back in the day used to point at the western countries and say i want that i like that there 's now a new person in town in the 
  form of a country china today generations are looking at china and saying china can produce infrastructure china can produce economic growth and we like that
  because ultimately  the question before us and the question before seven billion people on the planet is how can we create prosperity 
 people who care and will pivot towards the model of politics and economics in a very rational way to those models that will ensure that they can have better living standards in the shortest period of time 
 as you leave here today  i would like to leave you
 with a very personal message  which is what it is that i believe we should be doing as individuals  and this is really about being
 the fact that our hopes and dreams of creating prosperity for people around the world  creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people has to be based in being
 have good things and they have bad things 
 just to illustrate  i went into my annals of myself that 's a picture of me awww 
 i was born and raised in zambia
 in one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine at the time of my birth  blacks were not issued birth certificates
  and that law only changed in one thousand nine hundred and seventy three this is an affidavit from the zambian government 
 i bring this to you to tell you that in forty years i 've gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illustrious ted crowd today to talk to you about my views 
 in this vein we can increase
 economic growth we can meaningfully put a dent in poverty  
 but also  it 's going to require that we look at our assumptions assumptions and strictures that we 've grown up with
  around democracy around private capitalism around what creates economic growth and reduces poverty and creates freedoms we might have to tear those books up and start to look at other options and be open minded to seek the truth  
 ultimately it 's about transforming the world and making it a better place  thank you very much
