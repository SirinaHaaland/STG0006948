  know what a robot is right  if you don 't you 'd probably go to google and you 'd ask google what a robot is  so let 's do that 
 we 'll go to google and this is what we get now  you can see
 lots of different types of robots  but they 're predominantly humanoid in structure  
 and they look pretty conventional because they 've got plastic they 've got metal they 've got motors and gears and so on 
 some of them look quite friendly  and you could go up and you could hug them  
 some of them not so friendly  they look like they 're straight out of terminator in fact they may well be straight out of
  you can do lots of really cool things with these robots you can do really exciting stuff 
 but i 'd like to look at different kinds of robots i want to make different kinds of robots 
 and i take inspiration from the things that don 't look like us  but look like these 
 so these are natural biological organisms and they do some really cool things that we can 't and current robots can 't either  they do all sorts of great things like moving around on the floor they go into our gardens and they eat our crops
  they climb trees they go in water they come out of water  they trap insects and digest them  so they do really interesting things they live they breathe  
 they die  they eat things from the environment our current robots don 't really do that  now wouldn 't it be great if you could use some of those characteristics in future robots
 so that you could solve some really interesting problems
 i 'm going to look at a couple of problems now
  in the environment where we can use the skills and the technologies derived from these animals
 and from the plants and we can use them to solve those problems  let 's have a look at two environmental problems they
 're both of our making this is man interacting with the environment and doing some rather unpleasant things the first one is to do with the pressure of population  
 such is the pressure of population around
  world that agriculture and farming is required to produce more and more crops  now to do that  farmers put more and more chemicals onto the land  they put on fertilizers nitrates 
  pesticides all sorts of things that encourage the growth of the crops  
 and then when it rains 
 these chemicals go into the water table and in the water table  then they go into streams into lakes into rivers and into the sea 
 now if you put all of these chemicals these nitrates  into those kinds of environments there are organisms in those environments that will be affected by that
 algae for example algae loves nitrates it loves fertilizer so it will take in all
  these chemicals and if the conditions are right it will mass produce it will produce masses and masses of new algae  that 's called a bloom  
 the trouble is that when algae reproduces like this  it starves the water of oxygen as soon as you do that the other organisms in the water can 't survive  
 so what do we do
  we try to produce a robot that will eat the algae  consume it and make it safe  so that 's the first problem  
 the second problem is also of our making  and it 's to do with oil pollution  
 now oil comes out of the engines that we use the boats that we use sometimes tankers flush their oil tanks into the sea so oil is released into the sea that way wouldn
 't it be nice if we could treat that in some way using robots that could eat the pollution the oil fields have
  produced  so that 's what we do we make robots that will eat pollution to actually make the robot we take inspiration from two organisms
 on the right there you see the basking shark the basking shark is a massive shark it
  can swim with it as you can see and the basking shark opens its mouth and it swims through the water  collecting plankton
  it does that it digests the food  and then it uses that energy in its body to keep moving 
 so could we make a robot like that like the basking shark that chugs through the water and eats up pollution  
 well  let 's see if we can do that but also we take the inspiration from other organisms i 've got a picture here of a water boatman and the water boatman is really cute 
 when it 's swimming in the water it uses its
  push itself forward  so we take those two organisms and we combine them together to make a new kind of robot 
 in fact because we 're using the water boatman as inspiration  and our robot sits on top of the water and it rows  we call it the 
  so a row bot is a robot that rows ok so what does it look like here 's some pictures of the
  see it doesn 't look anything like the robots we saw right at the beginning google is wrong robots don 't look like that  they look like this  so i 've got the row bot here i
 'll just hold it up for you it gives you a sense of the scale  and it doesn 't look anything like the others  
 ok  so it 's made out of plastic and we 'll have a look now at the components that make up the  row bot what
  is made up of three parts and those three parts are really like the parts of any organism  it 's got a brain  it 's got a body and it 's got a stomach 
  it needs the stomach to create the energy any row bot will have those three components  and any organism will have those three components  so let 's go through them one at a time 
  it 's got flippers on the side here paddles that help it move  just like the water boatman  
 it 's got a plastic body but it 's got a soft rubber mouth mouth here and a mouth here it 's got two mouths  why does it have two mouths 
 one is to let the food go in and the other is to let the food go out  so you can see really it 's got a mouth and a derriere
  something where the stuff comes out which is just like a real organism  so it 's starting to look like that basking shark  so that 's the body  
 the second component might be the stomach we need to get the energy into the robot and we need to treat the pollution so the pollution goes in and it will do something 
 it 's got a cell in the middle here called a microbial fuel cell i 'll put this down and i 'll lift up the fuel cell here  so instead of having batteries instead of having
  power system  it 's got one of these this is its stomach  
 and it really is a stomach because you can put energy in this side in the form of pollution  and it creates electricity  so what is it it 's called a microbial fuel cell  it 's a little bit like 
  a chemical fuel cell which you might have come across in school or you might 've seen in the news chemical fuel cells take hydrogen and oxygen  and they can combine them together and you get electricity 
  technology it was in the apollo space missions that 's from forty fifty years ago 
 this is slightly newer this is a microbial fuel cell  it 's the same principle it 's got oxygen on one side but instead of having hydrogen on the other it 's got some soup  
 and inside that soup there are living microbes  now  if you take some organic material
 could be some
  the microbes will eat that food and they will turn it into electricity 
 not only that but if you select the right kind of microbes  you can use the microbial fuel cell to treat some of the pollution  
 if you choose the right microbes  the microbes will eat the algae  if you use other kinds of
 microbes  they will eat
 petroleum
  so you can see how this stomach could be used to not only treat the pollution but also to generate electricity from the pollution  
 so the robot will move through the environment taking food into its stomach 
 digest the food create electricity use that electricity to move through the environment and keep doing this ok  so let 's see what happens when we run the row bot when it does some rowing 
 here we 've got a couple of videos the first thing
  you can see here is the mouth open the front mouth and the bottom mouth open  
 and it will stay opened enough then the robot will start to row forward  it moves through the water so that food goes in as the waste products go out  once it 's moved enough it stops and then it closes the mouth slowly closes the mouths
 and then it will sit there and it will digest the food
 of course these microbial fuel cells they contain microbes what you really want is lots of energy coming out of those microbes as quickly as possible 
 but we can 't force the microbes and they generate a small amount of electricity per second they generate 
 let 's put that into context your mobile phone for example one of these modern ones if you use it it takes about one watt  so that 's a thousand or a million
  times as much energy that that uses compared to the microbial fuel cell
 how can we cope with that  well  when the row bot has done its digestion when it 's taken the food in it will sit there and it will wait until it has consumed all that food that could take some hours  it could take some days 
 a typical cycle for the
  looks like this  
 you open your mouth you move  you close your mouth and you sit there for a while waiting  
 once you digest your food then you can go about doing the same thing again  
 but you know what that looks like a real organism doesn 't it it looks like the kind of thing we do saturday night we go out open our mouths  fill our stomachs 
 sit in front of the telly and digest  
 when we 've had enough we do the same thing again 
  if we 're lucky with this cycle at the end of the cycle we 'll have enough energy left over for us to be able to do something else  we could send a message for example  we could send a message 
  saying this is how much pollution i 've eaten recently or this is the kind of stuff that i 've encountered or this is where i am  
  if you think about the oil slicks that we saw before or those massive algal blooms what you really want to do is put your row bot out there and it eats up all of those pollutions  and
 then you have to go collect them  why because these row bots at the moment  this row bot i 've got here it contains motors  it contains wires it contains components which themselves are not biodegradable 
 current row bots contain things like toxic batteries you can 't leave those in the environment
  so you need to track them  and then when they 've finished their job of work you need to collect them that limits the number of row bots you can use 
 if on the other hand you have robot a little bit like a biological organism  when it comes to the end of its life it dies and it degrades to nothing  
 so wouldn 't it be nice if these robots  instead of being like this made out of plastic were made out of other materials  which when you throw them out there they biodegrade
  that changes the way in which we use robots  instead of putting ten or one hundred out into the environment having to track them  and then when they die  collect them 
 you could put a thousand a million a billion robots into the environment just spread them around 
 you know that at the end of their lives they 're going to degrade to nothing you don 't need to worry about them  so that changes the way in which you think about robots and the way you
  then the question is can you do this well yes we have shown that you can do this you can make robots which are biodegradable 
 what 's really interesting is you can use household materials to make these biodegradable robots i 'll show you some you might be surprised 
 you can make a robot out of jelly  instead of having a motor  which we have at the moment  you can make things called artificial muscles artificial muscles are smart
  you apply electricity to them  and they contract or they bend or they twist they look like real muscles  
 so instead of having a motor you have these artificial muscles and you can make artificial muscles out of jelly if you take some jelly and some salts and 
 you can make an artificial muscle we 've also shown you can make the microbial fuel cell 's stomach out of paper  
 so you could make the whole robot out of biodegradable materials  you throw them out there and they degrade to nothing
  well  this is really really exciting it 's going to totally change the way in which we think about robots  
 but also it allows you to be really creative in the way in which you think about what you can do with these robots i 'll give you an example  if you can use jelly to make a robot now we eat jelly right so why not make something like this 
  thinks  it twists it bends it does something  it could go further down into your intestines  find out whether you 've got some ulcer or cancer  maybe do an injection something like that 
 you know that once it 's done its job of work  it could be consumed by your stomach  
 or if you don 't want that  it could go straight through you into the toilet  and be degraded safely in the environment  
 so this changes the way again in which we think about robots
 so we started off looking at robots that would eat pollution  and then we 're looking at robots which we can eat 
 i hope this gives you some idea of the kinds of things we can do with future robots  
 thank you very much for your attention
