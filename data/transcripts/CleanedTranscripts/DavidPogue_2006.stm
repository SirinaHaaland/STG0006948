  called for tech support again i ignored my boss 's
 now it 's evening and my dinner
 first grew cold and then grew mold  i 'm still on hold  i 'm listening
 to the sounds
 of silence  i don 't think you understand  i think your phone lines are unmanned 
 i punched every touch tone i was told
  i 've still spent eighteen hours on hold it 's not enough your software crashed my mac and it constantly hangs and bombs
 it erased my roms now the mac makes the sounds of silence in
 my dreams i fantasize
 of wreaking vengeance on you guys 
  motorcycle crashes blood comes gushing from your gashes with your fading strength 
 and you pray for a trained md  but you get me
  spot the ted presenter who used to be a broadway accompanist 
 when i was offered the times column six years ago  the deal was like this you 'll be sent the coolest hottest slickest new gadgets every week it 'll arrive at your door 
  you get to try them out play with them evaluate them until the novelty wears out before you have to send them back and you 'll get paid for it
  think about it if you want  so i 've always been a technology nut and
 i absolutely love it the job though came with one small downside and that is they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column
  and what i 've noticed is
 first of all you get an incredible amount of email if you ever are feeling lonely get a new york times column because you will get hundreds and hundreds
  hundreds of emails  and the email i 'm getting a lot today is about frustration people are feeling like things
 ok  i just had an alarm come up on my screen  lucky you can 't see it  
 people are feeling overwhelmed they 're feeling like it 's too much technology too fast it may be good technology  but i feel like there 's not enough of a support structure there 's not enough
 help there 's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it
  easy and enjoyable to use one time i wrote a column about my efforts to reach dell technical support and within twelve hours there were seven hundred messages
  from readers on the feedback boards on the times website from users saying me too and here 's my tale of woe 
 oh how did that get up there just kidding 
 ok so why is the problem accelerating and part of the problem is ironically because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use i 'll show you what i mean  
 this is what the computer interface used to look like 
 dos
  over the
  it 's gotten easier to use this is the original mac operating system 
 reagan was president madonna was still a brunette  and the entire operating system this is the good part the entire operating system fit in two hundred and eleven k  
 you couldn 't put the mac os x logo in two hundred and eleven k 
 laughter so the irony is that as these things became easier to use a less technical 
 broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time 
 i once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the apple call center for a day  the guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to 
 and the calls that
 you know how they say 
 your call may be recorded for quality assurance 
 uh uh your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a cd
 and i have a copy it
 's in your gift bag no no 
 with your voices on it
  so some of the stories are just so classic and yet so understandable a
 woman called apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking making a squeaking noise and the technician said well ma 'am what do you mean your mouse
  i can tell you is that it squeaks louder  the faster i move it across the screen 
 and the technician 's like ma 'am you 've got the mouse up against the screen she goes well the message said ' click here to continue ' 
 laughter well  if you like that one how much time have we got another one a guy
  this is absolutely true his computer had crashed and he told the technician he couldn 't restart it no matter how many times he typed eleven and the technician said 
 what why are you typing eleven he said the message says ' error type eleven ' 
 so 
 we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users  but why is the technical overload crisis
  the complexity crisis accelerating now in the hardware world it 's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller smaller smaller  so the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier  
 but our fingers are essentially staying the same size so it gets to be
 more and more of a challenge software is subject to another primal force  the mandate to release more and more versions when you
 buy a piece of software it 's not like buying a vase or a candy bar where you own it it 's more like joining a club where you pay dues every year and every year they say we 've added more features 
 and we 'll sell it to you for $ ninety nine i know one guy who 's spent $ four thousand just on photoshop over the years 
  which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times you eventually ruin it i mean 
 microsoft word was last just a word processor in you know the eisenhower administration 
 but what 's the alternative microsoft actually did this experiment they said well wait a minute everyone complains that we 're adding so many features let 's create a word processor that 's just a word processor simple pure does not do web pages
  it came out and it was called microsoft write and none of you are nodding in acknowledgment because it died it tanked no one ever bought it  
 i call this the sport utility principle people like to surround themselves with unnecessary power
 right they don 't need the database and the website  but they 're like well i 'll upgrade because i might you know i might need that someday 
 so the problem is as you add more features where are they going to go  where are you going to stick them you only have so
  many design tools  you can do buttons you can do sliders pop up menus  sub menus 
 but if you 're not careful about how you choose you wind up with this 
 this is an
 this is not a joke un retouched photo of microsoft word the copy that you have with all the toolbars open you 've
 obviously never opened all the toolbars  but
 all you have to type
  in is this little teeny window down here 
 and we 've arrived at the age of of interface matrices where there are so many features and options you have to do two dimensions you know a vertical and a horizontal 
 you guys all complain about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically
  the off switch is in there somewhere  
 i 'm telling you it 's there part of the art of designing a simple good interface is knowing when to use which one of these features so here is the log off dialogue box for windows two thousand there are only four choices  
 so why are they in a pop up menu  it 's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need
  they could have put them all out in view here 's apple 's take on the exact same dialogue box thank you yes  i designed the dialogue box no 
 no already we can see that apple and microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design
  microsoft 's approach to simplicity tends to be let 's break it down let 's just make it more steps
  there 's a new version of windows coming out this fall if they continue at this pace there 's absolutely no telling
 where they might wind up [
 welcome to the type a word wizard
  so there is a limit that we don 't want to cross 
 so what is the answer how do you pack in all these features in a simple intelligent way  
 i believe in consistency when possible real world equivalents trash can folder when possible  label things mostly  but i beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all which is intelligence
  now what do i mean by that i 'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent  but it 's better if you are buying something on the web you 're supposed to put in your address 
 and you 're supposed to choose what country you 're from ok  there are two hundred countries in the world we like to think of the internet as a global village  i 'm sorry  it 's not one yet  it 's mainly like the united
  you have to scroll like seven screensful to get to it  now it would be inconsistent to put united states first but it would be intelligent
  this one 's been touched on before  but why in god 's name do you shut down a windows pc by clicking a button called start 
 here 's another pet one of mine you have a printer
  most of the time you want to print one copy of your document in page order on that printer  so why in god 's name do you see this every time you print 
 it 's like a seven hundred and forty seven shuttle cockpit 
 and one of the buttons at the bottom
  i 'm not saying that apple is the only company who has embraced the
 the cult of simplicity 
 palm is also especially in the old days wonderful about this i actually got to speak to palm when they were flying high in the ' 90s and after the talk i met one of the employees
  palm pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus it 's too long  and it has to be redesigned ' so i 'm the tap counter 
 so i 'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter 
 this is microsoft word ok  when you want to create a new blank document in word
  you go up to the file menu and you choose new now what happens when you choose new do you get a new blank document you do not 
 on the opposite side of the monitor 
 a task bar appears and somewhere in those links by the way not at the top somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document  
 ok so that is a company
 not counting taps  you know i don 't want to just stand here and make fun of microsoft yes i do 
 the bill gates song i
 've been a geek forever
 and i wrote the very first dos  
 i put my software and
  together i got profit and they got the loss 
 i write the code that makes the whole world run i 'm getting royalties from
 everyone sometimes it 's garbage but the press is snowed 
  'll sell the code 
 every software company
 is doing microsoft 's r & d you can
 't keep a good idea down these days  even windows is a hack we 're kind of
 based loosely on the mac  so it 's big so it 's slow you 've got nowhere to go i 'm not doing this for praise 
  and i write the code
  i believe there are really two microsofts there 's the old one responsible for windows and office 
 they 're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh but they can 't they 're locked in because so many add ons and other company stuff locks into the old one thousand nine hundred and
  but there 's also a new microsoft that 's really doing good simple interface designs i liked the media center pc i liked the microsoft spot watch 
 the wireless watch flopped miserably in the market but it wasn 't because it wasn 't simply and beautifully designed but
 let 's put it this way  would you pay $ ten a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone and stops working when you leave your area code
 indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse so is there any hope the screens are getting smaller people are illuminating putting manuals in the boxes  things are coming out at a faster pace
  it 's funny when steve jobs came back to apple in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven after twelve years away it was the macworld expo he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans and he sort of did this the crowd went wild  but i had just seen
 i 'm like where have i seen this before i had just seen the movie evita 
 with madonna and i 'm like you know what i 've got to do one about steve jobs 
 it won 't be easy you 'll think i 'm strange 
 when i try to explain why i 'm back after telling the press apple 's future is black you
 all that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named woz 
 you try rhyming with garage
  are i made a fortune
 over at pixar don 't cry for me cupertino  i 've still got the
 drive and vision  i still wear sandals in any weather  it 's just that these days  they 're gucci leather
  steve jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty  and
 the the truth is for years i was a little depressed because americans obviously did not value it  because the mac had three percent market share windows had ninety five percent market share people did not think it was worth putting a price on it so i was i was a little depressed and
 i heard al gore 's talk and i realized i didn 't know the meaning of depressed 
 it turns out i was wrong right because the ipod came out and it violated every bit of common wisdom  other products cost less other products had more features they had voice recorders 
  and fm transmitters the other products were backed by microsoft with an open standard
  not apple 's propriety standard  but the ipod won this is the one they wanted the lesson was simplicity sells  and there are signs that the industry is getting the message this is a little company that 's done very well with simplicity and elegance
 the sonos thing it 's catching on i 've got just a couple examples  physically a really cool elegant thinking coming along lately
  when you have a digital camera  how do you get the pictures back to your
  you either haul around a usb cable or you buy a card reader and haul that around either one you 're going to lose what i do is i take out the memory card  and i fold it in half 
 revealing usb contacts i just stick it in the computer offload the pictures put it right back in the camera i never have to lose anything
  here 's another example  chris you 're the source of all power will you be my power
  hold that and don 't let go  you might 've seen this this is apple 's new laptop this the power cord it hooks on like this and i 'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives  or one of your children  
 you walk along and i 'm about to pull this onto the floor i don 't care it 's a loaner here we go 
 whoa it 's magnetic it doesn 't pull the laptop onto the floor 
  lot of my work using speech recognition software and i 'll just you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous
  speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly period like i get hundreds of them a day period  
 and it 's not just what i dictate
 that it writes down period  i also use this feature called voice macros period
  this is not an ideal situation because it 's getting the echo from the hall and stuff the point is i can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word  and having it write out a much longer thing so if somebody sends me a fan letter
  if somebody sends me hate mail which happens daily i say
 so the point is
 this is a really interesting story this is version eight of this software and do you know what they put in version eight no new features it 's never happened before in software the company put no new features they just said we 'll make this software work right 
 right  because for years people had bought this software tried it out ninety five percent accuracy was all they got which means one in twenty words is wrong and they 'd put it in their drawer
  the company got sick of that so they said this version we 're not going to do anything  but make sure it 's darned accurate and so that 's what they did this cult of doing things right is starting to spread so my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology
  remember if it doesn 't work it 's not necessarily you ok it could be the design of the thing you 're using
  be aware in life of good design and bad design and if you 're among the people who create this stuff 
 easy is hard pre sweat the details for your audience 
 count the taps  remember  the hard part is not deciding what features to add  it 's deciding what to leave out and best of all your motivation is  simplicity sells
