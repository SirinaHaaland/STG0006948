  to be here i last did a ted talk i think about seven years ago or so i talked about spaghetti sauce  and
 so many people i guess watch those videos people have been coming up to me
 ever since to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce which is a wonderful thing in the short term laughter
 but it 's proven to be less than ideal
 over seven years and so i though i would come and try and put spaghetti sauce behind me the theme of this morning 's
 session is things we make and so i thought i would
 tell a story about someone who made one of the most precious objects of his era  
 and the man 's name is carl norden carl norden was born in one thousand eight hundred and eighty  and
 he was swiss and of course the swiss can be divided into two general categories those who make small exquisite  expensive objects
  and those who handle the money of those who buy small exquisite
 expensive objects and carl norden is very firmly in the former camp  he 's an engineer he goes to the
 federal polytech in zurich
 in fact one of his classmates is a young man named named lenin who would go on to break small  expensive exquisite objects
  and he 's a swiss
  i mean that in its fullest sense of the word he wears three piece suits and he has a very very small  important
 mustache  
 and he is domineering and narcissistic and driven and has an extraordinary ego and he works  16 hour days 
 and he has very strong feelings about alternating current  and he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness
  and he drinks lots of coffee and he does his best work sitting in his mother 's kitchen in zurich for hours in complete silence with nothing but a slide rule
 in any case carl norden emigrates to the united states
 just before the first world war and sets up shop on lafayette street
 in downtown manhattan  and he becomes obsessed with the question of how to drop bombs from an airplane
 now if you think about it in the age before gps and radar that was obviously a really difficult problem it 's a complicated physics problem 
 you 've got a plane that 's thousands of feet up in the air going at hundreds of miles an hour  and you 're trying to drop an object a bomb towards some stationary target 
 in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments and all
  sorts of people
  moving up to the first world war and between the wars tried to solve this problem  and nearly everybody came up short  the bombsights that were available were incredibly crude  
 but carl norden is really the one who cracks the code  and he comes up with this incredibly complicated device it weighs about fifty lbs
 it 's called the norden mark fifteen bombsight and it has all kinds of levers
  and ball bearings and gadgets and gauges and
 he makes this complicated thing and what what he allows people to do is he makes the bombardier
 take this particular object  visually sight the target target because they 're in the plexiglas cone of the bomber 
 and then they plug in the altitude of the plane  the speed of the plane  the speed of the wind and
  and the coordinates
 of of the target  and the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb
 and as norden famously says before that bombsight came along 
 bombs would routinely miss their target by a mile or more but he said with the mark fifteen norden bombsight  he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at twenty thousand ft
  now i cannot tell
  you how incredibly excited the u s military was by the news of the norden bombsight
  it was like manna from heaven here was an army that had just had experience in the first world war where millions of men fought each other in 
  the trenches getting nowhere making no progress  and here someone had come up with
  up in the skies high above enemy territory and destroy whatever they wanted with pinpoint accuracy 
 and the u s military spends one point five billion dollars billion dollars in one thousand nine hundred and forty dollars developing the norden bombsight  and to put that in perspective
  the total cost of the
  manhattan project was three billion dollars half as much money was spent on this norden bombsight as was spent on the most famous military industrial project of the modern era  
 and there were people strategists within the u s military who genuinely thought that this single device was going to spell the difference between defeat and victory when it came to the battle against the nazis and against the japanese 
 and for norden as well this device had incredible moral importance because
  was a committed christian  in fact he would always get upset when people referred to the bombsight as his invention because in in his eyes  only god could invent things he was simply the instrument of god 's will  
 and what was god 's will well god 's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible
  and what did the norden bombsight do well it allowed you to do that it allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb  
 so in the years leading up to the second world war the u s military buys ninety thousand of these norden bombsights
 at a cost of $ fourteen thousand each again in one thousand nine hundred and forty dollars that 's a lot of money  
 and they trained fifty thousand bombardiers on how to use them long extensive
  sessions because these things are essentially analog computers they 're not easy to use   and they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath 
 to swear that if they 're ever captured  they will not divulge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy because it 's imperative the enemy not get their hands on this absolutely 
  essential piece of technology  and whenever the norden bombsight is taken onto a plane  it 's escorted there by a series of armed
  guards  and it 's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it and the box is handcuffed to one of the guards it 's never allowed to be photographed  and there 's a little incendiary 
  device inside of it so that if the plane ever crashes it will be destroyed and there 's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it 
 so what happens during the second world war
 well it
 turns out it 's not the holy grail  in practice the norden bombsight can drop a
 bomb into a pickle barrel at twenty thousand ft but that 's under perfect conditions and of course  in wartime conditions aren 't perfect 
 first of all it 's really hard to use really hard to use and not all of the people who are of those fifty thousand men who are bombardiers
 have the ability to properly program an analog computer
  secondly it breaks down a lot  it 's full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball bearings and they don 't work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle 
 thirdly when norden was making his calculations he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes  well in a real war
  get shot down 
 so they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds and the norden bombsight doesn 't work as well under those conditions  
 but most of all the norden bombsight required the bombardier to make visual contact with the target  but of course what happens in real life 
 there are clouds 
 right it needs cloudless sky to be really accurate well how many cloudless skies do you think there were above central europe between
  and forty five 
 not a lot
 and then to give you a sense of just how inaccurate the norden bombsight was there was a famous case in one thousand nine hundred and forty four where the allies bombed a chemical plant in leuna germany  and the chemical 
  plant comprised seven hundred and fifty seven acres  and over the course of twenty two
  thousand bombs on this seven hundred and fifty seven acre chemical plant using the norden bombsight  
 well what percentage of those bombs do you think actually landed inside the 700 acre perimeter of the plant  
 ten percent
  ten percent  and of those ten percent that landed sixteen percent didn 't even go off they were duds  the leuna chemical plant after one of the most
  extensive bombings in the history of the war was up and running within weeks and
 by the way all those precautions to keep the norden bombsight out of the hands of the nazis  well it turns out that
 that carl norden as a proper swiss was very enamored of german engineers  so in the 1930s he hired a whole bunch of them 
  gave a complete set of the plans for the norden bombsight to the nazis so they had their own norden bombsight throughout the entire war which also by the way didn 't work very well 
 so why do we talk about the norden bombsight  
 well because we live in an age where there are lots and lots of norden bombsights 
 we live in a time where there are all kinds of really really smart people running around saying that they 've invented gadgets
  that will forever change our world they 've invented websites that will allow people to be free they 've invented some kind of this thing or this thing or this thing that will make our world forever better 
 if you go into the military 
 you 'll find lots of carl nordens as well if you go to the pentagon they will say you know what now we really can put a bomb inside a pickle barrel at twenty thousand ft 
 and you know what it 's true  they actually
  can do that now but we need to be very clear about how little that means 
 in the iraq war at the beginning of the first iraq war the u s military the air force sent two squadrons of of f 15e fighter eagles to the iraqi desert equipped 
  with these five million dollar cameras that allowed them to see the entire desert floor  and their mission was to find and to destroy remember the scud
  missile launchers those surface to air missiles that the iraqis were launching at the israelis 
 the mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the scud missile launchers  and so they flew missions day and night and they dropped thousands of bombs and they fired thousands of missiles in an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge  
  and after the war was over there was an audit done as the army always does the air force always does and they asked the question how many scuds did we actually destroy you know what
 the answer was 
 zero  not a single one  now why is that is it because their weapons weren 't accurate  oh no  
 they were brilliantly accurate  they could have destroyed this little thing right here from twenty five thousand ft 
 the issue was they didn 't know where the
  the problem with bombs and pickle barrels is not getting the bomb inside the pickle barrel  it 's knowing how to find the pickle barrel
  that 's always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars  
 or take the battle in afghanistan 
 what is the signature weapon of the cia 's war in northwest pakistan it 's the drone 
 what is the drone  well it is the grandson of the norden mark fifteen bombsight it is this weapon of
  devastating accuracy and precision  and over the course of the last six years in northwest
 pakistan  the cia has flown hundreds of drone missiles and it 's used those drones to kill two thousand suspected pakistani 
 and taliban militants now what is the accuracy of those drones  well it 's extraordinary
 ninety five percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes ninety five percent of the people we kill need to be killed right that is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare but
 do you know what the crucial thing is 
 in that exact same period that we 've been using these drones with devastating accuracy 
 the number of attacks of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks against american forces in afghanistan has increased
 tenfold 
 as we have gotten more and more efficient in killing them  
 they have become angrier and angrier and more and more motivated to kill us 
 i have not described to you a success story  i 've described to you the opposite of a success story  
 and this is the problem with our
  our infatuation with the things we make 
 we think the things we make can solve our problems but our problems are much more complex than that 
 the issue isn 't the accuracy of the bombs you have it 's how you use the bombs you have and more importantly  whether you ought to use bombs at all
 there 's a postscript
 to the norden story of carl norden and his fabulous
  called the enola gay flew over japan
 and using a norden bombsight  dropped a very large thermonuclear device on the city of hiroshima  
 and as was typical with the norden bombsight  the bomb actually missed its target by eight hundred ft but of course
  it didn 't matter  and that 's the greatest irony of all when it comes to the norden  bombsight 
 the air force 's one point five billion dollar bombsight was used to drop its three billion dollar bomb  which didn 't need a bombsight at all 
 meanwhile back in new york no one told carl norden that his bombsight was used over hiroshima  
 he was a committed christian  he thought he had designed something that would reduce the toll of
  suffering in war  it would have broken his heart
