  the decorative use of wire in southern africa dates back hundreds of years  
 but modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material in the form of telephone wire 
 rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials
 natural grasses so here you can see the change from use starting to use
 contemporary materials  these pieces date back from the ' 40s to the late ' 50s 
 in the ' 90s my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form  which came from a squatter camp outside durban
  i got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point and started developing really and mentoring them
 in terms of scale  in terms of the design
  and the project soon grew from five to fifty weavers in about a year 
 soon we had outgrown the scrap yards  what they could provide so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us  
 and not only to supply the materials on on bobbins but to produce to our color specifications
 at the same time i was thinking well there 's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products  away from the ethnic a little bit more contemporary 
 so i developed a whole range around mass produced range
 that obviously fitted into a much  higher end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market 
 we started experimenting as you can see in terms of shapes
 forms the scale became very important  and it 's
 become our pet project it 's successful it 's been running for twelve years  and
 we supply the conran shops and donna karan and so it 's kind of great this is our group our main group of weavers  they come on a weekly basis to
  all have bank accounts they 've all moved back to the rural area where they came from it 's a weekly turnaround of production  
 this is the community that i originally showed you the slide of and that 's also modernized today  and it 's supporting
 work for three hundred weavers  and the rest says it all
