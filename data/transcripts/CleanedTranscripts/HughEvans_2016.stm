  i want to introduce you to an amazing woman her name is
  was born in jamaica  emigrated to the us at the age of eighteen and now lives just outside of washington
  nor a lobbyist she 'd probably tell you she 's quite unremarkable but she 's having the most remarkable impact 
 what 's incredible about davinia is that she 's willing to spend time every single week focused on people who are not her 
 people not her in her neighborhood her state  nor even in her country
 people she 'd likely never meet
  's impact started a few years ago when she reached out to all of her friends on facebook  and asked them to donate their pennies so she could fund girls ' education 
 she wasn 't expecting a huge response  but seven hundred thousand pennies later she 's now sent over one hundred and twenty girls to school 
 when we spoke last week she told me she 's become a little infamous at the local bank every time she rocks up with a shopping cart
  far from it she 's part of a growing movement  and there 's a name for people like davinia global citizens 
 a global citizen is someone who 
  first and foremost not as a member of a state a tribe or a nation  but as a member of the human race  and someone who is prepared to
 our world 's greatest challenges 
 our work is focused on finding  
 supporting and activating global citizens they exist in every country and among every demographic 
 i want to make the case to you today that the world 's future depends on global citizens  
 i 'm convinced that if we had more global citizens active in our world then every single one of the major challenges we face from poverty
  change  gender inequality these issues become solvable they are ultimately global issues  and they can ultimately only be solved by global citizens demanding global solutions from their leaders 
 now some people 's immediate reaction to this idea is that it 's either a bit utopian
  like to share with you a little of my story today  how i ended up here how it connects with davinia and hopefully with you 
 growing up in melbourne australia  i was one of those seriously irritating little kids that never ever stopped asking why you might have been one yourself i used 
  to ask my mum the most annoying questions i 'd ask her questions like mum why i can 't i dress up and play with puppets all day 
  what is a shrimp  and why do we have to keep throwing them on the barbie and mum this haircut  why 
 laughter the worst haircut
 i think still terrible  as a why kid  i thought i could change the world and it was impossible to convince me otherwise  and when i was twelve and in my first year of high school i started raising money for communities in the
  developing world we were a really enthusiastic group of kids and we raised more money than any other school in australia and so i was awarded the chance to go to the philippines to learn more 
 we were taken into a slum in the outskirts of manila  it was there i became friends with sonny boy who lived on what was literally a pile of steaming garbage
  called it but don 't let the romance of that name fool you because it was nothing more than a rancid landfill that kids like sonny boy spent hours rummaging through every single day to find something anything of value 
 that night with sonny boy and his family changed my life forever because when it came time to go to sleep we simply laid down on this concrete slab
 the size of half my bedroom with myself sonny boy and the rest of his family
 seven of us in this long line with the smell of rubbish all around us and cockroaches crawling all around 
 and i didn 't sleep a wink but i lay awake thinking to myself why should anyone have to live like this when i have so much 
 why should sonny boy 's ability to live out his dreams be determined by where he 's born or what warren buffett
  i just didn 't get it  and i needed to understand why  
 now i only later came to understand that the poverty i 'd seen in the philippines was the result of decisions made or not made
 by a succession of colonial powers and corrupt governments who had anything but the interests of sonny boy at heart sure they didn 't create smoky mountain but they may as
 and if we 're to try to help kids like sonny boy  it wouldn 't work just to try to send him a few dollars or to try to clean up the garbage dump on which he lived 
 because the core of the problem lay elsewhere  
 and as i worked on community development projects over the coming years trying to help build schools  train teachers and tackle hiv and aids  i came to see that community development should be driven by communities
  and that although charity is necessary it 's not sufficient 
 we need to confront these challenges on a global scale and in a systemic way  and the best thing i could do is try to mobilize a large group of citizens back home to insist that our leaders engage in that systemic change 
 that 's why a few years later  i joined with a group of college friends in bringing the make poverty history campaign
  we had this dream of staging this small concert around the time of the g20 with local aussie artists and it suddenly exploded one day when we got a phone call from bono  the edge and pearl jam who all agreed to headline
 our concert  i got a little bit excited that day as you can see 
 but to our amazement the australian government heard our
  and they agreed to double investment into global health and development an additional six point two billion dollars  
 it felt like 
 it felt like this incredible validation by rallying citizens together we helped persuade 
  our government to do the unthinkable and act to fix a problem miles outside of our borders  
  see there was a change in government and six years later all that new money disappeared what did we learn 
 we learned that one off spikes are not enough 
 we needed a sustainable movement not one that is susceptible to the fluctuating moods of a politician or the hint of an economic
  to happen everywhere  
 otherwise every individual government would have this built in excuse mechanism that they couldn 't possibly carry the burden of global action alone  
 and so this is what we embarked upon  
 and as we embarked upon this challenge  we asked ourselves how do we gain enough pressure and build a broad enough army to win these fights for the long term 
 we could only think of one way we needed to somehow turn that short term excitement of
  involved with the make poverty history campaign into long term passion it had to be part of their identity 
 so in two thousand and twelve we cofounded an organization that had exactly that as its goal  
 and there was only one name for it global citizen  
 but this is not about any one organization 
  this is about citizens taking action 
 and research data tells us that of the total population who even care about global issues 
 only eighteen percent have done anything about it  
 it 's not that people don 't want to act it 's often that they don 't know how to take action or that they believe that their actions will have no effect  
 so we had to somehow recruit and activate millions of citizens in dozens of countries to put pressure on their leaders to behave altruistically and
  we did so we discovered something really thrilling 
 that when you make global citizenship your mission  you suddenly find yourself with some extraordinary allies  
 see extreme poverty isn 't the only issue that 's fundamentally global so too is climate change  human rights  gender equality even conflict  
 we found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with people who are passionate about targeting all these interrelated
  issues  but how did we actually go about recruiting and engaging those global citizens  well  
 we used the universal language  
 music  we launched the global citizen festival in the heart of new york city in central park  and we persuaded some of the world 's biggest artists to participate  
 we made sure that these festivals coincided with the un general assembly meeting so that leaders who need to
  hear our voices couldn 't possible ignore them 
 but there was a twist 
 you couldn 't buy a ticket you had to earn it 
 you had to take action on behalf of a global cause  and only once you 'd done that could you earn enough points to qualify  
 activism is the currency  
 i had no interest in citizenship purely as some sort of feel good thing for me citizenship means you
  to act  and that 's what we required  and amazingly it worked 
 last year more than one hundred and fifty five thousand citizens in the new york area alone earned enough points to qualify  
 globally we 've now signed up citizens in over one hundred and fifty countries around the world  and last year we signed up more than one hundred thousand new members each and every
 week of the whole year 
 see  
 we don 't need to create global citizens from nothing we 're already everywhere  we just need to be organized and motivated to start acting  
 and this is where i believe we can learn a lot from davinia who started taking action as a global citizen back in two thousand and twelve 
 here 's what she did  it wasn 't rocket science she started writing letters
  emailing politicians ' offices she volunteered her time in her local community that 's when she got active on social media and started to collect pennies
 a lot of pennies 
 now maybe that doesn 't sound like a lot to you how will that achieve anything 
 well  it achieved a lot because she wasn 't alone her actions  alongside one hundred
  thousand other global citizens ' led the us government to double their investment into global partnership for education and here 's dr raj shah  the head of usaid  making that announcement 
  see when thousands of global citizens find inspiration from each other it 's amazing to see their collective power 
  modi of india affirmed his commitment to put a toilet in every household and school across india by two thousand and nineteen 
 global citizens encouraged by the late night host stephen colbert
 launched a twitter invasion on norway  erna solberg the country 's prime minister got the message committing to double
  global citizens together with rotarians called on the canadian uk and australian governments to boost their investment into polio eradication 
 they got together and committed six hundred and sixty five million dollars  
 but despite all of this momentum 
 we face some huge challenges  see you might be thinking to yourself how can we possibly persuade world leaders to sustain a focus on global issues
  the powerful american politician tip o 'neill once said all politics is local 
 that 's what always got politicians elected 
 to seek gain and hold onto power through the pursuit of local or at very best national interests 
 i experienced this for the first
  and behind closed doors i shared with him my passion to end extreme poverty i said minister australia has this 
  opportunity to help achieve the millennium development goals we can do this and he paused  looked down on me with cold dismissive eyes
 and he said hugh no one gives a funk about foreign aid except he didn 't use the word funk 
 he went on he said we need to look after our own backyard first 
 this is i believe outdated even dangerous thinking or as my late grandfather would say complete bs  
 parochialism offers this false dichotomy because it pits the poor in one country
  the poor in another  it pretends we can isolate ourselves and our nations from one another  
 the whole world is our backyard  and we ignore it at our peril see look what happened when we ignored rwanda when we ignore syria when we ignore climate change  political leaders ought to give a funk because the impact of climate change and extreme poverty
 comes right to our shore 
 now global citizens they understand this we live in a time that favors the global citizen in an age where every single voice can be heard 
 see do you remember when the millennium development goals were signed back in the year two thousand the most we could do in those days was fire off a letter and wait for the next election 
 there was no social media today  billions of citizens have more
  more tools more access to information more capacity to influence than ever before both the problems and the tools to solve them are right before us 
 the world has changed  and those of us who look beyond our borders are on the right side of history 
 so where are we 
 so we run this amazing festival we 've scored some big policy wins  and citizens are signing up all over the world  
 but have we achieved our mission
 no we have such a long way to go  but this is the opportunity that i see  
 the concept of global citizenship self evident in its logic
 but until now impractical in many ways  has coincided with this particular moment in which we are privileged to live 
 we as global citizens now have a unique opportunity
 to accelerate large scale positive change around the world  
 so in the months and years ahead  global citizens will hold world leaders accountable to ensure that the new global goals for sustainable development are tracked and implemented  
 global citizens will partner with the world 's leading ngos to end diseases like polio and malaria global citizens will sign up in every corner of this globe
  the frequency  quality and impact of their actions these dreams are within reach imagine an army of millions
 growing into tens of millions  connected  informed  engaged
 and unwilling to take no for an answer 
  over all these years  i 've tried to reconnect with sonny boy  sadly i 've been unable to 
 we met long before social media and his address has now been relocated by the authorities as often happens with slums i
 'd love to sit down with him wherever he is and share with him how much the time i
 i spent on smoky mountain inspired me  thanks to him and so many others i came to understand the importance of being part of a movement of people
 the kids willing to look up from their screens and out to the world  the global citizens  
 global citizens who stand together who ask the question why who reject the naysayers  and embrace the amazing
 possibilities of the world we share
