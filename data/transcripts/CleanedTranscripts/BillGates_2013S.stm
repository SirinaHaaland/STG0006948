  needs a coach  it doesn 't matter whether you 're a basketball player a tennis player a gymnast or a bridge player
  my bridge coach  sharon osberg says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else 's in the world 
 sorry sharon  here you go  
 we all need people who will give us feedback that 's how we improve  
 unfortunately there 's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better 
 and these people have one of the most
  important jobs in the world  i 'm talking about teachers 
 when melinda and i learned how little useful feedback most teachers get we were blown away  
 until recently  over ninety eight percent of teachers just got one word of feedback 
 satisfactory  
 if all my bridge coach ever told me
 was that i was
 i would have no hope of ever getting better how would i know
 who was the best how would i know what i was doing differently 
 today  districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers 
 but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice our teachers deserve better
  the system we have today isn 't fair to them it 's not fair to students and it 's putting america 's global leadership at risk  
 so today i want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve  
 let 's start by asking
 who 's doing
  unfortunately there 's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems  so i looked at the countries whose students perform well academically  
 and looked at what they 're doing to help their teachers improve  
 consider the rankings for reading proficiency the u s isn 't number one we 're not even in the top ten 
  out of all the places that do better than the u s in reading  how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve  
 eleven out of fourteen 
 the u s is tied for 15th in reading  but we 're 23rd in science and 31st in math 
 so there 's really only one area where we 're near the top and that 's in failing to give
  our teachers the help they need to develop their skills  
 let 's look at the best academic performer the province of shanghai  china  
 now they rank number one across the board in reading  math and science 
 and one of the keys to shanghai 's incredible success is the way they help
 teachers keep improving they made sure that
  younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work 
 they have weekly study groups where teachers get together and talk about what 's working 
 they even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues 
 you might ask why is a system like this so important it 's because there 's so much variation in the teaching profession
 some teachers are far more effective than others 
 in fact there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains if today 's average teacher could become as good as those teachers 
 our students would be blowing away
 the rest of the world  so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
  would that system look like well to find out our foundation has been working with three thousand teachers in districts across the country
 on a project called measures of effective teaching 
 we had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of
  for example did they ask their students challenging questions did they find multiple ways to explain an idea  
 we also had students fill out surveys with questions like does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson 
 do you learn to correct your mistakes 
 and what we found is very exciting  first the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes
  so it tells us we 're asking the right questions  
 and second teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools because they pointed to specific places where they can improve 
 i want to show you what this video
  let 's talk about what 's going on today to get started we 're
 doing a peer review day okay a peer review day and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays my name is sarah 
  brown wessling  i am a high school english teacher at johnston high school in johnston iowa turn to somebody next to you tell them what you think i mean when i
  talk about moves to prove i 've talk about i think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it okay so i would 
  like you to please bring up your papers  i think what video offers for us is
  is a lot to be learned from that and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this  
 i just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide angle lens 
 at the beginning of class i just perch it in the back of the classroom it 's not a perfect shot it doesn 't catch every little thing that 's going on but i can hear the sound  i can see a lot
  i 'm able to learn a lot from it so it really has been a simple
 but powerful tool in my own reflection all right let 's take a look at the long one first  okay  
 once i 'm finished taping then i put it in my computer and then i 'll scan it and take a peek at it if i don 't write things down i don 't remember them so having the notes is a part of my thinking process  and i discover what i 'm seeing
  as i 'm writing i really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management and just all 
  of those different facets of of the classroom  i 'm glad that we 've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works what doesn 't i think that video
  understand what this complex work is really all about i think it is a way to
 exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan  things you cannot convey in a standard things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a
  we 'd like every classroom in america to look something like that 
 but we still have more work to do diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle
  we also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis  if you learn that you need
  to improve the way you teach fractions you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions  
 so building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won 't be easy 
 for example i know some teachers aren 't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the
  that 's understandable but our experience with met
 suggests that if teachers manage the process  if they collect video in their own classrooms and they pick the lessons they want to submit a lot of them will be eager to participate  
 building this system will also require a considerable investment our foundation
  that it could cost up to five billion dollars  
 now that 's a big number 
 but to put it in perspective it 's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries 
 the impact for teachers would be phenomenal 
 we would finally have a way to give them feedback as well as the means to act on it 
 but this system would have an even more important benefit for our country
 it would put us on a path
 to making sure all our students get a great education 
 find a career that 's fulfilling and rewarding  and have a chance to live out their dreams 
 this wouldn 't just make us a more successful country it would also make us a more fair and just one
  i 'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve  i hope you are too  thank you
