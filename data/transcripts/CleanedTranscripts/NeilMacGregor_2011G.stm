  the things we make have one supreme quality they live longer than us 
 we perish they survive we have one life they have many lives and in each life they can mean different things 
 which means that while we all have one
  biography they have many 
 i want this morning to talk about the story the biography or rather the biographies of one particular object 
 one remarkable thing  
 it doesn 't i agree  look very much it 's about the size of a rugby ball  
 it 's made of clay  and it 's been fashioned into a cylinder
 shape  covered with close writing
 and then baked dry in the sun  
 and as you can see it 's been knocked about a bit which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago
 and was dug up in
 in the politics of the middle east  and it 's
 an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet  the story begins
 in the 
 war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of iraq by foreign forces  the removal
 of a despotic ruler
 and instant regime change  
 and i want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with 
 belshazzar 's feast
 because we 're talking about the iran iraq war of five hundred and thirty nine bc 
 and the parallels between the events of five hundred and thirty nine bc and two thousand and three
  and in between are startling 
 what you 're looking at is rembrandt 's painting now in the national gallery in london illustrating the text from the prophet daniel in the hebrew scriptures 
 and you all know roughly the story  belshazzar  the son of nebuchadnezzar  nebuchadnezzar who 'd conquered israel sacked jerusalem and captured the people and taken the jews back to babylon  not only the jews
  jews he 'd taken the temple vessels he 'd ransacked  desecrated the temple and the great gold vessels of the temple in jerusalem had been taken to babylon  
 belshazzar 
 his son  decides to have a feast 
 and in order to make it even more exciting he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun  and he brings out the temple vessels he 's already at war with the
  iranians with the king of persia  and that night 
 daniel tells us at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall 
 you are weighed in the balance and found wanting and your kingdom is handed over to the medes and the persians 
 and that very night
  a great moment in the history of the jewish people  
 it 's a great story it 's story we all know the writing on the wall is part of our everyday language 
 what happened next was remarkable  and it 's where our cylinder enters the story
  king of the persians has entered babylon without a fight
 the great empire of babylon  which ran from central southern iraq to the mediterranean  falls to cyrus 
 and cyrus makes a declaration  
 and that is what this cylinder is the declaration made by the ruler guided by god who had toppled the iraqi despot
 and was going to bring freedom to the people 
 in ringing babylonian it was written in babylonian he says i am cyrus  king of all the universe the great king the powerful king king of babylon  king of the four quarters of the world they
 're not shy of hyperbole as you can see 
 this is probably the first real press release
 by a victorious army that
  we 've got  
 and it 's written as we 'll see in due course  by very skilled  p r consultants 
 so the hyperbole is not actually surprising  and what is the great king the powerful king the king of the four quarters of the world going to do 
 he goes on to say that having conquered babylon  he will at once let all the peoples that the babylonians nebuchadnezzar and belshazzar
 have captured and enslaved
 go free  he 'll let them return to their countries  and more important  he will let them all recover
 the gods the statues the temple vessels that had been confiscated 
 all the peoples that the babylonians had repressed and removed will go home and they 'll take with
  and they 'll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way in their own place  this is the decree 
 this object is the evidence
 for the fact that the jews  after the exile in babylon  the years they 'd spent sitting by the waters of babylon  weeping when they remembered jerusalem 
  they were allowed to return to jerusalem and to rebuild the temple  
 it 's a central document in jewish history  
 and the book of chronicles  the book of ezra in the hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms  
 this is the jewish version of the same story thus said cyrus  king of persia ' all the kingdoms of the earth have the lord god of heaven
  and he has charged me to build him a house in jerusalem who is there among you of his people 
 the lord god be with him and let him go up ' 
 go up aaleh  the central element still of the notion of return 
 a central part of the life of judaism 
 as you all know that return from exile
  that great historic moment was made possible by cyrus the king of persia  
 reported for us in hebrew in scripture and in babylonian in clay 
 two great texts what about the politics what was going on
 was the fundamental shift in middle eastern history  the empire of iran the medes and the persians
  united under cyrus  became the first great world empire 
 cyrus begins in the 530s bc 
 and by the time of his son darius the whole of the eastern mediterranean is under persian control 
 this empire is in fact  the middle east as we now know it and it 's what shapes the middle east as we now know it it was the
 empire the world had known until then much more important it was the first
 multicultural multifaith state
 on a huge scale  and it had to be run in a quite new way  
 it had to be run in different languages the fact that this decree is in babylonian says one thing  and it had to recognize their different habits different peoples different religions
 different faiths all of those are respected by cyrus cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational multifaith
  multicultural society  and the result of that was an empire
 that included the areas you see on the screen and which survived for two hundred years of stability
 until it was shattered by alexander  it left a dream of the middle east as a unit and a unit where people of different faiths could live together
 the greek invasions ended that and of course alexander couldn 't sustain a government and it fragmented 
 but what cyrus represented remained absolutely central the greek historian xenophon
 wrote his book cyropaedia promoting cyrus as the great ruler and throughout
  cyrus remained the model this is a 16th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was and
 xenophon 's book on cyrus on how you ran a diverse society
 was one of the great textbooks that inspired the founding fathers of the american revolution  jefferson was a great admirer the ideals of cyrus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create
  religious tolerance in a new state 
 meanwhile back in babylon  
 things had not been going well  
 after alexander the other empires babylon declines  falls into ruins and all the traces of the great babylonian empire are lost
 until
  museum exhibition digging in babylon 
 and it enters now another story  
 it enters that great debate in the middle of the  19th century are the scriptures reliable can we trust them 
 we only knew about the return of the jews and the decree of cyrus from the hebrew scriptures no other evidence
  this appeared 
 and great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution by geology here was evidence that the scriptures 
  were historically true it 's a great 19th century moment  
  but the interpretation
 was rather more complicated 
 because the cylinder account and the hebrew bible account differ in one key respect 
 the babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of bablyon marduk 
 and not surprisingly they tell you that all this was done by marduk marduk we hold called cyrus by his name marduk takes
 cyrus by the hand calls him to shepherd his people
 and gives him the rule of babylon  
 marduk tells cyrus that he will do these great generous things of setting the people free 
 and this is why we should all be grateful to and worship marduk 
 the hebrew writers in the old testament you will not be surprised to learn take a rather different view of this 
 for them of course it can 't possibly by marduk that made all this happen it can only be
  be jehovah  and so in isaiah we have the wonderful texts
 giving all the credit of this not to marduk but to the lord god of israel
 the lord god of israel who also called cyrus by name also takes cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his
  it 's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event two different religious takeovers of a political fact 
 god we know is usually on the side of the big battalions  the question is which god was it  
 and the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion and it 's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah
  isaiah  and yet  jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by marduk  
 and there 's a slight sense that isaiah knows this because he says
 this is god speaking of course i have called thee by thy name
 though thou hast not known me i think it 's recognized that cyrus doesn 't realize that he 's acting under orders from
  jehovah
  and equally he 'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from marduk  because interestingly of course  cyrus is a good iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts
  real politics of the contemporary world
 the year of the balfour declaration 
 the year when the new imperial power in the middle east britain  
 decides that it will declare a jewish national home  it will allow the jews to return  
 and the response to this by the jewish population in eastern
  and across eastern europe jews display pictures of cyrus and of george v side by side
 the two great rulers who have allowed the return to jerusalem and the cyrus cylinder comes back into public view
 and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen
 after the war is over in one thousand nine hundred and eighteen is part of a divine plan you all know what happened
  happened the
 state of israel is setup  and fifty years later in the late 60s it 's clear that britain 's role as the imperial power is over 
 and another story of the cylinder begins the region the u k and the u s decide has to be kept safe from communism  
 and the superpower that will be created to do this would be iran the shah  
 and so the shah invents an
  iranian history or a return to iranian history that puts him in the center of a great tradition
 and produces coins showing himself
 with the cyrus cylinder 
 when he has his great celebrations in persepolis  
 he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the british museum goes to tehran and is part of those great celebrations of the pahlavi dynasty 
  cylinder guarantor of the shah  
 ten years later  another story iranian revolution one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine islamic revolution  no more cyrus  we 're not interested in that history we 're interested in islamic iran
 until iraq the new superpower that we 've all decided should be in the region  attacks
  it becomes critical for the iranians to remember their great past their great past when they fought iraq and won 
 it becomes critical to find a symbol
 that will pull together all iranians muslims and non muslims christians zoroastrians jews living in iran people who are devout  not
  and the obvious emblem is cyrus  
 so when the british museum and tehran national musuem cooperate and work together as we 've been doing 
 the iranians ask for one thing only as a loan it 's
 the only object they want they want to borrow the cyrus cylinder and last year the cyrus cylinder went to
 tehran
 for the second time  it 's shown being presented here put into its case by the director of the national
  museum of tehran one of the many women in iran in very senior positions  mrs ardakani 
 it was a huge event  this is the other side of that same picture  
 it 's seen in tehran by between one and two million people
 in the space of a few months  this is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the west and it 's the subject of a huge debate
 about what this cylinder means what cyrus means but above all cyrus as articulated through this cylinder
 cyrus as the defender of the homeland the champion of course of iranian identity and of of the iranian peoples  
 tolerant of all faiths and in the current iran  zoroastrians and christians have guaranteed
  very proud of 
 to see this object in tehran  thousands of jews living in iran came to tehran to see it 
 it became a great emblem a great subject of debate about what iran is at home and abroad 
 is iran still to be the defender of the oppressed will iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated
  and it was all put together in a great pageant
 launching the return  
 here you see this out sized cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of iran it
 was a narrative presented by
 the president himself and
 for me to take this object to iran to be allowed
  to take this object to iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate
 led at the highest levels about what iran is what different irans there are and how the different histories of iran might shape the world today  
 it 's a debate that 's still continuing  
 and it will continue to rumble because this object is
  one of the great declarations of a human aspiration 
 it stands with the american constitution it certainly says far more about real freedoms than magna carta  
 it is a document that can mean so many things for iran and for the region 
 a replica of this is at the united nations in new york this autumn it will be
  present when the great debates about the future of the middle east take place  
 and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures 
 it will appear  certainly in many more middle eastern stories and what story of the middle east what story of the world do you want to see
 reflecting what is said what is expressed in
  cylinder the right of peoples to live together in the same state worshiping differently freely
 a middle east a world in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate 
 in the world of the middle east at the moment  the debates are as you know  shrill 
 but i think it 's possible that the most powerful
 and the wisest voice of all
  them may well be the voice of this mute thing the cyrus cylinder
