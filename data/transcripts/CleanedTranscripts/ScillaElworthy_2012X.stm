  half a century of trying to help prevent wars there 's one question
 that never leaves me how do we deal with extreme violence without using
  when you 're faced with brutality whether it 's a child facing a bully on a playground or domestic violence
 or on the streets of syria today facing tanks and shrapnel 
 what 's the most effective thing to do fight back give in 
 use more force this
  how do i deal with a bully
 without becoming a thug in return has been with me ever since i was a child  i remember
 i was about thirteen  glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents ' living room
 as soviet tanks
 rolled into budapest  and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down
  and i rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase  and my mother came up and said what on earth are you doing and i said i 'm going to budapest 
 and she said what on earth for and i said kids are getting killed there there 's something terrible happening and she said don 't be so silly 
 and i started to cry  
 and she got it she said okay i see it 's serious
 much too young to help you need training i 'll help you but just unpack your suitcase 
 and so i got some training and went and worked in africa during most of my 20s 
 but i realized that what i really needed to know i couldn 't get from training courses  
 i wanted to understand how violence how oppression
 works and what i 've discovered since
 is this 
 bullies use violence in three ways they use political violence
 to intimidate physical violence to terrorize
 and mental or emotional violence
  to undermine 
 and only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence  
 nelson mandela
 went to jail believing in violence and twenty seven years later
 he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills
  the incredible skills that they needed
 to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy  
 and they did it in a total devotion to non violence 
 they realized
 that
 using force against
  does work 
 over time i 've collected about a half dozen methods that do work of course there are many more that do work and that are effective 
 and the first is that the change that has to take place has to take
 place here inside me it 's my
  my attitude to oppression that i 've got control over and that i can do something about and what i need to develop is 
 to do that that means i need to know how i tick  when i collapse  where my
 formidable points are where my weaker points are when do i give
  not the only one it 's one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power
  and my heroine here like satish 's is aung san suu kyi in burma 
 she was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of rangoon
  came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns  and she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers
 were more scared than the student protesters behind her but she told the students to sit down  and she walked
 forward with such calm and such clarity
 and such total lack of fear
 that she could walk right up to the first gun put her hand on it
 and lower it 
 and no one got killed
 so that 's what the mastery of fear can do not only faced with
  machine guns but if you if you meet a knife fight in the street but we have to practice  so what about our fear  
 i have a little mantra 
 my fear
 grows fat on the energy i feed it and if it grows very big it probably happens so
  we all know the three o 'clock in the morning syndrome  when something you 've been worrying about wakes you up i see a lot of people
 and
 for an hour you toss and turn it gets worse and worse and by four o 'clock
 you 're pinned to the pillow
 by a monster this big the only thing to do is to get up make a cup of tea and sit down
  the fear like a child beside you  
 you 're the adult the fear is the child and you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants what it needs 
 how can this be
 made
 better how can the child feel stronger  and you make a plan
  now we 're going back to sleep half past seven we 're getting up and that 's what we 're going to do 
 i had one of these three  a m episodes on sunday
 paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you 
 so i did the thing i got up made the cup of tea  sat down with it did it all and i 'm here
  that 's fear what about anger wherever there is
 injustice there 's anger  
 but anger is like gasoline  and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match you 've got an inferno  
 but
 anger as an engine in an engine is powerful if we can put our anger inside
  inside an engine it can drive us forward it can get us through the dreadful moments
 and it can give us real inner power  and i learned this
 in my work with nuclear weapon policy makers because at the beginning i was so outraged at the dangers they were
  exposing us to
 that i just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong  totally ineffective in order to develop
 a dialogue for change we have to deal with our anger it 's okay to be angry with
 the the thing the nuclear weapons in this case but it is hopeless to be angry with the
  they are human beings just like us and they 're doing what they think is best and that 's the basis on which we have to talk with them  
 so that 's the third one anger  and it brings me to the crux
 of what 's going on or what i perceive as going on in the world today which is that
 last century was top down power it was still governments telling people what to do 
 this century there 's a shift it
 's bottom up or grassroots power it 's like mushrooms coming through concrete  
 it 's people joining up with people as bundy just said miles away
 to
 bring about change  and
 peace direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict know what to do
  they know best what to do so peace direct gets behind them to do that and the kind of thing they 're doing is
 demobilizing militias  rebuilding economies  resettling refugees
  even liberating child
  they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this  and
 what they 've realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only
 less humane but it 's less effective than using methods that connect people with people that rebuild
 and i think that the u s military is finally beginning to get this 
 up to now their 
 policy
 has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost  and if civilians get in the way that 's written as
 and this is so infuriating and
 humiliating for the population of afghanistan 
 that it makes the recruitment for al qaeda very easy  when people are so disgusted by for example the burning of the koran 
 so the training of the troops has to change  and i think
  signs that it is beginning to change the british military have always been much better at this but there is
 one magnificent example for them to take their cue from and that 's a brilliant
 u s lieutenant colonel called chris hughes  and he was leading his men
 down the streets of najaf
 in iraq actually
 and suddenly people were
 pouring out of the houses on either side of the road screaming  yelling  furiously angry and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified  
 didn 't know what was going on couldn 't speak arabic  
 and chris hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his
  and these
 huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armor  wobbled to the ground  
 and complete silence fell 
 and after about two minutes everybody
 moved aside and went home now
 that to me is
  wisdom in action in the moment that 's what he did 
 and it 's happening
 everywhere now you don 't believe me have you asked yourselves
 why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last thirty years
  dictatorships in czechoslovakia  east germany
  and this hasn 't just happened 
 a lot of it
 is due to a book written by an 80 year old man in boston gene sharp 
 he wrote a book called from dictatorship to democracy
  the world and it 's being used by young people and older people everywhere
 because it works and it 's effective  
 so this is what gives me hope not just hope this is what makes me feel very positive right now
  beings are getting it we 're
 getting practical  
 doable methodologies to answer my question how do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug 
 we 're using the kind of skills that i 've outlined
  recognizing and working with our fear using anger as a fuel  
 cooperating with others  banding together with others  courage 
 and most importantly  commitment
 to active
 have to believe in it i see evidence everywhere of how it works and
 i see that we  ordinary people can do what aung san suu kyi and ghandi
 and mandela did we can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known
 and we can organize to overcome oppression
 by opening our hearts as well as
 strengthening this incredible resolve  and 
  this open heartedness is exactly what i 've experienced in the entire organization of this gathering since i got here yesterday  thank you
