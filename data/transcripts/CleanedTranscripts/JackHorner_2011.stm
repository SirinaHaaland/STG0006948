  when i was growing up in montana 
 i had two dreams  i wanted to be a paleontologist a dinosaur paleontologist  and i wanted to have a pet
  and so
 that 's what i 've been striving for all of my life  
 i was very fortunate early in my career  
 i was fortunate in finding things  i wasn 't very good at reading things in fact i don 't read much of anything 
 i am extremely dyslexic  and so reading is the hardest thing i do 
 but instead i go out and i find things then i just pick things up
  i basically
 practice
 for finding money on the street and i wander about the hills and i have found a few things and
 i have been fortunate enough to find things like
 the first eggs in the western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests the first dinosaur embryos and
  massive accumulations of bones  and
 it happened to be at a time when
 people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren 't the big  
 stupid green reptiles that people had thought for so many years people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special  
 and so at that time i was able to make some
  interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues we were able to actually say that dinosaurs based on the evidence we had that dinosaurs
 built nests and lived in colonies
 and cared for their young  brought food to their babies and traveled in
  it was pretty interesting stuff  i have gone on to find more things and
 and discover that that dinosaurs really were very social we have found
 a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults the appearance of them would have been different
 which it is in all social animals in social groups of animals the juveniles always look different than the adults the adults can recognize the juveniles
  the juveniles can recognize the adults  and so
 we 're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like and they didn 't just all chase jeeps around 
 but
 it is that social thing that that i guess attracted
 michael crichton and in his book he talked about the social animals and then steven spielberg
  of course  depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures  the theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so
 we come to that part of jurassic park michael crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life 
 you all know the story right
  i assume everyone here has seen jurassic park if you want to make a dinosaur you go out you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap
 otherwise known as amber
 that has some blood sucking insects in it
  good ones 
 and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some dna  because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days
 sucked dinosaur dna out and you take your
  dna back to the laboratory and you clone it and i guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg or something like that and then
 you wait and lo and behold out pops
 a little baby dinosaur  and everybody 's happy about that 
 and they 're happy over and over again they keep doing it they just keep making these things and
  and then then then and
 then then
 the dinosaurs being social 
 act out their socialness  and they get together  and they conspire 
 and of course that 's what makes steven spielberg 's movie
 conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around so i assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber
 and it had an insect in it and you drilled into it and you
 got something out of that insect and you cloned it  and you did it over and over and over again 
 you 'd have a room full of mosquitos 
 applause and probably a whole bunch of trees as
  if you want dinosaur dna i say
 go to the dinosaur  
 so that 's what we 've done back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three when the movie came out we actually had a grant from the national science foundation
 to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur  
 and we chose the dinosaur on the left a tyrannosaurus rex  which was a very nice specimen  and one of my former doctoral students
  mary schweitzer actually had the background to do this sort of thing and so
 she looked into the bone of this  t rex one of the thigh bones  and she actually found some very interesting structures in there 
 they found these red 
  objects  and they looked for all the world like red blood cells  and they 're in what appear to be the
 blood channels that go through the bone  and so
 she thought well what the heck so she
 sampled some material out of it  now it wasn 't dna she didn 't find dna  but she did find
 heme  which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin
  we tried and tried and we couldn 't really get anything else out of it so a few years went by and then we started the hell creek project and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get
 as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully
 find some dinosaurs that had more material in them and out in eastern montana
 there 's a lot of space a lot of badlands and not very many people and so
 you can go out there and find a lot of stuff and we did find a lot of stuff we found a lot of
 tyrannosaurs  but we found one special tyrannosaur  and we called it b rex and b rex was found
 under a thousand cubic yards of rock it wasn 't a very complete t rex  and it wasn 't a very big t rex  
 but it was a very special b rex and i and my colleagues cut into it and
  we were able to determine by looking at lines of arrested growth some lines in it that b rex had died at the age of sixteen  
 we don 't really know how long dinosaurs lived because we haven 't found the oldest one yet
  but this one died at the age of sixteen  
 we gave samples to mary schweitzer and she was actually able to determine that b rex was a female
 based on medullary tissue found on the
  inside of the bone  medullary tissue is the calcium build up 
 the calcium storage basically when an animal is pregnant  when a bird is pregnant  
 so here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs  but mary went further she took the bone and she dumped it into acid  now
 we all know that bones are fossilized  and so if you dump it into acid there shouldn 't be anything left  
 but there was something left  there were blood vessels left  there were flexible clear blood vessels  
 and so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur it was extraordinary  
 but she also found osteocytes which are the cells that laid down the bones and try and try we could not find dna
  but she did find evidence of proteins  but we thought maybe well we thought maybe that
 the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast  
 and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 wheeler trailer and actually took the laboratory to the field
 where we could get better samples and we did we got
  better material 
 the cells looked better the vessels looked better 
 found the protein collagen i mean it was wonderful stuff  but it 's not dinosaur dna  
 so
 we have discovered that dinosaur dna and all dna just breaks down too
  going to be able to do what they did in jurassic park we 're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on
 a dinosaur  but
 birds are dinosaurs birds are living dinosaurs  we actually classify them
 as dinosaurs we now call them
  dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs so the non avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct  
 avian dinosaurs are our modern birds so we don 't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them
  you can call it a dinosaur  but look at the velociraptor the velociraptor is cool the chicken is not 
 so this is our problem as you can imagine  the chicken is a dinosaur i mean it really
  you can 't argue with it because we 're the classifiers and we 've classified it that way 
 but the sixth graders demand it fix the chicken 
 laughter so that 's what i 'm here to tell you about how we are going to fix a chicken
  so we have a number of of ways that we actually can
  fix the chicken  because evolution works  we actually have some evolutionary tools we
 'll call them biological modification tools  we have selection 
 and we know selection works  we started out with a  wolf like creature and we ended up with a maltese
  definitely genetic modification 
 or any of the other funny looking little dogs
  we also have transgenesis transgenesis is really cool too that 's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one  that 's how people make glofish 
 you take a glow gene out of
  and you stick it in a zebrafish and puff they glow and that 's pretty cool  and they obviously make a lot of money off of them 
 and now they 're making  glow rabbits and glow all sorts of things i guess we could make a glow chicken 
 but i don 't think that 'll satisfy the sixth graders either
  but there 's another thing there 's what we call atavism activation and atavism activation is basically
 an atavism is an ancestral characteristic 
 you heard that occasionally children are born with tails  
 and it 's because it 's an ancestral characteristic  
 and so there are a number of
  can happen snakes are occasionally born with legs  and here 's an example this is a chicken
 with teeth a fellow by the name of matthew harris at the university of wisconsin in madison
 actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene
 for teeth  and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on
 and produce teeth in
  's a good characteristic  we can save that one we know we can use that we can make a chicken with teeth
 that 's getting closer  that 's better than a glowing chicken 
 a friend of mine  a colleague of mine dr hans larsson at mcgill university is actually looking at atavisms  and he 's looking at them by looking at the embryo
  genesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop and he 's interested in how birds actually lost their tail  he 's also interested in the transformation 
 of the arm the hand to the wing  he 's looking for those genes as well  and i said 
 and so he agreed and so
 that 's what we 're looking into 
 if you look at dinosaur hands a
 velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it  archaeopteryx which is a bird  a primitive bird still has that very primitive hand 
 but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else another bird has kind of a weird looking
  the hand is a wing  but the cool thing is is that if you look in the embryo as the embryo is developing
 the hand actually
 looks
 pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand it has the three fingers the three digits  but a gene turns on that actually fuses those together  
 and so what we 're looking for is that gene we want to stop that gene from turning on fusing those hands together  so we can get a chicken that hatches out
 with a three fingered hand  like the archaeopteryx and the same goes for the tails  birds have basically
 rudimentary tails  and so
 we know that
 in embryo  as the animal is developing it actually has
 a relatively long tail  but a gene turns on and resorbs the
  tail  gets rid of it  so that 's the other gene we 're looking for we want to stop that tail from resorbing so
 what we 're trying to do really is
 take our chicken  modify it
 and make the chickenosaurus
  just the very basics  so that really is what we 're doing  and people always say why do that why make this thing what good is it 
 well that 's a good question 
 actually i think it 's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things and
 quite frankly i think if
  sanders was to be careful how he worded it he could actually advertise an extra piece 
 anyway
 when our dino chicken hatches 
 it will be obviously the poster child or what you might call a poster chick for technology  entertainment and design  thank you
