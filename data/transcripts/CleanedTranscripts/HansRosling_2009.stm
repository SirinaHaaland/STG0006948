  these gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was
  estimate that it was what we are showing here is is
 on this axis here  i 'm showing percent of infected adults  and
 on this axis  i 'm showing dollars per person in income 
 and the size of these bubbles the size of the bubbles here that shows how many are infected in each country and the color is the continent now you can see
  united states in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three had a very low percentage infected but due to the big population still a sizable bubble there were quite many people infected in 
  the united states  and up there you see uganda they had almost five percent infected
  happened now you have understood the graph
 and now in the next sixty seconds we will play the hiv epidemic in the world  but first  i have a
 new invention here 
  the fast rise in uganda and zimbabwe they went upwards like this in asia the first country to be heavily infected was thailand they reached one to two percent then uganda started to turn back
 whereas zimbabwe skyrocketed  and some years later south africa had a terrible rise of hiv frequency  look  india got many infected but had a low level
  and almost the same happens here  see uganda coming down zimbabwe coming down  russia went to one percent in the last
 two to three years  we have reached a steady state of hiv epidemic in the world
 twenty five years it took  but steady state doesn 't mean that things are getting better  it 's just that they have stopped getting worse  and it has
 the steady state is more or less one percent of the adult world population is hiv infected it means thirty to forty million people the whole of california every person that 's more or less what we have today in the world  
 now let me make a
  a fast replay of botswana botswana upper middle income country in southern africa  democratic government 
 good economy and this is what happened there they started low they skyrocketed  they peaked up there in two thousand and three and now they are down but they are falling only slowly
  because in botswana with good economy and governance they can manage to treat people  
 and if people who are infected are treated they don 't die of aids these percentages won 't come down because people can survive ten to twenty years  
 so there 's some problem with these metrics now  
 but the poorer countries in africa the low income countries down here there
 the rates fall faster of the percentage infected because people still die in spite of
  pepfar the generous pepfar  
 all people are not reached by treatment and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries only sixty percent are left on treatment after two years 
 it 's not realistic with lifelong treatment for everyone in the poorest countries  but it 's very good that what is done is being done 
 but focus
  is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it drugs is too costly had we had the vaccine or when we will get the vaccine that 's something more effective but the drugs 
  are very costly for the poor not the drug in itself  but the treatment and the care which is needed around it 
  very high in africa  i would say hiv is very different in africa  
 you 'll find the highest hiv rate in the world  in african countries and yet you 'll find senegal down here the same rate as united states  
 and you 'll find madagascar  and you 'll find a lot of african countries about as low as the rest of
  it 's this terrible simplification that there 's one africa africa and things go on in one way in africa we have to stop that it 's not respectful  and it 's not very clever to think that way 
 i had the fortune to live and work for a time in the united states  i found out that salt lake city and san francisco were different 
 and so it is in africa it 's a lot of difference
  so why is it so high is it war  no it 's not look here war torn congo is down there two three four percent  and this is peaceful zambia neighboring country 
 fifteen percent and there 's good studies of the refugees coming out of congo they have two three percent infected and peaceful zambia much higher 
 for the high levels in africa so is it poverty  well if you look at the macro level it seems more money more hiv  
 but that 's very simplistic so let 's go down and look at tanzania  
 i will split tanzania in five income groups from the highest income to the lowest income  and here we go  the
 ones with the highest income the better off i wouldn 't say rich they have higher hiv the difference goes from eleven percent down to four percent  and it is even bigger among women 
 there 's a lot of things that we thought that now good research done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers show that that 's not the case  
 so this is the difference within tanzania and i can 't avoid showing kenya look
  split kenya in its provinces here it goes 
 see the difference within one african country it goes from very low level to very high level  and most of the provinces in kenya is quite modest 
 so what is it then  
 why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries well it is more common with multiple partners there is less
  older men tend to have sex with younger women we see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries  but where are they situated  i will swap the bubbles to a map 
 look  the highly infected are four percent of all population and they hold fifty percent of the hiv infected 
 hiv exists all over the world  look you have bubbles all over the world here  brazil has many
 hiv infected arab countries not so much but iran is quite high they have heroin addiction and also prostitution in iran 
 india has many because they are many southeast asia  and so on but there is one part of africa and the difficult thing is at the same time not to make a uniform 
 statement about africa not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this on one hand on the other
  hand  try to say that this is not the case  because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now  unaids have done good data available  finally about the spread of hiv  
 it could be concurrency  it could be some virus types it could be that that there is other
 things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency
  after all if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in one thousand 
 don 't jump to conclusions now on how to behave tonight and so on 
 but and if you are in an unfavorable situation more
 sexually transmitted diseases it can be one in one hundred but what we think is that it could be concurrency and what is concurrency
 in sweden we have no concurrency  we have serial monogamy  vodka new year 's eve new partner for the spring vodka midsummer 's eve new partner for the fall vodka and it goes on 
  like this you know and you collect a big number of exes  and we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic
  three to six weeks after infection and therefore having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for hiv than others probably it 's a combination of this  and what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this 
 you can get this chart free we have uploaded unaids data on the gapminder site  and we hope that when we act on global problems in the future we will not only have the heart we will not only have the money
  we will also use the brain  thank you very much
