  all over the world  eminent evolutionists
  anxious to celebrate this and what they 're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect
 of darwin and his life and how he changed our thinking 
 i say almost every aspect because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on  and they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something
  so i 'm going to talk about it it 's the question of why are we so different from the chimpanzees 
 we get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related hardly any genes of difference very very closely related 
 and yet  when you look at the phenotypes there 's a chimp there 's a man they 're
 astoundingly different
  measurable physical differences they that one is hairy and walking on four legs  that one is a naked biped why  
 i mean 
 laughter if i 'm a good darwinist i 've got to believe
 there 's a reason for that if we changed so much
  something must have happened  what happened 
 now fifty years ago that was a laughably simple question  everybody knew the answer they knew what happened  
 the ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees 
 our ancestors went out onto the plain  
 that explained everything we had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass or to chase after animals or to free our hands for weapons
  and we got so overheated in the chase
 that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away  
 everybody knew that  for generations  but then in the ' 90s something began to unravel  
 the paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna
 that lived in the same time
 and place as the hominids  
 and they weren 't savanna species  
 and they looked at the herbivores  and they weren 't savanna herbivores  and then they were so clever they found a way to analyze fossilized pollen 
 shock horror  
 the fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation some of it even came from lianas those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle
 so we 're left with a situation where
 we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees  
 before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence 
 this is not something i 've made up it 's not a minority theory everybody agrees with it  professor tobias came
  over from south africa
 and spoke to university college london he said everything i 've been telling you for the last twenty years  forget about it  it was wrong  
 we 've got to go back to square one and start again 
 it made him very unpopular they didn 't want to go back to square one  
  a terrible thing to happen you 've got this beautiful paradigm 
 you 've believed it through generations nobody has questioned it  you 've been constructing fanciful things on top of it  relying on it to be as solid as a rock  and now it 's whipped away from under you 
 what do you do 
 what does a scientist do in that case well we know the answer because
 thomas
  he said what scientists do when a paradigm fails
 is guess what they carry on as if nothing had happened 
 if they haven 't got a paradigm they can 't ask the question so they say yes it 's wrong but
  only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions 
 so that is what they have done now that 's why you don 't hear them talking about it it 's yesterday 's question  
 some of them have even elevated it into a principle it 's what we ought to be doing  aaron filler from harvard said isn
  time we stopped talking about selective pressures i mean  why don 't we talk about well there 's chromosomes and there 's genes and we just record what we see 
 charles darwin must be spinning in his grave 
 he knew all about that kind of science and he called it hypothesis free science  and he despised it from the bottom of his heart  
 and
 if you 're going to say i 'm going to stop talking about selective pressures you can take the origin of species and throw it out of
  window for it 's about nothing else but selective pressures  
 and the irony of it is that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we didn 't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up 
 there was one waiting in the wings  it had been waiting there since one thousand nine hundred and sixty
 when alister hardy a marine biologist said 
  our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time 
 he kept it to himself for thirty years but then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose all his colleagues said this is outrageous you 've
 exposed us to public ridicule  you must never do that again 
 and at that time it became set in stone the aquatic theory
 should be dumped
 with the ufos and the
  yetis  as part of the lunatic fringe of science  well i don 't think that i think that hardy had a lot going for him i 'd like to talk about just
 a handful of what have been called the
 hallmarks of mankind the things that made us different from everybody else and all our relatives let 's look at our naked skin
  it 's obvious that most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair mammals without body hair 
 are aquatic ones like the dugong  the walrus  the dolphin  the hippopotamus the manatee  and a couple of
 like the babirusa  and you 're tempted to think well
  could that be
 why we are naked i suggested it and people said no no no i mean look at the elephant you 've forgotten all about the elephant haven 't you 
 so back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two i said well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor 
 peals of merry laughter that crazy woman she 's off again she 'll say anything won 't she but by now  everybody agrees that the elephant
  round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors the last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros last year in florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said seems to have spent most of its time in the water 
 so this is a
 close connection between nakedness and water as an absolute connection it only works one way
  you can 't say all aquatic animals
 are naked because look at the sea otter but you can say
 that every
 animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water in its own lifetime or the lifetime of its ancestors  i think this is significant the only exception
 is the naked somalian mole rat which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground and take bipedality  here you can
 anybody to compare it with
  because we
 're the only animal that walks upright on two legs  but you can say this 
 all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs if they want to for a short time there is only one circumstance in which they always all of them walk on two legs and that is when they are wading through water 
 do you think that 's significant
  david attenborough thinks it 's significant  as the possible beginning of our bipedalism 
 look at the fat layer we have got under our skin a layer of fat all over 
 nothing in the least like that in any other primate  
 why should it be there  well they do know that if you look at other aquatic
  land mammals is deposited inside the body wall around the kidneys and the
 intestines and so on has started to migrate to the outside  and spread out in a layer
 inside the skin in the whale it 's complete no fat inside at all all in blubber outside 
 we cannot avoid the suspicion that in
  case it 's started to happen we have got skin lined with this layer it 's the only possible explanation of why
 humans if they 're very unlucky 
 can become grossly obese in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate  physically impossible something very odd
 matter of factly never explained 
 the question of why we can speak  we can speak  and the
 nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that purely has to do with its
 conscious control of its breath you can 't even train
 a gorilla to say ah on request the only
 creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds  it was an absolute precondition
 for our being able to speak  and then again  there is the fact
 that we are streamlined trying to imagine a diver diving into water hardly makes a splash  try to imagine a gorilla
 performing the same
 maneuver  and you can see that compared with gorilla we are halfway to being shaped like a fish i am trying to suggest that for
  aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe and it is not lunatic fringe and the ironic thing about it is that
 they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own which they 've all agreed on and they love there is nothing there they are staving off the
  how do they react when i say these things 
 one very common reaction i 've heard about twenty times is 
 but it was investigated  they conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning when hardy
  years i 've been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind and i 've concluded
 that that 's one of the urban myths it 's never been done i ask people sometimes 
  the aquatic theory  everybody likes the aquatic theory of course they don 't believe it  but they like
 everybody i talk to says it 's rubbish  and they can 't all be wrong can they 
 the answer to that  loud and clear is yes they can all be wrong history is strewn with the cases when they 've all got it wrong 
 and if you 've got a scientific problem like
 solve it by holding a head count and saying more of us say yes than say no 
 apart from that some of the heads count more than others
  some of them have come over  there was professor tobias he 's come over  daniel dennett  he 's come over  sir david attenborough 
  now we 've got to look to the future  ultimately one of three things is going to happen  
 either they will go on for the next forty years fifty years sixty years yeah well we don 't talk about that let 's talk about
  that would be very sad  the second thing that could happen
 is that some young genius will arrive  and say i 've found it  it was not the savanna  it was not the water  it was this 
 no sign of that happening either  i don 't think there is a third option so the third thing that might happen
 is a very beautiful thing if you look back at the early years of the last century
  lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in mendel and the believers in darwin it ended with a new synthesis 
 darwin 's ideas and mendel 's ideas blending together  
 and i think the same thing will happen here you 'll get a new synthesis 
 hardy 's ideas and darwin 's ideas will be blended together
  and we can move forward from there  and really get somewhere  that would be a beautiful thing 
 it would be very nice for me if it happened soon 
  because i 'm older now than george burns was when he
  that belongs with the ufos and the yetis and it 's not easy to change their minds  
 the professional journals
 won 't touch it with a barge pole  
 the textbooks don 't mention it the syllabus doesn 't mention even the fact that we 're naked  let alone look for a reason to it 
 horizon which takes its cue from the academics won 't touch it with a barge pole
 so we never hear the case put for it except
 in jocular references to people on the lunatic fringe  i don 't know quite
 where this diktat comes from somebody up there is issuing
 the
  thou shalt not believe
 in the aquatic theory  
 and if you hope to make progress in this profession  and you do believe it you 'd better keep it to yourself  because it will get in your way 
 so i get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are
 morphing into a kind of priesthood  
 but you know 
 that makes me feel good  because richard dawkins has told
  us how to treat a priesthood 
 he says firstly  you 've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence
 it 's been trained to receive right i 'll go ahead with that and secondly  he says you must never be afraid to rock the boat
