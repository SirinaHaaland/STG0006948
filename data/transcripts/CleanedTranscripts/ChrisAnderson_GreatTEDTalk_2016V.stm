  some people think that there 's a ted talk formula give a talk on a round red rug share a childhood story divulge a personal secret 
 end with an inspiring call to action 
 that 's not how to think of a ted talk in fact if you overuse those devices you 're just going to come across as
  clichd or emotionally manipulative but there is one thing that all great ted talks have in common  and i would like to share that thing with you 
 because over the past twelve years  i 've had a ringside seat listening to many hundreds of amazing ted speakers like these
  i 've helped them prepare their talks for prime time and learned directly
 directly from them their secrets of what makes for a great talk and even though these speakers and their topics all seem completely different they actually do have one key common ingredient  
 and it 's this 
 your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listeners ' minds an extraordinary gift
 a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea 
  let me show you what i mean here 's haley she is about to give a ted talk and frankly  she 's terrified presenter haley van dyck over
 the course of eighteen minutes one thousand two hundred people many of
 whom have never seen each other before are finding that their brains are starting to sync with haley 's brain and with each other
  they 're literally beginning to exhibit the same
 i don 't just mean they 're feeling the same emotions there 's something even more startling happening  let 's take a look inside haley 's brain for a moment 
 there are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle but look here right here
 a few million of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single
  and incredibly this exact pattern is being recreated in real time inside the minds of everyone listening 
 that 's right 
 in just a few minutes a pattern involving millions of neurons is being teleported into one thousand two hundred minds just by people listening to a voice and watching a face
 but wait
 what is an idea anyway well you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and navigate the world ideas come in
  all shapes and sizes from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic
 here are just a few examples shared from the ted stage
  sir ken robinson creativity is key to our kids ' future sir ken robinson my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy  
 and we should treat it with the same status
  growing all around us  it 's strong  it 's elegant 
 it 's earthquake resistant ca chimamanda adichie people are more than a single identity chimamanda adichie 
 the single story creates stereotypes  and the problem
 with stereotypes is not that they are untrue  but that they are incomplete ca your mind is teeming with ideas and not just randomly
 collectively they form an amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview it 's your brain 's operating system it 's how you navigate the world  
 and it is built up out of millions of individual ideas 
 so for example  if one little component of your worldview is the idea that kittens are adorable  then when you see this you
 'll react like this  but if another component of
  your worldview is the idea that leopards are dangerous  then when you see this you 'll react a little bit differently  
 so it 's pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial  
 you need them to be as reliable as possible a guide to the scary but wonderful real world out there 
  different people 's worldviews can be dramatically different for example how does your worldview react when you see this image dalia mogahed 
 what do you think when you look at me 
 a woman of faith
 if communicated properly  they 're capable of changing forever how someone thinks about the world 
 and shaping their actions both now and well into the future 
 ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture  so if you accept that your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea inside the minds of your audience 
 here are four guidelines for how you should go about that task
  one limit your talk to just one major idea ideas are complex things  you need to slash back your content so that you can focus
 on the single idea you 're most passionate about 
 and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly  you have to give context share examples make it vivid so pick
  running through your entire talk  so that everything you say links back to it in some way two give your listeners a reason to care 
 before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience  you have to get their permission to welcome you in and the main tool to achieve that 
 curiosity  
 stir your audience 's curiosity  use
  provocative questions to identify why something doesn 't make sense and needs explaining 
 if you can reveal a disconnection in someone 's worldview they 'll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap  
 and once you 've sparked that desire it will be so much easier to start building your idea  
 three build your idea  piece by piece out of concepts that your
  you use the power of language to weave together concepts that already exist in your listeners ' minds
 but not your language their language  you start where they are the speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with are completely unfamiliar to their audiences 
 now  metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together  
 for example when jennifer kahn wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called crispr 
 she said it 's as if for the first time you had a word processor to edit dna 
 crispr allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily 
 now a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment as it snaps into place in our minds  it 's important therefore
 to test your talk on trusted friends and find out which parts they get confused by
