  i 've been living in rural east africa for about ten years  and i want to share a field perspective with you on global poverty  
 i believe that the greatest failure of the human race is the fact that we 've left more than one billion of our members
  these often seem like gigantic insurmountable problems  too big to solve  
 but as a field practitioner  i believe these are actually very solvable problems if we just take the right strategies  
 archimedes was an ancient greek thinker  and he taught us that if we lean on the right levers  we can move the world  in the fight against extreme
  i believe there are three powerful levers that we can lean on this talk is all about those levers  and why they make poverty a winnable fight in our lifetimes 
 what is extreme poverty  
 when i first moved to rural east africa  i stayed overnight with a farm family 
 they were wonderful people they invited me into their home we sang songs together and ate a simple dinner they gave me a blanket to sleep on the floor 
 in the morning however  there was nothing to eat  and then at lunchtime i watched with an
  increasingly sick feeling
 as the eldest girl in the family cooked porridge as a substitute for lunch for that meal every child drank one cup to survive  
 and i cannot tell you how ashamed i felt when they handed one of those cups to me  and i knew i had to accept their hospitality 
 children need food not only to survive but also to grow physically and mentally every day they fail to eat they lose
  a little bit of their future 
 amongst the extreme poor one in three children are permanently stunted from a lifetime of not eating enough 
 when that 's combined with poor access to health care one in ten extremely poor children die before they reach age five  
 and only one quarter of children complete high school because they lack
  and extreme poverty curb human potential in every possible way  
 we see ourselves as a thinking feeling and moral human race  but until we solve these problems for all of our members we fail that standard 
 because every person on this planet matters  this child matters  these children matter 
  we see things like this  and we 're upset by them but they seem like such big problems we don 't know how to take effective action  
 but remember our friend archimedes 
 global poverty has powerful levers it 's a problem like any other 
 i live and work in the field and as a practitioner  i believe these are very solvable problems  so for the next ten minutes  let 's not be sad about the state of the world  
 let 's engage our brains  let 's engage our collective
  passion for problem solving and figure out what those levers are 
 lever number one most of the world 's poor are farmers  
 think about how extraordinary this is  if this picture represents the world 's poor then more than half engage in farming as a major source of income  
 this gets me really excited all of these people one
  think how powerful this is when farmers become more productive  then more than half the world 's poor earn more money and climb out of poverty  and it gets better 
 the product of farming is of course food  so when farmers become more productive  
 they earn more food 
 and they don 't just help themselves  but they help to feed healthy communities and thriving economies  and when farmers become more productive  they reduce environmental pressure 
  we only have two ways we can feed the world we can either make our existing farmland a lot more productive  or we can clear cut forest and savannah to make more farmland which would be environmentally disastrous 
 farmers are basically a really important leverage point  
 when farmers become more productive  they earn more income  they climb out of poverty  they feed their communities and they reduce environmental land pressure farmers stand at the center of the world  
 and not a farmer
  like this one but rather this lady most of the farmers i know are actually women  
 look at the strength and the will radiating from this woman she is physically strong mentally tough and she will do whatever it takes to earn a better life for her children if we 're going to put the future of humanity in one person 's hands then
 i 'm really glad it 's her
  just one problem many smallholder farmers lack access to basic tools and knowledge  
 currently  they take a little bit of saved food grain from the prior year  they plant it in the ground and they till it with a manual hand hoe 
 these are tools and techniques that date to the bronze age and it 's why many farmers are still very poor 
  lever number two humanity actually solved the problem of agricultural poverty a century ago  
 let me walk you through the three most basic factors in farming 
 first hybrid seed is created when you cross two seeds together 
 if you naturally pollinate a high yielding variety together with a drought resistant variety you get a hybrid that inherits positive traits from both of its parents
  if used responsibly is environmentally sustainable if you 
  just a pinch of fertilizer to a plant that 's taller than i am you unlock enormous yield gain 
 these are known as farm inputs 
 farm inputs need to be combined with good practice  when you space your seeds and plant with massive amounts of compost farmers multiply their
  these proven tools and practices have more than tripled agricultural productivity in every major region of the world  moving mass numbers of people out of poverty  
 we just haven 't finished delivering these things to everybody just yet particularly in sub saharan africa  
 so overall this is amazing news  humanity actually solved agricultural poverty a century ago 
 in theory  we just haven 't delivered these things to everybody just yet 
 in this century the reason that people remain poor is because maybe they live in
  remote places  they lack access to these things 
 therefore  ending poverty is simply a matter of delivering proven goods and services to people  
 we don 't need more genius types right now the humble delivery guy is going to end global poverty in our lifetime  
 so these are the three levers  and the most powerful lever is simply delivery  wherever the world 's companies
 and nonprofits set up delivery networks for life improving goods  we eliminate poverty  
 ok so that sounds really nice in theory  but what about in practice what do these delivery networks look like
 i want to share the concrete example that i know best my organization one acre fund
  we only serve the farmer and our job is to provide her with the tools that she needs to succeed 
 we start off by delivering farm inputs
  to really rural places now this may appear initially very challenging  but it 's pretty possible let me show you 
 we buy farm inputs with the combined power of our farmer network  and store it in twenty warehouses like this 
 then during input delivery we rent hundreds of 10 ton trucks and send them out to where farmers are waiting in the field 
 they then get their individual orders and walk it home to their farms it 's kind of like amazon for rural farmers
 importantly  realistic delivery also includes finance a way to pay 
 farmers pay us little by little over time covering most of our expenses  
 and then we surround all that with training 
 our rural field officers deliver practical hands on training to farmers in the field every two weeks  
 wherever we deliver our services farmers use these tools to climb out of
  poverty  
 this is a farmer in our program consolata 
 look at the pride on her face she has achieved a modest prosperity that i believe is the human right of every hardworking person on the planet  
 today i 'm proud to say that we 're serving about four hundred thousand farmers like
  scalable delivery 
 in any given area  we hire a rural field officer who delivers our services to two hundred farmers on average with more than one thousand people living in those families  
 today  we have two thousand of these rural field officers growing very quickly  this is our delivery army  
 and we 're just one organization  there are many companies  governments and nonprofits that have delivery armies just like this
 and i believe we stand at a moment in time where collectively we are capable of delivering farm services to all farmers  
 let me show you how possible this is  
 this is a map of sub saharan africa with a map of the united states for scale  i chose sub saharan africa because this is a huge delivery territory it 's very challenging  
 but we analyzed
  on the continent  and we found that half of farmers live in just these shaded regions
 that 's a remarkably small area overall  
 if you were to lay these boxes next to each other within a map of the united states  they would only cover the eastern united states 
 you can order pizza anywhere in this territory and it 'll arrive to your house hot fresh and delicious  
 if america can deliver pizza to an area of this size
  africa 's companies  governments and non profits can deliver farm services to all of her farmers this is possible 
 i 'm going to wrap up by generalizing beyond just farming 
 in every field of human development  humanity has already invented effective tools to end poverty  we just need to deliver them  
  so again in every area of human development super smart people a long time ago invented inexpensive highly effective tools humanity is armed to the teeth with simple effective solutions to poverty  
 we just need to deliver these to a pretty small area  
 again using the map of sub saharan africa as an example remember that rural poverty is concentrated in these blue shaded areas  
 urban poverty is even more concentrated in these green little dots  
 again using a
  map of the united states for scale  
 this is what i would call a highly achievable delivery zone 
 in fact for the first time in human history  we have a vast amount of delivery infrastructure available to us the world 's companies  governments and non profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this relatively small area  
 we just lack the will 
 if we are willing every one of
  has a role to play  
 we first need more people to pursue careers in human development  especially if you live in a developing nation we need more front line health workers  teachers farmer 
  trainers  sales agents for life improving goods these are the delivery people that dedicate their careers to improving the lives of others but
  alone  and we 're just one out of many  this may surprise you but no matter what your technical specialty there is a role for you in this fight 
 and no matter how logistically possible it is to end poverty  we need a lot more resources this is our number one constraint 
 for private investors  we need a big expansion of venture capital
 private equity working capital available in emerging markets  but there are also limits to what private business can accomplish  
 private businesses often struggle to profitably serve the extreme poor  so philanthropy still has a major role to play  
 anybody can give  but we need more leadership  we need more visionary philanthropists and global leaders who will take problems in human development
 and lead humanity to wipe them off the face of the planet  if you 're interested in these ideas check out this
  website  we need more leaders  
 humanity has put people on the moon we 've invented supercomputers that fit into our pockets and connect us with anybody on the planet 
 we 've run marathons at a  five minute mile pace we are an exceptional people  
 but we 've left more than one billion of our
  until every girl like this one has an opportunity to earn her full human potential we have failed to become a truly moral and just human race 
 logistically speaking it 's incredibly possible to end extreme poverty  we just need to deliver proven goods and services to everybody 
 if we have the will every one of us has a role to play  
 let 's deploy our
  our careers our collective wealth  let us deliver an end to extreme poverty in this lifetime  thank you
