  so if i told you that this
 was the face of pure joy  would you call me crazy  i wouldn 't blame you because every time i look at this
  i shiver just a little bit i want to tell you a little bit about this photograph i was swimming around
 in the lofoten islands in norway just inside the arctic circle and the water was hovering
 right at freezing the air 
 a brisk minus ten with windchill  and i could literally feel the blood trying to leave my hands  feet and face and rush to protect my vital organs it was the coldest i 've ever been
  even with swollen lips  sunken eyes and cheeks flushed red  i have found that this place right here
 is somewhere i can find great joy  
 now when it comes to pain  psychologist brock bastian probably said it best when he wrote 
 pain is a kind of shortcut to mindfulness  it makes us suddenly aware of everything in the environment 
 it brutally draws us in
  to a virtual sensory awareness of the world
 much like meditation if shivering is a form of meditation then i would consider myself a monk 
 now  before we get into the why would anyone ever want to surf in freezing cold water i would love to give you a little perspective
 on what a day in my life can
  i
  surf photographer right 
 i don 't even know if it 's a real job title to be honest my parents definitely didn 't think so when i told them at nineteen i was quitting my job to pursue this
  dream career  
 blue skies warm tropical beaches and a tan that lasts all year long i mean to me this was it life could not get any better 
 sweating it out shooting surfers in these exotic tourist destinations  
 but there was just this one problem you see the more time i spent traveling to these exotic locations the less gratifying
 it seemed to be i set out seeking adventure
  i was finding was only routine  it was things like wi fi tv fine dining and a constant cellular connection
 that to me were all the trappings of places heavily touristed in and out of the water  and it didn 't take long
 for me to start feeling suffocated 
 i began craving wild
  and so i set out to find the places others had written off as too cold  too remote and too dangerous to surf and that challenge intrigued me  
 i began this sort of personal crusade against the mundane  
 because if there 's one thing i 've realized  it 's that any career 
 even one as seemingly glamorous as surf photography  has the danger of becoming monotonous 
 so in my search to break up this monotony i realized
  something there 's only about a third
 of the earth 's oceans that are warm and it 's really just that thin band around the equator so if i was going to find perfect waves  it was probably going to happen somewhere cold 
 where the seas are notoriously rough and that 's exactly
 where i began to look  and it was my first trip to iceland
 that i felt like i found exactly what i was looking for i was blown away by the natural beauty of the landscape
  most importantly i couldn 't believe we were finding perfect waves in such a remote and rugged part of the world 
 at one point 
 we got to the beach only to find massive chunks of ice had piled on the shoreline they created this barrier between us and the surf and we had to weave through this thing like a maze just to get out into the
 lineup and once we got there we were pushing aside these ice chunks trying to get into waves it was
  experience one i 'll never forget  because amidst those harsh conditions 
 i felt like i stumbled onto one of the last quiet places somewhere that i found a clarity and a connection with the world i knew
 i would never find on a crowded beach 
 i was hooked  i was hooked cold water was constantly on my mind and from that point on my career focused
  on these types of harsh and unforgiving environments and it took me to places like russia norway alaska iceland chile the faroe islands and a lot of places in between  
 and one of my favorite things about these places
 was simply the challenge and the creativity it took just to get there hours days weeks spent on google earth trying to pinpoint any remote stretch of beach or reef we could actually get to 
 and once we got there the
  vehicles were just as creative  snowmobiles six wheel soviet troop carriers  and a couple of super sketchy helicopter flights 
 helicopters really scare me  by the way  
 there was this one particularly bumpy boat ride up the coast of vancouver island to this kind of remote surf spot 
 where we ended up watching helplessly from the water as bears ravaged our camp site they walked off with our food
  food and bits of our tent  clearly letting us know that we were at the bottom of the food chain and that this was their spot not ours  but to me that trip
 was a testament to the wildness i traded for those touristy beaches  
 now it wasn 't until i traveled to norway 
 laughter that i really learned to appreciate the cold  so this is the
  place
 where some of the largest the most violent storms in the world send huge waves smashing into the coastline we were in this tiny remote fjord 
 just inside the arctic circle
 it had a greater population of sheep than people so help if we needed it was nowhere to be found 
 i was in the water taking pictures of surfers  and it started to snow 
 and then the temperature
 began to drop  
 and i told myself there 's not a chance you 're getting out of the water you traveled all this way and this is exactly what you 've been waiting for freezing cold conditions with perfect waves 
 and although i couldn 't even feel my finger to push the trigger i knew i wasn 't getting out so i just did whatever i could i shook it off whatever but
 that was the point that i felt this wind gush through the valley and hit me and what started as this light snowfall
 quickly became a full on blizzard  and i started to lose perception
 of where i was i didn 't know if i was drifting out to sea or towards shore  and all i could really make out was the faint sound of seagulls
 and crashing waves  now i knew this place had a reputation for
  was out there floating i started to get a little bit nervous 
 actually i was totally freaking out and i was borderline hypothermic and my friends eventually had to help me out of the water  
 and i don 't know if it was delirium setting in
 or what but they told me later i had a smile on my face
 the entire time 
 now it was this trip and
  probably that exact experience where i really began to feel like every photograph was precious
 because all of a sudden in that moment it was something i was forced to earn  
 and i realized all this shivering had actually taught me something in life there are no shortcuts
  that is worth pursuing is going to require us to suffer
 just a little bit 
 and that tiny bit of suffering that i did for my photography  
 it added a value to my work that was so much more meaningful to me than just trying to fill the pages of magazines 
 see i gave a piece of myself
 in these places  and what i walked away with
 was a sense of fulfillment
  i had always been searching for 
 so i look back at this photograph  it 's easy to see frozen fingers and
 cold wetsuits and even the struggle that it took just to get there  but most of all what i see
 is just joy  thank you so much
