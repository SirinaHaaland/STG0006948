  i 've been playing ted for nearly a decade  and i 've very rarely played any new songs of
  was largely because there weren 't any so i 've been busy with a couple of projects  and
 one of them was this the nutmeg a 1930s ship 's lifeboat which i 've been restoring in the garden of my beach house in england 
 and so now when the polar ice caps melt my recording
 will rise up like an ark  and i 'll float off into the drowned world like a character from a j g ballard novel 
 during the day the nutmeg
 collects energy from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse and from a four hundred and fifty watt turbine up the mast 
 so that when it gets dark i 've got plenty of power  and i can light up the nutmeg
  and so i go in there until the early hours of the morning  and i work on new songs 
 i 'd like to play to you guys if you 're willing to be the first audience to hear it 
 it 's about billie holiday  and it appears that  
 some night in night in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven
 she left her physical space
 and was missing all night until she reappeared
  in the morning  but i know where she was she was with me on my lifeboat  and she was hot
  roof
