  to speak about a tiny little idea  and this is about shifting baseline  and because the idea
 can be explained in one minute i will tell you
 three stories before to fill in
 and the first story is is about charles darwin one of my heroes  
 and he was here  as you well know in ' thirty five and you 'd think he was chasing finches but he wasn 't 
 he was actually collecting fish and he described one of them
 as very common this was the sailfin grouper 
  we have heard it
 lots of times on galapagos and other places so there is nothing particular about it 
 but the point is we still come to galapagos  we still think it is pristine the brochures still say
 it is untouched so
  what happens here the second story  also to illustrate another concept is called shifting waistline because
 i was there in ' seventy one studying a lagoon in west africa i was there because
 i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa  and i thought i could blend in and i got a big sunburn  and i was convinced
 i was really not from there this was my first sunburn  and the the lagoon was surrounded by
 by palm trees as you can see and a few mangrove and it had tilapia about twenty centimeters a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia  
 and the fisheries for this tilapia sustained lots of
  and they had a good time and they earned more than average in
 ghana  when i went there twenty seven years later 
 the fish had shrunk to half of their size  
 they were maturing at five centimeters they had been pushed genetically there were still fishes  they were still kind of happy and
 the fish also were happy to be there so
 nothing has changed but everything has changed my third little
  story
 is that i was an accomplice in the introduction of trawling in southeast asia 
 in the ' 70s well beginning in the ' 60s europe did lots of development projects fish development
 meant imposing on countries that had already one hundred thousand fishers to impose
  is called the mutiara four  and i went sailing on it and we did surveys throughout
 the southern south china sea and especially the java sea and what we caught  we didn 't have words for it 
 what we caught i know now is the bottom of the sea and ninety percent of our catch
 were sponges
  animals that are fixed on the bottom and actually most of the fish they are a little spot on the debris the piles of debris were coral reef fish 
 essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down  and these pictures are
 extraordinary because
 this transition is very rapid  within
  you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins 
 the bottom is transformed from in this case a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy
 mess 
 this is a dead turtle they were not eaten they were thrown away because they were dead and one time we caught a live one it was not drowned yet and then they wanted to kill it
 because it was good to eat 
  of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that 's never been fished but it 's not documented 
 we transform the world  but we don 't remember it we adjust our baseline
 to the new level and we don 't recall what was there  
 if you generalize this something like this happens you have on the y axis
  some good thing biodiversity  
 numbers of orca the greenness of your country the water supply  and over time it changes it changes because
 people do things or naturally every generation
 will use the the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives
 as a standard and will extrapolate forward
  difference then they perceive as a loss  but they don 't perceive what happened before as a loss 
 you can have a succession of changes at the end you want to sustain
 miserable leftovers  and that to a large extent is what we want to do now  we want to sustain things
 that are gone or things that are not the way they were now one should
  think
 this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies they killed
 animals and they didn 't know they had done so after a few generations because
  becomes rare so you don 't lose abundant animals you always lose rare animals 
 and therefore they 're not perceived as a big loss  
 over time we concentrate on large animals 
 and in a sea that means the big fish they become rarer because we fish them over time we have a few fish left
 and we think
 this is the baseline
  and the question is why do people accept this well because they don 't know
 that it was different  and in fact lots of people scientists will contest that it was really different  
 and they will contest this because the evidence
 presented
  is not in
 the way they would like the evidence presented for example the anecdote that some
 present as
 captain so and so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not
 utilized by fishery scientists  because it 's not 
  so you have a situation where people don 't know the past even though we live in literate societies because they don 't trust
  the the sources of the past  
 and hence the enormous role that a marine protected area can play because with marine protected areas we actually
 recreate
  we recreate the past that
 people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low that is for people who can see
 a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides
 which enables them to reset their baseline  how about the people who can 't do that because they have no access the people in the midwest for example
 there i think that the arts and film
 can
 perhaps fill the gap  and simulation this is a simulation of chesapeake bay there were gray whales in chesapeake bay a long time ago five hundred years
 ago and you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like
  why people were so touched
 by it never mind the pocahontas story 
 why so touched by the imagery because it evokes
 something
 that in a sense has been lost and so my recommendation it 's the only one i will provide is for cameron to do
