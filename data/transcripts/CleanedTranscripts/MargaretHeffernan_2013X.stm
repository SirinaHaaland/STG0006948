  the northwest corner of the united states right up near the canadian border there 's a little town called libby montana
 and it 's surrounded by pine trees and lakes and just amazing
 wildlife and these enormous trees that scream up into the sky
 and in there is a little town called libby
 which i visited which feels kind of lonely a little isolated
 and in libby montana there 's a rather unusual woman named gayla benefield she always felt
  a little bit of an outsider although she 's been there almost all her life a woman of russian extraction
 she told me when she went to school she was the only girl who ever chose to do mechanical drawing
 later in life she got a job going house to house
 reading utility meters gas meters electricity meters and she was doing the work in the middle of the day and one
  thing particularly caught her notice which was in the middle of the day she met a lot of men who were at home
 middle aged late middle aged
 and a lot of them seemed to be on oxygen tanks it struck her as strange
 then a few
  years later her father died at the age of fifty nine five days before he was due to receive his pension
 he 'd been a miner she thought he must just have been worn out by the work
 but then a few years later her mother died
 and that seemed stranger still because her mother came from a long line of people who just seemed to live forever
 in fact gayla 's uncle is still alive to this day
 and learning how to waltz it didn 't make sense that gayla 's mother should die so young
 it was an anomaly
 and she kept puzzling over anomalies and as she did other ones came to mind she remembered for example when her mother had broken a leg and went into the hospital and she had a lot of x rays and two of them were leg x rays which made sense but six
  them were chest x rays
 which didn 't
 she puzzled and puzzled over every piece of her life and her parents life trying to understand what she was seeing
 she thought about her town the town had a vermiculite mine in it vermiculite was used for
 soil conditioners to make plants grow faster and better
 vermiculite was used to insulate lofts huge amounts of it put under the roof
 to keep houses warm during the long montana winters
 vermiculite was in the playground it was in the football ground it was in the skating rink
 what she didn 't learn until she started working this problem is vermiculite
  a very toxic form of asbestos
 when she figured out the puzzle she started telling everyone she could
 what had happened what had been done to her parents and to the people that she saw
 on oxygen tanks at home in the afternoons
 but she was really amazed she thought when everybody knows they 'll want to do something but actually nobody wanted to know
 in fact she became so annoying as she kept insisting on telling
  this story to her neighbors to her friends to other people in the community that eventually a bunch of them got together and they made a bumper sticker which they proudly displayed on their cars 
  which said yes i 'm from libby montana and no i don 't have asbestosis
 she talked to anybody she could she argued and argued and finally she struck lucky
 when a researcher came through town studying the history of mines in the area
 and she told him her story and at first of course like everyone he didn 't believe her but he went back to seattle and he did his own research and he realized
 that she was right
 so now she had an ally
 nevertheless people still didn 't want to know they said things like well
 if it were really dangerous someone would have told us
 if that 's really why everyone was dying the doctors would have told us
 some of the guys used to very heavy jobs said i don 't want to be a victim i can 't possibly be a victim
  and anyway every industry has its accidents
 but still gayla went on and finally she succeeded in getting a federal agency to come to town
 and to screen the inhabitants of the town
 fifteen thousand people
 and what they discovered
 was that the town had a mortality
  rate eighty times higher than anywhere in the united states
 that was in two thousand and two and even at that moment no one raised their hand to say gayla
 look in the playground where your grandchildren are playing
 it 's lined with vermiculite
 this wasn
  't ignorance
 it was willful blindness
 willful blindness is a legal concept which means if there 's information that you could know and you should know
 but you somehow manage not to know
 the law deems that you 're willfully blind you have chosen not to know
 there 's a lot of willful blindness around these days
  days you can see willful blindness in banks when thousands of people sold mortgages to people who couldn 't afford them
 you could see them in banks when interest rates were manipulated and everyone around knew what was going on but everyone studiously ignored it
 you can see willful blindness in the catholic church where decades of child abuse went ignored
 you could see willful blindness in the run up to the iraq war
 willful blindness exists on epic scales like those and it also exists on very small scales in people 's families
 in people 's homes and communities and particularly in organizations and institutions
 companies that have been
  studied for willful blindness can be asked questions like
 are there issues at work that people are afraid to raise
 and when academics have done studies like this of corporations in the united states what they find is eighty five percent of people say yes
  eighty five percent of people know there 's a problem but they won 't say anything
 and when i duplicated the research in europe asking all the same questions i found exactly the same number
 eighty five percent
 that 's a lot of silence it 's a lot of blindness
 and what 's really interesting is that when i go to companies in switzerland they tell me this is a uniquely swiss problem and when i go to germany they
  say oh yes this is the german disease and when i go to companies in england they say oh yeah the british are really bad at this
 and the truth is this is a human problem
 we 're all under certain circumstances willfully blind
 what the research shows is that some people are blind out of fear they 're afraid of retaliation
 and some people are blind
 because they think well seeing anything is just futile nothing 's ever going to change if we make a protest if we protest against the iraq war nothing changes so why bother better not to see this stuff at all
 and the recurrent theme that i encounter all the time is people say well you know the people who do see
 they 're whistleblowers and we all know what happens to them
 so there 's this profound mythology around whistleblowers which says first of all they 're all crazy
 but what i 've found going around the world and talking to whistleblowers
 is actually they 're very loyal and quite often very conservative people they 're hugely dedicated to the
  institutions that they work for and the reason that they speak up the reason they insist on seeing
 is because they care so much about the institution and want to keep it healthy
 and the other thing that people often say about whistleblowers is
 well there 's no point because you see what happens to them they are crushed nobody would want to go
  something like that and yet when i talk to whistleblowers the recurrent tone that i hear is pride
 i think of joe darby
 we all remember the photographs of abu ghraib
 which so shocked the world and showed the kind of war that was being fought in iraq
 but i wonder who remembers joe darby
  darby the very obedient good soldier who found those photographs and handed them in
 and he said he said you know i 'm not the kind of guy to rat people out but some things just cross the line
 ignorance is bliss they say but you can 't put up with things like this
 i talked to steve bolsin a british
  doctor
 who fought for five years to draw attention to a dangerous surgeon who was killing babies
 and i asked him why he did it and he said well it was really my daughter who prompted me to do it
 she came up to me one night and she just said dad you can 't let the kids die
 or i think of cynthia thomas
  a really loyal army daughter and army wife
 who as she saw her friends and relations coming back from the iraq war was so shocked
 by their mental condition and the refusal of the military to recognize and acknowledge post traumatic stress syndrome
 that she set up a cafe in the middle of a military town
 to give them legal psychological and medical assistance
 and she said to me she said you know margaret i always used to say i didn 't know what i wanted to be when i grow up
 but i 've found myself in this cause and i 'll never be the same
 we all
  enjoy so many freedoms today hard won freedoms
 the freedom to write and publish without fear of censorship a freedom that wasn 't here the last time i came to hungary
 a freedom to vote which women in particular had to fight so hard for
 the freedom for people of different ethnicities and cultures and sexual orientation to live the way that they want
  freedom doesn 't exist if you don 't use it
 and what whistleblowers do and what people like gayla benefield do is they use the freedom that they have
 and what they 're very prepared to do is recognize that yes this is going to be an argument
  and yes i 'm going to have a lot of rows with my neighbors and my colleagues and my friends
 but i 'm going to become very good at this conflict i 'm going to take on the naysayers because they 'll make my argument
 better and stronger i can collaborate with my opponents to become better at what i do
 these are people of immense persistence incredible patience and
  an absolute determination not to be blind and not to be silent
 when i went to libby montana
 i visited the asbestosis clinic that gayla benefield brought into being
 a place where at first some of the people who wanted help and needed medical attention went
  in the back door because they didn 't want to acknowledge that she 'd been right
 i sat in a diner and i watched as trucks drove up and down the highway
 carting away the earth out of gardens
 and replacing it with fresh uncontaminated soil
  i took my twelve year old daughter with me because i really wanted her to meet gayla
 and she said why what 's the big deal i said she 's not a movie star
 and she 's not a celebrity and she 's not an expert
 and gayla 's the first person who 'd say she 's not a saint
 the really important thing about gayla is she
  is ordinary she 's like you and she 's like me
 she had freedom and she was ready to use it thank you very much
