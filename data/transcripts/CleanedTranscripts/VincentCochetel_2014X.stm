  i cannot forget them  their names were aslan
  the list is longer 
 for many their existence their humanity  has been reduced to
 statistics  coldly recorded as security incidents 
 for me they were colleagues belonging to that community of humanitarian aid workers
  tried to bring a bit of comfort
 to the victims of the wars in chechnya in the ' 90s 
 they were nurses  logisticians shelter experts paralegals  interpreters 
 and for this service  they were murdered their families torn apart 
  and their story largely forgotten  no one was ever sentenced for these crimes  
 i cannot forget them  they live in me somehow 
 their memories giving me meaning every day  but they are also haunting the dark street of my mind  
 as humanitarian aid workers they made the choice to be at the side of the victim 
 to provide some assistance some comfort some protection
  when they needed protection themselves  it 
  you see the headlines of your newspaper these days with the war in iraq or in syria aid worker abducted  hostage executed
 but who were they why were they there what motivated them  how did we become so indifferent to these crimes
 is why i am here today with you we need to find better ways to remember them  
 we also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their lives 
 we also need to demand justice 
 when in ' ninety six i was sent by the united nations high commissioner for refugees to the north caucasus i knew some of the
 five colleagues had been killed three had been seriously injured  seven had already been taken hostage  so we were careful  
 we were using armored vehicles  decoy cars  changing patterns of travel changing homes all sorts of security measures  
 yet on a cold winter night of january
  turn when i entered my flat in vladikavkaz with a guard  we were surrounded by armed men  
 they took the guard they put him on the floor  they beat him up in front of me tied him  dragged him away  
 i was handcuffed  blindfolded
  gun pressed against my neck  when it happens to you there is no time for thinking no time for praying 
 my brain went on automatic  rewinding quickly the life i 'd just left behind  
 it took me long minutes to figure out that those masked men there were not there to kill me  but
  had ordered my kidnapping 
 then a process of dehumanization started that day  i was no more than just a commodity  
 i normally don 't talk about this but i 'd like to share a bit with you some of those three hundred and seventeen days of captivity  
 i was kept in an underground
  and then the guards would come normally two they would bring a big piece of bread a bowl of soup and a candle 
 that candle would burn for fifteen minutes  fifteen minutes of precious light and then they would take
  i was chained by a metal cable to my bed  i could do only four small steps 
 i always dreamt of the fifth one 
 and no tv no radio no newspaper no one to talk to 
 i had no towel  no soap  no toilet paper just two metal buckets open one for water
 one waste 
 can you imagine that mock execution can be a pastime for guards when they are sadistic
 or when they are just bored or drunk  we are breaking my nerves very slowly  
 isolation and darkness are particularly difficult to describe how do you describe
  nothing there are no words for the depths of loneliness i reached in that very thin border
 between sanity and madness in the darkness sometimes i played
 imaginary games of checkers  i would start with the black play with the white back to the black trying to trick the other side
  i don 't play checkers anymore
  i was tormented by the thoughts of my family
 and my colleague the guard edik i didn 't know what had happened to him i
 was trying not to think  i tried to fill up my time by doing all sorts of physical exercise on the spot  
 i tried to pray i tried all sorts of memorization games
 but darkness also creates images and thoughts that are not normal 
 one part of your brain wants you to resist to shout to cry 
 and the other part of the brain orders you to 
  just go through it it 's a constant internal debate there is no one to arbitrate  once a guard came to me
  very aggressively and he told me today you 're going to kneel and beg for your food 
 i wasn 't in a good mood so i insulted him  i insulted his mother i insulted his ancestors the
 consequence was moderate he threw the food into my waste the day after he came back with the same demand 
 he got the same answer  which had
  same consequence  
 four days later the body was full of pain i didn 't know hunger hurt so much when you have so little 
 so
 when the guards came down 
 i knelt  i begged for my food
  the only way for me to make it to another candle 
 after my kidnapping i was transferred from north ossetia to chechnya 
 three days of slow travel in the trunks of different cars  
 and upon arrival i was interrogated for eleven days by a guy called ruslan 
 the routine was always the same a bit more light
  he would come down to the cellar he would ask the guards to tie me on the chair and he would turn on the music loud  
 and then he would yell questions  he would scream  he would beat me i
 'll spare you the details there are many questions i could not understand and there are some questions i did not want to understand
  of the interrogation was the duration of the tape  fifteen songs forty five minutes  i would always long for the last song 
 on one day one night in that cellar  i don 't know what it was i heard a child crying above my head 
 a boy  maybe two or three years old  
 footsteps  
  people running 
 so when ruslan came the day after  
 before he put the first question to me  i asked him how is your son today is he feeling better ruslan was taken by surprise  
 he was furious that the guards may have leaked some details about his private life 
 i kept talking about ngos supplying medicines to local clinics
 that may help his son to get better and we talked about
  we talked about families 
 he talked to me about his children  i talked to him about my daughters and then he 'd talk about guns about cars about women and
 i had to talk about guns about cars about women 
 and we talked until the last song on the tape  
 ruslan was the most brutal man i ever met
  did not touch me anymore  he did not ask any other questions i was no longer just a commodity  two 
  days after i was transferred to another place there a guard came to me  very close it was quite unusual and he said with a very soft
  like to thank you for the assistance your organization provided my family when we were displaced in nearby dagestan 
 what could i possibly reply  
 it was so painful it was like a blade in the belly  it took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile
 the good reasons we had to assist that family and the soldier
 of fortune he became  he was young he was shy  i never saw his face  he probably meant well  
 but in those fifteen seconds  he made me question everything we did 
 all the sacrifices  
 he made me think also how they see us  until then i had assumed that they know why we are there and what we are doing
 one cannot assume this
 well explaining why we do this is not that easy  even to our closest relatives  
 we are not perfect  we are not superior  we are not the world 's fire brigade  we are not superheroes  we
  we know that humanitarian response is not a substitute for political solution  
 yet we do this because one life matters  sometimes that 's the only difference you make one individual one family a small group of individuals
 and it matters  when you have a tsunami an earthquake or a typhoon you see teams of rescuers coming from all over the
  searching for survivors for weeks why nobody questions this every life matters or
 every life should matter 
 this is the same for us when we help refugees people displaced within their country by conflict or stateless persons  
 i know many people when they are confronted by
  are so many ways people can help  
 we don 't stop with that feeling we try to do whatever we can to provide some assistance some protection some comfort  
 we have to we can 't do otherwise it 's what makes us feel i don 't know simply human
 that 's a picture of me the day of my release  months after my
  release i met the then french prime minister 
 the second thing he told me you were totally irresponsible to go to the north caucasus you don 't know how many problems you 've created for us it
 was a short meeting 
 i think helping people in danger is responsible in that war
  war that nobody seriously wanted to stop and we have many of these today  
 bringing some assistance to people in need and a bit of protection was not just an act of humanity  it was making a real difference for the people 
 why could he not understand this 
 we have a responsibility to try you 've heard about that concept responsibility to protect
  outcomes may depend on various parameters 
 we may even fail but there is worse than failing it 's not even trying when we can 
 well if you are met this way if you sign up for this sort of job your life is going to be full of joy and sadness 
 because there are a lot of people we cannot help a lot of people we cannot protect a lot of people we
  did not save  i call them my ghost 
 and by having witnessed their suffering from close you take a bit of that suffering on yourself 
 many young humanitarian workers go through their first experience with a lot of bitterness they are thrown into situations where they are witness  
 but they are powerless to bring any change they have to learn to accept it
 and gradually turn this into positive energy  it 's difficult many don 't succeed  
 but for those who do there is no other job like this you can see the difference you make every day 
 humanitarian aid workers know the risk they are taking in
  the sanctity of our life is fading 
 do you know that since the millennium the number of attacks on humanitarian aid workers has tripled two thousand and
  until the beginning of the civil war in somalia in the late ' 80s 
 humanitarian aid workers were sometimes victims of what we call collateral damages but by and large we were not
  the target of these attacks
 look at this picture baghdad august two thousand and three twenty four colleagues were killed  gone are the days when a u n blue flag
 or a red cross would automatically protect us  criminal groups and some
  over the last twenty years 
 and they 've created these sort of hybrids with whom we have no way of communicating 
 humanitarian principles are tested questioned and often ignored  but perhaps more importantly  
 we have abandoned the search for justice there seems to be no consequence whatsoever for attacks against humanitarian
  after my release i was told not to seek any form of justice it won 't do you any good that 's what i was told plus you 're going to put in danger the life of other colleagues  
 it took me years to see the sentencing of three people associated with my kidnapping  
 but this was the exception there was
  the same all over the world 
 this is unacceptable this is inexcusable 
 attacks on humanitarian aid workers are war crimes in international law those crimes should not go unpunished  
 we must end this cycle of impunity  we must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid
  workers are attacks against humanity itself that makes me furious i know i 'm very lucky
 compared to the refugees i work for  
 i don 't know what it is to have seen my whole town destroyed  i don 't know what it is to have seen my relatives shot in front of me  
 i don 't know what it is to lose the protection of my country
 i also know that i 'm very lucky compared to other hostages  four days before my eventful
 release  four hostages were beheaded
 a few miles away from where i was kept in captivity  why them  
 why am i here today 
 no easy answer
  i was received with a lot of support that i got from my relatives from colleagues 
 from friends from people i didn 't know they have helped me over the years to come out of the darkness 
 not everyone was treated with the same attention how many of my colleagues after a traumatic incident 
  own life 
 i can count nine that i knew personally  how many of my 
  difficult divorce after a traumatic experience
 because they could not explain anything anymore to their spouse i 've lost that count there
 is a price for this type of life in russia all
  no one is forgotten nothing is forgotten 
 i do not forget my lost colleagues i cannot forget anything  
 i call on you to remember their dedication and demand that humanitarian aid workers around the world be better
  we should not let that light of hope they have brought to be switched off 
 after my ordeal a lot of colleagues asked me but why do you continue why do you do this sort of job  why do you have to go back to it 
 my answer was very simple  
 if i had quit 
 that would have meant my kidnapper had won  they would have taken my soul and my humanity
