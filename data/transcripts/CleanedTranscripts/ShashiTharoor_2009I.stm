  as a politician and a government minister i 've become rather concerned about the
 the hype we 're hearing about our own country all this talk about india becoming a world leader even the next superpower  in fact the american
  the elephant the tiger and the cell phone added a gratuitous subtitle saying india the next 21st century power and i just don 't think that 's what india 's all about or should be all about 
 indeed  what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic it 's
 redolent of james bond movies and kipling ballads after
 all what constitutes a world leader  if it 's population we 're on course to top the charts  we will overtake china by two thousand and
  it military strength well we have the world 's fourth largest army is it nuclear capacity  we know we have that the americans have even recognized it in an agreement 
 is it the economy well we have now the fifth largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms  
 and we continue to grow when the rest of the world took a beating last year  we grew at six point seven
  none of that adds up to me to what i think
 india really can aim to contribute in the world in this part of the 21st century  and so i wondered could
 what
 the future beckons for india to be all about
 be a combination of these things allied to something else  the power of example  the attraction of india 's culture  
 what in other words people like to call soft power
 soft power is a
 concept invented by a harvard academic joseph nye a friend of mine 
 and very simply and i 'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here  it 's essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture its political values its foreign policies 
 and you know  lots of countries do this he was writing initially about the states 
 we know the alliance francaise is all about
 french soft power the british council the beijing olympics were an exercise in chinese soft power
  americans have the voice of america and the fulbright scholarships but the fact is in fact 
 that probably hollywood and mtv and mcdonalds have done more for american soft power around the world than any specifically government activity  
 so soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments but partly despite governments and
  in the information era we all live in today what we might call the ted age i 'd say that countries are increasingly being judged
 by a global public that 's been fed on
 an incessant diet of internet news of televised images 
 of cellphone videos of email gossip in other words all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries whether or not
 the countries concerned
 want people to hear those stories now  in this age again countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information
 have a particular advantage and of course they have more influence sometimes about how they 're seen india has more all news tv channels
 than any country in the world in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together but the fact still is that it 's not just that
  have soft power  you have to be connected one might argue that india has become
 an astonishingly connected country i think you 've already heard the figures  we 've been selling fifteen million cellphones a month  
 currently there are five hundred and nine million cellphones in indian hands in india  and that makes us larger than the u s as a
  those fifteen million cellphones are the most connections that any country including the u s and china has ever established in the history of telecommunications 
 but what perhaps some of you don 't realize is how far we 've come to get there you know
 when i grew up in india  telephones were a rarity  
 in fact they were so rare that elected members of parliament had the right to allocate fifteen telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed
  if you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist or a doctor or something you might have a telephone 
 but sometimes it just sat there i went to high school in calcutta  and we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer but
 half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces there would be no dial tone 
 if there was a dial tone and you dialed a number  the odds were two in three you wouldn 't get the number you were intending to reach in
  if you then wanted to connect to another city let 's say from calcutta you wanted to call delhi  you 'd have to book something called a trunk call and then sit by the phone all day  waiting for it to come through 
 or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call  but lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days so it was
 like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through  in fact so woeful was our telephone service
 that a member of parliament stood up
 and complained about this and the then communications minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury not a right that
 the government had no obligation to provide better service 
 and if the honorable member wasn 't satisfied with his telephone could he please return it since there was an eight year long waiting list for telephones in india now
 fast forward to today and this is what you see the fifteen million cell phones a month
 most striking is who is carrying those cell phones  you know  if you visit friends in the suburbs of delhi on the side streets
 you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the 16th century  wielding a 
  steam iron that might have been invented in the  18th century he 's called an isthri wala  but he 's carrying a 21st century instrument 
  's carrying a cell phone
 because most incoming calls are free and that 's how he gets orders from the neighborhood to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed 
 the other day i was in kerala my home state at the country farm of a friend about twenty kilometers away from any place you 'd consider urban  
 and it was a hot day and he said hey would you like some fresh coconut water 
 and it 's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics so i said sure and he whipped out his cellphone dialed the number and a voice said i 'm up here
 and right on top of the nearest coconut tree with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other was a local toddy tapper
  who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink 
 fishermen are going out to sea and
 carrying their cell phones when they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices 
  who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open if the market was on whether the product they 'd harvested could be sold what price they 'd fetch 
  they 'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back then they 'd load the cart today they 're 
 saving half a day 's labor with a two minute phone call so this empowerment of the underclass
 is the real result of india being connected  and that transformation is part of where
  india is heading today 
 but of course that 's not the only thing about india that 's spreading  you 've got bollywood my attitude to bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats at a bollywood garbage dump  mr 
 shekhar kapur forgive me
 and they 're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a bollywood studio  and the first goat chewing away says you know this film is not bad 
 and the second goat says
  better 
 i usually tend to think that the book is is usually better but  having said that 
 the fact is that bollywood is now
 taking a certain aspect of indian ness and indian culture around the globe not just in the indian diaspora in the
  but to the screens of arabs and africans of senegalese and syrians  i 've met a young man in new york whose illiterate mother in a village in senegal
 takes a bus once a month to the capital city of dakar just to watch a bollywood movie  she can 't understand the dialogue  
 she 's illiterate so she can 't read the french subtitles  but these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps and she has a great time in the song and
  the action she goes away with stars in her eyes about india as a result 
 and this is happening more and more 
 afghanistan  we know what a serious security problem afghanistan is for so many of us in the world india doesn 't have a military mission there you know what
 was india 's biggest asset in afghanistan in the last seven years 
 one simple fact  you couldn 't try to call an afghan at eight thirty in the evening  
 why because that was the moment when the indian television soap opera kyunki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi
  dubbed into dari was telecast on tolo t v and it was the most popular television show in afghan history 
 every afghan family wanted to watch it they had to suspend functions at eight thirty  weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the t v set and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom  
 crime went up at eight
  i have read a reuters dispatch so this is not indian propaganda a british news agency about how robbers in the town of musarri sharif * stripped a vehicle
 of its windshield wipers its hubcaps its sideview mirrors any moving part they could find at eight thirty  because the watchmen were busy watching the t v rather than minding the store 
 and they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show 's heroine
 is what india is developing through the e part of ted  its own entertainment industry 
 the same is true of course we don 't have time for too many more examples but it 's true of our of our music of our dance of our art
  yoga ayurveda even indian cuisine i mean the proliferation proliferation of indian restaurants since i first went abroad as a student in the mid ' 70s and what i see today you can 't go to
  europe or north america and not find an indian restaurant it may not be a very good one but today in britain for example 
 indian restaurants in britain employ more people than the coal mining  ship building and iron and steel industries combined  
 so the empire can strike back 
  tales like afghanistan comes
 something vital in the information era  
 the sense that in today 's world it 's not the side of the bigger army that wins  
 it 's the country that tells a better story that prevails and india is and must remain in my view the land of the better
  stereotypes are changing i mean  
 again  having gone to the u s as a student in the mid ' 70s i knew what the image of india was then if there was an image at all 
 today people in silicon valley and elsewhere speak of the iits the indian institutes of technology with the same reverence they used to accord to mit 
 this can sometimes have unintended consequences ok i had a friend a history major like me  
 who was accosted at schiphol airport in amsterdam by an anxiously perspiring european saying you 're indian
  're indian can you help me fix my laptop we 've gone from the image of india as
 land of fakirs lying on beds of nails and snake charmers with the indian rope trick 
 to the image of india as a land of mathematical geniuses computer wizards software gurus  but that too is transforming
  the indian story around the world but 
 there is something more substantive to that the story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism  
 it 's a civilizational story to begin with because india has been an open society for millennia 
 india gave refuge to the jews fleeing
 the destruction of the first temple by the babylonians and said thereafter by the romans  
 in fact legend has is that when doubting thomas  the apostle saint thomas  landed on the shores
  of kerala my home state somewhere around fifty two a d he was welcomed on shore by a flute playing jewish girl 
 and to this day remains the only jewish diaspora in the history of the jewish people which has never encountered a single incident of
 slightly more differently complicated history in the north but all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in india you
 know we just celebrated this year our general elections the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history  and the next one will be even bigger because our voting population keeps growing by twenty million a year  
 but  the fact is
  the last elections five years ago gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader
 of italian origin and roman catholic faith sonia gandhi  who then made way for a sikh mohan singh 
 to be sworn in as prime minister by a muslim president abdul kalam in a country eighty one percent hindu
  this is india  and of course it 's all the more striking because it was
 four years later that we all applauded
 the u s the oldest democracy in the modern world more than two hundred and twenty years of free and fair elections  which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasn 't white male or christian 
 so maybe oh sorry he is christian i beg your pardon and he is male but he isn 't white 
 all the others have been all those
  three all his predecessors have been all those three and that 's the point i was trying to make but the issue is
 that when i talked about that example it 's not just about
 talking about india it 's not propaganda because ultimately 
 that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world it was essentially india being itself  
 and ultimately it seems to me
 that always works better than propaganda  governments aren 't very good at telling stories 
 but people see a society for what it is and that it seems to me is what ultimately will make a difference in today 's
 information era in today 's ted age  so india
 now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion because we have every ethnicity known to mankind practically we 've every religion know
  to mankind with the possible exception of shintoism though that has some hindu elements somewhere
 we have twenty three official languages that are recognized in our constitution and those of you who
 cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note spelling out the denominations
  we 've got all of that
  we don 't even have geography uniting us because the natural geography of the subcontinent
 framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with pakistan in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven in fact you can 't even take the name of the country for granted 
 because the name india comes from the river indus  which flows in pakistan  
 but  the whole point is that india is the nationalism of an idea it 's the idea of an ever ever land 
 emerging from an ancient civilization  united by a shared history  but sustained above
  all by pluralist democracy that is a 
  story as well as an ancient one  and it 's the nationalism of an idea that
 essentially says you can endure differences of caste creed color culture  
 cuisine  custom and costume  consonant for that matter and still rally around a consensus
  and the consensus is of a very simple principle that in a diverse plural democracy like india you don 't really have to agree
 on everything all the time so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree
  the great success story of india a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate in the ' 50s and ' 60s 
 is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus
  emerging into the 21st century and i do want to make the point
 that if there is anything worth celebrating about india it isn 't military muscle economic power all of that is necessary  but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome 
 somebody said we are super poor  and we are also super power  we can 't really be both of those we have to overcome our poverty
  we have to deal with the hardware of development the ports the roads the airports all the infrastructural things we need to do and the software of development  the human capital the need for the ordinary person in india
 to be able to have a couple of square meals a day to be able to send his or her children to a decent school and to aspire to work a job that will give them
 opportunities in their lives that
 can transform themselves
