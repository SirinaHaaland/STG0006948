  phd student at harvard  and i loved to travel i had just gotten engaged to marry the love of my life  
 i was twenty eight and like so many of us when we are in good health  i felt like i was invincible 
 then one day i had a fever of one hundred and four point seven degrees  i probably should have gone to the doctor but i 'd never really been sick in my life
 and i knew that usually if you have a virus you stay home and you make some chicken soup  and in a few days everything will be fine  
 but this time it wasn 't fine  
 after the fever broke for three weeks i was so dizzy i couldn 't leave my house  i would walk straight into door
  i had to hug the walls just to make it to the bathroom 
 that spring i got infection after infection  and every time i went to the doctor he said there was absolutely nothing wrong  
 he had his laboratory tests  which always came back normal 
 all i had were my symptoms  which i could describe  but no one else can see
  know it sounds silly but you have to find a way to explain things like this to yourself and so i
 thought maybe i was just aging  maybe this is what it 's like to be on the other side of twenty five 
 then the neurological symptoms started sometimes i would find that i couldn 't draw the right side of a circle other times
  be able to speak or move at all 
 i saw every kind of specialist infectious disease doctors dermatologists endocrinologists cardiologists  
 i even saw a psychiatrist 
 my psychiatrist said it 's clear you 're really sick but not with anything psychiatric  
 i hope they can find out what 's wrong with you 
 the next day my neurologist diagnosed me with conversion disorder
  told me that everything
 the fevers the sore throats the sinus infection all of the gastrointestinal neurological and cardiac symptoms
 were being caused by some distant emotional trauma that i could not remember 
 the symptoms were real he said but they had no biological cause 
 i was training to be a social scientist  i had studied
  statistics probability theory mathematical modeling experimental design  
 i felt like i couldn 't just reject my neurologist 's diagnosis  
 it didn 't feel true  but i knew from my training that the truth is often counterintuitive 
 so easily obscured by what we want to believe  so i had to consider the possibility that he was right
  that day i ran a small experiment i walked back the two miles from my neurologist 's office to my house 
 my legs wrapped in this strange  almost electric kind of pain  
 i meditated on that pain  contemplating how my mind could have possibly generated all this 
  as soon as i walked through the door i collapsed my brain and my spinal cord were burning 
 my neck was so stiff i couldn 't touch my chin to my chest and the slightest sound
 the rustling of the sheets my husband walking barefoot in the next room
 could cause excruciating pain  
 i would spend most of the next two years in bed
  how could my doctor have gotten it so wrong 
 i thought i had a rare disease  something doctors had never seen and then i went online and found thousands of people all over the world
 living with the same symptoms  similarly isolated  similarly disbelieved  
 some could still work but had to spend their evenings and weekends in bed just so they could show up the next
  the other end of the spectrum some were so sick
 they had to live in complete darkness  unable to tolerate the sound of a human voice or the touch of a loved one 
 i was diagnosed with 
 you 've probably heard it called chronic fatigue syndrome for decades that 's a
  that 's meant that this
 has been the dominant image of a disease that can be as serious as this 
 the key symptom we all share is that whenever we exert ourselves physically  mentally
 we pay and we pay hard  
 if my husband goes for a run he might be sore for a couple of days  if i try to walk half a block  i might be bedridden for a week 
 it is a perfect custom prison  
 i know ballet dancers who can 't dance
  dance  accountants who can 't add  medical students who never became doctors 
 it doesn 't matter what you once were you can 't do it anymore 
 it 's been four years and i 've still never been as well as i was the minute before i walked home from my neurologist 's office  
 it 's estimated that about fifteen to thirty million people around the world have this disease
 in the us where i 'm from it 's about one million people that makes it roughly twice as common as multiple sclerosis 
 patients can live for decades with the physical function of someone with congestive heart failure
  twenty five percent of us are homebound or bedridden and 
  yet doctors do not treat us and science does not study us  how could a disease this common and this devastating
 have been forgotten by medicine 
 when my doctor diagnosed me with conversion disorder  he was invoking a lineage of ideas about women 's bodies that are over two thousand five hundred years old 
 the roman physician galen thought that hysteria was caused by sexual deprivation in particularly
  passionate women 
 the greeks thought the uterus would literally dry up and wander around the body in search of moisture  pressing on internal organs yes
 causing symptoms from extreme emotions to dizziness and paralysis the cure was marriage and motherhood
  these ideas went largely unchanged for several millennia until the 1880s when neurologists tried to modernize the theory of hysteria  
 sigmund freud developed a theory that the unconscious mind could produce physical symptoms when dealing with memories or emotions too painful for the conscious mind to handle 
 it converted these emotions into physical symptoms 
 this meant that men could now get hysteria but of course women were still the most susceptible
  when i began investigating
 the history of my own disease  i was amazed to find how deep these ideas still run in one thousand 
 nine hundred and thirty four one hundred and ninety eight doctors nurses and staff at the los angeles county general hospital became seriously ill they had muscle weakness 
 stiffness in the neck and back fevers all of the same symptoms i had when i first got diagnosed 
  form of polio  since then there have been more than seventy outbreaks documented around the world of a strikingly similar  post infectious disease 
 all of these outbreaks have tended to disproportionately affect women  
 and in time when doctors failed to find the one cause of the disease  they thought that these outbreaks were mass hysteria 
 why has this idea had such staying power
  i do think it has to do with sexism but i also think that fundamentally doctors want to help  they want to know the answer 
 and this category allows doctors to treat what would otherwise be untreatable to explain illnesses that have no explanation  
 the problem is that this can cause real harm in the 1950s a psychiatrist named
 eliot slater studied a cohort
 who had been diagnosed with hysteria  
 nine years later twelve of them were dead and thirty had become disabled 
 many had undiagnosed conditions like multiple sclerosis  epilepsy brain tumors 
 in one thousand nine hundred and eighty hysteria was officially renamed conversion disorder when my neurologist gave me that diagnosis in two thousand and
  he was echoing freud 's words verbatim  and even today women are two to ten times more likely to receive that diagnosis  
 the problem with the theory of hysteria or psychogenic illness
 is that it can never be proven it is by definition the absence of evidence  
 and in the case of me psychological explanations have held back biological research 
 all around the world me is one of the least funded diseases in the us
  us  we spend each year roughly
 two thousand five hundred dollars per aids patient two hundred and fifty dollars per ms patient
 and just five dollars per year per me patient  
 this was not just lightning  i was not just unlucky  
 the ignorance surrounding my disease has been a choice a choice made by the institutions that were supposed to protect us
  us 
 we don 't know why me sometimes runs in families  
 why you can get it after almost any infection from enteroviruses to epstein barr virus to q fever 
 or why it affects women at two to three times the rate of men 
 this issue is much bigger than just my disease  when i first got
  old friends were reaching out to me  i soon found myself a part of a cohort of women in their late 20s whose bodies were falling apart 
 what was striking was just how much trouble we were having being taken seriously  
 i learned of one woman with scleroderma  an autoimmune connective tissue disease who was told for years that it was all in her head 
 between the time of onset and diagnosis  her esophagus was so thoroughly damaged
  she will never be able to eat again another woman with ovarian cancer who for years was told that it was just early menopause 
 a friend from college  whose brain tumor was misdiagnosed for years as anxiety  
 here 's why this worries me  since the 
 rates of many autoimmune diseases have doubled to tripled
  of patients who are eventually diagnosed with a recognized autoimmune disease are initially told they 're hypochondriacs 
 like the hysteria of old this has everything to do with gender and with whose stories we believe
 seventy five percent of autoimmune disease patients are women  and in some diseases it 's as high as ninety percent 
 even though these diseases disproportionately affect women they are not women 's diseases me affects children and me affects millions of men
 as one patient told me we get it coming and going if you 're a woman you 're told you 're exaggerating your symptoms
  but if you 're a guy you 're told to be strong to buck up 
 and men may even have a more difficult time getting diagnosed 
 my brain
  is not what it used 
 here 's the good part  despite everything i still have
  so many diseases were once thought of as psychological until science uncovered their biological mechanisms 
 patients with epilepsy could be forcibly institutionalized until the eeg was able to measure abnormal electrical activity in the brain 
 multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed as hysterical paralysis until the cat scan and the mri discovered brain lesions  
 and recently we used to think that stomach ulcers were just caused by stress
 until we discovered that h pylori was the culprit me has never benefited from the kind of science
 that other diseases have had but that 's starting to change 
 in germany scientists are starting to find evidence of autoimmunity and in japan of brain inflammation 
 in the us scientists at stanford are finding abnormalities in energy metabolism that are
  sixteen standard deviations away from normal  
 and in norway  researchers are running a phase 3 clinical trial on a cancer drug that in some patients causes complete remission 
 what also gives me hope
 is the resilience of patients online we came
  and we shared our stories 
 we devoured what research there was we experimented on ourselves  
 we became our own scientists and our own doctors because we had to be 
 and slowly i added five percent here five percent there until eventually on a good day i was able to leave my home  
 i still had to make ridiculous choices  will i sit in the garden for fifteen minutes or will i wash
  my hair today  but it gave me hope that i could be treated  i had a sick body that was all 
 and with the right kind of help  maybe one day i could get better 
 i came together with patients around the world  and we started to fight  
 we have filled the void with something wonderful  but it is not enough
  i still don 't know if i will ever be able to run again 
 or walk at any distance or do any of those kinetic things that i now only get to do in my dreams  
 but i am so grateful for how far i have come 
 progress is slow  and it is up
 and it is
  but i am getting a little better each day 
 i remember what it was like when i was stuck in that bedroom  when it had been months since i had seen the sun  
 i thought that i would die there  
 but here i am today with you and that is a miracle
  i don 't know what would have happened had i not been one of the lucky ones had i gotten sick before the internet had i not found my community  
 i probably would have already taken my own life  as so many others have done 
 how many lives could we have saved  decades ago  if we had asked the right questions  
 how many lives could we save today
 if we decide to make a real start
  start 
 even once the true cause of my disease is discovered 
 if we don 't change our institutions and our culture  we will do this again to another disease  
 living with this illness has taught me that science and medicine are profoundly human endeavors 
 doctors scientists and policy makers are not immune to the same biases
 that affect
  all of us 
 we need to think in more nuanced ways about women 's health 
 our immune systems are just as much a battleground for equality as the rest of our bodies we need to listen to patients ' stories  
 and we need to be willing to say i don 't know 
 i don 't know is a beautiful thing i don 't know is where discovery
  starts  
 and if we can do that 
 if we can approach the great vastness of all that we do not know  and then rather than fear uncertainty  maybe we can greet it with a sense of wonder  thank you
