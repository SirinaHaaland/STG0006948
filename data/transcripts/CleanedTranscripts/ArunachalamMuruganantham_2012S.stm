  i tried to do a small good thing for my wife it makes me to stand here 
 the fame the money i got out of it  so what i did  i 'd gone back to my early marriage
  the early marriage days  you tried to impress your wife  i did the same on that occasion  i found my wife carrying something like this i saw
 what is that i asked my wife replied none of your business 
 then being her husband i ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth  i don 't even use that cloth to clean my two wheeler then
 i understood this adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days then i immediately asked her why are
  method  she replied  i also know about [ sanitary pads ] but myself and my sisters  if they start using that we have to cut our family milk budget  
 then i was shocked what is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget and it 's called affordability
 i tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads i went to a local shop 
  tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet that fellow looks left and right and spreads a newspaper rolls it into the newspaper gives it to me like a banned item something like
 that i don 't know why i did not ask for a condom
  then i took that pad  i want to see that  what is inside it the very first time at the age of
  white substance made of cotton oh my god that guy is just using a
 penny value of raw material inside they are selling for pounds
 dollars why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife that 's how all this started  but after making a sanitary
  even in bangalore you won 't get [ one ] in india  so only problem the only available victim is my wife
 then i made a sanitary pad and handed it to shanti my wife 's name is shanti close your eyes whatever i give it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond
  you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it close your eyes because
 i tried to make it intimate because it 's an arranged marriage  not a love marriage 
 so one day she said openly i 'm not going to support this research  then other victims they got into my sisters  
 but even sisters wives they 're not ready to support in the research  
  lot of women volunteers
 then i used tried to use the medical college girls  they also refused finally i decide use sanitary pad myself  
 now i am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon
  armstrong  then tenzing [ and ] hillary in everest like that muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the
 globe i wore a sanitary pad  i filled animal blood in a football bottle  i tied it up here  there is a tube going into my panties  while i 'm walking  while i 'm cycling
  me to give full respect  that five days i 'll never forget the messy days the lousy days  that wetness my god  it 's unbelievable 
 but here the problem is 
 one company is making napkin out of cotton it is working well  
 but i am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton it 's not working that makes me to want to refuse to continue this research
  you need first funds not only financial crises but because of the sanitary pad research  i come through all sorts of problems  
 including a divorce notice from my wife 
 why is this i used medical college girls she suspects i am using as a trump card
 to run behind medical college girls  finally i came to know it is a special cellulose
 derived from a pinewood
  even after that you need a multimillion dollar plant like this to process that material  again a stop up 
 then i spend another four years to create my own machine tools a simple machine tool like this 
 in this machine any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant 
 anyone can make a world class napkin at your dining hall  
 that is my invention
  so after that what i did 
 usually if anyone got a patent or an invention immediately you want to make convert into this  i never did this
 i dropped it just like this  because you do this if anyone runs after money  their life will not [ have ] any beauty  it is boredom
  lot of people making a lot of money billion billions of dollars accumulating why are they coming for finally for philanthropy  
 why the need for accumulating money then doing philanthropy what if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one  that 's why
 i am giving this machine only in rural india for rural women because in india [ you 'll be ] surprised only two percent of women are using sanitary pads the rest
  that 's why i am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across india  so far six hundred and thirty installations happened in twenty three states
 in six other countries  now
 i 'm on my seventh year sustaining against multinational transnational giants makes
  mba students a question mark a school dropout from coimbatore how he is able to sustaining that makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all iims
  then we have to cut our family milk budget
 investment for machine and all now any rural woman can they are performing
  i make a rural woman to compete with multinationals  i 'm sustaining on seventh year  already six hundred installations what is my mission i 'm going to make india
  a 100 percent sanitary napkin using country in my lifetime in this way i 'm going to provide not less than a million rural
  that 's why i 'm not running after this bloody money i 'm doing something serious if you
 chase a girl the girl won 't like you do your job simply the girl will chase you like that i never chased mahalakshmi 
 mahalakshmi is chasing me i am keeping in the back pocket 
 not in front pocket i 'm a back pocket man  
 that 's all a school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad
  i am becoming a solution provider i 'm very happy i don 't want to make this as a corporate entity  i want to make this as a
 local sanitary pad movement across the globe  that 's why i put all the details
 on public domain like an open software  now one hundred and ten countries are accessing it okay 
 so i classify the people into three
  uneducated  little educated  surplus educated
  little educated  done this surplus educated  what are you going to do for the society
