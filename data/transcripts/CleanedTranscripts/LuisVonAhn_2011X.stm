  had to fill out some sort of web form where you 've been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this how many of you found it really really annoying 
 okay outstanding so i invented that or
  of the people who did it that thing is called a captcha  and the reason it is there is to make sure you the entity filling out the form are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times 
 the reason it works is because humans at least non visually impaired humans have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters whereas computer programs simply can 't do it as well yet 
 so for example in the case of ticketmaster  the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions
  two at a time 
 captchas are used all over the internet and since they 're used so often a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate  so this is an example from the yahoo registration 
  page the random characters that happened to be shown to the user were w a i t which of course spell a word but the best part is the
  captcha project is something that we did here at carnegie melllon over ten years ago and it 's been used everywhere 
 let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later which is sort of the the next evolution of captcha this is a project that we call recaptcha  
 which is something that we started here at carnegie mellon then we turned it into a startup company  and then about a year and a half
  ago google actually acquired this company  so let me tell you what this project started
 so this project started from the following realization it turns out that approximately two hundred million captchas are typed everyday by people around the world
  when i first heard this i was quite proud of myself i thought look at the impact that my research has had  
 but then i started feeling bad see here 's the thing each time you type a
  you waste ten seconds of your time  and if you multiply that by two hundred million you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about five hundred thousand hours every day typing these annoying captchas  
 so then i started feeling bad 
 and then i started thinking well of course we can 't just get rid of captchas  because the security of the web sort of depends on them  but then i started thinking is there any way
 we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity so see here 's the thing while you 're typing a captcha during those ten seconds your brain is doing something amazing
  your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do 
 so can we get you to do useful work for those ten seconds another way of putting it is is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve yet we can split into tiny 10 second chunks
  such that each time somebody solves a captcha they solve a little bit of this problem and the answer to that is yes and this is what we 're doing now  so what you may not know is that nowadays while you 're typing a captcha not only are you authenticating yourself as a human 
  to digitize books
 so let me explain how this works so there 's a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books  google has one the internet archive has one amazon now with the kindle is trying to digitize books basically the way this works is you start with an old book 
 you 've seen those things right like a book so
 you start with a book  and then you scan it 
  scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book it gives you an image for every page of the book this is an image with text for every page of the book the next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image 
 that 's using a technology called ocr for optical character recognition which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there 
 now the problem is that  ocr is not perfect especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow ocr cannot recognize a lot of the words for example
  things that were written more than fifty years ago  the computer cannot recognize about thirty percent of the words  so what we 're doing now is we 're taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize
 and we 're getting people to read them for us while they 're typing a captcha on the internet so the next time you type a captcha these words that you 're typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize
  the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because you see one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book  it didn 't know what it was and it 's going to present it to you but since it doesn 't know the answer for it  it cannot grade it for you 
 so what we do is we give you another word one for which the system does know the answer
 we don 't tell you which one 's which and we say please type both  
 and if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer  it assumes you are human and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly  
 and if we repeat this process to like ten different people and all
  them agree on what the new word is then we get one more word digitized accurately  
 so this is how the system works and basically since we released it about three or four years ago a lot of websites have started switching from
 the old captcha where people wasted their time to the new captcha where people are helping to digitize books  so for example  ticketmaster so every time you buy tickets on ticketmaster  you help to digitize a book
  facebook every time you add a friend or poke somebody you help to digitize a book  twitter and about three hundred and fifty thousand
  other sites are all using recaptcha  and in fact the number of sites that are using recaptcha is so high that the number of words that we 're digitizing per day is really really large it 's about one hundred million a day  which is the equivalent
  of about two and a half million books a year and this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing captchas on the internet
  we 're doing so many words per day funny things can happen and this is especially true because now we 're giving people two randomly chosen english words next to each other
 so funny things can happen  for example  we presented this word it 's the word christians there 's nothing wrong with it  but if you present it along with another randomly chosen word  bad things can happen
  showed this actually happened to be called the embassy of the kingdom of god oops 
 laughter here 's another really bad one 
 so we keep on insulting people left and right everyday  
 now of course we 're not just insulting people see here 's the thing  since we 're presenting two randomly chosen words interesting things can happen so this actually has given rise to
 a really big internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in which is called captcha art i 'm sure some of you have heard about it  here 's how it works imagine you 're using the internet and you see a captcha that you think is somewhat
  then what you 're supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it  then of course you fill out the captcha because you help us digitize a book  but then 
 first you take a screen shot and then you draw something that is related to it 
 that 's how it works  there are tens of thousands of these some of them are very cute
  and some of them like paleontological shvisle they contain snoop dogg 
 okay  so this is my favorite number of recaptcha  so this is the favorite thing that i like about this whole project 
 this is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through recaptcha  seven hundred and fifty million
  which is a little over ten percent of the world 's population has helped us digitize human knowledge  and it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda so the question that motivates my research is the following 
 if you look at humanity 's large scale achievements these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically like for example  
 building the pyramids of egypt or the panama canal or putting a man on the moon
 there is a curious fact about them
  it is that they were all done with about the same number off people it 's weird  they were all done with about one hundred thousand people 
 and the reason for that is because before the internet  
 coordinating more than one hundred thousand people let alone paying them 
 was essentially impossible  
 but now with the internet i 've just shown you a project where we 've gotten seven hundred and fifty million people to help us digitize human knowledge  so the question that motivates my research is if we can put a man on the moon with one hundred thousand what can we do
 with one hundred million so based on this question we 've had a lot of different projects that we 've been working on let me tell you about one that i 'm most excited about this is something that we 've been
  working on for the last year and a half or so it hasn 't yet been launched it 's called duolingo  since it hasn 't been launched shhhhh yeah i can trust you 'll
  so this is the project here 's how it started it started with me posing a question to my graduate student  severin hacker  okay that 's severin hacker
  so i posed the question to my graduate student by the way you did hear me correctly his last name is hacker  
 so i posed this question to him how can we get one hundred million people translating the web into every major language for free okay
 so there 's a lot of things to say about this question first of all translating
  right now the web is partitioned into multiple languages a large fraction of it is in english if you don 't know any english  you can 't access it  
 but there 's large fractions in other different languages  and if you don 't know those languages  you can 't access it  so i would like to translate all of the web  or at least most of the web into every major language so
 that 's what i would like to do  now some of you may say why can 't we use computers to translate  why can 't we use machine translation machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there why can 't we use it to translate the whole web  well the problem with that is that it
  's not yet good enough and it probably won 't be for the next fifteen to twenty years it makes a lot of mistakes  even when it doesn 't make a mistake  since it makes so many mistakes you don 't know whether to trust it or not 
 so let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine actually it was a forum post it was somebody who was trying to ask a question about javascript  it was translated from japanese
  'll just let you read this person starts apologizing for the fact that it 's
 translated with a computer  so the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question so he 's just explaining something  remember it 's a question about javascript
  and then comes the ending which is my favorite part of the whole thing
  we need people to translate the whole web  so now the next question you may have is well why can 't we just pay people to do this we could pay professional language translators to translate the whole web  
 we could do that
  unfortunately it would be extremely expensive for example  translating a tiny tiny fraction of the whole web  wikipedia into one other language  spanish
  wikipedia exists in spanish  but it 's very small compared to the size of english it 's about twenty percent of the size of english
  we wanted to translate the other eighty percent
 into spanish  it would cost at least fifty million dollars and this is at even the most exploited outsourcing country out there so it
 would be very expensive so what we want to do is we want to get one hundred million people translating the web into every major language for free 
  now if this is what you want to do you pretty quickly realize you 're going to run into two pretty big
  the first one is a lack of bilinguals so
 i don 't even know if there exists one hundred million people out there using the web who are bilingual enough to help us translate
 that 's a big problem the other problem you 're going to run into is a lack of motivation 
 how are we going to motivate people to actually translate the web for free  normally you have to pay people to do this  so how are we going to motivate them to do it for free  
 now when we were starting to think about this we were blocked by these two things but then we realized there 's actually a way to
  solve both these problems with the same solution there 's a way to kill two birds with one stone 
 and that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do  
 and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals  and that is language education 
 so it turns out that today there are over one point two billion people learning a foreign language  
 people really really want to learn a foreign language and it 's not just because they 're being
  forced to do so in school for example in the united states alone there are over five million people who have paid over $ five hundred for software to learn a new language so people really really want to learn a new language  so 
  what we 've been working on for the last year and a half is a new website it 's called duolingo where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the web  
  we give you very very simple sentences there 's of course a lot of very simple sentences on the web  we give you very very simple sentences along with what each word means
 and as you translate them and as you see how other people translate them you start learning the language and as you as you get more and more advanced we give you more and more complex sentences to translate but at all times you 're learning by doing 
 now the crazy thing about this
  method is that it actually really works
 first of all people are really really learning a language we 're mostly done building it and now we 're testing it people really can learn a language with it 
 and they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software so people really do learn a language and not only do they learn it as well  but actually it 's way more interesting because you see with duolingo people 
  are actually learning with real content as opposed to learning with made up sentences people are learning with real content which is inherently interesting
  so people really do learn a language but perhaps more surprisingly the translations that we get from people using the site  even though they 're just beginners 
 the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators  which is very surprising so let me show you one example  this is a sentence that was translated from german into english  the top is 
  the german the middle is an english translation that was done by somebody who was a professional english translator who we paid twenty cents a word for this translation and the bottom is a translation by users of duolingo
  of whom knew any german before they started using the site you
 can see it 's pretty much perfect  
 now of course we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators we combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator
 now even though we 're combining
 the translations
  the site actually can translate pretty fast  so let me show you this is our estimates of how fast we could translate wikipedia from english into spanish  
 remember this is fifty million dollars worth of value
 so if we wanted to translate wikipedia into spanish  we could do it in five weeks with one hundred thousand active users  
 and we could do it in about eighty hours with a million active users since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users we 're hopeful that we 'll be able to translate extremely fast
  the thing that i 'm most excited about with duolingo is i think this provides a fair business model for language education  
 so here 's the thing the current business model for language education is the student pays 
 and in particular the student pays rosetta stone five hundred dollars that 's
 the current business model the problem with this business model is that ninety five percent of the world 's population doesn 't have five hundred dollars  so
 's extremely unfair towards the poor this is totally biased towards the rich now see in duolingo  because while you learn you 're actually creating value 
 you 're translating stuff which for example we could charge somebody for translations  so this is how we could monetize this
  since people are creating value while they 're learning they don 't have to pay their money they pay with their time but the magical thing here is that they 're paying with their time but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language
 so the nice thing about duolingo is i think
  it provides a fair business model one that doesn 't discriminate against poor people so here 's the site thank you applause
 so here 's the site we haven 't yet launched
  but if you go there  you can sign up to be part of our private beta which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks we haven 't yet launched this duolingo by the way
  talking here but actually duolingo is the work of a really awesome team some of whom are here so thank you
