  cities are the crucible of civilization 
 they have been expanding  urbanization has been expanding at an exponential rate in the last two hundred years so that by the second part of this century the planet will be completely dominated by cities
  cities are the origins of global warming  impact on the environment  health pollution disease  
 finance economies 
 energy they 're all problems that are confronted by having cities  that 's where all these problems come from and the tsunami of problems that we feel we 're facing in terms of sustainability questions
  are actually a reflection of the exponential increase in urbanization across the planet 
 here 's some numbers 
 two hundred years ago the united states was less than a few percent urbanized  it 's now more than eighty two percent 
 the planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago  china 's building three hundred new cities in the next twenty years now listen to this  every week for the
  foreseeable future until two thousand and fifty  every week more than a million people
 are being added to our cities  
 this is going to affect everything everybody in this room if you stay alive is going to be affected by what 's happening in cities in this extraordinary phenomenon  
 however cities  
  negative aspect to them 
 are also the solution because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets that have sucked up creative people creating ideas innovation wealth and so on 
 so we have this kind of dual nature  and so there 's an urgent need for
 a scientific theory of cities now these
  my comrades in arms 
 this work has been done with an extraordinary group of people  and they 've done all the work  and i 'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together 
 so here 's the problem  this is what we all want the ten billion people on the planet in two thousand and fifty want to live in places like this  
 having things like this  doing things like this  with economies that are growing like
  not realizing that entropy produces things like this this  this
 and this and the question is 
 is that what edinburgh and london and new york are going to look like in two thousand and fifty or is it going to be this  that 's the question 
 i must say many of the indicators look like this is what it 's going to look like  but let 's talk about
  my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities and scientific theory means quantifiable relying on underlying generic 
  principles that can be made into a predictive framework  that 's the quest is that conceivable 
  cities part of biology is london a great big whale  is edinburgh a horse  
 is microsoft a great big anthill what do we learn from that we use them metaphorically the dna of a company the
 metabolism of a city and so on is that just bullshit  metaphorical bullshit or is there serious substance to it and if that is the case 
 how come that it 's very hard to kill a city you
  drop an atom bomb on a city  and thirty years later it 's surviving very few cities
 fail all companies die all companies and if you have a serious theory you should be able to predict when google is going to go bust   
 so is that just another version of this  
 well we understand this very well that is you ask any generic question about this how many trees of a given size
  size how many branches of a given size does a tree have how many leaves what is the energy flowing through each branch  what is the size of the canopy what is its growth what is its mortality 
 we have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions and the idea is can we do the same for
  so the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life is that it is scalable it works over an extraordinary range this is just a tiny range actually it 's us mammals we 're one of these 
 the same principles the same dynamics the same organization is at work in all of these including us  and it can scale over a range of one hundred million in size and that is
 one of the main reasons life is
  resilient and robust
 scalability  we 're going to discuss that in a moment more but you know at a local level  you scale everybody in this room is scaled that 's called growth
 here 's how you grew 
 rat  that 's a rat could have been you we 're all pretty much the same  
 and you see you 're very familiar with this you grow very quickly and then you stop and that line there
 is a prediction from the same theory based on the same principles that describes that forest  
 and here it is for the growth of a rat and those points on there are data points  this is just the weight versus the age  
 and you see it stops growing very very good for biology also one of the reasons for its great resilience 
 very very bad for economies and companies and cities in our present paradigm 
  is what we believe  this is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us 
 particularly illustrated in that left hand corner  hockey sticks this is a bunch of software companies
 and what it is is their revenue versus their age all zooming away and everybody making millions and billions of dollars  okay  so
 how do we understand this so let 's first talk about biology this is
  explicitly showing you how things scale and this is a truly remarkable graph what is plotted here is metabolic rate
 how much energy you need per day to stay alive versus
 your weight your mass for all of us bunch of organisms 
 and it 's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of ten otherwise you couldn 't get everything on the graph  and what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way
  way is that everybody lies on the same line  despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe 
 there 's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this it 's particularly
 astonishing because each one of these organisms each subsystem each cell type each
  has evolved in its own unique environmental niche with its own unique history  
 and yet despite all of that darwinian evolution and natural selection  they 've been constrained to lie on a line  something else is going on 
 before i talk about that i 've written down at the bottom there the slope of this curve this straight line it 's three quarters roughly  
 which is less than one and we call that sublinear and here 's the point of that it says that
  that if it were linear the
 steepest slope then doubling the size you would require double the amount of energy  
 but it 's sublinear  and what that translates into is that if you double the size of the organism  you actually only need seventy five percent more energy so a wonderful thing about all of biology 
 is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale the bigger you are systematically according to very
  rules less energy per capita now
 any physiological variable you can think of any life history event you can think of if you plot it this way  looks like this  
 there is an extraordinary regularity so you tell me the size of a mammal i can tell you at the ninety percent level everything about it in terms of its physiology
  and the reason for this is because of networks all of life
 is controlled by networks from the intracellular through the multicellular through the ecosystem level  and you 're very familiar with these networks  
 that 's a little thing that lives inside an elephant  and here 's the summary of what i 'm saying 
 if you take those networks  this idea of networks and you apply universal principles
  principles all of these scalings and all of these constraints
 follow  including the description of the forest the description of your circulatory system 
 the description within cells one of the things i did not stress in that introduction was that  systematically the pace of life decreases as you get bigger  
 heart rates are slower  you live longer  diffusion of oxygen and resources across
  membranes is slower etc the question is is any of this true for cities and companies  
 so is london a scaled up birmingham which is a scaled up brighton  etc etc 
 is new york a scaled up san francisco which is a scaled up santa fe  don 't know we will discuss that  but they are networks 
 and the most important network of cities is you
  cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions our interactions and the clustering and grouping of individuals 
 here 's just a symbolic picture of that  
 and here 's scaling of cities  
 this shows that in this very simple example which happens to be a mundane example of number of petrol stations as a function of size plotted in the same way as the biology you see exactly the
  same kind of thing there is a scaling that is that the
 number of petrol stations in the city is now given to you when you tell me its size 
 the slope of that is less than linear  there is an economy of scale less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are not surprising  but here 's what 's
  it scales in the same way everywhere  this is just european countries  but you do it in japan or china or colombia  
 always the same with the same kind of
 economy of scale to the same degree and
 any infrastructure you look at whether it 's the length of roads length of electrical lines anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way  it 's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on
 but even more surprising
 is if you look at socio economic quantities quantities that have no analog in biology that have evolved when we started forming communities eight to ten thousand years ago  
 the top one is wages as a function of size plotted in the same way and the bottom one is you lot
 plotted in the same way  and what you see is a scaling phenomenon
  but most important in this 
 the exponent the analog to that three quarters for the metabolic rate is bigger than one it 's about one point one five to one point two 
 here it is  which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita  unlike biology higher wages more super creative people per capita as you get bigger
  more patents per capita more crime per capita and we 've looked at everything more aids cases flu  etc  
 and here they 're all plotted together just to show you what we plotted here is
 income gdp gdp of the city
 crime and patents all on one graph and you can see they all follow the same line  and here 's the statement if you double the size of a city from one hundred thousand to two hundred thousand from a million to two million ten to twenty million
  then systematically you get a fifteen percent increase in wages  wealth number of aids cases number of police  
 anything you can think of 
 it goes up by fifteen percent  and you have a fifteen percent savings
 on
 the infrastructure this  no doubt is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities because they think
 they think that all those wonderful things like creative people  wealth income is what attracts them forgetting about the ugly and the bad 
 what is the reason for this  well i don 't have time to tell you about all the mathematics but underlying this
 is the social networks because this is a universal phenomenon  this fifteen percent rule
 is true no matter where you
  on the planet japan 
 chile  portugal 
 scotland  doesn 't matter  always all the data shows it 's the same despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently  something universal is going on 
 the universality to repeat  is us that we are the city  and it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions so there it is
  it is those networks and their mathematical structure unlike biology which had sublinear scaling economies of scale  
 you had the slowing of the pace of life as you get bigger  if it 's social networks with super linear scaling more per capita
 then the theory says that you increase the pace of life the bigger you
  life gets faster on the left is the heart rate showing biology on the right is the speed of walking in a bunch of european cities  showing that increase
  lastly i want to talk about growth  
 this is what we had in biology just to repeat  economies of scale
 gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior  you grow fast and then stop part of our
  that would be bad for economies and cities and indeed one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation then 
  indeed you get from the same theory a beautiful rising exponential curve lovely and in fact if you compare it to data it fits very well with the development of cities and economies  but it has a terrible catch  and the catch is that
  destined to collapse for many reasons kind of malthusian reasons that you run out of resources and how do you avoid that  well we 've done it before what we do is 
 as we grow and we approach the collapse a major innovation takes place
 and we start over again  and we start over again as we approach the next one and so on so there 's this continuous cycle of innovation that is necessary in order to sustain
  growth and avoid collapse 
 the catch  however to this is that you have to innovate faster and faster and faster  
 so the image is that we 're not only on a treadmill that 's going faster  but we have to change the treadmill
 faster and faster we have to accelerate on a continuous basis
  avoid a heart attack  
 so lastly i 'm going to finish up in this last minute or two asking about companies
 see companies  they scale  the top one in fact is walmart on the right it 's the same plot  this happens to be income and assets versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees we could use sales  
 anything you like there it is after some little fluctuations at the beginning 
 when companies are innovating
  scale beautifully  and we 've looked at twenty three thousand companies in the united states  may i say  and i 'm only showing you a little bit of this  
 what is astonishing about companies is that they scale sublinearly like biology  indicating that they 're dominated not by
 economies of scale in that interpretation by bureaucracy and administration  and they do it beautifully may i say  so if you tell me the size of some company some small company  i could have predicted the size of walmart 
 if it has this sublinear scaling the theory says we should have
 sigmoidal growth there 's walmart  doesn 't look very sigmoidal that 's what we like hockey sticks  
 but you notice i 've cheated because i 've only gone up to ' ninety four let 's go up to two thousand and eight that red line is from the theory  so if i 'd have done this in 
 i could have predicted what walmart would be now and then this is repeated across the entire spectrum of companies there they
  they all start looking like hockey sticks they all bend over and they all die like you and me thank you
