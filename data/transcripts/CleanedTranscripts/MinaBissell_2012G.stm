  i don 't usually like cartoons i don 't think many of them are funny i find them weird  
 but i love this cartoon from the new yorker
  think outside the box  
 well i 'm afraid i used to be the cat i always wanted to be outside the box and it 's partly because
 i came to this field from a different background chemist and a bacterial geneticist so what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer sources of cancer
  for that matter why you are who you are didn 't make sense so let me quickly try and tell you why i thought that and how i went about it 
 so to begin with  however  i have to give you a very very quick lesson in developmental biology 
 with apologies to those of you who know some biology 
 so when your mom and dad met
 there is a fertilized egg that round thing with that little blip 
 it grows and then it grows and then it makes this handsome man 
 so  this guy with all the cells in his body 
 all have the same genetic information  so how did his nose
  become his nose his elbow his elbow and why doesn 't he get up one morning and have his nose turn into his foot  
 it could  it has the genetic information you all remember dolly it came from a single mammary cell so why doesn 't it do it 
 so have a guess of how many cells he has in his body
 trillion to seventy trillion cells in his body trillion now
 how did these cells all with the same genetic material make all those tissues  
 and so the question i raised before becomes even more interesting if you thought about the enormity of this in every one of your bodies
 the dominant cancer theory would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cancer cell and it would make you
 a cancer victim  
 well this did not make sense to me do you even know how a trillion looks now let 's look at
  got cancer you will be a lump of cancer  you will have cancer all over you and you 're not why not  
 so i decided over the years because of a series of experiments that this is because of context
 and architecture 
 and let me quickly tell you some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this 
 to begin with i came to work with this virus that causes that ugly tumor in the chicken  
 rous discovered this in one thousand nine hundred and eleven it was the first
  he made a filtrate he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter 
 and he injected it to another chicken  and he got another tumor  
 so scientists were very excited and they said a single oncogene can do it all you need is
  put the cells in cultures chicken cells dumped the virus on it and it would pile up and they would say this is malignant and this is normal and again this didn 't make sense to me 
 so for various reasons  we took this oncogene  attached it to a blue marker  
 and we injected it into the embryos now look at that there is that beautiful feather in the embryo
  every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell  and they 're part of the feather 
 so when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish  we got a mass of blue cells so in the chicken you get a tumor in the embryo you don 't you dissociate you put it in a dish  you get another tumor  
 what does that mean 
  means that microenvironment
 and the context which surrounds those cells
 actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do 
 now  let 's take a normal example  the normal example let 's take the human mammary gland i work on breast cancer so
 here is a lovely human breast and many of you know how it looks except that inside that breast  there are all these pretty
  developing tree like structures 
 so we decided that what we like to do is take just a bit of that mammary gland which is called an acinus where there are all these little things
  inside the breast where the milk goes and the end of the nipple comes through that little tube when the baby sucks  and we said wonderful look at this pretty structure
  want to make this a structure and ask the question how do the cells do that so we took the red cells you see the red cells are surrounded by blue 
 other cells that squeeze them and behind it is material that people thought was mainly inert  and it was just having a structure to keep
 and so we first photographed it with the electron microscope years and years ago  
 and you see this cell is actually quite pretty  it has a bottom it has a top  it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk because it just came from an 
 early pregnant mouse  you take these cells you put them in a dish  and within three days they look like that 
  you take them out  you put them in a dish  they don 't make milk  they completely forget 
 for example here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk on the left there is nothing on the right look at the nuclei the nuclei in the 
  cell on the left is in the animal  the one on the right is in a dish  they are completely different from each other 
 overrides in different contexts cells do different things but how does context signal  
 so einstein said that for an idea
 that does not first seem insane there is no hope so you can imagine the amount of
 skepticism i received couldn 't get money
  couldn 't do a whole lot of other things but i 'm so glad it all worked out so we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse  and all those lovely acini are 
  there every one of those with the red around them are an acinus and we said okay  we are going to try and make this  and i said
  that red stuff
 around the acinus that people think there 's just a structural scaffold maybe it has information  maybe it tells the cells what to do maybe it tells the
  nucleus what to do so i said extracellular matrix which is this stuff called ecm  signals and actually tells the cells what to do 
  extracellular matrix in it we put the cells in it and lo and behold in about four days they got reorganized and on the right is what we can make in culture 
 on the left is what 's inside the animal we call it in vivo and the one in culture was full of milk the lovely red there is full of milk so we got milk for the american audience 
 all right
  and here is this beautiful human cell  and you can imagine that here also  context goes 
 so what do we do now  i made a radical hypothesis  i said if it 's true that
 architecture is dominant architecture
 restored to a cancer cell
 should make the cancer cell think it 's normal could this be done so we tried it 
 in order to do that however  we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant 
 and on the left is the single normal cell human breast put
  gooey gel that has extracellular matrix it makes all these beautiful structures  on the right you see it looks very ugly the cells continue to grow the normal ones 
 stop  and you see here in higher magnification the normal acinus and the ugly tumor 
  messed up and make them to the level of the normal  
 well  it was wonderful boggles my mind this is what we got we can revert
 the malignant phenotype 
 and in order to show you that the malignant phenotype i
  just choose one here are little movies sort of fuzzy  but you see that on the left are the malignant cells all of them are malignant we add one single inhibitor
 in the beginning  and look what happens they all look like that we inject them into the mouse the ones on the right  and none of them would make tumors  we inject the other ones in the
  new way of thinking about cancer it 's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer  we should be able to be dealing with these things at this level 
 and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and 
  that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix
 and function
 interact dynamically and reciprocally  
 and here is another five seconds of repose is my mantra 
 form and function  
 and of course we now ask where do we go now we 'd like to take this kind of thinking
  but before we do that i 'd like you to think
 that at any given time when you 're sitting there 
 in your seventy trillion cells the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix
 and this is how your balance is kept and restored  we have made a lot of discoveries we have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin  we have
  shown that there 's little pieces of dna on the specific genes of the mammary gland that actually respond to extracellular matrix it has taken many years but it has been very rewarding  
 and before i get to the next slide  i have to tell you that there are so many additional discoveries to be made 
 there is so much mystery we don 't
  know  and i always say to the students and post docs i lecture to don 't be arrogant 
 because arrogance kills curiosity curiosity and passion 
 you need to always think what else needs to be discovered and maybe my discovery needs to be added to or maybe it needs to be changed  
 so we have now made an amazing discovery
 post doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me what do the cells do when you put them in what do they do in the beginning when they they do i said i don 't know we couldn 't look at them we didn 't 
 have high images in the old days  so she being an imager and a physicist did this incredible thing this is a single human breast cell
 you put the cancer cells there  and they do go all over they do this they don 't do this and when we revert the cancer cell it again does this absolutely boggles my mind  
 so the cell acts like an embryo what an exciting thing  so i 'd like to
  i used to love english literature and i debated in college which one should i do and
 unfortunately or fortunately chemistry won  but here is a poem from yeats i 'll just read you the last two lines  
 it 's called among the school children o body swayed to music  o brightening glance how [ can
  the dancer from the dance and here is merce cunningham i was fortunate to dance with him when i was younger  
 and here he is a dancer and while he is dancing he is both the dancer and the dance  the minute he stops we have neither 
 so it 's like form and function  
 now i 'd like to show you a current picture of my group  i have been fortunate to have had these magnificant
  students and post docs who have taught me so much  and i have had many of these groups come and go they are the future and i try to make them
 not be afraid of being the cat and being told don 't think outside the box  
 and i 'd like to leave you with this thought on the left
 is water coming through the shore taken from a nasa satellite
 on the right  there is a coral now  if you take the mammary gland and spread it and take the fat away on a dish
 it looks like that do they look the same do they have the same patterns  why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again and i
 'd like to submit to
  you that we have sequenced the human genome we know everything about the sequence of the gene the language of the gene the alphabet of the gene 
 but we know nothing  but nothing  
 about the language and alphabet of form 
 so it 's a wonderful new horizon 
 it 's a wonderful thing to discover for the young and the passionate old and that 's me
