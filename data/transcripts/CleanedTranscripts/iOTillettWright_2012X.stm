  human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other
 is that person dangerous 
 are they attractive are they a potential mate are they a potential networking opportunity  we do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them 
 what 's your name where are you from
  old are you what do you do 
 then we get more personal with it have you ever had any diseases 
 have you ever been divorced does your breath smell bad while you 're answering my interrogation right now what are you into who are you into what gender do you like to sleep with 
 i get it 
 we are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves we
  start forming cliques as soon as we 're old enough to know what acceptance feels like 
 we bond together based on anything that we can music preference race  gender the block that we grew up on 
 we seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices
  sometimes though just the
  what do you do can feel like somebody 's opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it because
 the categories  i 've found are too limiting the boxes are too narrow  and this can get really dangerous  
 so here 's a disclaimer about me though before we get too deep into this i grew up in a very sheltered environment 
 i was
 raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s two blocks from the epicenter of punk music  
 i was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of
 a religiously based upbringing  where i come from if you weren 't a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind you were the weirdo 
 laughter it was an unorthodox upbringing  but as a kid on the streets of new york you learn how to trust your own instincts you learn how to go with your own ideas
  so when i was six i decided that i wanted to be a boy  
 i went to school one day and the kids wouldn 't let me play basketball with them they said they wouldn 't let girls play so i went home and i shaved my head and i came back the next day and i said i 'm a boy 
 i mean who knows right when you 're six maybe you can do that 
 i didn 't want anyone to know that i was a girl and they didn 't i kept up the charade for eight years  so
  this is me when i was eleven  i was playing a kid named walter in a movie called julian po 
 i was a little street tough that followed christian slater around and badgered him see i was also a child actor which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity because
 no one knew that i was actually a girl really playing a boy 
 in fact no one in my life knew that i was a girl not my teachers at
  my friends not the directors that i worked with 
 kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an adam 's apple or grab my my crotch to check what i was working with  
 when i would go to the bathroom i would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like i was peeing standing up 
 at sleepovers i would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn 't want to kiss me without outing myself it
 's worth mentioning though that i didn 't hate my body or my genitalia  i didn 't feel like i was in the wrong body
  like i was performing this elaborate act i wouldn 't have qualified as transgender 
 if my family though had been the kind of people to believe in therapy they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty 
 but in my particular case i just woke up one day when i was fourteen and i decided that i wanted to be a girl again  
 puberty had hit  and i had no idea what being a girl meant  and i was ready to figure out who i actually was
  when a kid behaves like i did they don 't exactly have to come out right no one is exactly shocked 
 but i wasn 't asked to define myself by my parents when i was fifteen and i called my father to tell him that i had fallen in love  
 it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl
 three years later when i fell in love with a man  neither of my parents batted an eyelash either  
 see it 's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that i wasn 't ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point i was just allowed to be me  growing and changing in every moment 
 so four almost five years ago  proposition eight the great
 marriage equality debate was raising a lot of dust around this country
 and
 at the time getting married wasn 't really something i spent a lot of time thinking about but i was struck by the fact that america a country with such a tarnished civil rights record could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly  
 and i remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that
 the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country  between places where people believed in it and places where people
  and then 
 that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me 
 if this was a war with two disparate sides i by default fell on team gay because i certainly wasn 't one hundred percent straight  
 at the time
 i was just beginning to emerge from this eight year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being
  this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl 's clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy 
 to finally just a hesitant exploration of what i actually was a tomboyish girl
 who liked both boys and girls depending on the person i had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls much like myself who fell kind of
  girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear girls who had boys ' haircuts but wore girly nail polish 
 girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything  
 i loved these people and i admired their freedom but i watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where
 pundits
  started likening our love to bestiality on national television and this powerful awareness rolled in over me that
 i was a minority  and in my own home country  based on one facet of my character  i was legally and indisputably
 a second class citizen  
 i was not an activist i wave no flags in my own life  but i
  plagued by this question how could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that i knew
 based on one element of their character 
 how could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else were we even a group what group  
 and had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination
  they know who they were voting against and what the impact was 
 and then it occurred to me  perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second class citizenship
 it might make it harder for them to do it might give them pause  
 obviously i couldn 't get twenty million people to the same dinner party so
 i figured out a way where i could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice without any lighting or without any
  manipulation of any kind on my part  because in a photograph you can examine a lion 's whiskers without
 the fear of him ripping your face off 
 for me photography is not just about exposing film 
 it 's about exposing the viewer to something new a place they haven 't gone before but most importantly to people that they might be afraid of 
 life magazine introduced generations of people to distant far off cultures they never knew existed through pictures
 so i decided to make
 a series of very simple portraits  mugshots if you will and
 i basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not one hundred percent straight  
 which if you don 't know is a limitless number of people 
 so this was a very large undertaking and to do it we needed some help  so i ran
  out in the freezing cold and i photographed every single person that i knew that i could get to in february of about two years ago  and
 i took those photographs and i went to the hrc and i asked them for some help  and they funded two weeks of shooting in new york  and then we made this
  self evident truths is a photographic
  record of lgbtq america today 
 my aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who 's anything other than one hundred percent straight or feels like they fall in the lgbtq spectrum in any way 
 my goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face 
  that all men are created equal it 's written in the declaration of independence  we are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded there is no equality in the united
  i 've heard hundreds of people give the same answer we are all responsible for equality 
 so far we 've shot three hundred faces in new york city  and we wouldn 't have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the human rights campaign
  i want to take the project across the country  i want to visit
  this is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation  i challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human
  absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after
 that almost eighty five thousand people watched that video and then they started emailing us from all over the country asking us
 to come to their towns and help them to show their faces 
 and a lot more people wanted to show their faces than i had anticipated  so i changed my immediate goal to ten thousand faces
 that video was made in the spring of two thousand and eleven  and as of today i have traveled to almost twenty cities and photographed almost two thousand people 
 i know that this is a talk  but
 i 'd like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that i can say that will add to them  because if a picture is worth a thousand words
  of a face needs a whole new vocabulary 
  we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on  visibility really is key  familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst 
  your own family you 're far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it 
  i met people who
 legally divorced their children for being other than straight but i also met people who were southern baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian  
 sparking empathy had become the backbone of self evident truths but
 here 's what i was starting to learn that was really interesting  self evident truths doesn 't erase the differences between us in fact on the contrary  it highlights
  them  it presents not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings  but the complexities found within each individual person 
 it wasn 't that we had too many boxes it was that we had too few
 at some point i realized that my mission to photograph
  inherently flawed because there were a million different shades of gay 
 here i was trying to help  and i had perpetuated the very thing i had spent my life trying to avoid yet another box 
 at some point i added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to one hundred percent gay  
 and i watched so many existential crises unfold in front of
 people didn 't know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before can you quantify your openness  
 once they got over the shock though  by and large people opted for somewhere between seventy to ninety five percent or the three to twenty percent marks 
 of course there were lots of people who opted for a one hundred percent one or the other but i found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced
 i found that most people fall on a spectrum of what i have come to refer to as grey let me be clear though
 and this is very important in no way am i saying that preference doesn 't exist  
 and i am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative  
  any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice i invite you to go out and try to be grey i 'll take your picture just for trying 
 what i am saying though is that human beings are not 
 the most important thing to take from the percentage system is this if you have gay people over here
 and you have straight people over here
  and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another 
 there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between 
 and the reality that this presents is a complicated one because for example if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior where exactly do you draw the line 
 is it over here by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far or is it over here
  by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far where exactly does one become a second class citizen  
 another interesting thing that i learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is 
 after traveling so much and meeting so many people let me tell you there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and democrats
  and republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the lgbt community as there are within the human race  
 aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs 
 and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle just being other than straight doesn 't necessarily mean that we have anything in common
  so
 in the endless proliferation of faces that self evident truths is always becoming 
 as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms bus shelters  billboards  facebook pages screen savers  
 perhaps in watching this procession of
  something interesting and useful will begin to happen 
 hopefully these categories these binaries these over simplified boxes will begin to become useless
 and they 'll begin to fall away  because really they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know
 and nothing that we are what we see
 are human beings in all their multiplicity  and seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity
  the very least i hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights so
 is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing 
 the right to adopt children the right to marriage the freedom to shop here live here buy here
 am i the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father your neighbor
  your cousin your uncle the president your police woman or the fireman  
 it 's too late  
 because i already am all of those things  we already are all of those things and we always have been 
 so please don 't greet us as strangers  greet us as your fellow human beings period thank you
