  great time to be a molecular biologist 
 reading and writing dna code is getting easier and cheaper  
 by the end of this year we 'll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome
 in less than a day and for less than one thousand euros
  biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest growing technology sector it has the power potentially 
 to replace our fossil fuels to revolutionize medicine and to touch every aspect of our daily lives 
 so who gets to do it 
 i think we 'd all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it
 what about that guy 
 in two thousand and nine i first heard about 
 it 's a movement that it it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone
  not just scientists and people in government labs  the idea is that if you if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate  it 
  could really stimulate innovation putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they 've got the best idea of what their needs are 
  all these associated social moral  ethical questions  
 and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we 're doing in those labs  
 so
 wouldn 't it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff do it hands on 
 i thought so so three years ago i got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded genspace
 it 's a nonprofit a community biotech lab in brooklyn new york  and the idea was people could come they could take classes
 and putter around in the lab in a very open friendly atmosphere  
 none of my previous experience prepared me for what came next can you guess
  the press started calling us  and the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy  
 the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next frankenstein 
 and as a result for the next six months when you googled my name  instead of getting my scientific papers you got this
  that we knew that all over the world  there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were 
 they were opening biohacker spaces and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did more regulations less resources  
 but now three years later here 's where we stand  
 it 's a vibrant  global community of hackerspaces  and this is just the beginning
 these are some of the biggest ones  and there are others opening every day there 's one probably going to open up in moscow one in south korea  
 and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor
 that grew out of the community they came out of let me take you on a little tour  biohackers work alone  
 we work in groups in big cities
 and in small villages  
 we reverse engineer lab equipment we genetically engineer bacteria  
 we hack hardware  software  
 wetware and of course the code of life 
 we like to build things then we like to take things apart
 we make things grow  we make things glow  
 and we make cells dance  
 the spirit of these labs it 's open it 's positive but  you know sometimes when people think of us  the first thing that comes to
  all the dark side stuff i 'm not going to minimize those concerns  
 any powerful technology is inherently dual use and you know you get something like synthetic biology  nanobiotechnology  it really compels you you have to look at both
 the amateur groups but also the professional groups because
 they have better infrastructure they have better facilities  and they have access to pathogens
  so the united nations did just that and they recently issued a report on this whole area  
 and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative  
 and they even looked specifically at the diybio community  and
 they noted not surprisingly that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics
  ethics as
 a matter of fact diy people from all over the world  america europe got together last year  and we hammered out a common code of ethics 
 that 's a lot more than conventional science has done 
 now  we follow state and local regulations  we dispose of our waste properly we follow safety procedures we don 't work with pathogens  
 if you 're working with a pathogen
 you 're not part of the biohacker community you 're part of the bioterrorist community i 'm sorry  
 and sometimes people ask me well what about an accident well 
 working with the safe organisms that we normally work with 
 the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating like some sort of superbug that 's
 literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the
  middle of the sahara desert now it could happen  but i 'm not going to plan my life around it i 've
 actually chosen to take a different kind of risk  
 i signed up for something called the personal genome project it 's a study at harvard where at the end of the study they 're going to take my entire genomic sequence all of my medical information and my identity  and they 're going to post it online for everyone to see
 there were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion the one i liked the best is someone could download my 
  sequence  go back to the lab synthesize some fake ellen dna and plant it at a crime scene
  study like that far outweighs the risk 
 now you might be asking yourself well  you know  what would i do in a biolab well it
 wasn 't that long ago we were asking well what would anyone do with a personal computer 
 so this stuff is just beginning we 're only seeing just the tip of the dna
  let me show you what you could do right now 
 a biohacker in germany a journalist 
 wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street 
 yep  you guessed it he threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs  analyzed the saliva  identified the dog and confronted the dog owner
  i discovered an invasive species in my own backyard  
 looked like a ladybug right  it actually is a japanese beetle 
 and the same kind of technology it 's called dna barcoding it 's really cool you can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga 
 if that sushi is really tuna  or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat 's 
 in a biohacker space
  you can analyze your genome for mutations  you can analyze your breakfast cereal for gmo 's and you can explore your ancestry  
 you can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere  collect microbes see what 's up there 
 you can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water  
 you can make some sort of a biofuel cell  you can do a lot of things
 you can also do an art science project some of these are really spectacular  and they look at social ecological problems from a completely different perspective it 's really cool
  all over the world
