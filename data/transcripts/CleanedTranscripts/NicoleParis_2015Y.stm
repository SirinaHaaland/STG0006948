  make some noise
  like that let me show you how we used to
  that 's when she was a little baby we would do something like this
  but a lot of people out there don 't really know what beatboxing is where it started from ec right right np where it came from so why don 't you give them a little history just a tickle a
  but beatbox started here in new york what you would have is that when we would go to parties you would have the dj and you would have the rapper  but because i don 't have electricity coming out of me we had to emulate what the beats was doing
  when when you would see the beatboxer you would see us over to the side then you would see a rapper  and when the rapper began to rap we would do a simple beat because back then the beats were simple 
 beatboxing or 
  those were simple beats but now 
 you got folks that want to do all type of stuff with their beats now  and they want to humiliate their father  which is not right when you want to humiliate the person that take care of you  pay all your tuition 
 especially when you have fifty million people that just go around and call you the loser well 
 i 'm taking that to heart but now we do something different in our house so we have these jam sessions
 and our jam sessions
  consist of us jamming in church you know
  but you know what we 're talking all about this jam session and everything
  i remember that
