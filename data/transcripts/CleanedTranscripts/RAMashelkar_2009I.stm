  the big residual is always value for money  all the time we are trying to get value for money  what we don 't look for
 is value for many while we are generating value for money
  do we care about those four billion people whose income levels are less than two dollars a day the so called bottom of the pyramid  
 what are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many we have described here
 in terms of the performance and
 the price  if you have money of course  you can get the value  you can get a mercedes for a very
  very high performance 
 but if you don 't have money  what happens well you are to ride a bicycle carrying your own weight and also some other weight so that you can earn
 the bread for the day  well poor do not remain poor they become 
 and if they do so then of course  the conditions improve  and they start riding on scooters  
  they don 't get much value because they can 't afford anything more than
 the scooter  the issue is at that price can you give them some extra value 
 a super value in terms of their ability to ride in a car to get that dignity to get that safety looks
 practically impossible isn 't it now  this is something that we see on
 indian streets
 all the time  but many people see the same
  thing and think things differently  and one of them is here  ratan tata  
 the great thing about our leaders is that 
 should they not only have passion in their belly  which practically all of them have they
 're also very innovative an innovator is one who does not know it cannot
  they believe that things can be done  but great leaders like ratan have
 compassion and what you said lakshmi is absolutely true it 's not just ratan tata it 's the house of tatas
 over time  let me confirm what she said yes i went barefoot
 until i was twelve  i
 struggled to [ unclear ] day was a huge issue and when i finished my ssc the eleventh standard i stood eleventh among one
  thousand students but i was about to leave the school because my poor mother couldn 't afford schooling and it was [ unclear ] tata trust which gave me six rupees per month 
 almost a dollar per month for six years  
 that 's how i 'm standing before you  so that is the house of tata 
 innovation  compassion and
  they combine all that and it was that compassion which bothered them because when he saw in fact he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was
 driving his own car he drives his own car by the way
 and he saw in the rain  
 a family like the one that i showed to you getting drenched with an infant  and then he said well  i must give them a car that they can afford 
 one lakh car $ two thousand car 
  as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible  and that 's what was said by suzuki he said oh 
 probably he is going to build a three wheeler with stepney and you can see the cartoon here  well they didn 't build that they built a proper car  
 nano  
 and mind you  i 'm six feet half an inch
 ratan is taller than me and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car 
 and incredible car  and of course
 nothing succeeds like success  
 the cynics then turned around  
 and one after the other they also started saying yes  we also want to make a car in the nano segment we 'll manufacture a car in the nano segment 
 how did this great
 story unfold the making of nano  let me tell you a bit about it for example
  't define the vehicle for you  but i will define the cost for you it is one lakh one hundred thousand rupees  and you are to make it within that and he told them 
 question the unquestionable  
 stretch the envelope and at a point in time he got so engrossed
 in the whole challenge  that he himself
 became a member of the team can you believe it  
 i still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated until midnight he 'd be thinking early morning he 'll be coming back with sort of solutions 
 but who was the team leader 
 the team leader was girish wagh
  in design and beyond
  broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time for example  that a  two cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a single balancer shaft 
 adhesives were replacing the rivets 
 there was a co creation a huge co creation with vendors and suppliers all ideas on board were welcome
  adjacent to the plant and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed  imagine
 that a fellow who sells cloth for example will be selling nano i mean it was incredible innovation  
 seeking solutions for
 non auto sectors it was an open innovation ideas from all over were welcome the
 mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used by the way  as well as a dashboard that was inspired by
  and lamps were as in two wheelers and
 the crux of the matter was however  getting more from less  
 all the time  you have been given an envelope  you can 't cross that envelope  which is one hundred thousand rupees two thousand dollars  
 and therefore  each component had to have a dual functionality
  the seat riser for example  serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity half the number of parts
 are contained in nano
 in comparison to a typical passenger car  
 the length is smaller by eight percent by the way  but the current entry level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less but twenty one percent more inside
  what happened
 was
 that more from less you can see how much more for how much less 
 when the model t was launched and this is by the way all the figures that are adjusted to two thousand and seven dollar prices
 model t was nineteen thousand seven hundred by ford  volkswagon was eleven thousand three hundred and thirty three 
 and british motor was around eleven thousand and nano was bang two thousand dollars
 is why you started
 actually
 a new paradigm shift  where the same people
 who could not dream of sitting in a car who were carrying their entire family in a scooter  started dreaming of being in a car and those dreams are getting fulfilled  
 this is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home
  driver 's name is naran he has bought his own nano  and you can see there is a physical space that has been created for him 
 parking that car  along with the owner 's car  but more importantly  they 've created
 a space in their mind that yes my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it and that 's why i
  it is
 not just technological  
 it is social innovation that we talk about  and that is where  ladies and gentlemen  
 this famous theme of getting more from less for more becomes important  
 i remember talking about this for the first time in australia about one and a half years ago when their academy honored me with a fellowship 
 and unbelievably in forty years i was the first
  to be honored and the title of my talk was therefore 
 indian innovation from gandhi to gandhian engineering and i titled this more from less for more and more and more people as gandhian engineering  
 and gandhian engineering in my judgment is the one which is going to take the world forward is going to make a difference not just for a
  but for everyone let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility for those unfortunates who have lost their legs  
 here is an american citizen and his
 son
 having an artificial foot  what is its price  twenty thousand dollars  and of course these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such
 perfect
 pavement or roads
  the case in india  you can see him walk barefoot on an awkward land sometimes in a marshy land and so on and so forth more importantly  they not only
 walk far to work  and not only do they cycle to work  but they cycle for work as you can see here  
 and they climb up for their work  you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions a
  four billion people their incomes are less then two dollars a day  and if you talk about a 20 000 dollar shoe  you 're talking about
 ten thousand days of income you just don 't have it and therefore  you ought to look at alternatives and that is how jaipur foot was created in india 
 it had a revolutionary prosthetic
 fitment and delivery system a quick molding and modular components
  equivalent other feet took something like a day as so on  outer socket made by using heated
  he jumps you can see what stress it must have
  to something else  i 've been talking about getting more from less for more  let 's move to health  we 've talked about mobility and the rest of it 
 let 's talk about health  what 's happening in the area of health you know you have new diseases that require new drugs  
 and if you look at the drug development ten
  years ago and now what has happened ten years ago it used to cost about a quarter billion today it costs one point five billion dollars  
 time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace after all the human and animal testing was ten years now it is fifteen years 
 are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money no i 'm sorry  
 we used to have forty now they have come down to thirty so actually we are getting less from more for less and less people why less and less people
  it is so expensive  so very few will be able to basically afford that
 let us just take an example  psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin 
 the cost of treatment twenty thousand dollars 1 000 dollar antibody injections under the skin by the way and twenty of them 
 time for development it took around ten years and seven hundred million dollars  let 's start
 in the spirit of
  more from less and more for more
 and start putting some targets  for example we don 't want twenty thousand dollars we don 't have it can we do it [ for ] one hundred dollars  
 time for development not ten years  we are in a hurry five years  
 cost of development three hundred million dollars sorry  i can 't spend more than ten million dollars  looks absolutely audacious  looks absolutely ridiculous
 you know something  this has been achieved in india
  have been achieved in india and how they have been achieved 
 sir francis bacon once said when you wish to achieve results that have not been achieved before it is an unwise fancy to think that they can be achieved by using methods that have been used before 
 and therefore the standard process where you develop a molecule put it into mice into men are
  yielding those results the billions of dollars that have been spent 
 the indian cleverness was using its traditional knowledge  however scientifically validating it and making that journey
 from men to mice to men not molecule to mice to men  you know  and that is how this difference has come and you can see
 this blending of traditional medicine modern medicine modern science i launched a big program 
  about nine years ago he is giving us not just for psoriasis for cancer and a whole range of
  changing the whole paradigm and you can see this indian psoriasis breakthrough obtained by this reverse form of [ unclear ] by doing things differently  
 you can see before treatment and after treatment  this is really getting more from less for more and more people because these are all affordable treatments now  
 let me
 just
 remind you of what mahatma gandhi had said  he had said earth provides enough to satisfy every
  man 's need  but not every man 's greed 
 so the message he was giving us was you must get more from less and less and less so that you can share it for more and more people not only the current generation  but the future generations  
 and he also said i would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all so he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people not just a few people  
 and therefore  ladies and gentlemen
  this is the theme getting more from less for more and mind you  
 it is not getting just a little more for just a little less it 's not about low cost it 's about ultra low cost  you cannot say it 's a mere treatment
 ten thousand dollars but because you are poor i 'll give it for nine thousand sorry it doesn 't work you have to give it for one hundred dollars two hundred dollars  is it possible  it has been made possible by the
  certain other different reasons so you are not talking about low cost you are talking about
 ultra low cost  you are not talking about affordability  you are talking about extreme affordability because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day
  you 're not talking exclusive innovation  you 're talking about inclusive innovation  and therefore  you 're not talking
  you 're talking about disruptive innovation the ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms 
 and i would also add it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people the whole world working for it i
 was very touched when i saw a breakthrough the other day  
 you know  incubators for infants for example they 're not available in africa  they 're not available in indian villages and infants
  giving that performance that had been created and by whom by young students from standford university on an extreme
 affordability project that they had basically 
 their heart is in the right place like ratan tata it 's not just innovation  
 compassion and passion compassion in the heart and passion in the belly that 's the new world that we want to create  and that is why the message is that of gandhian engineering
  and gentlemen i 'd like to end before time  i was also afraid of those eighteen minutes i 've still one and a half to go 
 the message  the final message is this india gave a
 great gift to the world what was that [ in the ] 20th century we gave gandhi to the world  the 21st century gift which is very very important for the whole
  whether it is global economic meltdown  whether it is climate change
 any problem that you talk about
 is gaining more from less for more and more
 not only the current generations for the future generations  and that can come only from gandhian engineering  so ladies and gentlemen i 'm very happy to announce 
 this gift of the 21st century
 to the world from india gandhian engineering
  a quick question for you now when you were a young boy
 in this school  what were your thoughts like what did you think you could become what do you think that drove you was there a vision you had  what is it that drove you
  mother could not gather the twenty one rupees  that half a dollar that was required
 within the stipulated time it was [ unclear ] high school  
 but it was a poor school with rich teachers  honestly  and one of them was [ unclear ] who taught us physics 
 one day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us
 how to find the focal
  convex lens the lens was here the piece of paper was there he moved it up and down and there was a bright spot up there 
 and then he said this is the focal length but then he
 held it for a little while lakshmi  
 and then the paper burned  when the paper burned for some reason he turned to me and he said 
 mashelkar  like this if you do not diffuse your energies  if you focus your energies  you can achieve anything
  that gave me a great message  focus and you can achieve  i said whoa science is so wonderful i have to become a scientist but more importantly focus and you can achieve  
 and that message very frankly is valuable for society today  
 what does that focal length do 
 it has parallel lines which are sun rays  and the property of parallel lines is that they never meet
  what does that convex lens do it makes them meet  this is convex lens leadership you know what today 's leadership is doing concave length 
 they divide them farther so i learned the lesson of convex lens leadership
 from that and when i was at national chemical 
  council of scientific industry research forty laboratories when two laboratories were not talking to each other 
  and currently i 'm president of global research alliance sixty thousand scientists in nine counties right from india to the u s i 'm trying to
 build a global team which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing that was the lesson that was the inspirational moment
