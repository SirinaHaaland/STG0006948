  i remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house 
 my father was listening to bbc news on his small gray radio  
 there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then because the news mostly
  depressed him 
 the taliban are gone my father shouted  
 i didn 't know what it meant  but i could see that my father was very very happy 
 you can go to a real school now he said 
 a morning that i
  will never forget 
 a real school 
 you see i was six when the taliban took over afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school 
 so for the next five years i dressed as a boy
 to escort my older sister who was no longer allowed to be outside alone to a secret school
 it was the only way we both could be educated
  each day we took a different route
 so that no one would suspect where we were going we
 would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping 
 the school was in a house  more than one
  hundred of us packed in one small living room it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer 
 we all knew we were risking our lives the teacher  the students and our parents 
 from time to time the school would suddenly be canceled
 for a week because taliban were suspicious 
 we always wondered what they knew about us were we being followed 
 do they know where we live 
 we were scared  but still school was where we wanted to be 
 i was very lucky to
  grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured 
 my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time 
 a total maverick from a remote province of afghanistan  he insisted that his daughter my mom 
 go to school and for that he was disowned by his father  
 but my educated mother became a teacher
  there she is 
 she retired two years ago only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood  
 and my father
 that 's him
 he was the first ever in his family to receive an education  
 there was no question that his children would
 receive an education  including his daughters  
 despite the taliban  despite the risks to him  there was greater risk in not
 educating his children 
 during taliban years i remember there were times i would get so frustrated by our life
 and always being scared and not seeing a future i would want to quit  
 but my father 
 he would say 
 listen my daughter 
 you can lose everything you own in your life 
 your money can be stolen you can be forced to leave your home during a war  but the one thing that will always remain with you
  you is what is here 
 and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees we will 
 so do you still not want to continue 
 today i am twenty two i was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war
 fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school 
 and had my family not been so committed to my education i would be one of them  
 instead  i stand here a proud graduate of middlebury college
  when i returned to afghanistan  
 my grandfather the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters was among the first to congratulate me  
 he not only brags about my college degree but also that i was the first woman and that i am the first woman to drive him through
  my family believes in me  i dream big  but my family dreams even bigger for me that 's why
 i am a global ambassador for 10x10 a global campaign to educate women 
 that 's why i cofounded sola the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in afghanistan
  a country where it 's still risky for girls to go to school the exciting thing is that i see students at my school
 with ambition grabbing at opportunity  
 and i see their parents and their fathers who like my own advocate for them
 in the face of daunting opposition 
 like ahmed that 's not his real name  and i cannot show you his face 
 but ahmed is the father of one of my students 
 less than a month ago  he
 and his daughter
 were on on their way from sola to their village and
 they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb
 by minutes as he arrived home the phone rang a voice warning him
 that if he sent his daughter back to school they would try again 
 kill me now if you wish
  will not ruin my daughter 's future because of your old and backward ideas 
 what i 've come to realize about afghanistan 
 and this is something that is often dismissed in the west that behind most most of us who succeed
 is a father
  recognizes the value in his daughter
 and who sees that her success is his success 
 it 's not to say that our mothers aren 't key
 in our success in fact they 're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters
  but in the context of a society like in afghanistan we must have the support of men 
 under the taliban
  girls who went to school
 numbered in the hundreds remember it was illegal  
 but today  
 more than three million girls are in school in afghanistan 
  looks so different from here in america  i find that americans see the fragility
 in changes  i fear that these changes will not last
 much beyond the u s troops ' withdrawal  
 but when i am back in afghanistan  when i see
 the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them who encourage them
  i see a promising future
 and lasting change 
 to me afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities  
 and every single day the girls of sola remind me of that
  they are dreaming big
