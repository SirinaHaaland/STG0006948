  is a tuberculosis ward and at the time this picture was taken in the late 1800s 
 one in seven of all people died from tuberculosis we had no idea what was causing this disease 
 the hypothesis was actually
 it was your constitution that made you susceptible  and it was a highly romanticized disease it was also called consumption  and it was
 the disorder of poets and artists and intellectuals and some people actually thought it gave you heightened sensitivity and conferred
  we instead knew that tuberculosis was caused by a highly contagious bacterial infection which is slightly less romantic 
 but that had the upside of us being able to maybe develop drugs to treat it 
 so doctors had discovered a new drug iproniazid that they were optimistic might cure tuberculosis  
 and they gave it to patients 
 and patients were elated they were more
  social more energetic one medical report actually says
 they were dancing in the halls and unfortunately this was not necessarily because they were getting better a
 lot of them were still dying 
 another medical report describes them as being
 antidepressant was discovered  
 so accidental discovery is not uncommon in science  but it requires more than just a happy accident you have to be able to recognize it for discovery to occur 
 as a neuroscientist i 'm going to talk to you a little bit about my firsthand experience with
 whatever you want to call the opposite of dumb luck let 's call it smart luck
 a bit more background  
 thankfully since the 1950s we 've developed some other drugs and we can actually now cure tuberculosis  
 and at least in the united states though not necessarily in other countries we have closed our sanitoriums and probably most of you
 are not too worried about tb  but a lot of what was true
  about infectious disease  we can say now about psychiatric disorders  
 we are in the middle of an epidemic of mood disorders like depression and post traumatic stress disorder or ptsd 
 one in four of all adults in the united states suffers from mental illness  
 which means that if you haven 't experienced it personally or someone in your family hasn 't
  it 's still very likely that someone you know has  though they may not talk about it
 depression has actually now surpassed
 hiv aids  malaria  diabetes and war
 as the leading cause of disability worldwide  and also like tuberculosis in the 1950s 
 we don 't know what causes it  once it 's developed
  a lifetime and there are no known cures 
 the second antidepressant we discovered also by accident in the 1950s 
 from an antihistamine that was making people manic 
 and in both the case of the tuberculosis ward and the antihistamine someone had to be able to recognize that a drug that was designed to do one thing
 treat tuberculosis or suppress allergies could be used to do something
  very different
 treat depression 
 and this sort of repurposing is actually quite challenging when doctors first saw this mood enhancing effect of iproniazid 
 they didn 't really recognize what they saw  they were so used to thinking about it from the framework of being a tuberculosis drug
 that they actually just listed it as a side effect an adverse side effect as you can see here a lot of these patients
 fifty four are experiencing severe euphoria  and they were worried
 that this might somehow interfere with their recovering from tuberculosis so they recommended that iproniazid only be used in cases of extreme tb
 and in patients that were highly emotionally stable  which is of course the exact opposite of how we use it as an antidepressant
  they were so used to looking at it from the perspective of this one disease  they could not see the larger implications for another disease  
 and to be fair it 's not entirely their fault 
 functional fixedness is is a bias that affects all of us it 's a tendency to only be able to think of an object in terms of its traditional use or function 
 and mental set is another thing right that 's sort of this
 preconceived
  framework with which we approach problems  and that actually makes repurposing pretty hard
 for all of us which is i guess why they gave a tv show to the guy who was like really great at repurposing 
 so the effects in both the case of
  but it does make you wonder what else we 've missed so
  more than just a case study in repurposing they have two other things in common that are really important  one they
 have terrible side effects that includes liver toxicity  weight gain of over fifty pounds
  they both increase levels of serotonin  which is a chemical signal in the brain or a neurotransmitter  
 and those two things together right one or the two may not have been that important but the two together meant that we had to develop safer drugs  and that serotonin
 seemed like a pretty good place to start  so we developed drugs to
  more specifically focus on serotonin the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors so the ssris the most famous of which is prozac  
 and that was thirty years ago  
 and since then we have mostly just worked on optimizing those drugs 
 and the ssris they are better than the drugs that came before them but they still have a lot of side effects including weight gain insomnia  
 suicidality
 and they take a really long time to work something like four to six weeks in a lot of patients and that 's in
  patients where they do work there are a lot of patients where these drugs don 't work  
 and that means now in two thousand and sixteen  
 we still have no cures for any mood disorders just drugs that suppress symptoms  which is kind of the difference between taking a painkiller for an infection versus an antibiotic a
 painkiller will make you feel better but is not going to do anything to treat that underlying disease
 and it was this flexibility in our thinking that let us recognize that iproniazid and  imipramine could be repurposed in this way which led us to the serotonin hypothesis which we then ironically  fixated on 
 this is brain signaling serotonin from an ssri commercial in case you 're not clear this is a dramatization  
 and in science  we try and remove our bias right
  running double blinded experiments or being statistically agnostic as to what our results will be but bias creeps in more insidiously in what we choose to study
 and how we choose to study it  
 so we 've focused on serotonin now for the past thirty years  often to the exclusion of other things we
 still have no cures and what if serotonin
 isn 't all there is to depression what if it 's not even the key part of it that means no matter how much time or money or effort we put into it  it will never lead to a cure in
 the past few years doctors have discovered probably what is the first truly new antidepressant
 since the 
 and this drug works very quickly  within a few hours or a day  and it doesn 't work on serotonin
  it works on glutamate which is another neurotransmitter  
 and it 's also repurposed it was traditionally used as anesthesia in surgery  
 but unlike those other drugs which were recognized pretty quickly  it took us twenty years to realize that calypsol was an antidepressant despite the fact that it 's actually a better antidepressant probably than those other
  probably because of the fact that it 's a better antidepressant that it was harder for us to recognize there was no mania to signal its effects  
 so in two thousand and thirteen  up at columbia university i was working with my colleague dr christine ann denny  
 and we were studying calypsol as an antidepressant
 in mice 
 and calypsol has like a really short half life which means it 's out of your body within a few hours  and we were just piloting  so we would give an injection to mice
  and then we 'd wait a week  and then we 'd run another experiment
 to save money 
 and one of the experiments i was running we would stress the mice and we used that as a model of depression and at first it kind of just looked like it it didn 't really work at all  
 so we could have stopped there 
 but i have run this model of depression for years  and the data just looked kind of weird it didn 't really look right to me  so i went back and we
 reanalyzed it based on whether or not they had gotten that one injection of calypsol a week beforehand  and it looked kind of like this
 so if you look at the far left if you put a mouse in a new space this is the box it 's very exciting 
 a mouse will walk around and explore and you can see that pink line is actually
 the measure of them walking  and we also give it another mouse in a pencil cup
 that it can decide to interact with this is also a dramatization in case that 's not clear  and
 a normal mouse will explore  it will be social  
 check out what 's going on if you stress a mouse in this depression model  which is the middle box 
 they aren 't social they don 't explore they mostly just kind of hide in that back corner behind a cup yet the mice that had
  gotten that one injection of calypsol here on your right  they were exploring they were social  they looked like they had never been stressed at all  
 which is impossible  
 so we could have just stopped there 
 but christine had also used calypsol before as anesthesia 
 and a few years ago she had seen that it seemed to have some weird effects on cells and some other behavior that also seemed
  to last long after the drug maybe a few weeks so we were like ok maybe this is not completely impossible but we were really skeptical  so we did what you do in science when you 're not sure  
 and we ran it again 
 and i remember being in the animal room 
 moving mice from box to box to test them and christine was actually sitting on the floor with the computer in her lap so the mice couldn 't see
  her and she was analyzing the data in real time and i remember us yelling which you 're not supposed to do in an animal room where you 're testing because it had worked  
 it seemed like these mice were protected against stress 
 or they were inappropriately happy however you want to call it  and
 we were really excited  and then we were really skeptical because it was too good to be true  so we ran it again
 and then we ran it again in a ptsd model  and we ran it again in a physiological model where all we did was give stress hormones  and we had our undergrads run it  
 and then we had our collaborators halfway across the world in france run it  
 and every time someone ran it they confirmed the same thing it seemed like this one injection of
  was somehow protecting against stress for weeks  and we only published this a year ago but since then other labs have independently confirmed this effect
 so we don 't know what causes depression 
 but we do know that stress is the initial trigger in eighty percent of cases 
 and depression and ptsd are different diseases but this is something they share in common right it is traumatic stress like active combat or natural disasters or community violence or
  sexual assault that causes post traumatic stress disorder  and not everyone that is exposed to stress
 develops a mood disorder  and this ability to experience stress and be resilient and bounce back and not develop depression or ptsd
 is known as stress resilience  and it varies between people and we have always thought of it as just sort of this passive property it 's the
  absence of susceptibility factors and risk factors for these disorders  
 but what if it were active  maybe we could enhance it  sort of akin to putting on armor
  we had accidentally discovered
 the first
  drug and like i said we only gave a tiny amount of the drug and it lasted for weeks  and that 's not like anything you see with
  antidepressants but it is actually kind of similar to what you see in immune vaccines  
 so in immune vaccines 
 you 'll get your shots  and then weeks  months years later when you 're actually exposed to bacteria  it 's not the vaccine in your body that protects you it 's your own 
  immune system that 's developed resistance and resilience to this bacteria that fights it off  and you actually never get the infection
  which is very different from  say our treatments right in that case you get the infection you 're exposed to the bacteria you 're sick  and then you take say an antibiotic which cures it and those drugs are actually working to kill the bacteria 
 or similar to as i said before with this palliative you 'll take something that will suppress the symptoms  
 but it won 't treat the underlying infection  and you 'll only feel better during the time in which you 're taking it which is why you have to keep taking it 
 and in depression  and ptsd here we have your stress exposure
 we only have palliative care 
 antidepressants only suppress symptoms  and that is why you basically have to keep taking them for the life of the disease  which is often the length of your own life 
  because it seems like they might have the potential to protect against stress and prevent
 mice from developing depression and post traumatic stress disorder also not all antidepressants are also
 paravaccines we tried prozac as well  and that had no
  so if this were to translate into humans  
 we might be able to protect people who are predictably at risk against stress induced disorders like depression and ptsd so that 's first 
  responders and firefighters  refugees  prisoners and prison guards  
  of disease was estimated at
 two point five trillion dollars 
 and since they are chronic that cost is compounding and is therefore expected to rise up to six trillion dollars in just the next fifteen years 
 as i mentioned before repurposing can be challenging because of our prior biases
  has another name ketamine 
 which also goes by another name  special k  which is a club drug and drug of abuse  
 it 's still used across the world as an anesthetic it 's used in children we use it on the battlefield it 's actually the drug of choice in a lot of developing nations 
 because it doesn 't affect breathing it is on the world health organization list of most essential medicines 
  ketamine as a paravaccine first it 'd
 be pretty easy for us to develop it 
 but as is we have to compete with our functional fixedness and mental set that kind of interfere 
 fortunately it 's not the only compound we have discovered that has these prophylactic 
  but all of the other drugs we 've discovered or compounds if you will they 're totally new  they have to go through the entire fda approval process
 if they make it before they can ever be used in humans  and that will be years  so if we wanted something sooner 
 ketamine is already fda approved it 's generic  it 's available 
 we could develop it for a fraction of the price and a fraction of the time 
 but actually
  functional fixedness and mental set there 's a real
 other challenge to repurposing drugs  which is policy 
 there are no incentives in place once a drug is generic and off patent and no longer exclusive to encourage pharma companies to develop them because they don 't make money  
 and that 's not true for just ketamine that is true for all drugs  
 regardless the idea itself
 is completely novel in psychiatry to use drugs to prevent
 mental illness as opposed to just treat it it is possible
 that twenty fifty one hundred years from now we will look back now at depression and ptsd the way we look back at
  as a thing of the past this could be the beginning of the end of the mental health epidemic  but
 as a great scientist once said only a fool is sure of anything a wise man keeps on guessing
