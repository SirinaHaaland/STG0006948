  the technology likely to have the greatest impact on the next few decades has arrived  
 and it 's not social media it 's not big data  it 's not robotics
  it 's not even ai you 'll be surprised to learn that it 's the underlying technology of digital currencies like bitcoin  it 's called the 
 now it 's not the most sonorous word in the world  
 but i believe that this is now the next generation of the internet  and that it holds vast promise for every business every
 society and for all of you individually you know
  the past few decades we 've had the internet of information  
 and when i send you an email or a powerpoint file or something i 'm actually not sending you the original i 'm sending you a copy  
 and that 's great  this is democratized information  
 but when it comes to assets
  financial assets like stocks and bonds loyalty points intellectual property music art a vote  
 carbon credit and other assets sending you a copy is a really bad idea  
 if i send you one hundred dollars  it 's really important that i don 't still have the money 
 and that i can 't send it to you this has been called the
 so today  we rely entirely on big
 intermediaries middlemen like banks government big social media companies credit card companies and so on to establish trust in our economy  
 and these intermediaries
 perform all the business and transaction logic of every kind of commerce from authentication identification of people through to
 clearing settling and record keeping and overall they do a pretty good job but there are growing problems 
 to begin  they 're centralized that means they can be hacked and increasingly are
 jp morgan the us federal government linkedin home depot and others found that out the hard way  
 they exclude billions of people from the global economy  for example people who don 't have enough money to have a
  bank account  they slow things down it can take
 a second for an email to go around the world but it can take days or weeks for money to move through the banking system across a city  and they take a big piece of the action
 ten to twenty percent just to send money to another country  they capture our
  and that means we can 't monetize it or use it to better manage our lives our privacy is being undermined and the biggest problem is that overall  
 they 've
 appropriated the largesse of the digital age asymmetrically
 we have wealth creation  but we have growing social inequality  
 so what if
 there were not only an internet
  what if there were an internet of value
 some kind of vast global distributed ledger running on millions of computers and available to everybody  
 and where every kind of asset from money to music could be stored moved transacted exchanged and managed all without powerful intermediaries 
 what if there were a native medium for value
  well in two thousand and eight the financial industry crashed and perhaps
  an anonymous person or persons named satoshi nakamoto
 created a paper where he developed a protocol for a digital cash
  people to establish trust and do transactions without a third party  and this seemingly simple act set off a spark that
 ignited the world that has everyone excited or terrified or otherwise interested in many places  
 now don 't be confused about bitcoin bitcoin is an asset it goes up and down
  and that should be of interest to you if you 're a speculator more broadly  it 's a cryptocurrency it 's not a fiat currency controlled by 
 and that 's of greater interest  but the real pony here is the underlying technology it 's called blockchain 
 so for the first time now in human history people everywhere can trust each other and transact peer
  to peer 
 and trust is established not by some big institution 
 but by collaboration by cryptography and by some clever code  and because trust is native to the technology 
 i call this the trust protocol now you 're probably wondering how does this thing work
  fair enough assets digital assets like money to music and everything in between
 are not stored in a central place but they 're distributed across a global ledger  using the highest level of cryptography 
 and when a transaction is conducted  it 's posted globally across millions and millions of computers 
 and out there around the world is a group of people called miners these are not young people
 they 're bitcoin miners 
 they have massive computing power at their fingertips ten to one hundred times bigger than all of google worldwide 
 these miners do a lot of work  and every ten minutes kind of like the heartbeat of a network a block gets created
 that has all the transactions from the previous ten minutes  then the miners get to work  trying to
  solve some tough problems  
 and they compete  the first miner to find out the truth and to validate the block is rewarded in digital currency in the case of the bitcoin blockchain with bitcoin  
 and then this is the key part that block is linked to the previous block and the previous block to create a chain of blocks  and every one is
  of like with a digital waxed seal  so if i wanted to go and and hack a block and say pay you
 and you with the same money i 'd have to hack that block plus all the preceding blocks the entire history of commerce on that 
 not just on one computer but across millions of computers 
  all using the highest levels of encryption in the light of the most powerful computing resource in the world that 's watching me tough to do 
 this is infinitely more secure than the computer systems that we have today blockchain that 's
 how it works so the bitcoin blockchain is just one there are many the ethereum blockchain was developed by a canadian named
  and this blockchain has some extraordinary capabilities one of them is that you can build smart contracts it 's kind of what it sounds like it 's a contract 
 and the contract handles the enforcement the management performance and payment the contract kind of has a bank account too in a sense
 of agreements between people and today on the
 there are projects underway to do everything from create a new replacement for the stock market to create a new model of democracy where politicians are accountable to citizens 
 so to understand what a radical change this is going to bring let 's look at one industry financial services 
 recognize this 
 rube goldberg machine
  it 's a ridiculously complicated machine that does something really simple like crack an egg or shut a door  
 well it kind of reminds me of the financial services industry honestly i mean you tap your card in the corner store and a bitstream goes through a dozen companies
 each with their own computer system 
  mainframes older than many of the people in this room  and three days later a settlement occurs  
 well with a blockchain financial industry  there would be no settlement because the payment and the settlement is the same activity it 's just a change in the ledger  
 so wall street and all around the world the financial industry is in a big upheaval about this wondering can we be replaced or how do we embrace this technology for success
  now why should you care  
 well  let me describe some applications 
 prosperity  the first era of the internet the internet of information brought us wealth
 but not shared prosperity because social inequality is growing  and this is at the heart of all of the
  the anger and extremism and protectionism and xenophobia and worse that we 're seeing growing in the world today 
 brexit being the most recent case 
 so
 could we develop some new approaches to this problem of inequality because the the only approach today
 is to redistribute wealth tax people and spread it around more could we
  could we change the way that wealth gets created in the first place by democratizing wealth creation  engaging more people in the economy  and then ensuring that they got fair compensation  
 let me describe five ways that this can be done 
 number one did you know that seventy percent of the people in the world who have land
 have a tenuous title to
  a little farm in honduras some dictator comes to power he says i
 know you 've got a piece of paper that says you own your farm but the government computer says my friend owns your farm 
 this happened on a mass scale in honduras  and this problem exists everywhere 
 hernando de soto the great latin american economist says this is the number one issue in the world in terms of economic mobility more important than having a
  because if you don 't have a valid title to your land you can 't borrow against it and you can 't plan for the future  
 so today companies are working with governments to put land titles on a blockchain and once it 's there  this is immutable  
 you can 't hack it this creates the conditions for prosperity for potentially billions of people 
 secondly
  lot of writers talk about uber and airbnb and taskrabbit and lyft and so on as part of the sharing economy this is a very powerful idea that peers can come together and create and share wealth 
 my view is that these companies are not
 really sharing in fact  they 're successful precisely because they don 't share they aggregate services together and they sell them 
 what if rather than
 airbnb being a $ twenty five billion corporation there was a distributed application on a blockchain we 'll call it
 and
 it was essentially owned by all of the people who have a room to rent  
 and when someone wants to rent a room  they go onto the blockchain database and
 all the criteria they sift through it helps them find the right room and
  then the blockchain helps with the contracting it identifies the party it handles the payments just through digital payments they 're built into the system  and it even handles reputation because if she
 rates a room as a five star room that room is there  and it 's rated  and it 's immutable  so 
  disruptors in silicon valley
 could be disrupted  and this would be good for prosperity  number three 
 the biggest flow of funds from the developed world to the developing world is not corporate investment  and it 's not even foreign aid  
 it 's remittances  
 this is the global diaspora people have left
  sending money back to their families at home this is six hundred billion dollars a year  and it 's growing and these people are getting ripped off
 analie domingo is a housekeeper
 she lives in toronto  and every month she goes to the western union office
 with some cash to send her remittances to her mom
  mom in manila 
 it costs her around ten percent the money takes four to seven days to get there her mom never knows when it 's going to arrive it takes five hours out of her week to do this 
 six months ago analie domingo used a blockchain application called
 abra  and from her mobile device she sent three hundred bucks it went directly to her mom 's mobile device without going through an intermediary  
 and then her mom looked at her mobile device it 's kind of like an uber interface
  tellers moving around she clicks on a teller that 's a 
  seven minutes away the
 guy shows up at the door gives her filipino pesos she puts them in her wallet 
 the whole thing took minutes  and it cost her two percent  
 this is a big opportunity for prosperity  number
  the most powerful asset of the digital age is data 
 and data is really a new asset class maybe bigger than previous asset classes like land under the agrarian economy or an industrial plant or even money 
 and all of you we create this data we create this asset  and we leave this trail of digital crumbs behind us as we go throughout
  and these crumbs are collected into a mirror image of you the virtual you 
 and the virtual you may know more about you than you do because you can 't remember what you bought a year ago or said a year ago or your exact location a year ago  
 and the virtual you is not owned by you that 's the big problem  
 so today there are companies working to create an identity in a black box the virtual you owned by you 
 and this
 black box moves around with you
 as you travel throughout the world  and it 's very very stingy it only gives away the shred of information that 's required to do something a lot of transactions 
 the seller doesn 't even need to know who you are they just need to know that they got paid  
  because it can also help us protect our privacy and privacy is the foundation of a free society  
 let 's get this asset that we create back under our control where we can own our own identity and manage it responsibly  
 finally 
 finally number five there are a whole number
 creators of content who don 't receive fair compensation  because the system for intellectual property is broken it was broken by the first era of the internet  take music 
 musicians are left with crumbs at the end of the whole food chain you know if you were a songwriter twenty five years ago you wrote a a hit
  it got a million singles  
 you could get royalties of around forty five thousand dollars today you 're a songwriter you write a hit song it gets a million streams you don 't get
 surrounding it 
 and the music protects her intellectual property rights  you want to listen to the song it 's free or maybe a few micro cents that flow into a digital account  you want to put the song in your movie that 's 
  different  and the ip rights are all specified  you want to make a ringtone that 's different  
  it 's out there on this platform marketing itself protecting the rights of the author  and because the song has a payment system in the sense of bank account all the money flows back to the 
 artist  and they control the industry  rather than these powerful intermediaries 
 this is not just songwriters  it 's any creator
  scientific discoveries journalists there are all kinds of people who don 't get fair compensation  and with 
 they 're going to be able to make it rain on the blockchain and that 's a wonderful thing so 
 these are five opportunities
 out of a dozen to solve
  create prosperity of course people do but my case to you
 is that once again 
 the technology genie has escaped from the bottle  and it was summoned by an unknown person or persons at this uncertain time in human history  
 and it 's giving us another kick at the can
 another opportunity to rewrite the economic power grid and the old order of things and solve some of the world 's most
 difficult problems if we will it
