  the key phrase is
  brain cancer was really as you can imagine shocking news for me  i knew nothing about cancer  in
 western cultures  when you have cancer it 's as if you disappear in a way your life as a complex
  lab values a list of medicines
 and everyone changes as well you suddenly become a disease on legs doctors start speaking
 a language which you don 't understand they start
  people start
 changing as well because they
 start dealing with the disease  instead of
 with the human being  they say what did the doctor say before even saying hello 
 and in the meanwhile you 're left with questions to which
  nobody gives an answer these are the can i questions can i work while i have cancer  
 can i study  can i make love can i be creative  
 and
 you wonder what have i done to deserve this you wonder can i change something
  doctors are the good guys in
 all these scenarios  because they are very professional and dedicated to to curing you  but they also
 are very used to having to deal with patients so i
  things are changing but classically they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition 
  your friends and family engaged  or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you 're going through  
 but instead you 're forced there
 to wait
 in the hands of a series of
 very professional strangers while i was in the hospital i asked for a printed out
  it was really hard to obtain because it 's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer
  i talked to it and i said okay cancer  you 're not all there is to me  there 's more to me
  a cure  whichever it is will have to deal
 with the whole of me and so  the next day i left the
  the hospital against medical advice  i was determined to change
 my relationship with the cancer and i was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing
 anything as drastic as a surgery 
 i 'm an artist i use several forms
  and open information in my practice so my best bet
 was to get it all out there get the information out there and use it
 so that it could be accessed by anyone so i
 created a website which is called la  cura on which i put my medical data online
  actually had to hack it and that 's a thing which we can talk about in another speech i chose this 
  in italian means the cure because
 in many different cultures  the word cure can mean many different things  in our western cultures it means
 eradicating or reversing
  from the mediterranean  from latin countries from africa it can mean many more things 
 of course i was interested in the opinions of
 doctors
 and healthcare providers  but i was also interested in the cure of the artist 
  i was interested in
 the social cure  i was interested in the psychological cure  i was interested in the spiritual cure  i was interested in the emotional cure i was interested in any form of cure 
 and 
  i received lots of media attention from
 italy and from abroad and i quickly received
 more than five hundred thousand contacts emails social networking
 most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer  but more of them were about how to cure myself as
  for example here we see francesca fini in her performance 
 or  as artist patrick lichty has done  he produced a 3d
  can share our cancer and this was going on
 scientists the traditional medicine experts  several researchers doctors all connected with me to
  with all this information and support i was able to form a team of several
 neurosurgeons  traditional doctors  oncologists  and several hundred
 volunteers with whom i was able to discuss
 the information i was receiving  which
 which is very important and together we were able to form a strategy for my own cure
 in many languages  according to many cultures  and the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history 
 which is quite remarkable for me [
 surgery ] the follow up mris showed  luckily  little to no growth of the cancer so i was able to take my time and choose
  i chose
 the doctor i wanted to work with i chose the hospital i wanted to stay in and in the meanwhile  i was supported by thousands of people  
 none of whom felt pity for me  
 everyone
 felt like they could
 take an active role in helping me to get well  and this was the most important part of la
 what are the outcomes  i 'm fine  as you can see pretty fine 
 i had excellent news after the
 surgery i have i had
 a very low grade glioma
  kind of cancer which doesn 't grow a lot  i have completely changed my life
 and my lifestyle  everything i did was
 thoughtfully designed to get me engaged  up until the very last few minutes of the surgery  
 which was very intense a matrix of electrodes
  map of what the brain controls and right before the operation we were able to discuss 
  the functional map of of my brain with the doctor to understand which risks i was running into and if there were any
  and this openness was really the fundamental part of la cura thousands of people shared their
 stories their experiences
 doctors got to talk with people they don 't usually consult when
  different languages in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research
  really
 depends
 on the wellness of all of its components 
 this global performance is my open source cure for cancer 
 and from what i feel it 's a cure for me  but for us all thank you
