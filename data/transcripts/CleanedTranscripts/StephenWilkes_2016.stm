  i 'm driven by pure passion to create photographs that tell stories photography can be described as the recording of a single moment
 frozen within a fraction of
  each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece of our memories as time passes  
 but what if you could capture more than one moment in a photograph what if a photograph could actually collapse time 
 compressing the best moments of the day and the night seamlessly into one single image 
 i 've created a concept called day to night and i believe it 's going to change the way you look at the world  i know it has for me
  my process begins by photographing iconic locations places that are part of what i call our collective memory  
 i photograph from a fixed vantage point  and i never move  i capture the fleeting moments of humanity and light as time passes  
 photographing for anywhere from fifteen to thirty hours and
  i then choose the best moments of the day and night 
 using time as a guide i seamlessly blend those best moments into one single photograph  visualizing our conscious journey with time 
 i can take you to paris
 for a view from the tournelle bridge  and i can show you the early morning rowers along the river seine 
  i can show you notre dame aglow at night and in between  i can show you the romance of the city of light  
 i am essentially a street photographer from fifty feet in the air and every single thing you see in this photograph actually happened on this day 
 day to night is a global project and my work has always been about history  i 'm fascinated by the concept
  of going to a place like venice and actually seeing it during a specific event and i decided i wanted to see the historical regata an event that 's actually been taking place since 
 the boats and the costumes look exactly as they did then 
 and an important element that i really want you guys to understand is this is not a timelapse this is me photographing throughout the day
  and the night  
 i am a relentless collector of magical moments 
 and the thing that drives me is the fear of just missing one of them  
 the entire concept came about
 in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six life magazine commissioned me to create a panoramic photograph
 of the cast and crew of baz luhrmann 's
  film romeo + juliet  
 i got to the set and realized  it 's a square so the only way i could actually create a panoramic was to shoot a collage of two hundred and fifty single images  
 so i had dicaprio and claire danes embracing  and as i pan my camera to the right  i noticed there was a mirror on the wall
 and i saw they were actually reflecting in it
  for that one moment that one image i asked them would you guys just kiss for this one picture 
 and then i came back to my studio in new york  and i hand glued these two hundred and fifty images together
 and stood back and went wow  this is so cool  i 'm changing time in a photograph 
 and that concept actually stayed with me for thirteen years
 until technology
 finally has caught up to my
  dreams  
 this is an image i created of the santa monica pier day to night 
 and i 'm going to show you a little video that gives you an idea of what it 's like being with me when i do these pictures 
 to start with you have to understand that to get views like this most of my time is spent up high  and i 'm usually in a cherry picker
 or a crane so this is a typical
  capturing the entire day unfold 
 one of the things that 's great is i love to people watch and trust me when i tell you  this is the greatest seat in the house to have 
 but this is really how i go about creating these photographs so once i decide on my view
 and the location i have to decide where day begins and night ends  and
  what i call the time vector 
 einstein described time as a fabric think of the surface of a trampoline  it warps and stretches with gravity  
 i see time as a fabric as well  
 except i take that fabric and flatten it compress it into single plane one of the unique aspects of this work is also if you look at all my pictures  the time vector changes
  sometimes i 'll go left to right  sometimes
 front to back up or down even diagonally  
 i am exploring the space time continuum within a two dimensional still photograph 
 now when i when i do these pictures it 's literally like a real time puzzle going on in my mind 
 i build a photograph based on time and this is what i call the master plate  this can take us several months to complete 
 the fun thing about this work is
  absolutely zero control when i get up there on any given day and capture photographs  so i never know who 's going to be in the picture if it 's going to be a great sunrise or sunset no control 
 it 's at the end of the process if i 've had a really great day and everything remained the same that i then decide who 's in and who 's out and it 's all based on time i 'll
 take those best moments that i pick over a month of editing and they get seamlessly
  blended into the master plate  
 i 'm compressing the day and night as i saw it  creating a unique harmony between these two very discordant worlds 
 painting has always been a really important influence in all my work
 and i 've always been a huge fan of albert bierstadt the great hudson river school painter  he inspired a recent series that i did on the national parks this is
  's yosemite valley  
 so this is the photograph i created of yosemite  this is actually the cover story of the two thousand and sixteen january issue of national geographic  
 i photographed for over thirty hours in this picture  i was literally on the side of a cliff  capturing the stars and the moonlight as it
  the moonlight lighting el capitan  and i also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape  
 the best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity
 as time changed
 from day into night 
 and on a personal note i actually had a photocopy of bierstadt 's painting in my pocket  and when that sun started to
  rise in the valley  i started to literally shake with excitement because i looked at the painting and i go oh my god i 'm getting  bierstadt 's exact same lighting one hundred years earlier 
 day to night is
 about all the things it 's like a compilation of all the things i love about the medium of photography  
 it 's about landscape  it 's about street photography  it 's about color it 's about
  this is one of the most historical moments i 've been able to photograph the two thousand and thirteen presidential inauguration of barack obama  
 and if you look closely in this picture you can actually see time changing in those large television sets you can see michelle waiting with the children the president now greets the crowd  he takes his oath and now he 's speaking to the
  there 's so many challenging aspects when i create photographs like this for this particular photograph i was in a 50 foot scissor lift
 up in the air and it was not very stable so every time my assistant and i shifted our weight our horizon line shifted so for every picture you see and there were about one thousand eight hundred in this picture 
 we both had to tape our feet into position
 every time i clicked the shutter
  i 've learned so many extraordinary things doing this work  
 i think the two most important are
 patience and the power of observation 
 when you photograph a city like new york from above  i discovered that those people in cars that i sort of live with everyday 
 they don 't look like people in cars anymore they feel like a giant school of fish it was a
  of emergent behavior  
 and when people describe the energy of new york  i think this photograph begins to really capture that 
 when you look closer in my work you can see there 's stories going on
 you realize that times square is a canyon it 's shadow and it 's sunlight  
 so i decided in this photograph i would checkerboard time so wherever the shadows are it 's night and wherever the sun is
 time is this extraordinary thing that we never can really wrap our heads around 
 but in a very unique and special way i believe these photographs begin to put a face on time 
 they embody
 a new metaphysical visual reality 
 when you spend fifteen hours looking at a place 
 you 're going to see things a little differently than if you or i walked up with our camera  took a picture and then walked away  this was a perfect example i call it 
 i watched over fifteen hours all these people not even look at sacr coeur they were more interested in using it as a backdrop they would walk up 
 take a picture  
  i found this to be an absolutely extraordinary example a powerful disconnect between what we think the human experience is
 versus what the human experience is evolving into the act of sharing has suddenly become
 more important
 than the experience itself 
 and finally my most recent image
 has such a special meaning for me personally  
 this is the serengeti national park in tanzania  and this is photographed in the middle of the seronera this is not a reserve  
 i went specifically during the peak migration to hopefully capture the most diverse range of of animals 
 unfortunately when we got there there was a drought going on during the peak migration
  were drawn to the water i found this one watering hole and felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving i had a real opportunity to capture something unique we spent three days studying it 
 and nothing could have prepared me for what i witnessed during our shoot day  
 i photographed for twenty six hours in a sealed crocodile blind eighteen feet in the air what i
  was unimaginable frankly it was biblical we saw for twenty six hours all these competitive species share a single resource
 called water the same resource that humanity is supposed to have wars over during the next fifty years the animals
 never even grunted at each other they seem to understand something that we humans don 't
 't that this precious resource called water is something we all have to share when i
 created this picture  i realized that day to night is really
 a new way of seeing compressing time exploring the space time continuum within a
  as technology evolves
 along with photography photographs will not only communicate a deeper meaning of time and memory  
 but they will compose a new narrative
 of untold stories  creating a timeless window into our world  thank you
