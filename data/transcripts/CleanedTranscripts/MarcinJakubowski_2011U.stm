  my name is marcin
 farmer  technologist
 i was born in poland now in the u s 
 i started a group called open source ecology we 've identified the fifty most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist
 things from tractors
 bread ovens  circuit makers then we set out to create an open source diy do it yourself version
 that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost we call this the global village construction set so let me tell you a story so i finished my 20s
 with a ph d in fusion energy and i discovered
 i was useless  i had no practical skills
 world presented me with options and i took them  i guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle  so i started a farm
 in missouri and learned about the economics of farming  i bought a tractor
 then it broke  i paid to get it repaired then it broke again  then pretty soon  i was broke too  
 i realized that the truly
  appropriate low cost tools that i needed to start a sustainable farm and
 settlement just didn 't exist yet  
 i needed tools that were robust modular  
 highly efficient and optimized low cost made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime not designed for obsolescence  
 i found that i would have to build them myself  
 so i did just that
 and i tested them 
 and i found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale  
 so then i published the 3d designs schematics  instructional videos and budgets on a wiki  
 then contributors from all over the world began showing up  prototyping new machines during dedicated
  project visits  so far we have prototyped eight of the fifty machines and now the project is beginning to grow on its own 
 we know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity 
 and the same is starting to happen with hardware too  we 're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people 's lives in such tangible material ways
  if we can lower the barriers to farming building manufacturing  then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential that 's not only in the developing world 
 our tools are being made for the american farmer builder  entrepreneur maker we 've seen lots of excitement from these people who can now start a construction business  parts manufacturing
  just selling power back to the grid  our goal is a repository of published designs so clear so complete that a single burned dvd
 is effectively a civilization starter kit  
 i 've planted a hundred trees in a day  
 i 've pressed five thousand bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet
 and built a tractor in six
  days from what i 've seen this is only the beginning 
 if this idea is truly sound then the implications are significant 
 a greater distribution of the means of production  
 environmentally sound supply chains  and a newly relevant diy maker culture
 can hope to transcend artificial scarcity
  we 're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology  thank you
