  this is where our story begins the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son declan obviously a really profound moment and it changed our
  lives in many ways it also changed our lives in many unexpected ways and those unexpected ways we later reflected on 
 that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us and a year later we launched babble a website for parents rufus griscom
 now i think of our story as starting a few years earlier av that 's true rg you may remember we fell head over heels in love av we did 
 rg we were at the time running a very different kind of website it was a website called
  in theory and hopefully in practice a smart online magazine about sex and culture 
 av that spawned a dating site
  but you can understand the jokes that we get sex begets babies you follow instructions on nerve and you should end up on babble
  which we did and we might launch a geriatric site as our third we 'll see rg 
 but for us the continuity between nerve and babble was not just
 the life stage thing which is of course relevant but it was really more about
 our desire to speak very honestly about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about 
 it seems to us that when people start dissembling people start lying about things that 's when it gets really interesting that 's a subject that we want to dive into  and we 've been surprised
  as young parents  that there are almost more taboos around parenting than there are around sex av 
 it 's true  so like we said  the early years were really wonderful but they were also really difficult
  and we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting
 we subscribed to a lot of magazines did our homework but really everywhere you look around we were surrounded by images
  went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this the sun was always streaming in and our children would never be crying i would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested 
 and in fact  it was not like that at all rg when we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at with these beautiful images and looked at the scene in our actual living room it looked a little bit more like this 
 these are our three sons  and of course  they 're not always crying and screaming but with three boys there 's a decent probability that at least one of them will not be
  comporting himself exactly as he should av yes you can see where the disconnect was happening for us  we really felt like what we went in expecting
 had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing
  and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight we really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were
 in an honest
  so today what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos  and of course there are many more than four things you can 't say about parenting
  but we would like to share with you today four that are particularly relevant for us personally  so the first taboo number one 
 you can 't say you didn 't fall in love with your baby in the very first minute i remember vividly sitting there in the hospital  
  misuse of the pronoun alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child
  i was there with my arms open  the nurse was coming at me with this beautiful beautiful child  and i remember as she was approaching me  the voices of friends
  the moment they put the baby in your hands you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is [ on ] an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you 've ever experienced in your entire life so i was 
 bracing myself for the moment the baby was coming  and i was ready for this mack truck of love
 picture is from literally a few seconds after
 the baby was placed in my hands and i brought him over and you can see our eyes were glistening i was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife with deep deep gratitude that we had what appeared to be a healthy child  and it was also of course surreal i mean
 i had to check the tags and make sure i was incredulous are you sure this is our child and this was all
 quite remarkable but what i felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection but nothing like what i feel for him now five years later
  later  and so we 've done something here that is heretical  we have charted
 our love for our child over time 
 this as you know is an act of heresy you 're not allowed to chart love  the reason you 're not allowed to chart love is because we think
  love as a binary thing you 're either in love or you 're not in love you love or you don 't love  and i think the reality is that love is a process and i think the problem with thinking of love as something that 's binary is that it causes us to to be
 unduly concerned that that love is fraudulent or inadequate or what have you and i think i 'm speaking obviously here to the father 's experience  but i think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early
  that their
 emotional response is inadequate in some fashion av well i 'm glad rufus is bringing this up because you can notice where he dips in the first years where i think i was doing most of the work  
 but we like we like to joke  in the first few months of all of our children 's lives this is uncle rufus rg i
 'm a very affectionate uncle very affectionate uncle av yes and i often joke with rufus when he comes home that i 'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a
  amongst other babies so i actually threw a pop quiz here onto rufus rg uh oh av 
 i don 't want to embarrass him too much but i am going to give him three seconds rg that is not fair this is a trick question he 's not up there
  son is somewhere in here  and i want to see if rufus can actually quickly
  move on to taboo number two you can 't talk about how lonely having a baby can be 
 i enjoyed being pregnant i loved it i felt incredibly connected to the community around me 
 i felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy all around me  tracking it down till the actual due date 
 i felt like i was a vessel of the future of humanity
  that continued into the the hospital it was really exhilarating i was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors
  it was a really wonderful experience  but when i got home
 i suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out  and i was really surprised by those feelings i did expect it to be
  have sleepless nights constant feedings
  but i did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that i experienced 
 and i was really surprised that no one had talked to me that i was going to be feeling this way  and i called my sister
 whom i 'm very close to and had three children and i asked her 
 why didn 't you tell me i was going to be feeling this way that i was going to have these feeling incredibly isolated
  it 's just not something you want to say to a mother that 's having a baby for the first time rg
 and of course  we think it 's precisely what you really should be saying to mothers who have kids for the first time 
 and that this of course one of the themes
 for us is is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is is critical to us collectively being being
  it 's hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation
 is our modern world  so alisa 's experience is not isolated so your fifty eight percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness of those sixty seven percent are most lonely 
  when their kids are zero to five probably really zero to two in the process of preparing this we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this this period of time
  family members which i think is part of why this is such a tough period so to take one example among many in southern india there 's a practice known as
 in which the pregnant woman when she 's seven or eight months pregnant moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies 
 give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after
  one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period av 
 so taboo number three you can 't talk about your miscarriage but today i 'll talk about mine  so after we had declan  we kind of recalibrated our expectations we thought we actually
 could go through this again and and thought we we knew what we would be up against  
 and we were grateful that i was able to get pregnant  and i soon learned that we were having a boy  and then when i was five months we learned that we had lost our child
 this is actually the last little image we have of him  and it was obviously a very difficult time
 really painful as i was working through that
 mourning process i was amazed that i didn 't want to see anybody  i really wanted to crawl into a hole 
 and i didn 't really know how i was going to work my way back into my surrounding community
 and i realize i think the way i
 i was feeling that way is on a really deep gut level i was feeling a lot of shame
 and embarrassed frankly that in some respects i had failed at delivering what i 'm genetically engineered to do 
 and of course it made me question if i wasn 't able to have another child what would that mean for my marriage
  and just me as a woman so it was a very difficult time  as i started working through it more
  started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people i was really amazed by by all the stories that started flooding in people i interacted with daily worked with was friends with family members that i had known a long time had never shared with me their own stories  
 and i just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork
  and i felt like i happened upon this secret society of women
 that i now was a part of which was reassuring and also really
  concerning
  and i think miscarriage is an invisible loss there 's not really a lot of community support around it there 's really no ceremony  
 rituals or rites  and i think  with a death you have a funeral you celebrate the life and there 's a lot of community support  and it 's something women don 't have with miscarriage rg which is too bad
  of course it 's a very common and very traumatic experience  fifteen to twenty percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage and i find this astounding in a survey seventy four percent of women said that miscarriage 
 they felt was partly their fault  which is awful and astoundingly twenty two percent said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse  so taboo number four 
  the party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since i participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family i
 'll never forget i remember vividly to this day our first son  
 declan was nine months old and i was sitting there on the couch and i was reading daniel gilbert 's wonderful book stumbling on happiness 
 and i got about two thirds of the way through and there was a chart on the right hand side
 on the
  we 've labeled here the most terrifying chart imaginable for a new parent this chart is comprised of four completely independent studies  basically there 's this precipitous drop
 of marital satisfaction which is closely aligned we all know with broader happiness that doesn 't rise again until your first child goes to college
  so i 'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life this
  chasm of happiness that we 're driving our proverbial convertible straight into
 we were despondent av so you can imagine i mean again the first few months were difficult but we 'd come out of it and were really shocked to see this study so we really wanted to take a deeper look at it
 in hopes that we would find a silver lining rg and that 's when it 's great to be running a website
  because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies we said something is wrong here there 's something missing from these studies  it can 't possibly be that bad
  so
 liz mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece and she interviewed four scientists and she also interviewed
 daniel gilbert and we did indeed find a silver lining  so this is our guess as to what this
  baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life average happiness is of course inadequate because it doesn 't speak to the 
 experience and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in
  experience  and so we all remember as children the tiniest little thing and we see it on the faces of our children the teeniest little thing can just rocket them
  to these heights of just utter
 adulation  and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair  and it 's just extraordinary to watch and we remember it ourselves  and then of course as you get older it 's almost like age is a form of lithium as you get older you
 become more more stable  and part of what happens i think in your ' 20s and ' 30s is you start to learn to hedge your happiness you start to realize that
 i could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps but it 's more likely that i 'll feel claustrophobic and i won 't be able to get a beer
 so i 'm not going to go i 've got a good stereo at home so i 'm not going to go so your average happiness goes up
  but you lose those transcendent moments av yeah and then you have your first child
  and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows
 the highs being the first steps the first smile your child reading to you for the first time
 the lows being our house any time from six to seven every night
  but you realize you resubmit yourself to to losing control in a really wonderful way  
 which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying
 we trade average happiness we trade the sort of security and safety
 of a certain level of contentment for for these transcendent moments
  so where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this there 's another factor in our case  we have violated yet another taboo in our own lives 
 and this is a bonus taboo
  quick bonus taboo for you that we should not be working together especially with three children
 and we are rg and we had reservations about about this on the front end everybody knows you should absolutely not work with your spouse
 in fact when we first went out to raise money to start babble  the venture capitalists said we categorically don 't invest in companies founded by husbands and wives because there 's an extra point of failure 
 it 's a bad idea
  do it and we obviously went forward we did we raised the money and we 're thrilled that we did because in this phase of one 's life
  the incredibly scarce resource is time  and if you 're really passionate about what you do every day which we are and you 're also passionate about your relationship this is the only way we know how to do it  
 and so the final question that we would ask
  can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards  it 's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy but they 're sometimes pretty quick
 and so
 how about that average baseline of happiness can we move that up a little bit av 
 and we kind of feel that
 the happiness gap which we talked about is really the result of walking into parenting and really any long term partnership for that matter with the wrong expectations and if you have the right expectations and
  we feel like it 's going to be a pretty gratifying experience rg and so this is what and we think that
 that a lot of parents  when you get in there in our case anyway you pack your bags for a trip to europe and you 're really excited to go get out of the airplane it turns out you 're trekking in nepal
  and trekking in nepal is an extraordinary experience  particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you 're getting in for and you 're psyched so the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty but a hope that by
  being more honest and candid about these experiences that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit
