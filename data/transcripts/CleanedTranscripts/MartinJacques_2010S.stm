  changing with really remarkable speed  if you look at the chart at the top here you 'll see that in 
  these goldman sachs projections suggest that the chinese economy will be almost the same size as the american economy and if you look at the
 chart for two thousand and fifty  it 's projected that the chinese economy will be twice the size
 of the american economy and the indian economy will be almost the same size as the american economy and
 we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the western financial crisis a couple of weeks ago  i was looking
 at the latest
  projection by bnp paribas for when china will
 have a larger economy than the united states goldman sachs projected two thousand and twenty seven the
 projection is two thousand and twenty that 's just a decade
 decade away china
 is going to change the world
 in two fundamental respects first of all it 's a huge developing country
 with a population of one point
 three billion people 
 which has been growing for over thirty years at around ten percent a year and within a decade it will have the largest
 economy in the world never before in the modern era
  has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country  rather than a developed country  
 secondly  for the first time in the modern era  the dominant country in the world which i think is what china will become
 will be not from the west and from very very different civilizational roots
 now i know it 's a widespread assumption in the west that as countries
 modernize they also
 westernize this is an illusion it 's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition markets and technology it is not it is also shaped
 equally by history and culture
  is not like the west and it will not become like the west  it will remain in very fundamental respects
 very different 
 now the big question here is obviously how do we make sense of china  how do we try to understand what china is  and the problem we have in the west at the moment 
 by and large is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in western terms
  using western ideas we can 't  now i want to offer you three building blocks
 for trying to understand what china is like just as a beginning  the first is this that china
 is not really a nation state okay  it 's called itself a nation state for the last hundred years  but everyone who knows anything about china knows it 's a
  lot older than this 
 this was what china looked like with the victory of the qin dynasty in two hundred and twenty one b c at the end of the warring state period the birth of modern china and you can see it against the boundaries of modern china  
 or immediately afterward the han dynasty still two thousand years ago and you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as eastern china which is where the vast majority of chinese lived then and live now 
  now what is extraordinary about this is what gives china its sense of being china what gives
 the chinese the sense of what it is to be chinese comes not from the last hundred years not from the nation state period  which is what happened in the west  
 but from the period if you like of
  notion of the state likewise a very distinctive notion of the family  social relationships like guanxi
  confucian values and so on these are all things that come from the period of the 
 in other words china  unlike the western states and most countries in the world is shaped by its sense of civilization its existence as
  and there 's one other thing to add to this 
 and that is this of course we know china 's big huge demographically and geographically with a population of one point three billion people 
 what we often aren 't really aware of
 is the fact that china is
 extremely diverse and very pluralistic and in many ways very decentralized
  you can 't run a place on this scale simply from beijing even though we think
 this to be the case  it 's never been the case so this is china 
  rather than
 a nation state and what does it mean well  i think it has all sorts of profound implications i 'll give you two quick ones 
 the first is that the most important political
 value for the chinese
 is unity is the maintenance of
 chinese civilization 
 you know two thousand years ago  europe  breakdown the fragmentation of the holy roman empire  it divided  and it 's remained divided ever since  china  over 
  the same time period  went in exactly the opposite direction  very painfully holding this huge
  prosaic  which is hong kong do you remember the handover of hong kong
 by britain to china in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven you may remember what the chinese constitutional proposition was 
 one country two systems and i 'll lay a wager
 that barely anyone in the west believed them window dressing when china gets its hands on hong kong that won 't be the case thirteen years on
  the political and legal system in hong kong is as different now as it was in 
 we were wrong why were we wrong we were wrong
 because we thought naturally enough in nation state ways think of german unification one thousand nine hundred and ninety what happened  
 well basically the east was swallowed by the west  one nation one system that is the nation state mentality  but you can 't run
 a country like 
 on the basis of one civilization one system it doesn 't work so actually the response of
 china to the question of hong kong as it will be to the question of taiwan was a natural response one civilization  many systems 
 let me offer you
 another building block to try and understand
  china maybe not sort of a comfortable one the chinese have a very very different conception of race
 to most other countries do you know of the
 one point three billion chinese over ninety percent of them think they belong to the same race
  most populous countries india the united states indonesia brazil all of them
 are multiracial the chinese don 't feel like that china is only
 multiracial really at the margins  so the question is
  history of at least two thousand years  a history of conquest occupation  absorption  assimilation and so on led to the process by which over time this notion 
  of the han emerged of course nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity  
 the han china could never have held together  the han identity has been the cement which has
 held this country together  the great disadvantage of it
 is that the han have a very weak conception of cultural difference they really believe in
 their
  and they are disrespectful
 of those who are not hence their attitude for example to the uyghurs and to the tibetans 
 or let me give you my third building block the chinese state  now the relationship
 between the state and society in china is very different from that
 in the west  now we in the west overwhelmingly seem to think in these days at least that the authority and
  legitimacy of the state
 is a function of democracy the problem with this proposition is that the chinese state
 enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the chinese
  reason for this
 is because
 well there are two reasons i think and it 's obviously got nothing to do with democracy  because in our terms the chinese certainly don 't have a democracy  and the reason for this is firstly  
 because
 the state in china is given a very special it enjoys a very special significance
  the embodiment and the guardian of chinese civilization of the 
 this is as close as china gets to a kind of
 spiritual
 role  and the second reason
 is because  whereas in europe and north america the state 's power is continuously
  i mean in the european tradition  historically against the church against other sectors of the aristocracy  against merchants and so on
 for one thousand years  the power of the chinese state
 has not been challenged it 's had no serious rivals so you can see
 that the way in which power has been constructed in china is very different from our experience in western history the result
  way is that the chinese have
 a very different view
 of the state
  whereas we tend to view it as an intruder  a stranger  certainly
 an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained the chinese don 't see
  the chinese view the state
 as an intimate not just as an intimate actually as a member of the family not just in fact as a member of the family  but as the head of the family  the patriarch
 of the family  this is the chinese view of the state
 very very different to ours  it 's embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case
 in the west and i would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing
  with here in the chinese context is a new kind of paradigm  which is different from anything we 've had to
 think about in the past 
 know that that china believes in the market and the state i mean adam smith already writing in
 the late 18th century said the chinese market is larger and more developed
 and more sophisticated than anything in
  europe and apart from the mao period that has remained more or less the case ever since  but this is combined with an extremely strong
 and ubiquitous state the state is everywhere in china  i mean  it 's leading firms many of them are still
 publicly owned private firms  however large they are like lenovo  depend in many ways on state patronage targets for the economy and so on are set by the
  state and the state of course  its authority flows into lots of other areas as we are familiar with with something like the one child policy  moreover 
 this is a very old state tradition a very old tradition of statecraft i mean if you want an illustration of this  
 the great wall is one  but this is another this is the grand canal which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century b c and was finally completed
 in the seventh century  a d it went for one thousand one hundred and fourteen miles linking
 beijing with hangzhou and shanghai 
 so there 's a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in china  which i suppose helps us to explain what we see today  which is something like the three gorges dam and many other
  expressions of state competence within china  
 so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is china
 the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society 
  and yet we still insist by and large in thinking that we can understand china
 by simply drawing on western experience looking at it through western eyes  using western concepts 
 if you want to know why we unerringly seem to get china wrong our predictions about what 's going to happen to china are incorrect  this is
  i have to say that i think
 attitude towards china is that of a kind of little westerner mentality
 it 's kind of arrogant it 's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best  and therefore
 we have the universal measure  and secondly  it 's ignorant we refuse to really address the issue
 of difference you know there 's a very
  interesting passage in a book by paul cohen the american historian  and paul cohen argues
 that the west thinks of itself
 as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures  but it 's not in many ways  it 's the most
  because for two hundred years the west has been so dominant in the world that it 's not really needed to understand
 other cultures 
 other civilizations  because at the end of the day  it could if necessary by force get its own way  
 whereas those cultures virtually the rest of the world in
  which have been in a far weaker position  vis a vis the west have been thereby forced to understand the west because of the west 's presence in those societies  and therefore 
 they are as a result more cosmopolitan
 in many ways
 than the west i mean take the question of east asia  east asia  japan korea  china etc a third of the world 's population lives there  now the largest economic region in the world
  from east asia  are far more knowledgeable
 about the west
 than the west is about
 east
 asia now this point is very germane i 'm afraid 
 to the present because what 's happening back to that chart at the beginning  the goldman sachs chart what is happening
 is that very rapidly in historical terms the world is being driven
 and shaped not by the old developed countries  but by the developing world we 've seen this in terms of
 the g20 usurping very rapidly the position of the g7 or the g8 
 and there are two consequences of this 
  the west is rapidly
 losing its influence in the world there was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago copenhagen climate change conference 
 europe was not at the final negotiating table  when did that last happen i would wager it was probably about two hundred years ago  
 and that is what is going to happen in the future  and the second implication
 is that the world will inevitably as a consequence become increasingly unfamiliar to us
  because it 'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with or
 conversant with and at last i 'm afraid take europe america is slightly different
 but europeans by and large i have to say are ignorant are unaware
 about the way the world is changing  some people
  an english friend in china and he said the continent is sleepwalking into oblivion 
 well  maybe that 's true maybe that 's an exaggeration  
 but there 's another problem which goes along with this this that europe is increasingly out of touch with the world and that is
 a sort of
 loss
  but this alas is no longer true if you want to feel the future  if you want to taste the future  try china there 's old confucius  this
 is a railway station the likes of which you 've never seen before it doesn 't even look like a railway station this is the new
  bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together  
 or take this now this is an idea  
 but it 's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of beijing here you have a megabus
  on the upper deck carries about two thousand people it travels on rails down a suburban road  and the cars travel
 underneath it and it does speeds of up to about one hundred miles an hour  now
 this is the way things are going to move because china has a very specific problem which is different from europe and different from the united states 
 china has huge numbers of people and no space  so this is a solution to a situation where china 's going to have
  so how would i like to finish well what should our attitude be towards this world that we see
 very rapidly developing before us
  i think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it but i want to argue 
  for two hundred years the world was essentially
 governed by a fragment
 of the human population 
 that 's what europe and north america represented 
 the arrival of countries like china and india between them thirty eight percent of the world 's population and others like indonesia and brazil and so on
  represent
 the most important single act of democratization
 in the last two hundred years civilizations and cultures which had been ignored which had no voice which were not listened to which were not known about will have
 a different sort of representation in this world as humanists we must welcome surely
  transformation  and we will have to learn about these civilizations 
 this big ship here was the one sailed in by zheng he
 in the early  15th century on his great voyages around the south china sea the east china sea and across the indian ocean to east africa  
 the little boat
 in front of it was the one
 in which eighty years later christopher columbus crossed the atlantic or look carefully at this
 silk scroll made by
 zhuzhou
 i think they 're playing golf christ the chinese even invented golf  welcome to the future  thank you
