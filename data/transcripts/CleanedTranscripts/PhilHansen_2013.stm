  i was in art school  i developed a shake in my hand and this was the straightest line i could draw  
 now in hindsight it was actually good for some things like mixing a can of paint or shaking a polaroid 
  at the time this was really doomsday this was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist 
 the shake developed out of really a single minded pursuit of pointillism just years of making tiny tiny dots and eventually these dots went from
 being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles because of the shake  
 so to compensate i 'd hold the pen tighter and this progressively made the shake worse so i 'd hold the pen tighter still and this became a vicious cycle that ended up
  so much pain and joint issues  i had trouble holding anything  and after
 spending all my life wanting to do art i left art school  and then i left art completely 
 but after a few years i just couldn 't stay away from art and i decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and
 discovered i had permanent nerve damage  and
 he actually took one look at my squiggly line and said well why don 't you just embrace the shake
 so i did  i went home i grabbed a pencil and i just started letting my hand shake and shake  i was making all these scribble pictures 
 and even though it wasn 't the kind of art that i was ultimately passionate about it felt great  
 and more importantly once i embraced the shake i realized i could still make art  i just had to find a different approach to making the art that i wanted  
 now i still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism  seeing these little
  tiny dots come together to make this unified whole  so i began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn 't affect the work like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas  
 or in a 3d structure consisting of 
 creating a 2d image by burning it with a
  i discovered that if i worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials my hand really wouldn 't hurt  
 and after having gone from a single approach to art  i ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons 
 this was the first time i 'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation
 could actually drive creativity 
  i was finishing up school and i was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies i had this horrible little set of tools and
 i felt like i could do so much more with the supplies i thought an artist was supposed to have 
 i actually didn 't even have a regular pair of scissors i was using these metal shears until i stole a pair from the office that i worked at  
 so i got out of school  i got a job i got a paycheck i got myself to the art
  i just went nuts buying supplies  and then when i got home i sat down and i set myself to task to
 really try to create something just completely outside of the box  but i sat there for hours  and nothing came to mind 
 the same thing the next day and then the next quickly slipping into a creative slump  
 and i was in a dark place for a long time unable to create and it didn 't make any sense because i was finally able to support my art
 and yet i was creatively blank  
 but as i searched around in the darkness i realized i was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that i never had before and
 it was then that i thought back to my jittery hands embrace the shake and i realized if i ever wanted my creativity
  i had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box
 and get back into it 
 i wondered could you become more creative then by looking for limitations 
 what if i could only create with a dollar 's worth of supplies  
 at this point i was spending a lot of my evenings in well i guess i still spend a lot of my evenings in starbucks but i know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one
  i decided to ask for fifty surprisingly they just handed them right over and then with some pencils i already had i made this project for only eighty cents 
 it really became a moment of clarification for me that
 we need to first be limited
 in order to become limitless  
 i took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas and wondered what if instead of painting on a canvas  i could only paint on my chest  
 so i painted thirty images one layer at a time one on top of another with each
  picture representing an influence in my life 
 or what if instead of painting with a brush i could only paint with karate chops 
 so i 'd dip my hands in paint and i just i just attacked the canvas and i actually hit so hard that i bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks
 i had to rely on other people to create the content for the art  
 so for six days i lived in front of a webcam i slept on the floor and i ate takeout  and i asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life changing moment  
 their stories became the art as i wrote them onto the revolving canvas
  what if instead of making art to display  i had to destroy it 
 this seemed like the ultimate limitation being an artist without art  
 this destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that i called goodbye art  where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation
  the beginning of goodbye art i focused on forced destruction like this image of jimi hendrix made with over seven thousand matches 
 then i opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally  i looked for temporary materials  
 like spitting out food 
 sidewalk chalk and even
 frozen wine 
 the last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn 't actually exist in the first place  so i organized candles on a table 
 i lit them and then blew them out then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles 
  course of this goodbye art series i created  twenty three different pieces
 with nothing left to physically display 
 what i thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation as each time i created 
 the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where
 i felt refreshed and ready to start the next project it did
  failed to get off the ground or even worse after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing  
 but having committed to the process i continued on and something really surprising came out of this as i destroyed each project 
 i was learning to let go 
 let go of outcomes let go of failures
  and let go of imperfections  and in return i found a process of creating art that 's perpetual
 and unencumbered by results  i found myself in a state of constant creation thinking only of what 's next
 and coming up with more ideas than ever 
 when i think back to my three years away from art  away from my dream just going through the motions  
 instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream  
 i just quit  i gave up
  and what if i didn 't embrace the shake  
 because embracing the shake for me wasn 't just about art and having art skills it turned out to be about life and having life skills  
 because ultimately most of what we do
 takes place here inside the box with limited resources  learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations
 is the best hope we have
  to transform ourselves
 and collectively  transform our world looking at limitations as a source of creativity
 changed the course of my life  
 now when i run into a barrier or i find myself creatively stumped 
 i sometimes still struggle but i continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities
  like using hundreds of real live worms to make an image using a pushpin to tattoo a banana
  or painting a picture with hamburger grease 
 one of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that i 've learned into something others can replicate
  limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity but perhaps
 one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts  rethink categories and challenge accepted norms  
 and instead of telling each other to seize the day  maybe
 we can remind ourselves every day
 to seize the limitation
 thank you
