  i 'm
 speaking to you about what i call the mesh it 's essentially a fundamental shift
 in our relationship with stuff with the things in our lives and it 's starting to look at not always and not for everything
 but in certain moments of time access to certain kinds of goods and
  service will trump ownership of them  
 and so it 's the pursuit of better things easily shared and we come from a long tradition of sharing we 've shared transportation  we 've shared wine and food 
  and other sorts of fabulous experiences in coffee bars in amsterdam
  other sorts of entertainment sports arenas public parks concert halls libraries  universities all these things are 
  but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what i refer to as the mother of all 
 and as i think about the mesh and i think about well what 's driving it how come it 's happening now  i think there 's a number of vectors that i want to give you as background 
 one is the recession that the recession has
  caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value so starting to align the value with the true cost  
 secondly  population growth and density into cities more people  smaller spaces less stuff  
 climate change  we 're
  reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet 
 also there 's been this recent distrust of big brands global big brands in a bunch of different industries and that 's created an opening research is 
  showing here in the states and in canada and western europe that most of us are much more open to local
  we went with the big brands that we were sure we trusted and last is that we 're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before
 except for if you 're sitting next to someone 
 the other thing that 's worth considering is that we 've made a huge investment over decades and decades and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our inheritance  it 's a physical
  infrastructure that allows us to get from point a to point b
 and move things that way  it 's also web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems  
 and the investment
 of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance it allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways  and so for me a mesh company the
  company  brings together these three things our ability to connect to each other most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are 
 and web enabled allows us to find each other and find things in time and space and third is that physical things are readable on a map so restaurants 
 a variety of venues but also with gps and other technology like
  expand beyond that we can also track things that are moving like a car a taxicab a transit system a box that 's moving through time and space and so that sets up 
  for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them 
  was actually invented in europe one of the founders went went to switzerland saw it implemented someplace said wow that looks really cool i think we can do that in cambridge 
 brought it to cambridge and
 they started two women
 robin chase being the other person who started
  zipcar got some really important things right  first they really understood that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir  and so they were very clever about the way that they packaged 
 car sharing they made it sexy  they made it fresh they made it aspirational if you were a member of the club  when you 're a member of a club you 're a zipster the cars they picked
  cars that were
 hollowed out or something they picked these sexy cars they targeted to universities they made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car 
  was all matching it was a very nice experience and the cars were clean and reliable  and it all worked and so from a branding perspective  
  they understand that they are an information company  because when we buy a car we go to the dealer once we have an interaction and we 're chow usually as quickly as possible  
 but when you 're sharing a car and you have a car share service  you might use an e v to commute you get a truck because you 're doing a home project when you pick your aunt up at the airport you get a sedan  and
 you 're going to the mountains to ski you get different
  accessories put on
 the car for doing that sort of thing meanwhile these guys are sitting back collecting all sorts of data about our behavior and how we interact with the service  
 and so it 's not only
 an option for them but i believe it 's an imperative for zipcar and other mesh companies to actually
 just wow us to be like a concierge service because we give them so much
  they are entitled to really see how it is that we 're moving they 're in really good shape to anticipate what we 're going to want next  
 and so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car what percentage of the time  
 any guesses
  those are really very good
  i was imagining it was like twenty percent when i first started  the number across the u s and western europe is eight percent  and so basically
 even if you think it 's ten percent
  ninety percent of the time something that costs us a lot of money personally and also we organize our cities around it and all sorts of things
 ninety percent of the time it 's sitting around so for this reason  i think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that if we squeeze hard on
  things that we 've thrown away there 's a lot of value in those things what set up with zipcar zipcar started in two thousand 
 in the last year two thousand and ten two car companies started one
 that 's in the  u k called whipcar and the other one relayrides in the u s they 're both 
  services because the two things that really
  the car has to be available and two it 's within one or two blocks of where you stand well the car that 's one or two blocks from your home or your office is probably your neighbor 's car and it 's probably also available so people have created this business
 zipcar started a decade earlier in two thousand  it took them six years to get one thousand cars in service  
  which started april of last year  it took them six months to get one thousand cars in the service 
 so really interesting people are making anywhere between two hundred and seven hundred dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they 're not using it so it 's like vacation rentals for cars
  since i 'm here and and i hope some people in the audience are in the car business
  it would be really great if any minute now you guys could start rolling share ready cars off because it just creates more flexibility it allows us as owners to have other options and i think we 're going there anyway 
 the opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses and those are businesses like zipcar or netflix
  that are full mesh businesses or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies car manufacturers who are beginning to offer
 their own car share services as well as a second flanker brand or as really a test i think
 is to make sharing irresistible we have experiences in our lives
  when sharing has been irresistible  it 's just how do we make that recurrent and scale it we know also because we 're connected in social networks that
 it 's easy to create delight in one little place  it 's contagious because we 're all connected to each other so if i have a terrific experience and i tweet it or i tell five people standing next to me 
 news travels the opposite as we know is also true often
  so here we have ludotruck which is in l a doing the things that gourmet food trucks do and they 've gathered quite a following  
 in general and maybe  again it 's because i 'm a tech entrepreneur i look at things as platforms platforms are invitations so creating craigslist or itunes 
  and the iphone developer network there are all these networks facebook as well these platforms invite all sorts of developers and all sorts of
 to create and target an application for a particular audience and honestly
  it 's full of surprises because i don 't think any of us in this room could have predicted the sorts of applications that have happened at facebook around facebook for example
  two years ago when mark announced that they were going to go with a platform  so in this way i think that cities are platforms and certainly detroit is
  a platform the
 invitation of bringing makers and artists and entrepreneurs it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity and helps a city to thrive 
 it 's inviting participation and cities have historically  invited all sorts of participation 
 now we 're saying that there 's other options as well so for example
  can open up transit data google has made available transit data api and so there 's about seven or eight cities already in the u s 
 that have provided the transit data and different developers are building applications so i was having a coffee in portland and 
  half of a latte in and the little board in the in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in sixteen minutes and so it 's reliable real data
  that 's right in my face where i am  so i can finish the latte  
 there 's this fabulous opportunity we have across the u s now about twenty one percent of vacant commercial and industrial space 
 that space is not vital the areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement there 's this thing how many people here have heard of
 great  so i 'm a big fan of this and this is a very a very mesh y thing
  essentially there are all sorts of
 restaurants in oakland near where i live  there 's a pop up general store every three weeks  and they do a fantastic job of making a very social
  it happens in a very transitional neighborhood subsequent to that after it 's been going for about a year now they actually started to lease and create and extend an area that was 
  is now starting to become much cooler and and engage a lot more people so this is an example the crafty fox is this woman
  who 's into crafts and she does these pop up crafts fairs around london but these sorts of things are happening in many different environments from my perspective one of the things
  pop up stores do is create perishability and urgency it creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson sold out and the opportunity to really focus trust and attention is a is a wonderful thing  
 allows us to define refine and scale it allows us to test things as an entrepreneur to go to market to be in conversation with people listen  refine something and go back  
 it 's very
 and i 'm willing to share my failures as well though not from the stage 
 laughter i would just like to say that that one of the big things  when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other 
 but also move to to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation 
 two thousand and seven  came forward in paris with a very bold proposition a very big bike sharing service  they made a lot of mistakes they had some number of 
 big successes  but they were very transparent or they had to be in the way that
  bikes in london no one has had to repeat the version one point  zero screw ups and expensive learning exercises that happened in paris 
 so the opportunity when we 're connected is also to share failures and successes we 're
 at the very beginning of something that what we 're seeing and the way that
  mesh companies are coming forward is inviting it 's engaging but it 's very early i have a website
 it 's a directory and it started with about one thousand two hundred companies and in the last two and a half months it 's up to about three thousand three hundred companies  and it grows on a very
 regular daily basis  but it 's it 's very much at the beginning  so i just want to welcome all of you onto the ride  and thank you very much
