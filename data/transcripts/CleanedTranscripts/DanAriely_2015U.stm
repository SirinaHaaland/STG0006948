  it would be nice to be
 objective in life in many ways 
 the problem is that we have these color tinted glasses as we look at all kinds of situations
  think about something as simple as beer  
 if i gave you a few beers to taste and i asked you to rate them on intensity and bitterness different beers would occupy different space  
 but what if we tried to be objective about it in the case of beer it would be very simple what if we did a blind taste  
 well if we did the same thing you tasted the same beer now in the blind taste things would look slightly different  
 most of the beers will go into one place
  will basically not be able to distinguish them and the exception of course will be guinness 
 laughter similarly we can think about physiology  
 what happens when people expect something from their physiology  for example we sold people pain medications some people we told them the medications were expensive some people we told them it was
  and the expensive pain medication worked better it relieved more pain from people because expectations do change our physiology  
 and of course we all know that in sports if you are a fan of a particular team you can 't help but see the game develop from the perspective
 of your team  so all of those are cases in which our preconceived notions and our expectations
  what happened in more
 important questions what happened with questions that had to do with social justice  so we wanted to think about what is the blind tasting version for thinking about inequality  
 so we started looking at inequality and we did some large scale surveys around the u s and other countries  
 so we asked two questions do people know what kind of level of inequality we have and then what level of inequality do we want
 to have 
 so let 's think about the first question  
 imagine i took all the people in the u s and i sorted them from the poorest on the right to the richest on the left  
 and then i divided them into five buckets  the poorest twenty percent the next twenty percent the next the next and the richest twenty percent  
 and then i asked you to tell me how much wealth do you think is concentrated in each of those buckets
  so to make it simpler  imagine i ask you to tell me how much wealth do you think is concentrated in the bottom two buckets  the bottom forty percent 
 take a second think about it and have a number usually we don 't
 think think for a second have a real number in your mind you have it 
 okay here 's what lots of americans tell us they think that the bottom twenty percent has about two point nine percent of the wealth
  the next group has six point four  so together it 's slightly more than nine  the next group
 they say has twelve percent twenty percent  
 and the richest twenty percent people think has fifty eight percent of the wealth  you can see how this relates to what you thought now
 what 's reality reality is slightly different  the bottom twenty percent has zero point one percent of the wealth
 the next twenty percent has zero point two percent of the wealth  together it 's zero point three  the next group has three point nine
 and the richest group has 
  percent of the wealth  so what we actually have and what we think we
  what about what we want  how do we even figure this out  
 so to look at this to look at what we really want  we thought about the philosopher john rawls if you remember john rawls  
 he had this notion of what 's a just society 
 he said a just society is a society that if you knew everything about it you would be willing to enter it in a random place  
  because if you 're wealthy you might want the wealthy to have more money the poor to have less if you 're poor you might want more equality but if you 're going to go into that society
 in every possible situation and you don 't know you have to consider all the aspects 
 it 's a little bit like blind tasting in which you don 't know what the outcome will be when you make a decision  and rawls called this the veil of ignorance 
 so 
 another group a large group of americans and we asked them the question in the veil of ignorance  what are the characteristics of a country that would make you want to join it knowing that you could end randomly at any place  
 and here is what we got  what did people want to give to the first group the bottom twenty percent  they wanted to give them about ten percent of the wealth  
 the next group  fourteen percent of the wealth
  in our sample wanted full equality  nobody thought that socialism is a fantastic idea in our sample 
 but what does it mean it means that we have this knowledge gap between what we have and what we think we have  but we have at least as big a gap between what we think is right
 to what we think we have now we can ask these questions by the way not just about wealth we can ask it about other things as well
  so for example  we asked people from different parts of the world about this question people who are liberals and conservatives  and they gave us basically the same answer 
 we asked rich and poor they gave us the same answer  men and women  npr listeners and forbes readers
  very similar answers we even asked different departments of a university we went to harvard and we checked almost every department 
 and in fact from harvard business school where a few people wanted the wealthy to have more and the [ poor ] to have less  the similarity was astonishing i know some of you went to
 harvard business school  
 we also asked this question about something else we asked what about the ratio of ceo pay to unskilled workers  
 so you can see what people think is the ratio
 and then we can ask the question what do they think should be the ratio  
 and then we can ask what is reality  
 what is reality and you could say well it 's not that bad right the red and the yellow are not that different 
 but the fact is it 's because i didn 't draw them on the same scale  
 it 's hard to see there 's yellow and blue in there
  what about other outcomes of wealth  wealth is not just about wealth we asked what about things like health  
 what about availability of prescription medication  
 what about life expectancy what about life expectancy of infants how do we want this to be distributed
 what about education for young people and
 for older people and across all of those things what we learned was that people don 't like inequality of wealth
  but there 's other things where inequality which is an outcome of wealth is even more aversive to them for example inequality in health or education  
 we also learned that people are particularly open to changes in equality when it comes to people who have less agency
 basically young kids and babies because we don 't think of them as responsible for their situation  so what are some lessons
  from this 
 we have two gaps we have a knowledge gap and we have a desirability gap and the knowledge gap is something that we think about how do we educate people how do we get people to think differently about inequality
 and the consequences of inequality in terms of health education jealousy crime rate and so on 
 then we have the desirability gap how do we get people to think differently about what we really want you see the rawls
  the rawls way of looking at the world the blind tasting approach  takes our selfish motivation out of the picture how do we implement that to a higher degree on a more extensive
 scale  
 and finally we also have an action gap how do we take these things and actually do something about it i
 think part of the answer is to think about people like young kids and babies that don 't have much agency because people seem to be more
  willing to do this 
 to summarize i would say next time you go to drink beer or wine
 first of all think about what is it in your experience that is real 
 and what is it in your experience that is a placebo effect coming from expectations  
 and then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life and hopefully also for policy questions that affect all of us  thanks a lot
