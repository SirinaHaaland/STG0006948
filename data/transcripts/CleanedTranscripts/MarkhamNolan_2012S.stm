  i 've been a journalist now since i was about seventeen 
 and it 's an interesting industry to be in at the moment because as you all know there 's a huge amount of upheaval going on in media and most of you probably know this from the business angle which is that the
 business model is pretty screwed and as my grandfather would say
  profits have all been gobbled up by google so it 's a really interesting time to be a journalist but the upheaval that i 'm interested in is not on the output side it 's on the input side  it 's
 concern with how we get information and how we gather the news  and that 's changed because we 've had a huge shift in the balance of power from
 the news organizations to
  the audience for such a long time was in a position where they didn 't have any way of affecting news or making any change they couldn 't really connect and that 's that 's changed irrevocably my first
 connection with the news media was 
 the bbc had a one day strike  i wasn 't happy i was angry i couldn 't see my cartoons so i wrote a letter 
 and it 's a very effective way of ending your your hate
  still works 
 i 'm not sure if i had any impact on the one day strike but what i do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me  and that was the round journey it took that long for anyone to have any impact and get some feedback 
  and that 's changed now because as journalists we interact in real time we 're not in a position where the audience is reacting to news we 're reacting to the audience  
  to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear  so
 it 's a real time thing it 's much quicker it 's happening on a constant basis and the journalist is always playing catch up 
 to give an example of how we rely on the audience on the 5th of september in
 in costa rica an earthquake hit it was a seven point six
  it was fairly big and sixty seconds is the amount of time it took for it to travel two hundred and fifty kilometers to managua  so the ground shook in managua sixty seconds after it hit the epicenter  
 thirty seconds later the first message went onto twitter  and this was someone saying temblor which means earthquake 
 so sixty seconds was how long it took for the physical earthquake to travel  thirty seconds later news of that earthquake had traveled all around the world 
  everyone in the world  hypothetically had the potential to know that an earthquake was happening
 in managua  
 and that happened because this one person had a documentary instinct which was to post a status update  which is what we all do now so if something happens  we put our status 
  update or we post a photo we post a video  and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream and
 there are seventy two more hours of video on youtube so that 's every second more than an hour of video gets uploaded  and in photos instagram fifty eight photos are uploaded to instagram a second more than three and a half thousand photos
 go up onto facebook 
 so by the time i 'm finished talking here there 'll be eight hundred and sixty four more hours of video on youtube than there were when i started  
 and two and a half million more photos on facebook and instagram than when
  started  so
 it 's an interesting position to be in as a journalist because we should have access to everything any event that happens anywhere in the world  i should be able to know about it pretty much instantaneously
  as it happens for free  and that goes for every single person in this room 
 the only problem is when you have that much information 
  you have to find the good stuff  and that can be incredibly difficult when you 're dealing with those volumes and
 nowhere was this brought home more than during hurricane sandy so what you had in hurricane sandy was a superstorm the likes of which we hadn 't seen for a long time hitting the iphone capital of the universe 
 and you got volumes of media like we 'd never seen before  and that meant that journalists had to deal with fakes  so we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted
  to deal with composite images that were merging
 photos from previous storms we had to deal with images from films like the day after tomorrow and we had to deal with images
 that were so realistic it was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all 
 but joking aside  there were images like this one from instagram which was subjected to a grilling by journalists they weren 't really sure it was filtered in instagram the lighting was questioned
  was questioned about it and it turned out to be true it was from avenue c in downtown manhattan which was flooded  
 and the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source and in this case these guys were new york food bloggers they were
 well respected they were known  so this one wasn 't a debunk it was actually something that they could prove and that was the job of the journalist it was filtering all this stuff 
 and you were instead of going and finding the information and bringing it back to the reader you were holding
  back the stuff that was potentially damaging and finding the source becomes more and more important finding the good source
 and twitter is where most journalists now go it 's like the de facto real time newswire if you know how to use it because there is so much on twitter
  and a good example of how useful it can be but also how difficult was the egyptian revolution in
 twitter lists and lists of good sources people  we could establish were credible were really important 
 and how do you build a list like that from scratch well it can be quite difficult but you have to know what to look for this visualization was done by an italian academic he 's called andr pannison  
 and he basically took the twitter conversation in tahrir square on the day that hosni mubarak would eventually resign  and the dots you can see are
  so when someone retweets a message a connection is made between two dots  and the more times that message is retweeted by other people the more you get to see these nodes these connections being made  
 and it 's an amazing way of visualizing the conversation but what you get is hints at who is more interesting and who is worth investigating  and as the conversation grew and grew
 it became more and
  eventually you were left with this huge big rhythmic
 pointer of this conversation you could find the nodes though and then you went 
 and you go right  i 've got to investigate these people these are the ones that are obviously making sense let 's see who they are 
 now in the deluge of information this is where the real time web gets really interesting for a journalist like myself because we have more tools than ever
 to do that kind of investigation  and when you start digging into the sources you can go further and further than you ever could before
 sometimes you come across a piece of content that is so compelling  you want to use it you 're dying to use it  but you 're not one hundred percent sure if you can because you don 't know if the 
  source is credible you don 't know if it 's a scrape  you don 't know if it 's a re upload and you have to do that investigative work and this video which i 'm going to let run through was one we discovered a couple of weeks ago
  if you 're a news producer this is something you 'd love to run with because obviously this is gold you know this is a fantastic reaction from someone very
 genuine video that they 've shot in their back garden  
 but how do you find if this person if it 's true if it 's faked or if it 's something that 's old and that 's been reposted  so we set about going to work on this video and the
  thing that we had to go on was the username on the youtube account  there was only one video posted to that account  and the username was rita krill  and we didn 't know if rita existed or if it was a fake name but we started looking and we used free internet tools to do so 
 the first one was called spokeo  which allowed us to look for rita krills  so we looked all over the u s we found them in new york we found them in pennsylvania  nevada and florida  
 so we went and we looked for a second free internet tool called wolfram alpha
  checked the weather reports for the day in which this video had been uploaded  
 and when we went through all those various cities we found that in florida  there were thunderstorms and rain on the day  so we went to the white pages  and we found we looked through
 the rita krills in the phonebook  and we looked through a couple of different addresses  and that took us to google maps where we found a house  
 and we found a house with a swimming pool that looked remarkably like rita 's so we went back to the video
  to look for clues that we could cross reference so
 if you look in the video there 's the big umbrella  there 's a white lilo in the pool there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool and there 's two trees in the background  
 and we went back to google maps and we looked a little bit closer and sure enough  there 's the white lilo
  there are the two trees 
  there 's the umbrella it 's actually folded in this photo  little bit of trickery  and there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool  
 so we were able to call rita clear the video make sure that it had been shot  and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being being worried  
 sometimes the search for truth  though is
 a little bit less flippant and it
 has much greater consequences syria has been really interesting for us because obviously a lot of the time you 're trying to debunk
 stuff that can be potentially war crime evidence  so this is where youtube
 actually becomes the most important repository of information about what 's going on in the world  so
 this video i 'm not going to show you the whole thing
 because it 's quite gruesome but you 'll hear some of the sounds this is from hama video and what this video shows 
 when you watch the whole thing through is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck and thrown off a bridge
 the allegations were that these guys were muslim brotherhood and they were throwing syrian army officers ' bodies off the bridge and they were cursing and using blasphemous language  and there were lots of counterclaims about who they were and whether or not they were what the video said it was  
 so we talked to some sources in hama who we had been back and forth with on twitter and we asked them about this and
 the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify three
  different sources said three different things about the bridge they said one the bridge doesn 't exist  
 another one said the bridge does exist but it 's not in hama it 's somewhere else  
 and the third one said i think the bridge does exist  but the dam upstream of the bridge was closed so the river should actually have been dry so this doesn 't make sense 
 so that was the only one that gave us a clue  
 we looked through the video for other clues  we saw the distinctive railings which we could use we looked at the
  curbs the curbs were throwing shadows
 south so we could tell the bridge was running east west across the river it had black and white curbs 
 as we looked at the river itself you could see there 's a concrete stone on the west side  there 's a cloud of blood that 's blood in the river so the river is flowing south to north that 's what that tells me  and also as you look away from the bridge  there 's a divot on the left hand side of the bank and the river
  so onto google maps we go  and we start looking through literally every single bridge we go to the dam that we talked about  we start just literally
 going through every time that road crosses the river crossing off the bridges that don 't match we 're looking for one that crosses east west 
 and we get to hama we get all the way from the dam to hama and there 's no bridge  
 so we go a bit further we switch to the satellite view  and
  and everything starts to line up the bridge looks like it 's crossing the river east to west  so this could be our bridge  and we zoom right in we start to see that it 's got
 a median so it 's a two lane bridge  and it 's got the black and white curbs that we saw in the video  
 and as we click through it  you can see someone 's uploaded photos to go with the map which is very handy  so we click into the photos  and the photos start showing us more detail that we can cross reference with the video  the first
  that we see is we see black and white curbing  which is handy because we 've seen that before  
 we see the distinctive railing that we saw the guys throwing the bodies over  
 and we keep going through it until we 're certain that this is our bridge  so what does that tell me  i 've got to go back now to my three sources and look at what they told me  the one who said the bridge didn 't exist  the one who said the bridge wasn 't in hama and the one guy who said yes the bridge does exist but i 'm not sure about the water levels
  number three is looking like the most truthful all of a sudden and we 've been able to find that out using some free internet tools sitting in a cubicle in an office in dublin
 in the space of twenty minutes  and that 's part of the joy of this although the web is running like a torrent  there 's so much information there that it 's incredibly hard to sift and getting harder every day 
 if you use them intelligently  you can find out incredible information given a couple of clues i could probably find out
  of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out but
 what it tells me is that at a time when there 's more there 's a greater abundance of information than there ever has been it 's harder to filter  
 we have greater tools we have free internet tools that allow us  help us do this kind of investigation  we have algorithms that are smarter than ever before  and computers that are quicker than ever before
