  i was very glad to see goldie hawn because i had
  an apology to make to her i 'd had dinner with her
 about two years ago and i 'd
 she had this big wedding ring and i put it on my
 on my finger and i couldn 't get it off and
 i went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why i had another woman 's big massive big wedding ring on my finger 
 and anyway the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it
 cut off
  going to put up some
 some slides of some of
 your companies here you 've started one or two in your time
  so  you know  virgin atlantic virgin records i guess it all started with a magazine called student
  and then yes all these other ones as well i mean  how do you do this
  i mean i think i learned early on that if you can run one company  you can really run any companies i mean companies are all about
 finding finding the right
  drawing out the best in people and i just love learning and i 'm incredibly inquisitive and
 i love taking on you know the status quo and trying to turn it upside down so
 i 've seen life as one long
 one long learning process and if i see you know  if i fly on somebody else 's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one which it wasn 't
 twenty one years ago then i 'd think well  you know maybe i can create the kind of airline that i 'd like to fly on and so you know so
 got one secondhand seven hundred and forty seven from boeing and gave it a go ca well that was a bizarre thing because you
 you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy  and in fact 
  in a way it almost took down your empire at one point i had a conversation with
 one of the investment bankers who at the time when you you basically sold
 virgin records
 and invested heavily in virgin atlantic and his view was that you were trading you know 
 the world 's fourth biggest record company for the twenty fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind 
 why did you do that rb well
 i think
 that
 there 's a very thin dividing line between success
  and failure and i think if you start a business without financial backing  you 're likely to
 go the wrong side of that dividing line we had
 we were being attacked by british airways they were trying to put our airline out of business and they launched what 's become known as the dirty tricks
  the whole empire was likely to come crashing down unless
 i chipped in a chip and in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company  i had to sell the
  you use the virgin brand a lot and it seems like you 're getting synergy from one thing to the other what does the brand stand for in your head rb 
 well i like to think it stands for quality that you know 
  we have a lot of fun
 and i think the people who work for it enjoy it as i say we go in and shake up other other industries and i think
 you know we do it differently and i think that industries are not quite the same as a result of virgin attacking the market ca i mean there are a
  i was actually also curious why i think you missed an opportunity with your your condoms launch you called it mates i mean couldn 't you have used the virgin brand for that as well ain
 't virgin no longer
  often when you launch a company and you get customer complaints  you know you can deal with them but about three months after the launch of the condom company i had
 a letter a complaint and i sat down and
 wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely but obviously there wasn 't a lot i could do about it and then
  just help us with some of the numbers i mean  what are the numbers on this i mean how big is the group overall
  you 've been photographed in various ways at various times and
 never worrying about
 putting your dignity on the line or anything like that  what was that was that real
  that car that we actually we it was a tedster event there i think  is that could you still pause on that
  when i first came to america i used to try this with employees as well and they kind of they have these different rules over here
  just run a couple more pictures here virgin brides very nice and ok so stop there this was you had
  you like to be called sir richard or how rb nobody 's ever called me sir richard occasionally in america  i hear people saying sir richard and think
 shakespearean play taking place
 but nowhere else anyway ca 
 ok  so can you can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just rb no 
 i suppose if you if you 're having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something
  so that 's the bert rutan designed spaceship rb yeah it 'll be
  ready in twelve months and then we do twelve months extensive testing and then twenty four months from now people will be able to
 take a ride into space ca so
 this interior is philippe starcke designed rb philippe has done
 the yeah quite a bit of it  the logos and he 's building the space station in new mexico and basically
  taken an eye
 and the space station will be one
 giant eye so when you 're in space you ought to be able to see this
 massive eye looking up at you and when you land you 'll be able to
 go back into this this giant eye but he 's an absolute genius when it comes to design ca but you didn 't have him design the engine
  philippe is quite erratic so i think that he wouldn 't be the best person to design the engine
 have you ever regretted that rb many times i mean i think with the
 ballooning and boating expeditions we 've done in the past well i got pulled out of the sea i think six times by helicopters so and each time i
 didn 't expect to come home to tell the tale 
  so in those moments  you certainly wonder what you 're doing up there or ca what was the closest you got to when did you think this is it i might be on my way out
 rb well i think the balloon adventures were each one was was
 each one actually i think we came close and i mean first of all
 we nobody had actually crossed the atlantic in a hot air balloon before  so we
  we had to build a
 hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream  and we weren 't quite sure when a balloon actually got into the jet stream whether it would actually survive the
 two hundred two hundred and twenty miles an hour winds that you can find up there and so just the initial
 lift off from sugarloaf to cross the atlantic as we were pushing into the jet stream this enormous balloon the top of the balloon
 ended up
  going at a couple of hundred miles an hour the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at
 maybe two miles an hour  and it just it just took off and it was like holding onto a thousand horses  and we were just
 crossing crossing every finger  praying that the balloon would hold together which fortunately it did  
  the ends of all those balloon trips were 
 you know something seemed to go wrong every time and on that particular occasion  the more experienced balloonist who was with me
 jumped  and left me holding on for dear life
  oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon with my parachute looking at the swirling clouds below trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the north sea which and it was a very
  i knew i had about half an hour 's fuel left  and i also knew that the chances were that if i jumped i would only have a couple of minutes of life left so
 i climbed back into the capsule and
 just desperately tried to make sure that i was making the right decision and
  wrote some notes to my family and then
 climbed back up again looked down at those clouds again climbed back into the capsule again  and then finally just thought
 there 's a better way i 've got you know this enormous balloon above me it 's the biggest parachute
 ever why not use it and so i managed to fly the
 balloon down through the clouds and about
 fifty feet before i hit the sea threw myself over and the balloon hit the sea and went
  shooting back up to
 ten thousand feet without me  but it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and ca what did you write to your family 
 rb just
 what you what you would do in a situation like that just i love you very much  and
 i 'd already written them a letter before
  they never had to use it ca your companies have had incredible pr value out of these heroics  
 the years and
 until i stopped looking at the polls you were sort of regarded as this great
 hero in the u k and elsewhere and cynics might say you know this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to
 execute his particular style of marketing  how much was the pr
 value part of this rb well of course  the pr experts said that
  as an airline owner the last thing you should be doing
 is heading off in balloons and boats 
  i think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying  you know come on richard  there are better ways of crossing the atlantic
  it was one of the reasons i left
 school when i was fifteen years old and if i
 if i 'm not interested in something 
 i don 't grasp it  as somebody who 's dyslexic you also have some quite bizarre situations i mean for instance 
 i 've had to
 you know i 've been running the largest group of private companies in europe but haven 't been able to know the difference between net and gross
 and so the board the board meetings have been fascinating
  here 's a
 let me draw on a diagram here 's a net in the sea and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net and that 's the profits you 've got left over
  i mean at school so as well as being you know  doing pretty miserably academically but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams so you were kind of a you were a natural leader 
 but just a bit of a were you a rebel then or how would you
  i was fortunately good at sport  and
 so at least i had something to excel at at school ca and
 some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life i mean there 's the story about your your mother allegedly dumping you in a field  aged four and saying ok walk home did this really happen rb 
  felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age so she did things to us which now she 'd be arrested for such as
 pushing us out of the car and telling us to find our own way to granny 's about five miles before we actually got there
 and making us making us go on wonderful long bike rides and we were never allowed to watch television
 you bring them up do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think
 they 're too coddled they don 't know what they 've got we 're going to raise a generation of privileged  rb no i think if you 're bringing up kids you just want to smother them with love and
 praise and
  you didn 't turn out too bad i have to say i 'm your headmaster said to you i mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school he said you 're either going to
 be a millionaire or go to prison and i 'm not sure which which of those happened first 
 rb well i 've done both  i think i went to
  i was actually prosecuted
 under two quite ancient acts in the   u k i was prosecuted under the one thousand eight hundred and eighty nine venereal diseases act
 and the one thousand nine hundred and sixteen indecent advertisements act on the first occasion for mentioning the word venereal disease in public which
 we had a center where we would
 help young people who had problems and one of the problems young people have is venereal disease  and there 's an ancient law that says you can 't actually mention the word venereal disease or print
  it in public  so the police knocked on the door and told us they were going to arrest us if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease we changed it to social diseases
 and people came along with acne and spots but nobody came with vd any more so we put it back to vd and promptly got arrested  
 and then subsequently never mind the bollocks here 's the sex pistols the word bollocks
  police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bollocks on the sex pistols ' album  and
 john mortimer  the playwright defended us and he asked if i could find a linguistics expert to
 come up with a different definition of the word bollocks and so i rang up nottingham university and i asked to talk
  nothing to do with balls whatsoever it 's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century and
 he
 went furthermore i 'm a priest myself and so i said would you mind coming to the court and he said he 'd be delighted and i said and he said would you like me to wear my dog collar and i said
 argued that it was actually never mind the priest here 's the sex pistols and the judge found us reluctantly found us not guilty so 
 ca that is outrageous so
 seriously 
 is there a dark side a lot of people would would say there 's no way that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses without
  knifing a few people in the back you know doing some ugly things you 've been accused of being ruthless there was a nasty biography written about you by someone 
 is any of it true  is there an element of truth in
 it rb i don 't actually think that the stereotype stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top
  generally speaking works i think
 if you treat people well
 people will come back and and come back for more and i think all you have in life is your reputation and
 it 's a very small world and i actually think that the best the best way
 of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with
  like to think that 's how how we run virgin ca and what about
 the people who love you and who see you spending you keep getting caught up in these new projects but it almost feels like you 're
 addicted to launching new stuff you get excited by an idea and  kapow i mean  do you think about life balance
 how do your family feel about each time you step into something big
  also believe that being a father 's incredibly important so from from the time the kids were very young you know 
 when they go on holiday i go on holiday with them  and
 so
 we spend
 a very good sort of three months
 away together yes i 'll you know be in touch we 're very lucky we have this tiny little island in the caribbean
 and we can
  take them there and we can bring friends and
 we can play together  but i can also
 keep keep in touch with what 's going on ca you started talking in in recent years about this term capitalist philanthropy what is that rb 
 capitalism has been proven to be a system that
 works you know the alternative communism has not
  but the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people  and therefore extreme responsibility i think goes
 with that wealth and i think it 's important that the individuals who are in that fortunate position do not end up
 competing for bigger and bigger boats and bigger and bigger cars but you
  use that money to either create new jobs or
 or to tackle tackle issues around the world ca and what are the issues that you worry about most care most about want to turn your
 resources toward rb well there 's i mean there 's a lot of issues i mean global warming certainly is is a
 massive threat to mankind and
 we are putting a lot of time and energy into
  up with alternative fuels and 
 we just launched this this prize  which is really a prize in case in case we don 't get an answer
 on alternative fuels in case we don 't actually manage to get the carbon
 emissions cut down quickly and in case we go through the
  we need to try to encourage people to come up with a way of extracting carbon out of the earth 's atmosphere and
 we just you know there weren 't really people working on that before so we wanted people to try to
 all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that and also to try to extract the methane
 out of the earth 's atmosphere as well and actually we 've had about fifteen thousand people
 fill in the forms saying they want to give it a go
 so we only need one so we 're hopeful ca and you 're also working in africa on a couple of projects rb yes i mean  we 've got
 we 're setting up something called the war room which is maybe the wrong wrong word we 're trying to maybe we 'll change it but anyway  it 's a war room to
 try to coordinate all all the attack that 's going
  there 's a doctor in africa that 's found that if you
 give a mother antiretroviral drugs at twenty four weeks  when she 's pregnant that the baby will not
 will not have hiv when it 's born  and so disseminating that
  to
 around the rest of africa is important ca the war room sounds  it sounds powerful and dramatic and is there a risk that
 the kind of the the business heroes of the
 of the west
 get get so excited about i mean they 're used to having an idea getting stuff done and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world is there a risk that we go to places like africa and say
  we 've got to fix this problem and we can do it i 've got all these billions of dollars you know da da da here 's the big idea and kind of
 take a much more complex situation and actually end up
 making a mess of it do you worry about that
  with accepting hiv and aids are related  but this is a way i think of him tackling tackling this problem
 and instead of
 the world criticizing him it 's a way way of working working with him with his government it 's important that if people do go to africa and do try to help 
 they don 't just go in there and then and then leave after a few years it 's got to be consistent  
  bring their entrepreneurial know how and help governments approach things slightly differently for instance we 're setting up
 clinics in africa
 where we 're going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs free tb treatment and free malaria treatment but we 're also trying to make them
 a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself or bill gates or whatever that this is really being it 's almost driven by some sort of desire again you
 know for the right image for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct 
 what would you say to them rb well i think that everybody
 people do things for a whole variety of different
  when i 'm on me deathbed i will want to feel that
 that i 've made a difference to other people 's lives and that may be a selfish
 a selfish thing to think but it 's the way i 've been brought up i think if i 'm in a position to
 radically change other people 's lives for the better  i should
  people are driven by this desire to grow and that 's where they get their fulfillment
 the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy i mean it seems like you 're still a little bit in the growth
 phases you 're still doing these incredible new plans how much do you think about legacy  and what would you like your legacy to be
 rb i don 't
 think i think too much about legacy i mean i like to you know 
 my grandmother lived to one hundred and one so hopefully i 've got another thirty or forty years to go
 no i just want 
  if i can make a difference i hope to be able to make make a difference  and i think one of the positive things at the moment is you 've got
 sergey and larry from google for instance who are good friends and
 thank god you 've got two people who genuinely care about the world and and with that kind of wealth if they had that kind of wealth and they didn 't care about the world  it
  be very worrying and you know they 're going to make a hell of a difference to the world and i think it 's important that people in in that kind of position do make a difference
