  please close your eyes  and open your hands  
 now imagine what you could place in your hands an apple maybe your wallet  now open your eyes
  what about a life 
 what you see here is a premature baby he looks like he 's resting peacefully  but in fact he 's struggling to stay alive because he can 't regulate his own body temperature 
 this baby is so tiny he doesn 't have enough fat on his body to stay warm  
 sadly twenty million babies like this are born every year around the world 
 four million of these babies die annually  but the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe long term health problems the reason is
  because in the first month of a baby 's life its only job is to grow 
 if it 's battling hypothermia its organs can 't develop normally  resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes to heart disease to low i q 
 imagine many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm 
 that is the primary function of an incubator  but traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to twenty thousand
  dollars so you 're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries 
 as a result parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies ' bodies  or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here methods that are both ineffective and unsafe 
 i 've seen this firsthand over and over again on one of my first trips to india i met this young woman sevitha who had just given birth to a tiny premature
  baby  rani she took her baby to the nearest village clinic and the doctor advised her to take rani to a city hospital
 so she could be placed in an incubator  but that hospital was over four hours away and sevitha didn 't have the means to get there so her baby died 
 inspired by this story and dozens of other similar stories like this my team and i realized what was needed was a local solution
  that could work without electricity that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use given that the majority of births still take place in the home 
 we needed something that was portable something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies
 and something  ultra low cost compared to the twenty thousand dollars that an incubator in the u s costs  
 so this is what we came up with what you see here looks nothing like an incubator it looks like a small sleeping bag for a
  baby you can open it up completely it 's waterproof there 's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily but the magic
 is in this pouch of wax 
 this is a phase change material it 's a wax like substance with a melting point of human body temperature  thirty seven degrees celsius 
 you can melt this simply using hot water
 and then when it melts it 's able to maintain one constant temperature
 for four to six hours at a time after which you simply reheat the pouch so you then
 place it into this little pocket back here
 and it creates a warm 
 for the baby 
 looks simple but we 've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors moms and clinicians to ensure that this
  really meets the needs of the local communities we plan to launch this product in india in two thousand and ten
  and the target price point will be twenty five dollars  less than zero point one percent of the cost of a traditional incubator 
 over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies  but the longer term social impact is a reduction in population growth 
 this seems counterintuitive but turns out that as infant
  mortality is reduced population sizes also decrease because parents don 't need to anticipate that their babies are going to die 
 we hope that the embrace infant warmer
 and other simple innovations like this
 represent a new trend for the future of technology simple localized affordable solutions that have the potential
  to make huge social impact
