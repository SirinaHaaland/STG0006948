  of those forms that
 require a certain kind of intellectual activity  because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in
  might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on
 on the subject 
 i was asked  
 i guess about six years ago to do a series of paintings that in some way
 would celebrate the birth of piero della francesca and it was very difficult
 for me to imagine how to
 paint pictures that were based on piero
 until i realized that i could look at piero as nature
 that i would have the same attitude towards looking
 at piero della francesca as i would if i were looking out a window at a tree  and that was
 enormously liberating to me perhaps it 's not a very
 insightful observation but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations
 based
  on a work by piero in this case that that remarkable
 painting that 's in the uffizi the duke of montefeltro who faces
 his consort battista  once i realized that i could take some liberties with the subject  i did the following
 series of drawings
  real piero della francesca
 one of the greatest
 portraits in human history  and these i 'll just show these without comment it 's just a series
 of variations
 on the head of the duke of montefeltro who 's a great great figure in the renaissance and probably the
  he apparently lost an eye in battle which is why he is always shown in profile  and this is
 battista  
 and then i decided i could move them around a little bit
 so that for the first time in history they 're facing the same direction  whoops
  and then a visitor from another painting by piero this is from the resurrection of christ 
 as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat and now four large panels this is upper left
  i 've never understood
 the conflict between abstraction
 and naturalism  
 since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there doesn 't seem to be an argument there 
 on another subject 
 i was driving in the country one day with my wife
  i saw this sign and i said that
 is a fabulous piece of design and she said what are you talking about i said well  it 's so persuasive because
 the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage  and
 since most people are so suspicious of garages  and know that they 're going to be ripped off they use the word ' reliable
 but everybody says they 're reliable but reliable dutchman 
 fantastic 
 because as soon as you hear the word dutchman which is an archaic word nobody calls dutch people dutchmen anymore
 but as soon as you hear dutchman you get
 this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike preventing the thing from falling and flooding holland
 the
 entire issue is detoxified by the use of dutchman now if you think i 'm exaggerating at all in this all you have to do is substitute
 something else like
  but you know it 's going to cost a lot of money 
 i 'm going to take you quickly
 through the actual process of doing a poster  
 i do a lot of work for the school of visual arts where i teach and the director of this school a remarkable man named silas rhodes often gives you
 a piece of text
  he says do something with this and so he did and this was the text in words as fashion the same rule will hold alike fantastic if too new or old
 be not the first by whom the new are tried nor yet the last to lay the old aside i could make nothing of that 
 and i really struggled with this one and the first thing i did which was sort of in the absence of another idea was say i 'll sort of write it out and make some words big and i
  some kind of design on the back
 somehow and i was hoping as one often does to stumble into something so i took another
 crack at it you 've got to keep it moving and i xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and i pasted them down on an ugly board 
 i thought that something
 would come out of it like words rule fantastic new old first last pope
 because it 's by alexander pope but i sort of made a mess out of it and then i thought i 'd repeat it in some way so it was legible so it was going nowhere  
 sometimes in the middle of a resistant problem i write down things that i know about it  
 but you can see the beginning of an idea there  because you can see the word new
  that 's what happens there 's a relationship between the old and the new the new emerges from the context of the old 
 and then i did some variations of it but
 it still wasn 't coalescing graphically at all i had this other version which had something interesting about it
 in terms of
 being able to put it together in your mind from clues the w was clearly a w the n was clearly an n 
 even though they were very fragmentary and
 wasn 't a lot of information in it  then i got the words new and old and now i had regressed back to
 a point where there seemed to be no return  i was really desperate
 at this point  and so i do something i 'm
 truthfully ashamed of which is that i took two drawings i had made for another purpose
 and i
  put them together it says dreams at the top and i was going to do a thing i say well change the copy let it say something about
 dreams and come 
 sort of fulfill your dreams but to my credit  i was so
 embarrassed about doing that that i never submitted this sketch and finally i
 arrived at the following solution  
 now  it doesn 't look terribly interesting  but it does have something that
 distinguishes it from a lot of other
 posters for one thing it transgresses the idea of what a poster 's
  which is to be understood and seen
 immediately  
 and not explained  i remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts if you have to explain it it ain 't working 
 and one day i woke up and i said well suppose that 's not true 
 so here 's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left
  says thoughts 
 this poem is impossible  
 silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations this one generates no imagery at all i am now exposing myself to my audience 
 right which is something you never want to do professionally 
 maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening what 's the heart of this poem don 't be trendy if you want to be serious
  doing the poster this way trendy in itself  
 i guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old 
 like this and then i show you a little drawing you see you remember that old
 thing i discarded well i found a way to use it  so there 's that little
  but more didactic than visual maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace a kind of dance where each defines the other 
 and then more self questioning am i being simple minded 
 is this the kind of simple that looks obvious or the kind that looks profound there 's a significant difference this could be embarrassing  
 actually i realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition
 do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school well
 i think there are two fresh things here two fresh things 
 one is
 the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience  and not to suggest
  that i am confident about
 what i 'm doing and as you know 
 you have to have a front  i mean you 've got to be confident if you don 't believe in your work
  who else is going to believe in it  so that 's one thing 
 to introduce the idea of doubt
 into graphics that can be a big contribution the other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the
  price of one you get the big one and if you don 't like that how about the little one 
 and that too is
 a relatively new idea and here 's just a series of experiments
 where i ask the question of does a poster have to be square now this is a little illusion that poster is not folded
  's not folded that 's a photograph and it 's cut on the diagonal same cheap trick in the upper  left hand corner  
 and here 
 a very peculiar poster because simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer 
 it won 't sit still in the space at times it seems to be wider at the back than the
  front and then it shifts and if you sit here long enough it 'll float off the page into the audience but we don 't have time 
 laughter and then an experiment
 a little bit about the nature of perspective where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective but the shape of the bottle which is
 identical to the outside shape is seen frontally
 and another piece for the art directors ' club
 is anna rees casting long shadows this is another poster from the school of visual arts  there were ten artists
 invited to participate in it and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and i didn 't want to be embarrassed
  so i worked very hard
 on this the idea was and it was a brilliant idea was to have ten posters distributed throughout the city 's subway system
 so every time you got on the subway you 'd be passing a different poster all of which
 had a different idea of what art is but
 i was absolutely stuck on the idea of art is and trying to
 determine what art was but then i gave up and i said
  is whatever and as soon as i said that i discovered that the word hat was hidden in the word whatever and that led me to
 the inevitable conclusion but then again  it 's on my list of didactic posters 
 my intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster in case you don 't get it
  note to the viewer  
 i thought i might use a visual cliche of our time magritte 's everyman to express the idea that art is mystery continuity and history  
 i 'm also convinced that in an age of computer manipulation surrealism has become banal 
 a shadow of its former self 
 the phrase ' art is whatever ' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art making a sort of ' it ain 't what you do it 's the way that you do it ' notion the shadow of magritte
  the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow
 man isolates the word ' hat ' hidden in the word  ' whatever '
 the four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined as a thing itself  the worth of the thing the shadow of the thing  and the shape of the thing
  the one that i did not submit  which i still like  i wanted to use the same phrase there were
 wonderful experiments by bruno munari
 on letterforms some years ago sort of see how far you could go and still be able to read them and that idea stuck in my head
  but then i took the pieces that i had taken off and put them at the bottom and 
 of course those are the remains  and they 're so labeled but what really happens is that you read it as art is whatever remains
