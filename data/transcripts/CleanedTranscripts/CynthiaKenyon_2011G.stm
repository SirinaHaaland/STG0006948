  have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer and put off aging  this is a dream of the ages but scientists
 have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible  they thought you just wear out there 's nothing you can do about it kind of like an old shoe
  if you look in nature  you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans  
 now these animals are different from one another because they have different genes  so that suggests that somewhere in these genes somewhere in the dna are genes for aging  genes that allow them to have different lifespans  
 so if there are genes like that  then you can imagine that if you could change one of the genes in an experiment an aging gene
 maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan  
 and if you could do that then you could find the genes for aging and if they exist and you can find them then maybe one could eventually do something about it 
 so we 've set out to look for genes that control aging and we didn 't study any of these animals instead we studied a little tiny round worm called c 
  which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence  and we were really optimistic that we could find something because there had been a report of a long lived mutant  
 so we started to change genes at random looking for long lived animals and we were very lucky to find that mutations that damage one single gene called daf 2 doubled the lifespan of the little worm  
 so you can see in black  after a month
  that 's why we like to study them for studies of aging in black  after a month the normal worms are all dead  but at that time  most of the mutant worms
 are still alive  and it isn 't until twice as long that they 're all dead  and now i want to show what they actually look like in this movie here  
 so the first thing you 're going to see is the normal worm when it 's about college student age a young adult it 's quite a cute little fellow  
 and next you 're going to see the
 when it 's young so this animal is going to live twice as long is it miserable it doesn 't seem to be it 's active you can 't tell the difference really 
 and they can be completely fertile have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do 
 now get out your handkerchiefs here you 're going to see in just two weeks the normal worms are old  you can see the little head moving down at the bottom there
  everything else is just lying there the animal 's clearly in the nursing home  and if you look at the tissues of the animal they 're starting to deteriorate 
 you know even if you 've never seen one of these little c elegans which probably most of you haven 't seen one you can tell they 're old isn 't that interesting so there 's something about
 aging that 's kind of universal  and now here is the 
 one gene is changed out of twenty thousand and look at it it 's the same age but it 's not in the nursing
  what 's really cool it 's aging more slowly it takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day  
 and when i tell people about this they tend to think of maybe an eighty or ninety year old person who looks really good for being ninety or eighty but it 's really more like this
  and you say well how old are you she says i 'm sixty that 's what it 's like and you would never know you would never know until she told you 
 so what is the daf 2 gene well as you know genes which are part of the dna 
 they 're instructions to make a protein that does something and the daf 2 gene encodes a hormone receptor
  so what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell so part of it is like a baseball glove part of it 's on the outside and it 's catching the hormone as it 
  comes by in green  and the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell  
  the animal lives longer  so that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging 
 that 's what that arrow means it speeds up aging it makes it go faster  so it 's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself speeding up aging
 so this is altogether really really interesting it says that
 aging is subject to control by the genes and specifically by hormones  so what kind of hormones are
 there 's lots of hormones there 's testosterone adrenalin you know about a lot of them these hormones are similar to
 hormones that we have in our bodies 
 the daf 2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and igf 1 now you 've all heard of at least insulin insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal  
  growth  so these functions were known for these hormones for a long time  but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about
 maybe they also affect aging 
 and it 's looking like that 's the case so after we made our discoveries with little c elegans people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking if we made the same daf 2 mutation the hormone receptor mutation 
 in other animals will they live longer and that is the
  case in flies  if you change this hormone pathway in flies they live longer and also in mice and mice are mammals like us  
 so it 's an ancient pathway because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution such that it still works in all these animals and also the common precursor also gave rise to people so maybe it 's working in people the same way
  and there are hints of this so for example there was one study that was done in a population of ashkenazi jews in new york city and just like any population most of the people
 live to be about seventy or eighty  but some live to be ninety or one hundred and what they found was that
 people who lived to ninety or one hundred were more likely to have daf 2 mutations that is changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for igf 1 
  made the gene
 not act as well as the normal gene would have acted  it damaged the gene
 so those are hints suggesting that humans are susceptible to the effects of the hormones
 for aging  
 so the next question of course is is there any effect on age related disease as you age you 're much more likely to get cancer  alzheimer 's disease  heart disease all sorts of diseases it turns out that these long lived mutants are more resistant to
  all these diseases they hardly get cancer  and when they do it 's not as severe  
 so it 's really interesting  and it makes sense in a way that they 're still young so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old
  so it suggests that if we could
 have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age related diseases all at once
  so how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging  how could that work 
 well it turns out that in the daf 2 mutants 
 a whole lot of genes are switched on in the dna that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues and repair damage  
 and the way that they 're switched on is by a gene regulator protein called foxo so in a daf 2 mutant you see that i have the x drawn here
  the receptor the receptor isn 't working as well under those conditions the foxo protein in blue has gone into the nucleus that little compartment there in the middle of the cell
 and it 's sitting down on a gene binding to it you see one gene there are lots of genes actually that bind on foxo and it 's just sitting on one of them 
 so foxo turns on a lot of genes and the genes it turns on includes antioxidant
  whose protein products
 actually help other proteins to function well to fold correctly and function correctly and it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they 're damaged 
 dna repair genes are are more active in these animals  and the immune system is more active  
 and many of these different genes we 've shown actually contribute to the long lifespan of the
  so it 's really interesting these animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do 
 they have the ability to protect themselves from many kinds of damage  which we think makes them live longer  
 so what about the normal worm well when the daf 2 receptor is active  
 then it triggers a series of events that prevent foxo from getting into the nucleus where the
  so it can 't turn the genes on 
 that 's how it works that 's why we don 't see the long lifespan until we have the daf 2 mutant  but what good is this for the worm  well we think that insulin and igf 1 hormones are hormones that are particularly 
  active under favorable conditions in the good times when food is plentiful and there 's not a lot of stress in the environment 
  we think is that  under conditions of stress  the levels of these hormones drop for example having limited food supply
  and that we think is registered by the animal as a danger signal a signal that things are not okay and that it should roll out its protective capacity  
 so it activates foxo foxo goes to the dna and that triggers
 the expression of these genes that improves the ability of the cell to protect itself and repair itself and that 's why we think the animals live longer
  so you can think of foxo as being like
 a building superintendent  so maybe he 's a little bit lazy but he 's there he 's taking care of the building  but it 's deteriorating and then suddenly he learns that there 's going to be a hurricane 
 so
 he doesn 't actually do anything himself he gets on the on the telephone just like foxo gets on the dna
 and he calls up the roofer  the window person the painter
 the floor person and they all come and they fortify the house and then the hurricane comes through and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in and not only that it can also just last longer  even if there isn 't a hurricane  
 so that that 's the concept here
 for how we think this life extension ability exists now the really cool thing about foxo is that
 there are different forms of it we all have foxo genes
 exactly the same form of the foxo gene just like we all have eyes  but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes and there are certain forms of the foxo gene
 that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be ninety or one hundred  
 and that 's the case all over the world as you can see from these stars and each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked okay are there differences in the type of
  foxo genes among people who live a really long time and there are we don 't know the details of how this works but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people  
 and that means that maybe if we tweak it a little bit we can increase
 the health and longevity of people  so this is really exciting to me a foxo is a protein that we found in these little round worms to affect lifespan and here it
  affects lifespan in people  so we 've been trying in our lab now to develop drugs
 that will activate this foxo cell using human cells now
 in order to try and come up with drugs that will delay aging and age related diseases  
 and i 'm really optimistic that this is going to work there are lots of different proteins that are known to affect
  and for at least one of them there is a drug  there 's one called tor which is another nutrient sensor like the insulin pathway  
 and mutations that damage the tor gene just like the daf 2 mutations extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice 
 but in this case there 's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the tor protein and inhibits its activity  
 and you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse even when it 's pretty old like age sixty for a human that old for a mouse if you give the
  mouse
 rapamycin it will live longer  now i don 't want you all to go out taking rapamycin it is a drug for people but the reason is
 it suppresses the immune system so people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected  so this may not be the perfect drug
 for staying young longer  but still here in the year two thousand and eleven  there 's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan
  which comes out of this science that 's been done in all these different animals 
 so i 'm really optimistic and i think it won 't be too long i hope  before this age old dream begins to come true  thank you
  let me get this straight  although you 're looking for a drug that can solve aging in
 old men like me 
 what you could do now pretty well in the lab if you were allowed ethically 
 is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer
  the kinds of drugs i was talking about would not change the genes  they would just bind to the protein itself
 and change its activity  so if you stop taking the drug the protein would go back to normal 
 you could change the genes in principle there isn 't the technology to do that but i don 't think that 's a good idea and the reason is
 that these these hormones like the insulin and the igf hormones and the tor pathway  they 're essential if you knock them out completely
 then you 're very sick  so it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any
 any problems and i think that 's much better that kind of control would be much better
 as a drug and also there are other ways of activating foxo that don 't even involve insulin or igf 1 that might even be safer
  a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about which is a negligible senescence there are some creatures on this planet already that don 't really
 do aging  just move to one side for us if you would ck there are there are some animals that don 't seem to age for
  tortoises called blanding 's turtles 
 and they they grow to be about this size and they 've been tagged  and they 've been found to be seventy years old and when you look at these seventy year old turtles  you can 't tell the difference just by looking between those turtles and twenty year old turtles 
 and the seventy year old ones actually they 're better at scouting out the good nesting places  and they also have more progeny every year
 and there are other examples of these kinds of animals like turns certain kinds of birds are like this and nobody knows
 if they really can live forever or what keeps them from aging it 's not clear  
 if you look at birds which live a long time cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or
  hydrogen peroxide things like that and our  long lived mutants are too they 're more resistant to these kinds of stresses  so it could be that the pathways that i 've been talking about
  which are set to run really quickly in the worm have a different
 normal set point
 in in something like a bird so that a bird can live a lot longer and maybe they 're even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all but we don 't know mr 
 but what you 're talking about here is not
 extending human lifespan by preventing
  that 's right it 's more like say if you were a dog  you notice that you 're getting old and you look at your human and you think 
 why isn 't this human getting old they 're not getting old in the dog 's lifespan it 's more like that  but now we 're the human looking out and imagining a different human 
 thank you very much indeed
