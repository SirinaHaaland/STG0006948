  the first patient to ever be treated with an antibiotic
 was a policeman in oxford on his day off from work  he was scratched by a rose thorn while working in the garden 
 that small scratch became infected over the next few days his head was swollen with abscesses
  and
 in fact his eye was so infected that they had to take it out and by february of one thousand nine hundred and forty one this poor man was on the verge of dying  
 he was at radcliffe infirmary in oxford  and fortunately for him a small team of doctors led by a dr howard florey
 had managed to synthesize a very small amount of penicillin  a drug that had been
  discovered twelve years before by alexander fleming
 but had never actually been used to treat a human  and indeed no one even knew if the drug would work  if it was full of impurities that would kill the patient 
 but florey and his team figured if they had to use it they might as well use it on someone who was going to die anyway  
 so
  he started getting better his fever went down his appetite came back  second day he was doing much better 
 they were starting to run out of penicillin so what they would do was run with his urine across the road to re synthesize the penicillin from his urine and give it back to him  
 and that worked day four well on the way to recovery this was
  miracle day five they ran out of penicillin  and the poor man died  
 so that story didn 't end that well  but fortunately for
 millions of other people like this child who was treated again in the early 1940s who was again dying of a
  and within just six days you can see recovered thanks to this wonder drug penicillin  millions have lived  and
 global health has been transformed now antibiotics have been used for
 patients like this 
 but they 've also been used rather frivolously in some instances for treating someone with just a cold or the flu which they might not have responded to an antibiotic  
 and they 've also been used in large
  quantities
  which means in small concentrations to make chicken and hogs grow faster just to save a few pennies on the price of meat 
 we 've spent a lot of antibiotics on on animals not for treatment not for sick animals but primarily for growth promotion  
  what did that lead us to basically the massive use of antibiotics around the world
 has imposed such large selection pressure on bacteria
 that resistance is now a problem because we 've now selected for just the resistant bacteria  and
 i 'm sure you 've all read about this in the newspapers you 've seen this in every magazine that you come across but i really want you to appreciate the significance of this problem 
 this is serious the next slide i 'm about to show
  you is of
 carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug  and carbapenem is pretty much the strongest class of antibiotics that we can throw at at this bug  
 and
 you can see in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine this is the pattern of resistance mostly under about ten percent across the united states now watch what happens when we play the video
 so i don 't know where you live  
 but wherever it is it certainly is a lot worse now than it was in one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine 
 and that is the problem of antibiotic resistance it 's a global issue affecting both rich and poor countries 
  the heart of it you might say well  isn 't this really just a medical issue if we taught doctors how not to use antibiotics as much if we taught patients how not to demand antibiotics perhaps this really wouldn 't be an issue  
 and maybe the pharmaceutical companies should be working harder to develop more antibiotics now 
 it turns out that there 's something fundamental about antibiotics
 which makes it different from other drugs which is that if i misuse antibiotics or i use antibiotics
  not only am i affected but others are affected as well  in the same way as if i choose to drive to work or take a plane
 to go somewhere 
 that the costs i impose on others through global climate change go everywhere and i don 't necessarily take these costs into consideration 
 this is what economists might call a problem of the commons  and the problem of the commons is
 exactly what we face in the case of antibiotics as well  
 that we don 't consider and we including individuals patients hospitals  entire health systems do not consider the costs that they impose on others by the way antibiotics are actually used 
 now that 's a problem that 's similar to another area that we all know about which is of fuel use and energy and of course energy use both depletes energy as well as
 leads to to local pollution and climate change
  and typically in the case of energy there are two ways in which you can deal with the problem one is we can make better use of the oil that we have  and that 's analogous to making better use of existing antibiotics and we can do this in a number of ways that we 'll talk about in a second 
 but the other option is the drill baby drill option which in the case of antibiotics is is to go find new antibiotics  now  these are not separate
  they 're related because if we invest heavily in new oil wells  we reduce the incentives for conservation of oil in the same way that 's going to happen for antibiotics  
 the reverse is also going to happen which is that if we use our antibiotics appropriately  
 we don 't necessarily have to make the investments in in new drug
  if you thought that these two were entirely fully balanced between these two options you might consider the fact that
 this is really a game that we 're playing 
 the game is really one of coevolution and coevolution is in this particular picture between cheetahs and gazelles cheetahs have evolved to run faster because if they didn 't run faster  they wouldn 't get any lunch  
 gazelles have evolved to run faster because if they don 't run faster they would be lunch
  we 're playing against the bacteria except we 're not the cheetahs we 're the gazelles  and the bacteria
 would just in the course of this little talk would have had kids and grandkids and figured out how to be resistant
 just by selection and trial and error trying it over and over again  whereas how do we stay ahead of
  we have drug discovery processes  screening molecules we have clinical trials and then when we think we have a drug then we have the fda regulatory process  
 and once we go through all of that then we try to stay one step ahead of
 of the bacteria  now this is clearly not a game that can be sustained or one that we can win by simply innovating to stay ahead we 've got to slow the
 pace of coevolution down  and there are ideas
  that we can borrow from energy
 that are helpful in thinking about how we might want to do this in the case of antibiotics as well  
 now  if you think about how we deal with energy pricing for instance we consider emissions taxes  which means we 're imposing the costs of pollution on people who actually use that energy 
 we might consider doing that for antibiotics
  perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics actually get used appropriately 
 there are clean energy subsidies which are to switch to fuels which don 't pollute as much or perhaps don 't need fossil fuels 
 now the analogy here is perhaps we need to move away from using antibiotics and if you think about it what are good substitutes for antibiotics  
 well  turns out that anything that reduces the need for the antibiotic would really work  so that could
 include improving hospital
  infection control
 or vaccinating people  particularly against the seasonal influenza  
 and the seasonal flu is probably the biggest driver of antibiotic use both in this country as well as in many other countries  
 and that could really help 
 a third option might include something like tradeable permits
  consider the fact that we might not have antibiotics for many people who have infections 
 we might consider the fact that we might want to allocate who actually gets to use some of these antibiotics
 over others and some of these might have to be on the basis of clinical need but also on the basis of pricing  and certainly consumer education works very
  or prescribe too much without necessarily knowing that they do so 
 and feedback mechanisms have been found to be useful  both on on energy when you tell someone that they 're using a lot of energy during peak hour they tend to cut back 
  and the same sort of example has been performed even in the case of antibiotics a hospital in st louis basically would put up on a chart
  the names of surgeons in the ordering of how much antibiotics they 'd used
 in the previous month  and this was purely an informational feedback there was no shaming  but essentially that provided some information back to surgeons that maybe they could rethink how they were using antibiotics  
 now  there 's a lot that can be done on the supply side as well  if you look at the price of penicillin  the cost per day is about ten cents it 's a fairly cheap drug  if you take drugs that have been introduced since then
  more expensive  so to a world that has been used to paying ten cents a day for antibiotics  the idea of paying one hundred and eighty dollars per day seems like a lot 
 but what is that really telling us that price is telling us that we should no longer
 take cheap effective antibiotics as a given into the foreseeable future  and that price is a signal to us
  that perhaps we need to be paying much more attention to conservation that price is also a signal
 that maybe we need to start looking at other technologies in the same way that gasoline prices are a signal
 and an impetus to say the development of electric cars 
 prices are important signals and we need to pay attention but we also need to consider the fact that
 although these high prices seem
  unusual for antibiotics 
 they 're nothing compared to the price per day of some cancer drugs which might save a patient 's life only for a few months or perhaps a year  whereas antibiotics would potentially save a patient 's life forever  
 so this is going to involve a whole new paradigm shift and it 's also a scary shift because in many
 parts of this country
  in many parts of the world the idea of paying two hundred dollars for a day of antibiotic treatment is simply unimaginable 
 so we need to think about that 
 now there are backstop options which is other alternative technologies that people are working on it includes bacteriophages probiotics  quorum sensing
 synbiotics now  all of these are
  useful avenues to pursue and they will become even more lucrative
 when the price of new antibiotics starts going higher  and we 've seen that the market does actually respond  
 and the government is now considering ways of subsidizing new antibiotics and development  
 but there are challenges here  we don 't want to just throw money at a problem what we want to be able to do is invest in new antibiotics in ways that actually encourage
 appropriate use and sales of those antibiotics and that really is
  challenge here  now  going back to these technologies you all remember the line from that famous
 dinosaur film nature will find a way so it 's not as if these are permanent solutions we really have to
 remember that whatever the technology might be that nature will find some way to to work around it 
 you might think well this is just a problem just with antibiotics and with bacteria but it turns out that we have the exact
  same identical problem in many other fields as well  with
 multidrug resistant tuberculosis  which is a serious problem in india and south africa  thousands of patients are dying because the second line drugs are so expensive  and in some instances even those don 't work and you have xdr tb 
 viruses are becoming resistant  
  right now much of the world depends on one drug  artemisinin drugs 
 essentially to treat malaria resistance to artemisinin has already emerged  and if this were to become widespread that puts at risk
 the single drug that we have to treat malaria around the world in a way that 's currently safe and efficacious
 mosquitos develop resistance if you have kids you probably know about head lice  and if you 're from new york city i understand that the specialty there
  is bedbugs  so those are also resistant 
 and we have to bring an example from across the pond turns out that rats are also resistant to poisons  now what 's common to all of these things is the idea that we 've had 
  these technologies to control nature only for the last seventy eighty or one hundred years
  we have squandered our ability to control because we have not recognized that natural selection and evolution was going to find a way to get back  and we need to completely rethink
 how we 're going to use
 measures to control biological organisms and rethink how we incentivize
 the development introduction in the case of antibiotics
  of these valuable resources  and we really now need to start thinking about them as as natural resources  
 and so we stand at a crossroads an option is to is to go through that rethinking and carefully consider incentives to change how we do business  
 the alternative is
 is a world in which even a blade of grass is a potentially lethal weapon thank you
