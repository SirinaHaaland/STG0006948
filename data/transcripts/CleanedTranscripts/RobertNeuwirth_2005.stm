  what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow
  gandhi national park in bombay india what 's called mumbai these days
 this is hosinia the largest and most urbanized favela in rio de janeiro
 and this is sultanbelyi which is one of the largest squatter communities in istanbul
 they are what i consider to be the cities of tomorrow the new urban world now why
  do i say that to tell you about that i have to talk about this fellow here his name is julius
 and i met julius
 the last week that i was living in kibera so i had been there almost three months
 and i was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and julius was tagging along and he was bug eyed and at certain points we were walking around he grabbed
  my hand for support which is something most kenyans would never consider doing they 're very polite and they don 't get so forward so quickly
 and i found out later that it was julius first day
 in nairobi
 and he 's one of many
 so close to two hundred thousand people a day migrate from the
  rural to the urban areas
 and i 'm going to be fair to the statisticians who talked this morning not almost one five million people a week but almost one four million people a week but i 'm a journalist and we exaggerate so almost one five million people a week close to seventy million people
 a year
 and if you do the math that 's one hundred and thirty people every minute so that 'll be in the eighteen
  that i 'm given to talk here between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities
 and here are the statistics today a billion squatters one in six people on the planet
 twenty thirty two billion squatters one in four people on the planet
 and the estimate is that in twenty fifty there 'll be three billion squatters better than one in three people on earth so
 these are the cities of the future and
 we have to engage them and i was thinking this morning of
 the good life and before i show you the rest of my presentation i 'm going to violate ted rules here and i 'm going to read you something
 from my book
 as quickly as i can
  because i think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is
 so
 the hut was made of corrugated metal set on a concrete pad it was a ten by ten cell
 armstrong o 'brian jr shared it with three other men
 armstrong and his friends
  had no water they bought it from a nearby tap owner no toilet the families in this compound shared a single pit latrine
 and no sewers or sanitation
 they did have electricity but it was illegal service tapped from someone else 's wires and could only power one feeble bulb
 this was southland a small shanty community on the western side of nairobi kenya but it could 've been
  anywhere in the city because more than half the city of nairobi lives like this one five million people stuffed into mud or metal huts with no services no toilets no rights
 armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation they paid fifteen hundred shillings in rent about twenty bucks a month
 a relatively high price for a kenyan shantytown and they could not afford to be late with the money in case you owe one
  month the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out he will confiscate your things armstrong said not one month one day
 his roommate hilary kibagendi onsomu who was cooking ugali the spongy white cornmeal concoction that is the staple food in the country cut into the conversation
 they called their landlord a wabenzi meaning that he is a person who has enough money to drive a mercedes benz
  hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof and we perspired as we ate after we finished armstrong straightened 
  his tie put on a wool sports jacket and we headed out into the glare outside a mound of garbage formed the border between southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of langata it was perhaps eight feet tall forty feet
  long and ten feet wide
 and it was set in a wider watery ooze as we passed two boys were climbing the mount kenya of trash
 they couldn 't have been more than five or six years old they were barefoot and with each step their toes sank into the muck sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile
 i thought they might be playing king of the hill
 but i was wrong once
  atop the pile one of the boys lowered his shorts squatted and defecated
 the flies buzzed hungrily around his legs
 when twenty families one hundred people or so share a single latrine a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing
 but it stood in jarring
 contrast to something armstrong had said as we were eating that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood for armstrong southland wasn 't constrained by its material conditions 
 instead the human spirit radiated out from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something no legal neighborhood could
  have stayed here you cannot go back he meant back beyond that mountain of trash back in the legal city of legal buildings with legal leases and legal rights
 once you have stayed here he said you can stay for the rest of your life
 so he has hope and this is where these communities start this is perhaps
  the most primitive shanty that you can find in kibera little more than a stick and mud hut next to a garbage heap
 this is getting ready for the monsoon in bombay india this is home improvement
 putting plastic tarps on your roof this is
 in rio de janeiro and it 's getting a bit better right we 're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile
  and little pieces of signs and plaster over the brick some color
 and this is sulay montakaya 's house in sultanbelyi and it 's getting even better
 he 's got a fence he scavenged a door he 's got new
 tile on the roof and then you get rocinha and you can see
 that it 's getting even better the buildings here are multi story they develop
  you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other room after room after room and
 what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories and they sell their loggia or roof rights
 and someone else builds on top of their building and then that person sells the roof rights and someone else builds on top of their building
 all of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick and then you get sultanbelyi in turkey
 where it 's even built to a higher level of design the crud in the front is mattress stuffing and you see that all over turkey people dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs 
 but the green building on behind you can see that the top floor is not occupied so people are building with the possibility of expansion and it 's built to a pretty high standard
  of design
 and then you finally get squatter homes like this which is built on the suburban model hey that 's a single family home in the squatter community that 's also in istanbul turkey
 they 're quite vital places these communities this is the main drag of rocinha the estrada da gavea and there 's a bus route
 that runs through it lots of people out on the street these communities in these cities are actually more vital
 than the illegal communities they have more things going on in them
 this is a typical pathway in
  called a beco these are how you get around the community it 's on very steep ground they 're built on the hills inland from the beaches
 in rio and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions so that 's just a rock in the hillside and
 these becos are normally very crowded and people hump furniture up them or refrigerators up them all sorts of things
 beer is all carried
  in on your shoulders beer is a very important thing in brazil
 this is commerce in kenya right along the train tracks
 so close to the train tracks that the merchants sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way
 this is a marketplace also in kenya toi market lots of dealers in almost everything you want to buy
 those green things in the foreground are mangoes
 this is a shopping street in
  kibera and you can see that there 's
 a soda dealer a health clinic two beauty salons a bar two grocery stores and a church and more it 's a typical
 downtown street it just happens to be self built
 this here on the right hand side is what 's called a if you look at the fine print under the awning it 's a hotel
 and what hotel means in
  kenya and india is an eating place so that 's a restaurant
 people steal electrical power this is rio people tap in and they have
 thieves who are called grillos
 or crickets and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood people burn trash to get rid of the garbage
 and they dig their own sewer
  channels talk about more plastic bags than plankton and sometimes they have natural trash disposal
 and when they have more money they cement their streets and they put in sewers and good water pipes and stuff like that
 this is water going to rio people
 run their water pipes all over the place and that little hut right there has a pump in it and that 's what people do they steal
  electricity they install a pump and they tap into the water main and pump water up to their houses
 so the question is how do you go from the mud hut village
 to the more developed city to the even highly developed sultanbelyi i say there are two things one is people need a guarantee they won 't be evicted
 that does not necessarily mean property rights and i would disagree with hernando de soto
  on that question because property rights create a lot of complications they 're most often sold to people and
 people then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt and sometimes have to sell their property in order to pay back the debt
 there 's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don 't work in these cases but they do need security of tenure and they need
  access to politics
 and that can mean two things that can mean community organizing from below but it can also mean
 possibilities from above and i say that because the system in turkey is
 notable turkey has two great laws that protect squatters one is that it 's called gecekondu in turkish which means built overnight
 and if you build your house overnight
  turkey you can 't be evicted without due process of law if they don 't catch you during the night and the second aspect is that
 once you have two thousand people in the community you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal sub municipality
 and when you 're a legal sub municipality you suddenly have politics you 're allowed to have an elected government collect taxes provide municipal services and that 's exactly what they do
 so these are the civic leaders of the future
 the woman in the center is
  geeta jiwa she lives in one of those tents on the highway median in mumbai
 that 's sureka gundi she also lives with her family on the tent along the same highway median they 're very outspoken they 're very active they can be community leaders
 this woman is nine which means grandma in turkish and there were three old ladies who lived in that 's her self built house behind her and
 they 've lived there for thirty or
  years and they are the backbone of the community there
 this is richard muthama peter and he is an itinerant street photographer in kibera he makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood and the people in the neighborhood
  and is a great resource in the community and finally my choice to run for mayor of rio
 i don 't know the future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people so i think
 the message i take from what i read from the book from what armstrong said and from all these people is that these are neighborhoods the issue is not urban poverty the issue is not
  the larger over arching thing the issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods this is a legitimate form of urban development and that cities have to engage
