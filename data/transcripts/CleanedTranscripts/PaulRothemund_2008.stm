  people argue vigorously about the definition of life they ask if it should have reproduction in it  or metabolism  or evolution  and i don 't know the answer to that so i 'm not going to tell you i will say that life involves
  so this is a computer program booted up in a cell  the program would execute and it could result
 in this person  or with a small change  it could result in this person  or another small change this person  or with a larger change this dog  
 or this tree  or this whale  so now if you take this metaphor [ of ] genome as program seriously  you have to consider that chris anderson is a
  as is jim watson craig venter as are all of us and in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that 
 could help to convince you but one to me that 's most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development the output a small mutation can take a two wing fly and make it a four wing fly 
 six fingered man now a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes if your bank account 's one dollar and you flip a single bit you could end up with a thousand dollars 
 so these small changes are things that i think that they indicate to us that a complicated computation in development is is underlying these amplified large changes
  all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology  and it shows the power of molecular programs biology does  and what i want to do is write molecular programs 
 potentially to build technology and there are a lot of people doing this a lot of synthetic biologists doing this like craig venter and they concentrate on using cells 
 so my friends molecular programmers and i have a sort of 
  're interested in using dna rna and protein and building new languages for building things from the bottom up using biomolecules potentially having nothing to do with biology 
  so these are all the machines in a cell there 's a camera  there 's the solar panels of the cell some switches that turn your genes on and off the girders of the cell  motors that move your muscles 
  trying to
 refashion all of these parts from dna we 're not dna zealots but dna is the cheapest easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this and as other things become easier to use maybe protein we 'll work with those  
 if we succeed what will molecular programming look like you 're going to sit in front of your computer  you 're going to design something like a cell phone  and in a high level language you 'll describe that cell phone then you 're going to have a compiler that 's going to take that description
  it 's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer
 and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed  and what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately is it will do a developmental computation a molecular computation  and it 'll build 
  an electronic computer and if i haven 't revealed my prejudices already i think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers building electronic computers which together with 
  electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers which will build new electronic computers and so
  forth and if you buy all of this and you think life is about computation as i do 
 then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist so one big question is how does a baby know when to stop growing 
 and for molecular programming the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing 
 or how does a computer program know when to stop running 
 or more to the point how do you know if a program will ever stop there are other questions like this too one of them is craig venter
  question  turns out i think he 's actually a computer scientist he asked how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism how few genes can i use this is exactly 
  analogous to the question what 's the smallest program i can write that will act exactly like microsoft word 
  molecular programming our question is how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone  what 's the smallest number we can get away with now these are big questions in computer science these 
  are all complexity questions and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions almost many of them are impossible  but for some tasks we can start to answer them so i 'm going to start asking those questions for the dna structures i 'm going to talk about next 
 it 's double stranded it 's a double helix has the as ts cs and gs that pair to hold the strands together and i 'm going to draw it like this sometimes just so i don 't scare you we want to look at
 individual strands and not think about the double helix when we synthesize it it comes single stranded so we can take the blue strand in one tube
 and make an orange strand in the other tube
  and they 're floppy when they 're single stranded you mix them together
 and they make a rigid double helix now for the last  twenty five years ned seeman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three dimensional structures using this kind of reaction 
  of dna strands coming together but a lot of their approaches though elegant take a long time they can take a couple of years or it can be difficult to design so i came up with a new method a couple of 
  years ago i call dna origami that 's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen and design the stuff on a laptop  but to
  do it you need a long single strand of dna  which is technically very difficult to get so you can go to a natural source you can look in this  computer fabricated artifact  
 and he 's got a double stranded genome that 's no good you look in his intestines there are billions of bacteria they 're no good either double strand again  but inside them they 're infected with a virus that 
  has a nice long single stranded genome that we can fold like a piece of paper and here 's how we do it  this is part of that genome
  add a bunch of short synthetic dnas that i call staples each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place and a right half that binds it in a different place and brings the long 
  strand together like this the net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle  now we can 't actually take a movie of this process but shawn douglas at harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short
  strands in it and what happens
 is that we mix these strands together we heat them up we add a little bit of salt we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down and as we cool them down the short strands bind the long strands
  and start to form structure and you can see a little bit of double helix forming there 
  you can see that what it really is even though you think it 's complicated is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other 
 and they 're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one so there 's a strand that goes like this  goes along one helix and binds it jumps to another helix and comes back that holds the long strand like this now 
 to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we wanted i tried to make this shape i wanted to fold dna into something that goes up over the eye down the nose up the nose
  around the forehead back down and end in a little loop like this  and so i thought if this could work anything could work so i had the computer program design the short staples to do this 
  i ordered them they came by fedex i mixed them up heated them cooled them down and i got fifty billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water
  the width of a human hair ok  so they 're all floating around in solution and to look at them you have to get them on a surface where they stick so you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick 
  to that surface and we take a picture using an atomic force microscope it 's got a needle like a record needle that goes back and forth over the surface  bumps up and down and feels the height of the first surface it
 feels the dna origami there 's the atomic force microscope working
 and you can see that the landing 's a little rough when you zoom in they 've got you know weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out but it 's pretty good
 you can zoom in and even see the extra little loop this little nano goatee now  
 what 's great about this is anybody can do this  and so i got this in the mail about a year after i did this  unsolicited anyone know what this is
 what is it
  what happened is a graduate student in china lulu qian did a great job she wrote all her own software to design and built this dna origami a beautiful rendition of china  which even has taiwan and you can see it 's sort of on the world 's shortest leash right 
 laughter so this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes  ok  and you can make a map of the
  americas and spell dna with dna  and
 what 's really neat about it
 well actually this all looks like  nano artwork but it turns out that  nano artwork is just what you need to make  nano circuits 
 so you can put circuit components on the staples like a light bulb and a light switch let the thing assemble and you 'll get some kind of a circuit and then you can maybe wash the dna away and have the circuit left over so 
 this is what some colleagues of mine at caltech did they took a dna origami  organized some carbon
  made a little switch you see here wired it up tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch now this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer  so
 we have a long way to go but this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one tenth the size of those in a normal computer  so it 's very 
  promising for making small computers now  i want to get back to that compiler the dna origami is a proof that that compiler actually works 
  start with something in the computer you get a high level description of the computer program a high level description of the origami
  you can compile it to molecules send it to a synthesizer and it actually works and it turns out that a company has made a nice program that 's much better than my code which was kind of ugly and will allow us to do this in a nice visual computer aided design way  
 so now you can say all right why isn 't dna origami the end of the story  you have your molecular compiler you can do whatever
  you want the fact is that it does not scale  so
 if you want to build a human from dna origami the problem is you need a long strand that 's ten trillion trillion bases long that 's three light years  ' worth of dna so we 're not going to do this we 're going to turn to another technology 
 called algorithmic self assembly of tiles it
  has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a dna origami  you zoom in there are just four dna strands and they have little single stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles if they match  
 and we like to draw these tiles as little squares  and if you look at their sticky ends these little dna bits you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern so these tiles would make a complicated self assembling
  and the point of this  if you didn 't catch that is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output
 patterns  and a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs specifically counting 
 so you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard so you can read off binary numbers five
  and in order to get these kinds of computations started right you need some kind of input a kind of seed you can use dna origami for that you can encode the number thirty two in the right hand side of a dna origami and when you add those tiles that count 
 they will start to count
 they will read that thirty two and they 'll stop at thirty two so what we 've done is we 've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going  it knows when to stop growing because it can count it knows how big it
  that sort of first question i was talking about it doesn 't tell us how babies do it however  
 so now  we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than dna origami could otherwise  here 's the dna origami and what we can do is we can write thirty two on both edges 
  of the dna origami  and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles  
 the counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing so what we 've done is is we 've succeeded in making something something much bigger than a dna origami by combining dna origami with tiles and the neat thing about it is is that it 's also reprogrammable  
 you can just change a couple of the dna strands in this binary representation and you 'll get
  and if you do that the origami 's the same size  but the resulting square that you get
 is three times bigger 
 so this sort of recapitulates what i was telling you about development  you have a very sensitive computer program where small changes single tiny little mutations 
 can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger  
  developmental process
 is something that also has bearing on craig venter 's question so you can ask how many dna strands are required to build a square of a given size  if we wanted to make a square of size ten 
 one hundred or one thousand if we used dna origami alone we would require a number of dna strands that 's the square of the size of that square so we 'd need one hundred ten thousand or a million dna strands that 's really not affordable
 but if we use a little computation we use origami  plus some tiles that count
 then we can get away with using one hundred two hundred or three hundred dna strands 
 and so we can exponentially reduce the number of dna strands we use if we use counting if we use a little bit of computation  
 and so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something to reduce the size of the genome
  genome that you 're building 
 and finally i 'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers  if you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory  
 so if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles rather than to the
 the staple strands you affix them to the tiles then they 'll self assemble the somewhat complicated circuits the
  demultiplexer circuits that you need to address this memory  so you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation it 's a molecular computer building an electronic computer now you ask me how far have we gotten down this path  experimentally this is what we 've done in the
 last year here is a dna origami rectangle  and here are some tiles growing from
  it 's got some errors but at least it counts up 
 so it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago and that 's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things so i think we made a lot of progress we 've got ideas about how to fix these errors  and i
  in the next five or ten years we 'll make the kind of squares that i described and maybe even get to some of those
 self assembled circuits  so now  what do i want you to take away from this talk i want you to remember that to create
 life 's very diverse and complex forms life uses computation to do that and the computations that it
  molecular computations and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it as feynman said you know we need to build something to understand it and so we are going to use molecules 
  and refashion this thing rebuild everything from the bottom up using dna in ways that nature never intended using dna origami and dna origami to seed this algorithmic
  what 's really neat about
