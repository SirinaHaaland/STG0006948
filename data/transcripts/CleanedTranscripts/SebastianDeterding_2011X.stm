  we are today talking about moral persuasion what is moral and immoral in trying to change people 's behaviors by using technology and using design 
 and i don 't know what you expect but when i was thinking about that issue i early on realized what i 'm not able to give you are answers
  'm not able to tell you what is moral or immoral 
 because we 're living in a pluralist society  my values can be radically different from your values 
 which means that what i consider moral or immoral based on that might not necessarily be what you consider moral or immoral 
 but i also realized there is one thing that i could give you and that is what this guy behind me gave the world socrates  it is questions
  what i can do and what i would like to do with you is give you like that initial question a set of questions to figure out for yourselves layer by layer 
 like peeling an onion getting at the core of what you believe is moral or immoral persuasion 
 and i 'd like to do that with a couple of examples of technologies where people have used game elements to get people
  to do things 
 so it 's at first a very simple very obvious question i would like to give you what are your intentions if you are designing something 
 and obviously intentions are not the only thing 
 so here is another example for one of these applications there are a couple of these kinds of eco dashboards right now dashboards built
  into cars which try to motivate you to drive more fuel efficiently this here is nissan 's myleaf where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people so you can compete for who drives a route the most fuel efficiently and these things are very effective it turns out
 so effective that they motivate people to engage in unsafe driving behaviors like not stopping at a red light because that way you have to stop and restart the engine and that would use
 quite some fuel wouldn 't it so despite this being a very
 well intended application obviously there was a side effect of that
 here 's another example for one of these side effects commendable 
 a site that allows parents to give their kids little badges for doing the things that parents want their kids to do like tying their shoes and at first that sounds
 very nice very benign well intended but it turns out if you look into research on people 's mindset
  caring about public recognition  caring about these kinds of public tokens of recognition is not necessarily very helpful for your long term psychological well being it 
  's better if you care about learning something it 's better when you care about yourself than how you appear in front of other people 
  that is used actually in and of itself has a long term side effect in that every time we use a technology that uses something like public recognition or status we 're actually 
  positively endorsing this as a good and and normal thing to care about that way possibly having a detrimental effect on the  long term psychological well being of ourselves as a culture  
 less fuel as well as the effects of the actual tools you 're using to get people to do things public recognition 
 now is that all intention effect well there are some technologies which obviously combine both both good
  effects and a positive intention like fred stutzman 's freedom where the whole point of that application is well  we 're usually so bombarded with with constant requests by other people
 with this device you can shut off the internet connectivity of your pc of choice for a pre set amount of time to actually get some work done  
 and i think most of us will agree that 's something well intended and also has good consequences in the words of michel foucault  it is a technology of the self it is a technology 
  that empowers the individual to determine its own life course to shape itself 
  is as foucault points out that every technology of the self has a technology of domination as its flip side 
 as you see in today 's modern liberal democracies 
 the society the state not only allows us to determine our self to shape our self  it also demands it of us it demands that we optimize ourselves that we control ourselves that we
 continuously  because that 's the only way in which such a liberal society works these technologies 
 want us to stay in the game that society has devised for us they want us to fit in even better they want us to optimize ourselves to fit in now
 i don 't say that is necessarily
  i just think that this example points us to a general realization  and that is no matter what technology or design you look at even something
 we consider as well intended and as good in its effects as stutzman 's freedom  comes with certain values embedded in it and we can question these values we can question  is it a good thing that all of us continuously
  ourselves to fit better into that society or to give you another example what about a piece of persuasive technology that
 convinces muslim women to wear their headscarves  is that a good or a bad technology in its intentions or in its effects well
 that basically depends on the kind of values you bring to bear to make these kinds of judgments  
 so that 's a third question what values do you use to judge
  and speaking of values  i 've noticed that in the discussion about moral persuasion online and when i 'm talking with people more often than not there is a weird bias  
 and that bias is that we 're asking is this or that still ethical  is it still permissible  we 're asking things like  
  is this oxfam donation form where the regular monthly donation is the preset default
  or nudged into giving a regular donation instead of a one time donation is that still ' permissible is it still ethical  we 're fishing at the low end 
 but in fact that question is it ' still ' ethical is just one way of looking at ethics because if you look at the beginning of ethics
 in western culture you see a very different idea of what ethics also could
  for aristotle ethics was not about the question is that still good or is it bad ethics was about the question of how to live life well  
 and he put that in the word arte which we from [ ancient greek ] translate as virtue but really it means excellence it means living up to your own full potential as a human being  
 and that is an idea that i
  richard buchanan put nicely in a recent essay where he said products are vivid arguments about how we should live our lives 
 our designs are not ethical or unethical in that they 're using ethical or unethical means of persuading us 
 they have a moral component just in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life that they present to us  
 and if you look into the designed environment around us with that kind of lens asking what is the vision of the good life
  life that our products our design present to us 
 then you often get the shivers  
 because of how little we expect of each other of how little we actually seem to expect of our life and what the good life looks like 
 so that 's
 a fourth question i 'd like to leave you with what vision of the good life do
  and speaking of design you 'll notice that i already broadened the discussion  because
 it 's not just persuasive technology that we 're talking about here it 's any piece of design that we put out here in the world  
 i don 't know whether you know the great communication researcher paul watzlawick who back in the ' 60s made the argument that we cannot not communicate even if we choose to be silent  we chose to be silent and we 're communicating something by choosing to be silent
 and in the same way that we cannot not communicate we cannot not persuade whatever we do or refrain from doing  whatever we put out there as a piece of design  into the world 
 has a persuasive component it tries to affect people  it puts a certain vision of the good life out there in front of us which is what peter paul
  dutch philosopher of technology says
  no matter whether we as designers intend it or not we materialize morality  we make certain things harder and easier to do we organize 
  the existence of people  we put a certain vision of what good or bad or normal or usual is in front of people by everything we put out there in the world  
  materializes a certain vision of the good life
 a good life in which teaching and learning and listening is about one person teaching the others listening in which it is about
 in which you learn for yourself in which you 're not supposed to change these rules because the chairs are fixed to the ground 
 and even something as innocuous as a single design chair like this one by arne jacobsen
  is a persuasive technology because again it communicates an idea of the good life 
 a good life a life that you as a designer consent to by saying in a good life goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably as this chair
 workers are treated as well or as badly as the workers were treated that built that chair the
 good life is a life where design is important because somebody obviously took the time and spent the
  money for that kind of well designed chair where tradition is important because this is a traditional classic and someone cared about this and where there is something as conspicuous consumption where it is ok and normal 
 to spend a humongous amount of money on such a chair to signal to other people what your social status is 
  when you 're designing something  what are the effects intended and unintended that you 're having  what are the values you 're using to judge those  what are the virtues the aspirations that you 're actually expressing in that 
 and how does that apply not just to persuasive technology but to everything you design do we stop there 
 i don 't think so i think that all of these things are
  eventually informed by the core of all of this and this is nothing but
 life itself  
 why when the question of what the good life is informs everything that we design should we stop at design and not ask ourselves how does it apply to our own life 
 why should the lamp or the house be an art object but not our life
  as michel foucault puts it 
 just to give you a practical example of buster benson this is buster setting up a pull up machine at the office of his new start up habit labs  where they 're trying to build 
 other applications like health month for people  and why is he building a thing like this well  here is the set of axioms that habit labs buster 's start up put up for 
  themselves on how they wanted to work together as a team when they 're building these applications a
  working together one of them being we take care of our own health and manage our own burnout 
 because ultimately how can you ask yourselves and how can you find an answer
 on what vision of the good life you want to convey and create with your designs without asking the question  what vision of the good life do you yourself
 want to live and with that i thank
