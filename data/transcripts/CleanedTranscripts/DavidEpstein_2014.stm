  and athletes have fulfilled that motto
 rapidly the winner of the two thousand and twelve olympic marathon ran two hours and eight minutes had he been racing against the winner of
  the one thousand nine hundred and four olympic marathon he would have won by nearly an hour and a half 
 now we all have this feeling that we 're somehow just getting better as a human race inexorably progressing but it 's not like we 've evolved into a new species in a century 
 so what 's going on here 
 i want to take a look at what 's really behind this march of athletic
  jesse owens held the world record in the one hundred meters  
 had jesse owens been racing last year in the world championships of the one hundred meters  
 when jamaican sprinter usain bolt finished owens would have still had fourteen feet to go  
 that 's a lot in sprinter land 
 to give you a sense of how much it is i want to share with you a demonstration
 conceived by sports scientist ross tucker
  picture the stadium last year at the world championships of the one hundred meters  thousands of fans waiting with baited breath to see usain bolt the fastest man in history 
 flashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world coil themselves into their blocks  and i want you to pretend that jesse owens is in that race  
 now close your eyes for a second and picture the race  
 bang the gun goes off an american sprinter jumps out to the front usain bolt starts to catch him usain bolt passes him and as the
  runners come to the finish you 'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line 
 that 's the entire finish of the race  
 you can open your eyes now 
 that first beep was usain bolt that last beep was jesse owens  listen to it again 
 when you think of it like that it 's not that
  and then consider that usain bolt started by propelling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet
 designed to allow him to travel as fast as humanly possible 
 jesse owens on the other hand ran on cinders the ash from burnt wood  and that soft surface stole far more energy from his legs as he ran 
 rather than blocks jesse owens had a gardening trowel that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from 
 biomechanical analysis
  of the speed of owens ' joints shows that had been running on the same surface as bolt he wouldn 't have been fourteen feet behind he would have been within one stride  
 rather than the last beep owens would have been the second beep  listen to it again 
 that 's the difference track surface technology has made and it 's done it throughout the running world consider a longer event in
 hundred and fifty four sir roger bannister became the first man to run under four minutes in the mile  
 nowadays college kids do that every year on rare occasions a high school kid does it 
 as of the end of last year one thousand three hundred and fourteen men had run under four minutes in the mile  
 but like jesse owens  sir roger bannister ran on soft cinders that stole far more energy from his legs than the synthetic tracks of today
  so i consulted biomechanics experts to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders than synthetic tracks and their consensus that it 's one and a half percent slower 
 so if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion
 to every man who ran his sub four mile on a synthetic track this is what happens 
 only five hundred and thirty are left if you look at it from that perspective fewer than ten new men per [ year ] have joined the
 sub four mile club since sir roger bannister now five hundred and thirty is a lot more than one
 and that 's partly because there are many more people training today and they 're training more intelligently  
 even college kids are professional in their training compared to sir roger bannister who trained for forty five minutes at a time while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school  
 and that guy who won the one thousand nine hundred and four olympic marathon in three in a half hours  that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy while
  he ran along the course  that was his idea of
 clearly athletes have gotten more savvy about performance enhancing drugs as well
  and that 's made a difference in some sports at some times  but technology has made a difference in all sports from faster skis to lighter shoes  take a look at the record for the 100 meter freestyle
  the record is always trending downward  but it 's punctuated by these steep cliffs this first cliff 
  the introduction of the flip turn rather than stopping and turning around athletes could somersault under the water and get going right away in the opposite direction 
 this second cliff  the introduction of gutters on the side of the pool that allows water to splash off  rather than becoming turbulence that impedes the swimmers as they race  
 this final cliff  the introduction of
  swimsuits throughout sports technology has changed the face of performance 
 in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two eddy merckx set the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour at thirty miles three thousand seven hundred and seventy four feet 
 now that record improved and improved as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic
 all the way until one thousand nine
  when it was set at thirty five miles one thousand five hundred and thirty one feet nearly five miles farther than eddy merckx cycled in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two 
 but then in two thousand the international cycling union decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record
 had to do so with essentially the same equipment that eddy merckx used in one thousand nine hundred and seventy two where does the record stand today  thirty miles
  a grand total of eight hundred and eighty three feet farther than eddy merckx cycled more than four decades ago 
 essentially the entire improvement in this record was due to technology  
 still technology isn 't the only thing pushing athletes forward while indeed we haven 't evolved into a new species in a century  
 the gene pool within competitive sports most certainly has changed 
  physical education instructors and coaches had the idea that the average body type was the best for all athletic endeavors  medium height  medium weight no matter the sport  
 and this showed in athletes ' bodies in the 1920s the average elite high jumper and average elite shot putter were the same exact size 
 but as that idea started to fade away 
 as sports scientists and coaches realized that rather than the average body type you want highly specialized bodies that fit into certain athletic niches 
  selection took place a self sorting for bodies that fit certain sports  and athletes ' bodies became more different from one another 
 today  rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper  the average elite shot putter is two and a half inches taller and one hundred and thirty pounds heavier  
 and this happened throughout the sports world in fact  if you plot on a height versus mass graph one data point for each of two dozen sports in the first half of
 it looks like this there 's some dispersal  but it 's kind of grouped around that average body type  
 then that idea started to go away and at the same time digital technology first radio  then television and the internet gave millions or in some cases billions of people a ticket
 to consume elite sports performance  the financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes
  and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance 
 it accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies and if you plot a data point for these same two dozen sports today  it looks like this 
 the athletes ' bodies have gotten much more different from one another  
 and because this chart looks like the charts that show the expanding universe with the galaxies flying away from one another  the scientists who
 discovered it call it the big bang of body types 
 in sports where height is prized like basketball the tall athletes got taller 
 in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three the national basketball association signed a groundbreaking agreement making players partners in the league  
 entitled to shares of ticket revenues and television contracts  
 suddenly anybody who could be an nba player wanted to be 
 and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships
  the proportion of men in the nba who are at least seven feet tall doubled
 to ten percent today one in ten men in the nba is at least seven feet tall  but a seven foot tall man is incredibly rare in the general population
 so rare that if you know an american man between the ages of twenty and forty who is at least seven feet tall there 's a seventeen percent chance he 's in the
  seven footers one is in the nba right now  
 and that 's not the only way that nba players ' bodies are unique 
 this is leonardo da vinci 's vitruvian man the ideal proportions with arm span equal to height  my arm span is exactly equal to my height  
 yours is probably very nearly so but not the average nba player  
  the average nba player is a shade under six ' seven with arms that are seven feet long not only are nba players ridiculously tall they are ludicrously long 
 had leonardo wanted to draw the vitruvian nba player he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse not a circle and a square 
 so in sports where large size is prized the large athletes have gotten larger  
 conversely in sports where diminutive stature is an advantage  the small athletes got smaller  
 the average elite female gymnast shrunk from five
  three to four ' nine on average over the last thirty years 
 all the better for their power to weight ratio and for spinning in the air  and while the large got larger and the small got smaller  the weird got weirder  
 the average length of the forearm of a water polo player in relation to their total arm got longer all the better for a forceful throwing whip and
 as the large got larger  small got smaller and the weird weirder
  type is a long torso and short legs it 's like the long hull of a canoe for speed over the water 
 and the opposite is advantageous in running you want long legs and a short torso and this shows in athletes ' bodies today  here you see michael phelps  the greatest swimmer in history  
 standing next to hicham el guerrouj the world record holder in the mile  
  these men are seven inches different in height  but because of the body types advantaged in their sports they wear the same length pants 
 seven inches difference in height these men have the same length legs 
 now in some cases the search for bodies that could push athletic performance forward ended up introducing into the competitive world populations of people that weren 't previously competing at all 
 like kenyan distance runners
 we think of kenyans as being great marathoners  kenyans think of the kalenjin
  tribe as being great marathoners  the kalenjin make up just twelve percent of the kenyan population
 but the vast majority of elite runners and they happen on average to have a certain unique physiology legs that are very long and very thin at their extremity  
 and this is because they have their ancestry at very low latitude in a very hot and dry
  and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes 
 it 's the same reason that a radiator has long coils to increase surface area compared to volume to let heat out 
 and because the leg is like a pendulum the longer and thinner it is at the extremity the more energy efficient it is to swing 
 to put kalenjin running success in perspective  consider that seventeen american men in history
 have run faster than two hours and ten minutes in the marathon that 's a
 four minute and 58 second per mile pace thirty two kalenjin men did that last october 
 that 's from a source population the size of metropolitan atlanta  
 still even changing technology and the changing gene pool in sports don 't account for all of the changes in performance athletes have a different mindset than they once did 
 have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets an electrical shock and they 're thrown across a room
  there 's no explosion there what 's happening when that happens is that the electrical impulse is causing all their muscle fibers to twitch at once and they 're throwing themselves across the room  
 they 're essentially jumping  
 that 's the power that 's contained in the human body 
 but normally we can 't access nearly all of it our brain acts as a limiter 
 preventing us from accessing all of our physical resources because we might hurt ourselves  tearing tendons or ligaments but the more we learn about how
  that limiter functions  
 the more we learn how we can push it back just a bit in some cases by convincing the brain that the body won 't be in mortal danger by pushing harder 
 endurance and  ultra endurance sports serve as a great example ultra endurance was once thought to be harmful to human health  
 but now we realize that we have all these traits that are perfect for
  a glut of sweat glands that keep us cool while running  
 narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames large surface area of joints for shock absorption 
 we have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring short toes that are better for pushing off than for grasping tree limbs  and when we run we can turn our torso and our shoulders like this while keeping our heads
  our primate cousins can 't do that they have to run like this 
 and we have big old butt muscles that keep us upright while running have you ever looked at an ape 's butt they have no buns
 because they don 't run upright  
 and as athletes have realized that we 're perfectly suited for  ultra endurance they 've taken on feats that would have been unthinkable before athletes like spanish endurance racer 
  with a sweatshirt there tied around his waist it 's so steep he can can 't even run here he 's pulling up on a rope this is a vertical ascent of more than eight thousand feet 
 and klian went up and down in under three hours  
 amazing  and talented though he is klian is not a physiological freak  
 now that he has done this other athletes will follow just as other athletes followed after sir roger bannister ran under four minutes in the
  mile changing technology changing genes and a changing mindset  
 innovation in sports whether that 's new track surfaces or new swimming techniques the democratization of sport the spread to new bodies and to new populations around the world 
 and imagination in sport 
 an understanding of what the human body is truly capable of have conspired to make athletes stronger  faster bolder  and better than ever 
 thank you very much
