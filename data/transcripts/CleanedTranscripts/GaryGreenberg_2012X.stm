  so i want to talk a little bit about seeing the world from a totally unique point of view  and this world i 'm going to talk about is the micro world 
 i 've found  after doing this for many many years that there 's a magical world behind reality  and that can be seen directly
 through a microscope
 and i 'm going to show you some of this today  so let 's start off looking at something rather
 not so small something that we can see with our naked eye  and that 's a bee  so when you look at this bee it 's about this size here it 's about a centimeter  
 but to really see the details of the bee and really appreciate what it is you have to look a little bit closer  so
  that 's just the eye of the bee
 with a microscope and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia  
 and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes so they know when they 're right up close to something because they can 't see in stereo  
 as we go smaller 
 here is a human hair a human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see it 's about a tenth of a millimeter 
 and as we go smaller again about ten times smaller than that is a cell
 so you could fit ten
 human cells
 across the diameter of a human hair  
 so when we would look at cells this is how i really got involved in biology and science is by looking at living cells in the microscope  
 when i first saw living cells in a microscope i was absolutely
 enthralled and amazed at what they looked like  so if you look at the cell like that from the immune system they 're actually moving all over the place
 this cell is looking for
 foreign objects  bacteria things that it can find  and it 's looking around and when it finds something and recognizes it being foreign it will actually engulf it and eat it so if you look right there  
 it finds that little bacterium  
 and it
 engulfs it and eats it
  if you take some heart cells
 from an animal and put it in a dish  they 'll just sit there and beat that 's their job every cell has a mission
 in life  and these cells the mission is to move blood around our body 
 these next cells are nerve cells and right now as we see and understand what we 're looking at our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this right now they 're not just static  they 're moving around making new connections  and that 's what
  happens when we learn  as you go farther down this scale here
 that 's a micron or a micrometer and we go all the way down to here to a nanometer and an angstrom now an angstrom is the size of the diameter of a hydrogen atom 
 that 's how small that is 
 and microscopes that we have today can actually see individual
  so these are some pictures of individual atoms each bump here is an individual atom this is a ring of cobalt atoms  
 so this whole world the nano world this area in here is called the nano world 
 and the nano world 
 the whole micro world that we see there
 's a nano world that is wrapped up within that and the whole  and that is the world of molecules and atoms  but i want to talk about this larger world the world of the micro world  
  little tiny
 bug living in a flower 
 what would that flower look like if the flower was this big it wouldn 't look or feel like anything that we see when we look at a flower  
 so if you look at this flower here and you 're a little bug if you 're on that surface of that of that flower 
 that 's what the terrain would look like the petal of that flower looks like that so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects and if you look a little bit closer at this
 stigma and the stamen here  this is the style of that flower  and you notice that it 's got these little these are like little jelly like
 things that are what are called spurs these are
 nectar spurs  so this little ant that 's crawling here it 's like it 's in a little willy wonka land it 's like a little disneyland for them  
 it 's not like what we see 
 these are little bits of
 individual
  of pollen there and there 
 and here is a what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen when you look in a microscope it 's actually made of thousands
 of little grains of pollen  so this for example when you see bees flying around these little plants and they 're collecting pollen those pollen grains that they 're collecting they pack
  into their legs and they take it back to the hive  and that 's what makes the beehive the wax in the beehive  and they 're also collecting
 nectar and that 's what makes the honey that we eat 
 here 's a close up picture or this is actually a regular picture of a water hyacinth and if you had really really good vision with your naked eye you 'd see it about that well 
 there 's the stamen and the pistil but look what the stamen and the pistil look like in a microscope that 's the stamen 
  and there 's the the pistil there and these are the little little things called trichomes and that 's what makes the
 the flower give a fragrance and
 plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances 
 i want to talk about something really ordinary just ordinary sand i became interested in sand about ten years ago when i first saw sand from maui
 and in fact this is a little bit of sand from maui  
 so sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size  but when you look closer at this look at what 's there it 's really quite amazing  
  you have microshells there  you have things like coral  you have fragments of other shells you have
  you have bits of a volcano there 's a little bit of a volcano there you have tube worms 
 an amazing array of incredible things exist in sand 
 and the reason that is is because in a place like this island a lot of the sand is made of biological material because
 the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or
 macroscopic animals grow  and when they die their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand  things like coral and so forth
  so here 's for example a picture of sand from
 from maui  this is from lahaina  
 and when we 're walking along a beach we 're actually walking along millions of years of biological and geological history we don 't realize it but it 's actually a record of that entire ecology  
 so here we see for example a sponge spicule two bits of coral here 
 that 's a sea urchin spine
  really some amazing stuff  so when i first looked at this i was i thought gee this is like a little treasure trove here i couldn 't believe it and i 'd go around dissecting the little bits out and making photographs of them  
 here 's what most of the sand in our world looks like these are quartz crystals
 and feldspar  so most sand in the world on on the mainland is made of quartz crystal and feldspar it 's the erosion of granite rock so mountains are built up
  up and they erode away by water
 and rain and ice and so forth  and they become grains of sand there 's some sand that 's really much more colorful these are sand from near the great lakes and you can see that it 's filled with minerals 
  like pink garnet and green epidote all kinds of amazing stuff and if you look at different sands from different places  every single beach every single place you look at sand  it 's different 
  like they 're little jewels there are places in africa where they do the mining of jewels and you go to the sand where where the rivers
 have the sand go down to the ocean and it 's like literally looking at tiny jewels through the microscope  
 so every grain of sand is unique every beach is different  every single grain is different there are no two grains of sand alike in the world 
 every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere
 they 're like a snapshot in time 
 now sand is not only on earth but sand is ubiquitous throughout the universe in fact outer space is filled with sand  
 and that sand comes together to make our planets and the moon  
 and you can see those in micrometeorites this is some micrometeorites that the army
  and they get these out of the drinking wells in the south pole  and they 're quite amazing looking and these are the tiny constituents that make up the world
 that we live in the planets and the moon  
 so nasa wanted me to take some pictures of moon sand so they sent me sand from all the different landings
 of the apollo missions that happened forty years ago  and i started taking pictures with my
  this was the first picture i took it
 was kind of amazing i thought it looked kind of a little bit like the moon  
 which is sort of interesting now the way my microscopes work is normally in a microscope you can see very little at one time so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope
 keep taking pictures and then i have a computer program that puts all those pictures together into one picture so you can see actually what it looks
  something 's interesting here  this looks very different than any sand on earth that i 've ever seen and i 've seen a lot of sand on earth believe me 
 look at this hole in the middle 
 that hole was caused by a micrometeorite hitting the moon now the moon has no atmosphere so micrometeorites come in continuously 
 and the whole surface of the moon is covered with powder now
  for four billion years it 's been bombarded by micrometeorites  
 and when micrometeorites come in at about twenty to sixty thousand miles an hour they vaporize on contact  and you can see here that that is that 's sort of vaporized and that material 
  is holding this little clump of little sand grains together this is a very small grain of sand this whole thing  
  like that and you 'd never find that on earth 
 most of the
 of the sand on on the moon especially and you know when you look at the moon there 's the dark areas and the light areas the dark areas are lava flows they 're
 basaltic lava flows  and that 's what this sand looks like very similar to the sand that you would see in
  other sands when these micrometeorites come in they vaporize and they make these fountains these microscopic fountains that go up into the
 i was going to say up into the air but there is no air goes
 sort of up and these microscopic glass beads are formed instantly  and they harden and by the time they fall down back to the surface of the moon  
  they have these beautiful colored glass spherules and these are actually microscopic you need a microscope to see these
 now here 's a grain of sand
 that is from the moon  and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there this grain of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion 
  years old  and it 's never eroded away like the way we have sand on earth erodes away because of water
  and so forth all you can see is a little bit of erosion down here by the sun has these solar storms
