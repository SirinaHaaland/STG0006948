  i 'm an underwater explorer 
 more specifically a cave diver 
 i wanted to be an astronaut when i was a little kid but growing up in canada as a young girl that wasn 't really available to me
  as it turns out we know a lot more about space
 than we do about the underground waterways coursing through our planet the very lifeblood of mother earth  
 so i decided to do something that was even more remarkable instead of exploring outer space i wanted to explore the wonders of inner
  a lot of people will tell you that cave diving is perhaps one of the most dangerous endeavors  
 i mean imagine yourself here in this room if you were suddenly plunged into blackness with your only job to find the exit  sometimes swimming 
  through these large spaces and at other times crawling beneath the seats  following a thin guideline 
  that 's my workplace
 but what i want to teach you today is that our world is not one big solid rock  it 's a whole lot more like a sponge  
 i can swim through a lot of the pores in our earth 's sponge  
 but where i can 't other  life forms and other materials can make that journey without me  and my voice is the one that 's going to teach
  you about the inside of mother earth 
 there was no guidebook available to me when i decided to be the first person to cave dive inside antarctic icebergs 
 in two thousand this was the largest moving object on the planet it calved off the ross ice shelf  and we went down there to explore ice edge ecology and search for
 for  life forms beneath the ice 
 we use a technology called rebreathers  it 's an awful lot like the same technology that is used for space walks 
 this technology enables us to go deeper than we could 've imagined even ten years ago we use exotic gases  and we can make missions even up to twenty hours long underwater 
 i work with biologists
 it turns out that caves are repositories of amazing life forms species that we never knew existed before 
 many of these life forms live in unusual ways they have no pigment and no eyes in many cases  and these animals are also
 extremely 
  in fact animals swimming in these caves today are identical in the fossil record that predates the extinction of the dinosaurs  so imagine 
  that these are like little swimming dinosaurs what can they teach us about evolution and survival 
  of a cat he 'd be the most dangerous thing on our planet  
 and these animals live in remarkably beautiful places and in some cases caves like this that are very young  
 yet the animals are ancient how did they get there 
 i also work with physicists  and they 're interested oftentimes in global climate change they can take rocks within the caves
  and they can slice them and look at the layers within with rocks much like the rings of a tree  and they can count back in history and learn about the climate on our planet at very different times 
 the red that you see in this photograph is actually dust from the sahara desert  so it 's been picked up by wind blown across the atlantic
  it 's rained down in this case on the island of abaco in the bahamas  it soaks in through the ground and deposits itself in the rocks within these caves  
 and when we look back in the layers of these rocks we can find times when the climate was very very dry on earth  and we can go back many hundreds of thousands of years 
  are also interested in where the sea level stands were at other times on earth here in bermuda my team and i
  embarked on the deepest manned dives ever conducted in the region  and we were looking for places where the sea level used to lap up against the shoreline many hundreds of feet below current levels 
 i also get to work with paleontologists and archaeologists in places like mexico in the bahamas  and even in
  looking at cultural remains and also human remains in caves  and they tell us a lot about some of the earliest inhabitants of these regions  
 but my very favorite project of all was over fifteen years ago  when i was a part of the team that made the very first accurate three dimensional map of a subterranean surface 
 this device that i 'm driving through the cave was actually creating a  three dimensional model as we drove it 
 we also used ultra low frequency radio to broadcast
  back to the surface our exact position within the cave 
 so i swam under houses and businesses and bowling alleys and golf courses  and even under a sonny 's bbq restaurant  
 pretty remarkable  and what that taught me was that everything we do on the surface of our earth will be returned to us to drink 
 our water planet is not just rivers
 but it 's this vast network of groundwater that knits us all together it 's a shared resource from which we all drink  
 and when we can understand our human connections with our groundwater and all of our water resources on this planet then
 we 'll be working on the problem that 's probably the most important issue of this
  i never got to be that astronaut that i always wanted to be  but this mapping device designed by dr bill stone will be it 's actually morphed  it 's now a self swimming autonomous robot  artificially intelligent 
 and its ultimate goal is to go to jupiter 's moon europa and explore oceans beneath the frozen surface of that
 body  and that 's pretty amazing
