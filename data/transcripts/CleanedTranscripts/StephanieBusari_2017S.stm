  i want to tell you a story about a girl  but i can 't tell you her real name so let 's just call her
 hadiza hadiza is twenty she 's shy  but she has a beautiful smile
 that lights up her face  but she 's in constant
  pain  
 and she will likely be on medication for the rest of her life do you want to know why
 hadiza is a chibok girl  and on april fourteen two thousand and fourteen she was kidnapped
 by boko haram terrorists she managed to escape
  by jumping off the truck that was carrying the girls  but when she landed she broke both her legs  
 and she had to crawl on her tummy to hide in the bushes she told me she was terrified that boko haram would come back for her 
 she was one of fifty seven girls who would escape by jumping off trucks that day this story quite rightly caused ripples
 around the world people like michelle
  lent their voices in protest and at about the same time i was living in london at the time i was sent from london to abuja to cover the world economic forum
 that nigeria was hosting for the first time but when we arrived it was clear that there was only one story in town 
 we put the government under pressure we asked tough questions about what they were doing to bring these girls back 
 understandably  they weren 't too happy
  with our line of questioning  and let 's just say we received our fair share of alternative facts 
 influential nigerians were telling us at the time
 that we were nave we didn 't understand the political situation in nigeria but they also told us
 that the story of the
  sadly this hoax narrative has persisted  and there are still people in nigeria today who believe that the chibok girls were never kidnapped 
 yet i was talking to people like these
 devastated parents who told us that on the day boko haram
 kidnapped their daughters they ran into the sambisa forest after the trucks carrying their daughters they were armed with machetes  but they were
  forced to turn back because boko haram had guns 
 for two years  inevitably the news agenda moved on and for two years  
 we didn 't hear much about the chibok girls  everyone presumed they were dead  
 but in april last year  i was able to obtain this video 
 this is a still from the video that boko haram filmed as a proof of life
 and through a source i obtained this video  but before i could publish it  i had to
 travel to the northeast of nigeria to talk to the parents to verify it  i didn 't have to wait too long
 for confirmation one of the mothers when she watched the video told me that if she could have reached into the laptop
 and pulled our her child
  from the laptop she would have done so for those of you who are parents like myself in the audience you can only imagine the anguish
 that that mother felt 
 this video would go on to kick start negotiation talks
 with boko haram and a nigerian senator told me that because of this video
 they they entered into those talks
  because they had long presumed that the chibok girls were dead twenty one girls were freed in october
 last year  sadly  nearly two hundred of them still remain missing  
 i must confess that i have not been a dispassionate observer
 covering this story i am furious when i think about the wasted opportunities
 to rescue these
  girls i am furious when i think about what the parents have told me that if these were daughters of the rich and the powerful they would have been found much earlier  
 and i am furious that the hoax narrative i firmly believe  caused
 a delay it was part of the
  reason for the delay in their return this illustrates to me the deadly danger
 of fake news so what can we do about it 
 there are some very smart people smart engineers at google and facebook who are trying to use technology
 to stop the spread of fake news  but beyond that i think everybody here you and i
 we have a role to play in that we are the ones who share the content we are the
  ones who share the stories online in this day and age we 're all publishers  
 and we have responsibility 
 in my job as a journalist  i check i verify i trust my gut  but i ask tough questions 
 why is this person telling me this story what do they have to gain by sharing this information do they have a hidden agenda
  i really believe that we must all start to ask tougher questions
 of information that we discover online 
 research shows that
 some of us don 't even read beyond headlines
 before we share stories who here has done that i know i have but what
  if
 we stopped taking information
 that we discover at face value what if
 we stop to think about the consequence of the information that we pass on and its potential to incite violence or hatred 
 what if
 we stop to think about the real life consequences of the information that we share thank you very much for listening
