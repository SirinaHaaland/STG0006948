  so today i 'm going to talk to you about the rise of collaborative consumption  i 'm going to explain what it is and try and convince you in just fifteen minutes that this isn 't a flimsy idea or a
  but a powerful cultural and economic force
 reinventing not just what we consume  but how we consume  
 now i 'm going to start with a deceptively simple example 
 hands up how many of you have books  cds  dvds or videos lying around your house that you probably won 't use again  but you can 't quite bring yourself to throw away 
 can 't see all the hands but it looks like all of you right on our shelves at home
  we have a box set of the dvd series twenty four season six to be precise i think it was bought for us around three years ago for a christmas present 
 now my husband chris and i love this show  
 but let 's face it when you 've watched it once maybe or twice you don 't really want to watch it again because you know how jack bauer is going to defeat the terrorists  
 so there it sits on our shelves
 obsolete to us but with immediate
  latent value to someone else  
 now before we go on  i have a confession to make i lived in new york for ten years  and i am a big fan of sex and the city 
 now i 'd love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm up to the sequel coming out next week  
 so how easily could i swap our unwanted copy of twenty four for a wanted
  sex and the city now you may have noticed there 's a new sector emerging called swap trading now the easiest analogy for swap trading is like
 an online dating service for all your unwanted media 
 what it does is use the internet to create an infinite marketplace to match person a 's haves with person c 's wants whatever they may be 
 the other week  i went
  so in other words what 's happening here is that swaptree solves my carrying company 's sugar rush problem a problem
  the economists call the coincidence of wants in approximately sixty seconds what 's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot because it knows the way of the item 
 now there are layers of technical wonder behind sites such as swaptree  but that 's not my interest and nor is swap trading per se 
 my passion and what i 've spent the last few years dedicated to researching
  behaviors and 
 inherent in these systems 
 when you think about it it would have seemed like a crazy idea  even a few years ago  that i would swap my stuff with a total stranger whose real name i didn 't know
 and without any money changing hands  yet ninety nine percent of trades on swaptree happen successfully and the one percent that receive a negative rating
 relatively minor reasons like the item didn 't arrive on time  so what 's happening here an extremely powerful
 dynamic that has huge commercial and cultural
 implications is at play  namely that technology is enabling trust between strangers  
 we now live in a global village where we can mimic the ties
  that used to happen face to face but on a scale and in ways that have never been possible before 
 so what 's actually happening is that social networks and real time technologies are taking us back 
 we 're bartering trading swapping sharing but they 're being reinvented into dynamic and appealing forms 
 what i find fascinating is that we 've actually wired our world to share
  that 's our neighborhood our school our office  or our facebook network  and that 's creating an economy of what 's mine is yours 
 from the mighty ebay  the grandfather of exchange marketplaces 
 to car sharing companies such as goget where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour 
 to social lending platforms such as zopa that will take anyone in this audience with
  one hundred dollars to lend and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world 
 we 're sharing and collaborating again in ways that i believe are more hip than hippie  
 i call this groundswell collaborative consumption 
 now before i dig into the different systems of collaborative consumption 
 i 'd like to try and answer the question that every author rightfully gets asked  which is where
 did this idea come from 
 now i 'd like to say i woke up one morning and said i 'm going to write about collaborative consumption but
 actually it was a complicated web of seemingly disconnected ideas 
 over the next minute you 're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head 
 the first thing i began to notice how many big concepts were emerging from the
  wisdom of crowds to smart mobs around how ridiculously easy it is to form groups for a purpose  
 and linked to this crowd mania were examples all around the world from the election of a president to the infamous wikipedia and everything in between
 on what the power of numbers could achieve now you know when you learn a new
  and then you start to see that word everywhere that 's what happened to me when i noticed that we are moving from passive consumers
 to creators to highly enabled collaborators what
 's happening is the internet is removing the middleman 
 so that anyone from a t shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling  peer to peer 
  means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates  
 i mean  it 's amazing to think that in every single minute of this speech twenty five hours of youtube video will be loaded  
 now what i find fascinating about these examples is how they 're actually tapping into our primate instincts  
 i mean we 're monkeys  and we 're born and bred to share and cooperate  and we were doing so for thousands of years
  whether it 's when we hunted in packs  or 
 farmed in cooperatives before this big system called hyper consumption came along
 and we built these fences and created out own little fiefdoms  
 but things are changing and one of the reasons why is the digital natives or gen y 
  it 's second nature to them  
 so we the millennials i am just a millennial are like foot soldiers moving us from a culture of me to a culture of we 
 the reason why it 's happening so fast is because of mobile collaboration  we now live in a connected age
 where we can locate anyone anytime in real time from a small device in our hands all of this was going through my head towards the end of two thousand and eight
  of course the great financial crash happened thomas friedman is one of my favorite new york times columnists  and he poignantly commented
 that two thousand and eight is when we hit a wall when mother nature and the market both said no more 
 now we rationally know that an economy built on
  a ponzi scheme  it 's a house of cards  yet it 's hard for us to individually know what to do  
 so all of this is a lot of twittering right well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head until actually i realized it was happening because of four key drivers 
 one a renewed belief in the importance of community and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means 
 a torrent of peer to peer
  fundamentally changing the way we behave three pressing unresolved environmental concerns 
 and four a global recession that has fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors 
 these four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift
 away from the
  're at an inflection point where the sharing behaviors through sites such as flickr and twitter
 that are becoming second nature online are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives 
 from morning commutes to the way fashion is designed to the way we grow food we are consuming and collaborating once again 
  and i have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption  
 and although they vary enormously in scale maturity and purpose  when we dived into them we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems 
 the first is redistribution markets  redistribution markets  just like swaptree are when you take a used or
  and move it from where it 's not needed to somewhere or someone where it is 
 they 're increasingly thought of as the fifth ' r ' reduce reuse recycle repair and redistribute because they stretch the life cycle of a product and thereby reduce waste  
 the second is collaborative lifestyles  this is the sharing of resources of things like money skills and time i bet in a couple of
  are going to become a part of everyday vernacular one of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles
 is called landshare  
 it 's a scheme in the u k that matches mr jones with some spare space in his back garden 
 with mrs smith a would be grower together they grow their own food
  's one of those ideas that 's so simple yet brilliant you wonder why it 's never been done before 
 now the third system is product service systems 
 this is where you pay for the benefit of the product what it does for you without needing to own the product outright 
 this idea is particularly powerful for things that have high idling capacity  
 and that can be anything from baby goods to fashions to how many of you have a power drill 
 own a power
  drill  right  that power drill will be used around twelve to thirteen minutes in its in its entire lifetime 
 it 's kind of ridiculous right because what you need is the hole not the drill so why don 't you rent the
 drill or even better rent out your own drill to other people and make some money from it these three systems are coming together
  people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles  or their cherished personal freedoms  i 'm not asking people to share nicely in the sandpit 
 so
 i want to just give you an example of how powerful collaborative consumption can be to change behaviors  the average car
  hours a day  so when you consider these two facts it starts to make a little less sense that we have to own one outright  
 so this is where car sharing companies such as zipcar and goget come in 
 in two thousand and nine zipcar took two hundred and fifty participants from across thirteen cities
 and
  to surrender their keys for a month 
 instead these people had to walk bike take the train  or other forms of public transport they could only use their zipcar membership when absolutely necessary  
 the results of this challenge after just one month was staggering  it 's amazing that four hundred and thirteen lbs were lost
  just from the
 extra exercise  
 but my favorite statistic is that one hundred out of the two hundred and fifty participants did not want their keys back 
 in other words  the car addicts had lost their urge to own 
 now products service systems have been around for years just think of libraries and laundrettes but i think they 're entering a new age because technology makes sharing frictionless and fun 
 there 's a great quote that was written in the new york times that said
 sharing is to ownership
 what the ipod is to the 8 track what solar solar power is to the coal mine 
 i believe also our generation 
 our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation  i don 't want the dvd
 i want the movie it carries  i don 't want a clunky answering machine i want the message it saves  i don 't want a cd  i want the music it plays in other words  i don 't want stuff 
 i want the needs or experiences it fulfills 
 this is fueling a massive shift
 from where usage trumps possessions or as kevin kelly the editor of wired magazine puts it where access
 is better than ownership now as our
 possessions dematerialize into the cloud a blurry
  line is appearing between what 's mine what 's yours  and what 's ours i want to give you one example that shows how fast this evolution is happening 
 this represents an eight year time span we 've gone from traditional car ownership
 to car sharing companies such as zipcar and goget to
  platforms that match rides to the newest entry which is peer to peer car rental where you can actually make money out of renting that car that sits idle for twenty three hours a day to your neighbor 
 now all of these systems require a degree of trust and the cornerstone to this working is reputation 
 now in the old consumer system our reputation didn 't matter so much because our credit history was far more important that any kind of
  but now with the web we leave a trail 
 with every spammer we flag 
 with every idea we post comment we share we 're actually signaling how well we collaborate and whether we can or can 't be trusted 
 let 's go back to my first example swaptree  
 i can see that rondoron has completed five hundred and fifty three trades with a one hundred percent
  success rate in other words  i can trust him or her  
 now mark my words  it 's only a matter of time before we 're going to be able to perform a google like search
 and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital and this reputation capital will determine our access
  it 's a new social currency so to speak that could become as powerful as our credit rating  
 now as a closing thought  i believe we 're actually in a period where we 're waking up
 from this humongous hangover of emptiness and waste  
 and we 're taking a leap to create a more sustainable system built to serve our innate needs for community and individual identity  
 i believe it will be referred to as a revolution
  to speak
 when society faced with great challenges  made a seismic shift
 from individual getting and spending towards a rediscovery of collective good
 i 'm on a mission to make sharing cool  i 'm on a mission to make sharing hip
 because i really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business
 help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of  hyper consumption and teach us when enough really is enough thank you very much
