  i live in south central 
 this is south central  liquor stores  
 fast food 
 vacant lots  so the city planners they get together and they figure they 're going to change the name south central to make it represent something
  else  so they change it to south los angeles  like this is going to fix what 's really going wrong in the city this
 is south los angeles 
 liquor stores  fast food vacant lots just like twenty six point
  people are dying from curable diseases in south central los angeles  for instance the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times
  ten miles away
 i got tired of of seeing this happening  and i was wondering how would you feel
 if you had no access to healthy food  if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood 
 i see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars  i see dialysis centers popping up like starbucks
  i figured this has to stop   so i figured that
 the problem is the solution 
 food is the problem and food is the solution  
 plus i got tired of driving forty five minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn 't impregnated with pesticides  
 so what i did i planted a food forest in front of my house
  a strip of land that we call a parkway it 's one hundred and fifty feet by ten feet thing is it 's owned by the city  
 but you have to maintain it so i 'm like cool 
 i can do whatever the hell i 
  's my responsibility and i gotta maintain it and this is how i decided to
  so me and my group l a green grounds we got together and we started planting my food forest fruit trees you know the whole nine  vegetables what we do we 're a pay it forward kind of group 
 where it 's composed of gardeners from all walks of life from all over the city and it 's completely volunteer and everything we do is free 
 and the garden it was beautiful 
 and then somebody complained the city came down on
  basically gave me a citation saying that i had to remove my garden which this citation was turning into a warrant and i 'm like come on really 
 a warrant for planting food on on a piece of land that you could care less about 
 and i was like cool bring it because this time it wasn 't coming up 
  got ahold of it steve lopez did a story on it and and
 talked to the councilman  and one of the green grounds members they put up
 a petition on change org and with nine hundred signatures  we were a success we had a victory on our hands  my councilman even called in
 and said how they endorse and love what we 're doing  i mean come on why
  the united states in vacant lots that the city actually owns they own twenty six square miles
 of vacant lots that 's twenty central parks that 's enough space to plant seven hundred and 
  million tomato plants why in the hell would they not okay this growing one plant will give you one thousand ten thousand
  seeds  when one dollar 's worth of green beans
 will give you seventy five dollars ' worth of produce it 's my gospel when i 'm telling people grow your own food  growing your own food is like printing your own money 
  i have a legacy in south central  
 i grew up there  i raised my sons there  
 and i refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people and i 'm manufacturing my own reality 
 see i 'm an artist
  gardening is my graffiti i grow my art 
  just like a graffiti artist 
 where they beautify walls me  
 i beautify lawns  parkways  
 i use the garden the soil like it 's a piece of cloth and the plants and the trees  that 's my embellishment for that cloth 
 you 'd be surprised what what
 the soil could do if you let it be your canvas
  you just couldn 't imagine how amazing a sunflower is
 and how it affects people  so what
 what happened  
 i have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood 
 to change the community you have to change the composition of the soil  we are the soil
  be surprised
 how kids are affected by this gardening is the most
 therapeutic and defiant act you can do
 especially in the inner city  plus you get strawberries 
 i remember this time
  thirty at night and they were in my yard  
 and i came out and they looked so ashamed so i 'm like 
 man it made me feel bad that they were there and i told them  you know you don 't have to do this like this 
 this is on the street for a reason  
 it made me feel ashamed to see people
 that were this close to me that were hungry
  the whole idea  i want them to take it but at the same time i want them to take back their health 
 there 's another time when 
 i put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown los angeles these are the guys they helped me
  unload the truck it was cool  and they just shared the stories about how
 this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother and it was just cool to see how this how this changed them if it was only for for that one moment  
 so green grounds has gone on to plant maybe twenty gardens  we 've had like
  like  fifty people come to our dig ins and participate and it 's all volunteers if kids grow kale  kids eat kale 
 if they grow tomatoes  
 they eat tomatoes  
 but when none of this is is presented to them  if they 're not shown how food affects the mind and the body they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them
 i see young people and
 they want to work  
 but they 're in this thing where they 're caught up i see kids of color and they 're just on this track that 's designed for them
  that leads them to nowhere  so with with gardening i see an opportunity where we can train these kids
 to have a sustainable life
 and when we do this who knows we might produce the next george george washington  carver but if we don 't change the composition of the soil  we will never do this  
 now this is this is one of my plans this is what i want to do 
 i want to plant a whole
 block of gardens
  where people can share in the food in the same block  i want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes
  now don 't get me wrong i 'm not talking about no free shit  because
 free is not sustainable the
 funny thing about sustainability  you have to sustain it 
 i 'm talking about is putting people to work and
 getting kids off the street and letting them know the joy the pride and the honor in growing your own food  opening farmer 's markets
 so what i want to do here  we gotta make this sexy  
 so i want us all to become ecolutionary renegades  gangstas gangsta gardeners
 get gangsta with your shovel okay and let that be your weapon of choice
 so basically  if you want to meet with me  
  don 't call me if you want to sit around in in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit
 where you talk about doing some shit  if you want to meet with me come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit
