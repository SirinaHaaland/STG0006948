  to share with you today is my challenge
 as an iranian artist  as an iranian woman artist as an iranian woman artist living in exile well
 pluses and minuses on the dark side politics doesn 't seem to escape people like me 
 every iranian artist in one form or another is political politics have defined our lives 
 if you 're living in iran you 're facing censorship  harassment  arrest torture at times  execution
  if you 're living outside like me you 're faced with life in exile
 the pain of the longing
 and the separation from your loved ones and your family 
 therefore we don 't find the moral  emotional  psychological and political space
 to distance ourselves from the reality of social
 responsibility  oddly enough an artist such as myself
 finds herself also in the position
 of being the voice  the speaker of my people  even if i have indeed  no access to my own country 
 also people like myself we 're fighting
 two battles on different grounds we 're being critical of the west the perception of the west about our identity
 about the image that is constructed about us about our
  women about our politics about our religion  
 we are there to take pride and insist on respect and at the same time we 're fighting another battle 
 that is our regime our government
 our atrocious government [ that ] has done every crime in order to stay in power our artists are at
  risk we are in a position of danger we pose a threat to the order of the government  
 but ironically  
 this situation has empowered all of us 
 because we are considered as artists  central to the cultural political social discourse in iran 
 we are there to inspire to provoke 
  mobilize to bring hope to our people we are the reporters of our people and are communicators to the outside world 
 art is our weapon 
 culture is a form of resistance  i envy sometimes the artists of the west
 for their freedom of expression for the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of
  politics from the fact that they are only serving one audience mainly
 the western culture  
 but also i worry about the west 
 because often in this country in this western world that we have 
 culture risks being a form of entertainment 
 our people depend on our
  communication 
 my journey as an artist started from a very very personal place  
 i did not start to make social commentary about my country  
 the first one that you see in front of you is actually when i first returned to iran after being separated
  i was absent from iran the islamic revolution had descended on iran and had entirely transformed the country from persian to the islamic culture 
 i came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that i found my place in the society  
 but instead
  i found a country that was totally ideological and that i didn 't recognize anymore  more so i became very interested as i was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions  
 i became immersed in the study of the islamic revolution
 how indeed  it had incredibly transformed the lives of iranian women 
 i found the subject of iranian women immensely interesting in the way the women of iran
  embody
 the political transformation so in a way by studying a woman you can read the structure and the ideology of the country 
 so i made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life  and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse the subject of martyrdom
  the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection
 of love of god  faith  but violence and crime and cruelty 
 for me this became incredibly important  and yet  
 i had an unusual position toward this i was an outsider who had come back to iran to find my place  but i was not in a position to be critical
 of the government or the ideology of the islamic revolution
 this changed slowly as i found my voice and i discovered things that i didn 't know i would discover so my art became slightly more critical my knife became a little sharper 
 and i fell into a life in exile  
 i am a nomadic artist  i work in morocco in turkey in mexico  i go everywhere to make believe it 's iran
 am making films  
 last year i finished a film called women without men 
 women without men returns to history  but another part of our iranian history it goes to one thousand nine 
 when american cia exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader dr mossadegh
  the book is written by an iranian woman shahrnush parsipur it 's a magical realist novel this book is banned and she spent five years in prison 
 my obsession with this book and the reason i made this into a film is
 because it at once was addressing the question of being a female traditionally historically in iran
 and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change freedom and democracy while the country of iran
  as if another character also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy and independence from the foreign interventions 
 i made this film because i felt it 's important for it to speak to the westerners
 about our history
 as a country that all of you seem to remember iran after the islamic revolution that iran was once a secular society  and we had
  democracy and this democracy was stolen from us
 by the american government by the british government this film also speaks to the iranian people
 in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so islamicized
 in the way we looked  in the way we played music in the way we had intellectual life  and most of all
  the way that we fought for democracy 
 these are some of the shots actually from my film 
 these are some of the images of the coup and we made this film in casablanca  
 recreating all the shots this film tried to find a balance between telling a political story but also a feminine story
  i am foremost interested
 to make art to make art that transcends politics religion the question of feminism 
 and become an important  timeless  universal work of art the challenge i have is how to do that 
 how to tell a political story but an allegorical story how to move you with your emotions
  but also make your mind work these are some of the images
 and the characters of the film 
  now comes the green movement the summer of two thousand and nine  as my film is released the uprising begins in the streets of tehran  
  the period that we tried to depict in the film 
 the cry for democracy and social social justice  repeats itself now again in tehran the green movement
 significantly inspired the world 
 it brought a lot of attention to all those iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy what was most significant for me was once again
 the presence of the women they 're absolutely inspirational for me  
 if in the islamic revolution the images of the woman portrayed were submissive and didn 't have a voice  
 now we saw a new idea of feminism in the streets of tehran
 women who were educated  forward thinking
  and those young men
 united iranians across the world  inside and outside 
 i then discovered why i take so much inspiration from iranian women 
 that under all circumstances  they have pushed the boundary they have confronted the authority they have broken every rule in the smallest and
  the biggest way  and once again they proved themselves i stand here to say that iranian women have found a new voice and their voice
 is giving me my voice and it 's a great honor to be an iranian woman and an iranian artist  even if i have to operate in the west only for now
