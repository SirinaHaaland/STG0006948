  frugal digital is essentially a small research group at c i d where we are looking to find
 alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society that 's what we
  we do this because we actually believe that silicon technology today is mostly about a culture of excess  
 it 's about the fastest and the most efficient and the most dazzling gadget you can have 
 while about two thirds of the world can hardly reach the most basic of this technology
 to even address fundamental needs in life  including health care education
 and all these kinds of
 very fundamental issues
  before i start i want to talk about a little anecdote a little story about a man i met
 once in mumbai  
 so this man his name is sathi shri  he is an outstanding person because he 's a small entrepreneur  he runs a little shop in one of the back streets of mumbai  
 he has this little
  so much is being done  it 's incredible because i couldn 't believe my eyes when i once just happened to bump into him basically what he does is he has all these services for micro payments and booking tickets and all kinds of basic things that you would
 go online for but he does it for people offline and connects to the digital world 
 more importantly he makes his money by selling these mobile recharge coupons you know for the prepaid subscriptions 
  but then in the backside he 's got this little nook
 with a few of his employees where they can fix almost anything  
 any cell phone any gadget you can bring them they can fix it and it
 's pretty incredible because i took my iphone there and he was like yeah do you want an upgrade yes 
 i was a bit skeptical but then i decided to give him a nokia instead
  this reverse engineering and know how that 's built into this little
 two meters
 of space  they have figured out everything that 's required to dismantle take things apart  
 rewrite the circuitry re flash the firmware do whatever you want to with the phone  and they can fix anything so quickly you can hand over a phone this
  morning and you can go pick it up after lunch  and it was quite incredible  
 but then we were wondering whether this is a local phenomenon or is truly global and over time we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about  
 because that is something that 's happening not just in one street corner in mumbai  it 's actually happening in all parts of the country  
 it 's even happening in africa like for example in cape town we did extensive research
  even here in doha i found this little nook where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed  
 and it 's a lot of tiny little parts  it 's not easy you 've got to try it on your own to believe it  but what fuels this it 's this entire ecosystem
 of low cost parts and supplies
 that are produced all over the world literally and then redistributed to basically service this industry  
 and you can even buy salvaged parts basically you don 't have to necessarily buy brand new things you have
  condemned computers that are stripped apart and you can buy salvaged components and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration  
 but what does this new  sort of approach give us that 's the real question because this is something that 's been there part of every society that 's
 deprived of enough resources  but there 's an interesting paradigm there 's the traditional
  and then there 's the technology crafts we call it the technology crafts because these are emerging  they 're not something that 's been established it 's not
 something that 's institutionalized it 's not taught in universities  it 's taught [ by ] word of mouth and it 's an informal education system around this  
 so we said what can we get out of this you know like what are the key values that we can get out of this 
 the main thing is a fix it locally culture  which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn 't have to
 go through a huge bureaucratic system to get it
  fixed  it also affords us cheap fabrication which is fantastic so it means that you can do a lot more with it  
 and then the most important thing is it gives us large math for low cost so it means that you can actually embed pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds of extendable ideas into really simple devices
  what we call this is a silicon cottage industry it 's basically what was the system or the paradigm before the industrial revolution is now re happening in a whole new way in small digital shops
 across the planet in most developing countries  so we kind of
 toyed around with this idea  and we said what can we do with this can we make a little product or a service out of it so one of the first things we did is this thing called a multimedia platform we call it a lunch box basically one of the
  that we studied was
 schools in very remote parts of india  
 so there is this amazing concept called the one teacher school  which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker who teaches this amazing little social setting  it 's an informal school  but it 's really about holistic education 
 the only thing that they don 't have is access to resources they don 't even have a textbook sometimes  and they don 't even have a proper curriculum  so we said
  we do to empower this teacher to do more how to access the digital world  instead of being the sole guardian of information be a facilitator to all this information  
 so we said what are the steps required to empower the teacher how do you make this teacher into a digital gateway and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform that can be constructed locally and serviced locally 
 so we walked around  we went and scavenged
 markets and we tried to understand what can we pick up that will make this happen 
 so the thing that we got was a little mobile phone with a little pico projector that comes for about sixty dollars  
 we went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery  and a bunch of small speakers  so essentially the
 mobile phone gives us a
 connected multimedia platform it allows us to get online and
 allows us to load up files of different formats and play them 
 the flashlight gives us this really intense bright  l e d and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack 
 and the lunch box is a nice little package in which you can put everything inside  
 and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of amplify the sound large enough believe me  those little classrooms are really noisy  
 they are kids who scream at the top of their voices and you really have to get above that  
 and we took it back
 this little tinkering setup of a mobile phone repair shop  and then the magic happens we dismantle the whole thing we reassemble it in a new configuration  
 and we do this hardware mashup systematically training the guy how to do this  
 out comes this a little lunch box form factor
  learned some important lessons  and we went through many iterations one of the key issues was battery consumption and charging  
 luminosity was an issue when you have too much bright sunlight outside often the roofs are broken  so you don 't have enough
 darkness in the classroom to do these things we extended
  we tested it many times over and the next version we came up with
 was a box that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy but most importantly connect
 to a car battery  because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power in places where there 's not enough electricity or erratic electricity 
 and the other key thing that we did was make this box run off a usb key because we realized that even though there was gprs and all that on paper at least in
  it was much more efficient to send the data on a little usb key by surface mail  it might take a few days to get there but at least it gets there in high definition and in a reliable quality  
 so we made this box and we tested it again and again and again and we 're going through multiple iterations to do these things  but it 's not limited to just
 education this kind of a technique or metrology can actually be applied to other kinds of areas and i 'm going to tell you one more little story  
 it 's about this little device called a medi meter it 's basically a
 a little health care screening tool that we developed 
 in india there is a context of these amazing people the health care workers called asha workers they are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system who live in the local community and are trained 
  with basic tools and basic concepts of health care  and the main purpose is basically to
  make recommendations of what kind of health care should they approach they are basically referral services essentially  
 but the problem with that is that we realized after a bunch of research
 that they are amazing at referring people to the nearest clinic or the public health care system  but what happens at the public health care system is
  incredibly long lines and too many people who overload the system
 simply because there 's not enough doctors and and facilities for the population that 's being referred so everything from a common cold to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same level of attention and there 's no priorities so we
 said come on there 's got to be a better way of doing this for sure so we said what can we do with the asha worker that 'll allow this
  asha worker to become an interesting filter but not just a filter a really well thought through referral system
 that allows load balancing of the network  and directs
 patients to different sources of health care based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations 
 so the real key question was how do we empower this woman how do we empower her with simple tools
 that 's not diagnostic but more screening
  she at least knows how to advise the patients better and that 'll make such a huge difference on the system because the amount of waiting time
 and the amount of distances that people need to travel often sometimes seven to fifteen kilometers sometimes by foot to get a simple health check done 
 is very very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care
  so if there was something that she could do that would be amazing so what we did was that we converted this device into a medical device i want to demo this actually because it 's a very simple process 
 bruno do you want to join us come along 
 so 
 what we 're going to do is that we 're going to measure a few basic parameters on you 
 including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen that
  's there in your blood  so you 're going to put your thumb on top of this
 so it 's taking a little reading from you 
 and then the pointer goes and points to three different options let 's see what happens here 
 beeps oh bruno you can go home
  had pointed to the red spot  we would have to rush you to a hospital  
 luckily not today  and if it had pointed to the orange or the amber  it basically meant you had to have 
 sort of more continuous care from the health care worker so that was a very simple three step screening process that could basically change the
  just explain to you how this is done  because that 's the more interesting part  so essentially the three things that are required to make this conversion from this guy
 to this guy
 is
 a cheap remote control for a television that you can almost find in every home today
  some parts from a computer mouse basically something that you can scavenge for very low cost  
 and a few parts that have to be pre programmed basically this is a 
 with a few extra components that can be shipped for very little cost across the world  
 and that 's what is all required with a little bit of local tinkering talent to convert the device into something else  
 so we are right now
 doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the asha worker  we are going through some reference tests to compare it against professional equipment to see
 if there 's a degree of change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact in people 's lives  
 but most importantly  what we are trying to do right now is we are trying to scale this up because there are over two hundred and fifty thousand asha workers on the
 who are these amazing foot soldiers  and if we can give
 at least a fraction of them the access to these things  it just changes the way the economics of public health care works  and it changes the way systems actually function not just
 on a systematic planning level planning level but also in a very grassroots  bottom up level  
 so that 's it  and we hope to do this in a big way thank you
