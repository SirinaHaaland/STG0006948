  how often do we hear that people just don 't care  how many times have you been told that real substantial change isn 't possible
 because most people are too selfish too stupid or too lazy to try to make a difference in their community  i propose to you today that apathy
  as we think we know it doesn 't actually exist  
 but rather that people do care  but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way i 'll give you some examples of what i mean 
 let 's start with city hall you ever see one of these before this
 is a newspaper
  it 's a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building so the neighborhood knows what 's happening  as you can see it 's impossible to read you need to get halfway down to even find out which address they 're talking 
  about  and then further down in tiny 10 point font to find out how to actually get involved
  never happen 
 you 'll never see an ad like that because nike actually wants you to buy their shoes  
 whereas the city of toronto clearly doesn 't want you involved with the planning process otherwise their ads would look something like this with all the information laid out clearly  as long as the city 's putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged then of course people aren 't going to be engaged  but that 's not
  the manner in which we mistreat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change because we 've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression  
 whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice  dominating the visual and mental environment the problem with this model is there
  some amazing messages that need to be said that aren 't profitable to say so you 're never going to see them on a billboard  
 the media plays an important role in developing our relationship with
 political change  mainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals  but even when they do talk about important political issues they do it in a way that i feel discourages engagement i 'll give you an example the now magazine from last week
  downtown weekly in toronto this is the cover story  it 's an article about a theater performance and it starts with basic information about where it is in case you actually want to go and see it after you 've read the article
 where the time the website same with this it 's a movie review an art review a book review where the reading is in case you want to go 
 a restaurant
 you might not want to just read about it maybe you want to go there so they tell you where it is the prices the address the phone number etc  then you get to their
  political articles  here 's a great article about an important election race that 's happening it talks about the candidates written very well  but no information no follow up no websites for the campaigns no information about when the debates are where the campaign offices are 
 here 's another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign the message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat
 maybe read a book maybe see a movie but not be engaged in their community you might think this is a small thing but i think it 's important because it sets a tone
 and it it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport 
 heroes how do we view leadership look at these ten movies what do they have in common
  they all have heroes who were chosen someone came up to them and said you 're the chosen one there 's a prophecy  you have to save the world and then they go off and save the world because they 've been told to 
 with a few people tagging along 
 this helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about 
 a heroic effort is a collective
  it 's imperfect  it 's not very glamorous and doesn 't suddenly start and suddenly end it 's an ongoing process your whole life but most importantly  it 's voluntary  
 it 's voluntary  as long as we 're teaching our kids
 that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead or someone tells you you 're part of a prophecy they 're missing the most important characteristic of leadership which is that it comes from within  
 it 's about following your own dreams uninvited
  with others to make those dreams come true 
 political parties oh boy  
 political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points for people to get engaged in politics instead they 've become sadly
  uninspiring
 and uncreative organizations that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups that they end up all saying the same thing pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear
  hear at the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas  and people can smell that and it feeds cynicism 
 charitable status groups who have charitable status in canada aren 't allowed to do advocacy this is a huge problem and a huge obstacle 
  to change because it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices are completely silenced
  especially during election time which leads us to the last one which is 
 our elections 
 as you may have noticed our elections in canada are a complete joke we use out of date systems that are unfair and create random results canada 's currently led by a party that most canadians didn 't actually want how
 can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote when votes don 't count in canada 
 you add all this up together and of
  course people are apathetic it 's like trying to run into a brick wall  now i 'm not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining
 what 's in our way quite the opposite i actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care
  but that as i said we live in this in this environment where all these obstacles are being put
 in our way  as long as we believe that people our own neighbors are selfish
  stupid or lazy then there 's no hope  
 but we can change all those things i mentioned we can open up city hall we can reform our electoral systems we can democratize our public spaces 
 my main message is 
 if we can redefine apathy not as some kind of internal syndrome  but as a complex web of cultural barriers
  reinforces disengagement 
 and if we can clearly define clearly identify what those obstacles are  
 and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles then anything is possible thank you
