 
 so i 've known a lot of fish in my life 
 i 've loved only two 
 that first one was a 
 it was more like a passionate affair 
 it was a beautiful fish 
 flavorful textured 
 meaty a best seller on the menu what a fish 
 
 even better it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability 
 
 so you could feel good about selling it 
 
 i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months 
 
 one day the head of the company called and asked if i 'd speak at an event 
 
 about the farm 's sustainability absolutely i said 
 
 here was a company trying to solve 
 what 's become this unimaginable problem for our chefs 
 
 how do we keep fish on our menus 
 
 for the past fifty years we 've been fishing the seas 
 like we clear cut forests 
 
 it 's hard to overstate the destruction 
 ninety percent of large fish the ones we love the tunas the halibuts the salmons swordfish they 've collapsed there was nothing left 
 
 so for better or for worse aquaculture fish farming is going to be a part of our future 
 a lot of arguments against it 
 fish farms pollute 
 most of them do anyway and they 're inefficient take tuna a major drawback 
 
 it 's got a feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna 
 not very sustainable doesn 't taste very good either 
 
 so here finally 
 
 was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support them 
 
 the day before the event i called the head of pr for the company 
 let 's call him don 
 don i said just to get the facts straight you guys are famous for for farming so far out to sea you you don 't pollute that 's right he said we 're so far out 
 the waste from our fish gets distributed 
 not concentrated and then he added 
 we 're basically a world unto ourselves 
 
 that feed conversion ratio two point five to one he said best in the business 
 
 two point five to one great two point five to one what what are you feeding sustainable proteins he said 
 
 great i said got off the phone 
 
 and that night i was lying in bed and i thought 
 
 what the hell is a sustainable protein 
 
 so the next day just before the event i called don i said don what are some examples of sustainable proteins he said he didn 't know 
 
 he would ask around well i got on the phone with a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer 
 
 until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist 
 
 let 's call him don too 
 
 don i said what are some examples of sustainable proteins 
 
 well he mentioned some algaes 
 and some fish meals and then he said chicken pellets 
 
 i said chicken pellets he said yeah feathers skin 
 
 bone meal scraps dried and processed into feed 
 i said what percentage 
 of your feed is chicken 
 
 thinking you know two percent 
 
 well it 's about thirty percent he said 
 
 i said don 
 what 's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish 
 
 there there was a long pause on the line 
 
 and he said there 's just too much chicken in the world 
 
 i fell out of love with this fish 
 
 no not because i 'm some self righteous goody two shoes foodie 
 
 i actually am 
 
 no i fell out of love with this fish because i swear to god after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken 
 
 this second fish 
 
 it 's a different kind of love story 
 
 it 's the romantic kind 
 
 the kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish 
 
 i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain 
 
 a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time 
 she kind of set us up 
 
 ok it came to the table a bright 
 almost shimmering white color 
 
 the chef had overcooked it like twice over ok amazingly it was still delicious 
 
 who can make a fish taste good 
 
 after it 's been overcooked 
 i can 't but this guy can 
 let 's call him miguel actually his name is miguel 
 
 and no he didn 't cook the fish and he 's not a chef at least in the way that you and i understand it 
 he 's a biologist 
 at veta la palma it 's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain 
 
 it 's at the tip of the guadalquivir river 
 
 until the nineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians 
 
 they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands 
 
 they did it by draining the land they built this intricate series of canals 
 
 and they pushed water off the land and out into the river 
 
 well they couldn 't make it work not economically 
 and ecologically it was a disaster 
 
 killed like ninety percent of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds 
 
 and so in nineteen eighty two 
 
 a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do 
 
 they reversed the flow of water they literally flipped the switch 
 
 instead of pushing water out 
 they used the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canals 
 
 they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish farm 
 bass mullet shrimp eel 
 and in the process miguel and this company 
 completely reversed the ecological destruction 
 
 the farm 's incredible i mean you 've never seen anything like this 
 
 you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland 
 
 i was there not long ago with miguel 
 
 he 's an amazing guy 
 
 like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile dundee 
 
 okay 
 there we are slogging through the wetlands 
 
 and i 'm panting and sweating got mud up to my knees and miguel 's calmly conducting a biology lecture 
 
 here he 's pointing out a rare black shouldered kite 
 now he 's mentioning 
 the mineral needs of phytoplankton 
 and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe 
 
 it turns out miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa 
 
 i asked him how he became such an expert on fish he said fish 
 
 i didn 't know anything about fish 
 i 'm an expert in relationships 
 and then he 's off 
 launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants and don 't get me wrong that was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing you know it 's great 
 but i was in love and my head 
 was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before so i interrupted him i said miguel what makes your fish taste so good 
 he pointed at the algae 
 i know dude the algae the phytoplankton the relationships it 's amazing 
 
 but what are your fish eating what 's the feed conversion ratio 
 
 well he goes on to tell me 
 
 it 's such a rich system 
 
 that the fish are eating what they 'd be eating in the wild 
 
 the plant biomass the phytoplankton the zooplankton it 's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it 's totally self renewing there 
 there is no feed 
 ever heard of a farm that doesn 't feed its animals 
 
danbarber_2010 1 danbarber_2010_s103 573.02 578.57 <o,f0,> later that day i was driving around this property with miguel and i asked him i said for a place that seems so natural 
 
 unlike like any fish any farm i 'd ever been at 
 
 how do you measure success 
 
 at that moment it was as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos 
 
 a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see 
 
 that 's success he said 
 
 look at their bellies pink they 're feasting 
 
 feasting i was totally confused i said miguel aren 't they feasting on your fish 
 
 yes he said 
 
 we lose twenty percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds 
 
 well the last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it 
 
 more than two hundred and fifty different species it 's become today the largest 
 
 and one of the most important 
 
 private bird sanctuaries in all of europe 
 
 i said miguel isn 't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm 
 
 he shook his head no he said 
 we farm extensively 
 
 not intensively 
 
 this is an ecological network 
 
 the flamingos eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the phytoplankton so the pinker the belly the better the system 
 
 okay so let 's review a farm that doesn 't feed its animals 
 
 and a farm that measures its success 
 
 on the health of its predators 
 
 a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary 
 
 oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn 't even be there in the first place 
 
 they brood in a town a hundred and fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests 
 
 every morning they fly one hundred and fifty miles into the farm 
 
 and every evening they fly one hundred and fifty miles back 
 
 they do that because they 're able to follow the broken white line of highway a ninety two 
 
 no kidding 
 
 you know i was imagining a march of the penguins thing you know so i looked at miguel i said 
 miguel do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm 
 and then do they fly one hundred and fifty miles back at night 
 
 do they do that for the children 
 
 he looked at me like i had just quoted a whitney houston song 
 
 he said no they do it because the food 's better 
 
 you know i didn 't mention the skin of my beloved fish 
 
 which was delicious and i don 't like fish skin i don 't like it seared i don 't like it crispy 
 
 it 's that acrid tar like flavor 
 i almost never cook with it 
 yet when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain it tasted not at all like fish skin 
 
 it tasted sweet and clean 
 
 like you were taking a bite of the ocean 
 
 i mentioned that to miguel and he nodded he said the skin acts like a sponge it 's the last defense before anything enters the body it evolved 
 to soak up impurities and then he added 
 
 but our water has no impurities 
 
 okay a farm that doesn 't feed its fish 
 
 a farm that measures its success 
 by the success of its predators 
 
 and then i realized when he says 
 a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the guadalquivir river 
 
 it 's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days 
 
 chemical contaminants pesticide runoff 
 
 and when it works its way through the system 
 
 and leaves the water is cleaner than when it entered 
 
 the system is so healthy it purifies the water 
 
 so not just a farm that doesn 't feed its animals not just a farm that measures its health 
 
 health success by the health of its predators 
 
 but a farm that 's literally a water purification plant 
 
 and not just for those fish 
 
 but for you and me as well because when that water leaves it dumps out into the atlantic 
 
 a drop in the ocean i know but i 'll take it and so should you 
 
 because this love story 
 
 however romantic is also instructive 
 you might say it 's a recipe for the future of good food 
 
 whether we 're talking about bass or beef cattle 
 
 what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good 
 
 but for a lot people 
 that 's a bit too radical 
 we 're not realists us foodies 
 we 're lovers 
 we love farmers markets we love small family farms 
 we talk about local food we eat organic 
 
 and when you suggest these are the things that will insure 
 the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says hey guy 
 
 i love pink flamingos but how are you going to feed the world how are you going to feed the world 
 
 how are you going to feed the world can i be honest i don 't love that question 
 
 no not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world 
 
 one billion people 
 
 will go hungry today one billion that 's more than ever before 
 
 because of gross inequalities in distribution not tonnage 
 
 no i don 't love this question because it 's determined the logic of our food system for the last fifty years 
 
 feed grain to herbivores 
 
 pesticides to monocultures chemicals to soil chicken to fish 
 
 and all along agribusiness has simply asked 
 
 if we 're feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be 
 
 that 's been the motivation it 's been the justification it 's been the business plan 
 
 of american agriculture we should call it what it is 
 
 a business in liquidation 
 
 a business that 's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible 
 that 's not a business and it isn 't agriculture 
 our bread basket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources 
 
 not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertile land 
 
 not by pumps but by fresh water 
 
 not by chainsaws but by forests and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the sea want to feed the world 
 
 let 's start by asking how are we going to feed ourselves 
 
 or better how can we create conditions that enable every community 
 to feed itself 
 
 to do that don 't look 
 at the agribusiness model for the future it 's really old and it 's tired it 's high on capital chemistry and machines 
 
 and it 's never produced anything really good to eat 
 
 instead let 's look to the ecological model 
 
 that 's the one that relies on two billion years 
 
 of on the job experience 
 
 farms that aren 't worlds unto themselves 
 farms that 
 restore instead of deplete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively 
 
 farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships 
 because they 're the ones 
 that are experts in flavor too 
 
 and if i 'm going to be really honest 
 
 they 're a better chef than i 'll ever be 
 you know i 'm okay with that 
 because if that 's the future of good food it 's going to be delicious thank you
