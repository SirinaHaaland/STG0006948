 
 i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction in high school i i took a bus to school an hour each way every day and i was always absorbed in a book 
 science fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this in in a in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had and and 
 you know that curiosity also manifested itself in in 
 the fact that whenever i wasn 't in school i was i was out in the woods hiking and taking 
 samples frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and bringing it back looking at it under the microscope i was you know i was a real science geek but it was all about trying to understand 
 understand the world understand the the limits of of possibility and my you know love of of science fiction 
 actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening this is in the late sixties 
 you know we were we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep oceans jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a you know a wondrous world that we could never really have 
 previously imagined so that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it  
 and i was a an artist i could draw i could paint and and i i found that because there weren 't you know video games and this saturation of cg movies and and all of this imagery in the media landscape 
 i had to create these images in my head you know we all did as kids having to read a book and through the author 's description put something on on the screen the movie screen in our heads and so my 
 response to this was to paint to draw alien creatures alien worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in math class you know doodling behind the behind the textbook and 
 that was the creativity had to had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened the the jacques cousteau 
 shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday that that seemed pretty pretty darn unlikely 
 but i could that was a world i could really go to right here on earth that was as as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined from reading these books 
 so i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean  
 but i didn 't let that daunt me i pestered my father until he finally found a a scuba class in in buffalo new york right across the border from where we live 
 and i actually got certified in a pool in a ymca in the dead of winter in buffalo new york and  
 i didn 't see the ocean a a real ocean for another two years until we until we moved to california you know since then you know in in the in the intervening 
 forty years i 've i 've spent about three thousand hours underwater and five hundred hours of that was in submersibles and i 've learned that 
 that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow oceans are so rich with with amazing life 
 that really is beyond beyond our imagination you know nature 's imagination is so 
 so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i what i see when i make these dives and my love affair with the ocean is 
 is ongoing and and just as strong as it ever was but when i when i chose a career as an adult 
 it was film making and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile 
 this urge i had to tell stories with my my urges to create images and i was as a kid constantly drawing comic books and so on so film making was the way to put put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that 
 i chose to tell were science fiction stories terminator aliens and the abyss and with the abyss i i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with film making so you know 
 merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was 
 that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature  
 we actually embraced computer generated animation cg and  
 this this resulted in the first soft surface character cg animation that was ever in a in a movie 
 and even though the film didn 't make any money barely broke even i should say i witnessed something amazing which is that the the audience the global audience was mesmerized by this apparent magic you know it 's arthur clarke 's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic they were seeing something magical 
 and so that that that got me very excited and i thought wow this is this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art so with terminator two which was my next film we took that much farther working with with ilm we created the liquid metal 
 dude in that film the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work and it did and we created magic again and we had the same result with an audience although we did make a little more money on that one so  
 you know drawing a line through those those two two dots of of experience came to this this is going to be a whole new world this was a whole new world of creativity for 
 for film artists so i i started a company with stan winston my good friend stan winston who is the the the premier make up and and creature designer 
 at that time and it was called digital domain and the concept of the company was that we would leap frog past the kind of analog processes of of optical printers and so on and we would go right to digital production and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while 
 but we found ourselves lagging in the in the mid nineties in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do 
 so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope  
 of visual effects of cg effects beyond with realistic human emotive characters generated in cg and the main characters would all be in cg and the world would be in cg and  
 you know the envelope pushed back and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren 't going to be able to do this for a while so i shelved it and i made this other movie about a big ship that sinks 
 
 and you know i i went and pitched it to the studio as romeo and juliet on a ship it 's going to be this epic romance passionate 
 film secretly what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real wreck of titanic and that 's why i made the movie 
 
 and that 's the truth now the studio didn 't know that but i convinced them i said i said we 're going to dive to the wreck we 're going to film it for real we 'll be using it in the opening of the film it will be really important it will be a great marketing hook and i talked them into funding an expedition 
 
 sounds crazy but this goes back to that theme about you know your imagination creating a reality because we actually created a reality where six months later i find myself in a russian submersible 
 two and a half miles down in the north atlantic looking at the real titanic through through a view port not a movie not hd for real 
 
 now that that blew my mind and you know it took a lot of preparation we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this 
 dive these deep dives was like a like a space mission you know where it was it was highly technical and it required enormous planning you get in this capsule you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can 't get back by yourself 
 and you know i i thought wow i 'm i 'm like living in a science fiction movie this is really cool 
 and so i i really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration of course the curiosity the science component of it it was everything it was adventure it was curiosity it was imagination and it was an experience 
 that hollywood couldn 't give me because you know i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it but i couldn 't imagine what i was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions  
 i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and and sometimes things that i had had never seen before sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them so i was completely smitten by this 
 and had to do more and so i actually made a kind of curious decision after the success of titanic i said okay you know i 'm going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker and i 'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while 
 and so you know we started planning these these expeditions and we wound up going to the bismark and and exploring it with with robotic vehicles we went back to the titanic wreck we took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic 
 and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship which had never been done nobody had ever looked inside the wreck they didn 't have the means to do it so we created technology to do it 
 so you know here i am now on the deck of titanic sitting in a submersible and looking out at planks that look much like this where i knew that the that the band had played 
 and i 'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the through the corridor of the of the ship you know when i say you know i 'm i 'm i 'm operating it but my mind is in the vehicle 
 i felt like i was physically present inside the shipwreck of titanic and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience i 've i 've ever had because 
 i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie  
 and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship so it was this absolutely remarkable experience and it really made me realize that 
 made me realize that the the telepresense experience that you actually can have these robotic avatars then your consciousness 
 is is in injected into the into the vehicle into this this other form of existence it was really really quite profound and maybe a little bit of a glimpse to to what might be happening you know some decades out as 
 as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in in many sort of post human futures that i that i can imagine as a science fiction fan so having done these these 
 expeditions and and you know really beginning to appreciate what was down there such as at the at the the deep ocean vents where we had these 
 amazing amazing animals they are basically aliens right here on earth they live in an environment of chemosynthesis they don 't survive  
 on sunlight based system the way we do and so you 're seeing animals that are living next to a five hundred degree centigrade water plumes that you think they can 't possibly exist at the same time 
 
 i was getting very interested in space science as well again you know it 's the science fiction influence as a kid 
 and i wound up getting involved with the space community really involved with with nasa sitting on the nasa advisory board planning actual space missions going to russia going to the pre cosmonaut biomedical protocols and all these sorts of things 
 to actually go and fly to the international space station with our three d camera systems and this was fascinating but what what i wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep 
 and taking them down so that they had access astrobiologists planetary scientists people who were interested in these extremely fine environments 
 taking them down to the vents and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and so on so here we were making documentary films but actually doing science and actually doing space science  
 i 'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan you know as a kid and doing this stuff for real  
 and you know along the way in this journey of discovery i learned a lot i learned a lot about science but i also learned a lot about  
 leadership now you think directors got to be a leader leader of you know captain of the ship and all that sort of thing i didn 't really learn about leadership until 
 
 i did these expeditions because i had to at a certain point say what am i doing out here why am i doing this what do i get out of it  
 we don 't make money at these damn shows you know we barely break even there is no fame in it people sort of think i went away between titanic and avatar and was buffing my nails someplace you know sitting at the beach made all these films made all these documentary films you know for a very 
 limited audience no fame no glory no money what are you doing you 're doing it for the task itself for the challenge  
 and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens  
 when a small group of people form a tightly knit team because we would do these things with ten twelve people working for years at a time  
 sometimes at sea for for for two or three months at a time and in that bond you realize that the most important thing 
 is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you that you 've done a task 
 that you can 't explain to someone else when you come back to the shore and you say you know we had to do this and the fiber optic and the attentuation and the this and the that all the all the technology of it and the difficulty the human performance aspects of working at sea 
 you can 't explain it to people it 's that thing that that maybe cops have or people in in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it creates a bond creates a bond of respect so when i came back to make my next movie which was avatar 
 i tried to apply that same principle of leadership which is that you respect your team and you earn their respect in return and it really changed the dynamic so here i was again with a small team  
 in you know in uncharted territory doing avatar coming up with new technology that didn 't exist before tremendously exciting tremendously challenging and we became a family 
 over a four and half year period and it completely changed how i do movies so people have commented on how well you know you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of pandora to me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business the process itself that changed as a result of that  
 so what can we synthesize out of all this you know what 's the what are the lessons learned well i think number one is curiosity it 's the most powerful thing you own imagination 
 is a force that can actually manifest a reality and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world  
 
 i have young film makers  
 come up to me and say you know give me some advice for doing this 
 and i say 
 don 't put limitations on yourself other people will do that for you don 't do it to yourself don 't bet against yourself and and take risks nasa has this has this phrase that they like failure is not an option 
 but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration because it 's a leap of faith and no important endeavor that required innovation  
 was done without risk you have to be willing to take those risks so that 's the thought i would leave you with is that in whatever you 're doing failure  
 is an option but fear is not thank
