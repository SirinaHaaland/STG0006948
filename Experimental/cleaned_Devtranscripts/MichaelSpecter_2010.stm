 
 let 's pretend right here we have a machine a big machine a cool ted ish machine and it 's a time machine and everyone in this room has to get into it and you can go backwards you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are 
 and i wonder what you 'd choose because i 've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back i don 't know they want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idol 
 i don 't know i 'm i 'm convinced that there 's some sort of pull to nostalgia to wishful thinking and i understand that i 'm not part of that crowd i have to say 
 i don 't want to go back and it 's not because i 'm adventurous it 's because possibilities on this planet they don 't go back they go forward so i want to get in the machine and i want to go forward 
 this is the greatest time there 's ever been on this planet by any measure you wish to choose health wealth 
 mobility opportunity declining rates of disease there 's never been a time like this my great grandparents 
 died all of them by the time they were sixty my grandparents pushed that number to seventy my parents are closing in on eighty so i 've 
 there 'd better be there 'd better be a nine at the beginning of my death number but it 's not even about people like us because 
 this is a bigger deal than that a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did one hundred years ago 
 think about that it 's an incredible fact and why is it true 
 smallpox smallpox killed billions of people on this planet it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has it 's gone 
 it 's vanished we vanquished it puff in the rich world 
 diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist hardly diphtheria rubella polio does anyone even know what those things are 
 
 vaccines modern medicine our ability to feed billions of people those are triumphs of the scientific method and to my mind the scientific method trying stuff out 
 
 seeing if it works changing it when it doesn 't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity so that 's the good news 
 unfortunately that 's all the good news because there 's some other problems and they 've been mentioned many times and one of them is that 
 despite all our accomplishments a billion people go to bed hungry in this world 
 every day that number 's rising and it 's rising really rapidly and it 's disgraceful and not only that we 've used our imagination 
 to thoroughly trash this globe potable water arable land rainforest oil gas they 're going away 
 and they 're going away soon and unless we innovate our way out of this mess we 're going away too 
 so the question is can we do that and i i think we can i think it 's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on i think we can power this world with energy that doesn 't also destroy it 
 i really do believe that and no it ain 't wishful thinking but here 's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night 
 
 we 've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now never and we 've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today we 're on the verge of amazing amazing events in many fields 
 and yet i actually think we 'd have to go back hundreds three hundred years before the enlightenment to find a time when we battled progress when we fought about these things more vigorously on on more fronts 
 than we do now people wrap themselves in their beliefs and they do it so tightly that you can 't set them free not even the truth will set them free and listen 
 everyone 's entitled to their opinion they 're even entitled to their opinion about progress but you know what you 're not entitled to you 're not entitled to your own facts sorry you 're not and this took me awhile to figure out 
 about a decade ago i wrote a story about vaccines for the new yorker a little story and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is after all the most effective public health measure in human history 
 
 i didn 't know what to do so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on and soon after that 
 
 i wrote a story about genetically engineered food same thing only bigger people were going crazy so 
 i wrote a story about that too and i couldn 't understand why people thought this was frankenfoods why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trespassing on nature 's ground 
 but you know i do what i do i wrote the story i moved on i mean i 'm a journalist 
 we type we file we go to dinner it 's fine 
 
 but these stories bothered me and i couldn 't figure out why and eventually i did and that 's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren 't actually fanatics at all they were thoughtful people educated people decent people 
 they were exactly like the people in this room 
 and it it just disturbed me so much but then i thought you know let 's be honest we 're at a point in this world 
 where we don 't have the same relationship to progress that we used to we talk about it ambivalently we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress 
 
 okay there are reasons for that and i think we know what those reasons are we 've lost faith in institutions in authority and sometimes in science itself and there there 's no reason we shouldn 't have you can just say a few names and people will understand 
 chernobyl bhopal the challenger 
 vioxx weapons of mass destruction hanging chads 
 i mean you know you can choose your list 
 there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right so be skeptical 
 
 ask questions demand proof demand evidence don 't take anything for granted but here 's the thing when you get proof 
 you need to accept the proof and we 're not that good at doing that 
 and the reason that i can say that is because we 're now in an epidemic of fear like one i 've never seen and hope never to see again about twelve years ago there was a story published a horrible story 
 that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles mumps and rubella vaccine shot 
 
 very scary tons of studies were done to see if this was true tons of studies should have been done it 's a serious issue 
 
 the data came back the data came back from the united states from england from sweden from canada and it was all the same no correlation no connection none at all 
 it doesn 't matter it doesn 't matter because we believe anecdotes we believe what we see what we think we see what makes us feel real 
 we don 't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data and i i do understand that i think we all do but you know what 
 the result of that has been disastrous disastrous because here 's a fact 
 the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down 
 that is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves it 's horrible 
 and what kind what kind of a thing happened that we could do that now 
 i understand it i do understand it because does anyone have measles here has one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles 
 doesn 't happen very much doesn 't happen in this country at all but it happened a hundred and sixty thousand times in the world last year that 's a lot of death of measles twenty an hour 
 
 but since it didn 't happen here we can put it out of our minds and people like jenny mccarthy 
 can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live 
 and they can do it because they don 't link causation and correlation they don 't understand that these things seem the same but they 're almost never the same and it 's something we need to learn and we need to learn it really soon 
 
 this guy was a hero jonas salk he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us no fear no agony polio puff gone 
 that guy in the middle not so much his name is paul offit 
 he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people it 's save the lives of four hundred five hundred thousand 
 kids in the developing world every year pretty good right well it 's good except that paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining and he actually says it that way so paul 's a terrorist 
 when paul speaks in a public hearing he can 't testify without armed guards he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school 
 and why because paul made a vaccine i don 't need to say this but vaccines are essential you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases and that 's happening we have measles in this country now 
 and it 's getting worse and pretty soon kids are going to die again because it 's just a numbers game and they 're not just going to die of measles what about polio let 's have that 
 why not a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said you know she thought i was a little strident no one 's ever said that before 
 she wasn 't going to vaccinate her kid against polio no way fine 
 why because we don 't have polio and you know what we didn 't have polio in this country yesterday today i don 't know maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning and he 's flying to lax right now he 's over ohio 
 and he 's going to land in a couple hours he 's going to rent a car and he 's going to come to long beach and he 's going to attend one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight and he doesn 't know that he 's infected with a paralytic disease and we don 't either because that 's the way the world works that 's the planet we live on 
 don 't pretend it isn 't now we love to wrap ourselves in lies we love to do it everyone take their vitamins this morning 
 echinacea echinacea a little antioxidant to get you going 
 i know you did because half of americans do every day they take the stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn 't matter how often we 
 find out that they 're useless the data says it all the time they darken your urine they almost never do more than that 
 
 it 's okay you want to pay twenty eight billion dollars for dark urine i 'm totally with you 
 
 dark urine dark 
 
 why do we do that why do we do that well i think i understand we hate big pharma we hate big government we don 't trust the man and we shouldn 't our health care system sucks 
 it 's cruel to millions of people it 's absolutely astonishingly cold 
 and soul bending to those of us who can even afford it so we run away from it and where do we run we leap into the arms of big placebo 
 
 that 's fantastic i love big placebo 
 
 but you know it 's not it 's it 's it 's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap and we spend billions of dollars on it and i have all sorts of little props here 
 none of it ginkgo fraud 
 echinacea fraud acai i don 't even know what that is but we 're spending billions of dollars on it it 's fraud 
 and you know what when i say this stuff people scream at me and they say what do you care let people do what they want to do it 's it 's it makes them feel good and you know what you 're wrong because 
 i don 't care if it 's the secretary of h h s 
 who 's saying hmm i 'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on the mammograms or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient 
 with coffee enemas when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science you end up in a place you don 't want to be 
 you end up in thabo mbeki south africa he killed four hundred thousand of his people by insisting 
 that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of aids hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease 
 please don 't tell me there are no consequences to these things there are there always are now 
 the most mindless epidemic we 're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between 
 proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite it 's an idiotic debate it has to stop it 's a debate about words about metaphors 
 it 's ideology it 's not science 
 every single thing we eat every grain of rice every sprig of parsley every brussel sprout has been modified by man you know there weren 't tangerines in the garden of eden 
 there wasn 't any cantaloupe 
 there weren 't christmas trees we made it all we made it over the last eleven thousand years 
 
 and some of it worked and some of it didn 't we got rid of the stuff that didn 't now we can do it in a more precise way and there are risks 
 absolutely but we can put something like vitamin a into rice and that stuff can help millions of people millions of people prolong their lives 
 
 you don 't want to do that i i have to say i don 't understand it we object to genetically engineered food why do we do that well the things i constantly hear are 
 too many chemicals pesticides hormones 
 monoculture we don 't want giant fields of the same thing that 's wrong 
 we don 't want companies patenting life we don 't want companies owning seeds and you know what my response to all of that is yes 
 you 're right let 's fix it it 's true we 've got a huge food problem but this isn 't science 
 this has nothing to do with science it 's law it 's morality it 's patent stuff you know science isn 't a company it 's not a country 
 it 's not even an idea it 's a process 
 it 's a process and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn 't but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we 're afraid 
 is really very deadening and it 's preventing millions of people from prospering you know in the next 
 fifty years we 're going to have to grow seventy percent more food than we do right now seventy percent this is investment in africa over the last thirty years disgraceful disgraceful they need it and we 're not giving it to them and why 
 genetically engineered food we don 't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff like cassava for instance cassava 's something that half a billion people eat it 's kind of like a potato it 's just a bunch of calories it sucks 
 it doesn 't have nutrients it doesn 't have protein and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now 
 and then people would be able to eat it and they 'd be able to not go blind they wouldn 't starve and you know what that would be nice it wouldn 't be chez panisse but it would be nice 
 
 and all i can say about this is 
 why are we fighting it why i mean let 's ask ourselves why are we fighting it because we don 't want to move genes around this is about moving genes around it 's not about chemicals 
 it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones our insistence on having bigger food better food singular food 
 this isn 't about rice krispies this is about keeping people alive and it 's about time we started to understand what that meant because you know something if we don 't 
 if we continue to act the way we 're acting we 're guilty of something that i don 't think we want to be guilty of high tech colonialism there 's no other way to describe what 's going on here it 's selfish 
 it 's ugly it 's beneath us and we really have to stop it 
 
 so after this amazingly fun conversation 
 
 you might want to say so you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward 
 and absolutely absolutely i do it 's stuck in the present right now but we have an amazing opportunity we can set that time machine on anything we want we can move it where we want to move it 
 and we 're going to move it where we want to move it we have to have these conversations and we have to think but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead 
 we 're going to be happy we do i know that we can and as far as i 'm concerned 
 that 's something the world needs right now thank you 
 
 thank you 
 
 thank you
