going talk today energy climate might seem bit surprising full time work foundation mostly vaccine seed thing need invent deliver help poorest two billion live better life energy climate extremely important people fact important anyone else planet climate getting worse mean many year crop grow much rain enough rain thing change way fragile environment simply support lead starvation lead uncertainty lead unrest climate change terrible also price energy important fact could pick one thing lower price reduce poverty far would pick energy price energy come time uh really advanced civilization based advance energy coal revolution fueled industrial revolution even nineteen hundred seen rapid decline price electricity refrigerator air conditioning make uh modern material many thing wonderful situation uh electricity rich world make cheaper let say let go making twice cheap need meet new constraint constraint co two co two warming planet equation co two actually straightforward one sum co two get emitted lead temperature increase temperature increase lead negative effect effect weather perhaps worse indirect effect natural ecosystem adjust rapid change get ecosystem collapse exact amount map certain increase co two temperature positive feedback uncertainty much certainly uncertainty bad effect extremely bad asked top scientist several time really get near zero know cut half quarter answer get near zero temperature continue rise big challenge different saying know twelve foot high truck trying get ten foot bridge sort squeeze something get zero put lot carbon dioxide every year twenty six billion ton american twenty ton uh people poor country le one ton average five ton everyone planet somehow make change bring zero constantly going various economic change even flattened go rapidly rising falling falling way zero equation four factor little bit multiplication got thing left co two want get zero going based number people service person using average energy average service co two put per unit energy let look one see get zero uh probably one number going get pretty near zero back high school algebra let let take look first got population world today six point eight billion people headed nine billion really great job new vaccine health care reproductive health service could lower perhaps ten fifteen percent see increase one point three second factor service use encompasses everything food eat clothing tv heating good thing getting rid poverty mean providing service almost everyone planet great thing number go rich world perhaps top one billion probably could cut back use le every year number average going go double service delivered per person basic service lighting house able read homework fact kid going reading school work street lamp efficiency e energy service finally good news something going various invention new way lighting different type car different way building building lot service bring energy service quite substantially individual service even bring ninety percent service like make fertilizer air transport room improvement far far le overall optimistic may get reduction factor three even perhaps factor six first three factor gone twenty six billion best maybe thirteen billion ton cut let look fourth factor going key one amount co two put per unit energy question actually get zero burn coal burn natural gas almost every way make electricity today except emerging renewables nuclear put co two going global scale create new system need energy miracle use term miracle mean something impossible microprocessor miracle personal computer miracle internet service miracle people participated creation many miracle usually deadline get miracle certain date usually kind stand come along case actually drive full speed get miracle pretty tight time line thought could really capture kind natural illustration demonstration would grab people imagination thought back year ago brought mosquito somehow people enjoyed really got involved idea know people live mosquito energy could come decided releasing firefly would contribution environment year natural firefly told bite fact might even even leave jar sort gimmicky solution like one really add much need solution either one several unbelievable scale unbelievable reliability although many direction people seeking really see five achieve big number left tide geothermal fusion biofuels may make contribution better expect much better key point going work five give look daunting significant challenge let look first burning fossil fuel either burning coal burning natural gas need seems like might simple take co two burned going flue pressurize create liquid put somewhere hope stay pilot thing sixty eighty percent level getting full percentage tricky agreeing co two quantity put hard toughest one long term issue going sure going guarantee something literally billion time larger type waste think term nuclear thing lot volume tough one next would nuclear also three big problem cost particularly highly regulated country high issue safety really feeling good nothing could go wrong even though human operator fuel get used weapon waste although large lot concern people need feel good three tough problem might solvable worked last three five grouped together people often refer renewable source actually although great require fuel disadvantage one density energy gathered technology dramatically le power plant energy farming talking many square mile thousand time area think normal energy plant also intermittent source sun shine day shine every day likewise wind blow time depend source way getting energy time period available got big cost challenge transmission challenge example say energy source outside country need technology deal risk energy coming elsewhere finally storage problem dimensionalize went looked type battery get made car computer phone flashlight everything compared amount electrical energy world us found battery make could store le ten minute energy fact need big breakthrough something going factor hundred better approach impossible easy thing show try get intermittent source say twenty thirty percent using counting hundred percent need incredible miracle battery going go forward right approach manhattan project thing get u well need lot company working hundred five path need least hundred people lot look say crazy good think ted group many people already pursuing bill gross several company including one called esolar great solar thermal technology vinod khosla investing dozen company great thing interesting possibility trying help back nathan myhrvold actually backing company perhaps surprisingly actually taking nuclear approach innovation nuclear modular liquid innovation really stopped industry quite time ago idea good idea laying around surprising idea terrapower instead burning part uranium one percent u two thirty five decided let burn ninety nine percent u two thirty eight kind crazy idea fact people talked long time could never simulate properly whether would work advent modern supercomputer simulate see yes right material approach look like would work burning ninety nine percent greatly improved cost profile actually burn waste actually use fuel leftover waste today reactor instead worrying take great thing breathes uranium go along kind like candle see log often referred traveling wave reactor term fuel really solves problem got picture place kentucky left ninety nine percent taken part burn called depleted uranium would power u hundred year simply filtering sea water inexpensive process enough fuel entire lifetime rest planet know got lot lot challenge ahead example many hundred hundred idea need move forward let think measure report card look like well let go really need get look intermediate twenty fifty heard many people talk eighty percent reduction really important get twenty percent used thing going poor country still agriculture hopefully cleaned forestry cement get eighty percent developed country including country like china switch electric electricity generation altogether grade deploying zero emission technology deployed developed country process getting elsewhere super important key element making report card backing twenty twenty report card look like well two element go efficiency measure start getting reduction le emit le sum co two therefore le temperature way grade get thing get u way big reduction equally maybe even slightly le important piece innovation breakthrough breakthrough need move full speed measure term company pilot project regulatory thing changed lot great book written al gore book choice david mckay book sustainable energy without hot air really go think create framework discussed broadly need broad backing lot come together wish concrete wish invent technology gave one wish next fifty year could pick president could pick vaccine something love could pick thing half cost co two get invented wish would pick one greatest impact get wish division people think short term long term terrible u china poor country rich life two billion far worse appealing step forward drive need go research funding country get together place like copenhagen discus co two discus innovation agenda stunned ridiculously low level spending innovative approach need market incentive co two tax cap trade something get price signal need get message need dialogue rational understandable dialogue including step government take important wish one think achieve thank thank thank thank understand terrapower right mean first give sense scale investment actually software buy supercomputer hire great scientist done ten million even test material russian reactor make sure material work properly hundred million tough thing building pilot reactor finding several billion finding regulator location actually build first one get first one built work advertised clear day economics energy density different nuclear know understand right involves building deep ground almost like vertical kind column nuclear fuel sort spent uranium process start top kind work right today always refueling reactor lot people lot control go wrong thing opening moving thing good cheap fuel put sixty year think log put complexity sits burn sixty year done nuclear power plant waste disposal solution yeah well happens waste let sit lot le waste approach actually take put another one burn start actually taking waste exists today sitting cooling pool dry casking reactor fuel begin thing problem reactor actually get fed reducing volume waste quite dramatically going process talking different people around world possibility interest actually something well uh picked particular place uh interesting disclosure rule anything called nuclear got lot interest people company russia india china back seeing secretary energy talking fit energy agenda optimistic know french japanese done work variant something done important advance like fast reactor lot country built anybody done fast reactor candidate first one get built mind timescale likelihood actually taking something like live well need one high scale electro electro generation thing cheap twenty year invent twenty year deploy sort deadline environment model environmental model shown u meet know terrapower thing go well wishing lot could easily meet fortunately dozen company need hundred likewise science go well funding pilot pilot plant go well compete best multiple succeed could use mix mix thing certainly need one succeed term big scale possible game change biggest aware energy breakthrough important thing would even without environmental constraint environmental constraint make much much greater nuclear space innovator know know work well know one modular people different approach liquid type reactor seems little hard maybe say u different one beauty molecule uranium million time much energy molecule say coal deal negative essentially radiation footprint cost potential term effect land various thing almost class work start taking emergency measure try keep temperature earth stable yeah get situation like eating heart attack know go may need heart surgery something line research called geoengineering various technique would delay heating buy u twenty thirty year get act together hope insurance policy hope need people say even work insurance policy might make lazy keep eating know heart surgery save sure wise given importance problem geoengineering discussion back pocket case thing happen faster innovation go lot slower expect climate skeptic sentence two say might persuade wrong well unfortunately skeptic come different camp mean one make scientific argument know saying negative feedback effect cloud offset thing thing even say know chance million thing main problem kind like aid make mistake pay lot later sort urgent problem idea taking pain gain later somewhat uncertain pain thing fact ipcc report know necessarily worst case people rich world look ipcc say okay know big deal fact uncertain part move u towards dream make economic meet co two constraint skeptic say okay care put co two kind wish put co two guess accept cheaper come would response bjorn lomborg argument basically spend energy trying solve co two problem going take away goal trying rid world poverty malaria forth stupid waste earth resource put money towards better thing yeah well actual spending r piece know say u spend ten billion year right dramatic take away thing thing get big money reasonable people disagree something non economic trying fund mostly waste unless close funding learning curve going get cheap believe try know thing potential far le expensive trade get let make energy super super expensive rich afford mean u could pay five time much energy change lifestyle disaster two billion even lomborg changed shtick r getting discussed still earlier stuff associated skeptic camp realized pretty lonely camp making r point thread something think appropriate r piece crazy little funded well bill suspect speak behalf people say really hope wish come true thank much

everybody talk happiness day somebody count number book happiness title published last five year gave forty many huge wave interest happiness among researcher lot happiness coaching everybody would like make people happier spite flood work several cognitive trap sort make almost impossible think straight happiness talk today mostly cognitive trap applies laypeople thinking happiness applies scholar thinking happiness turn messed anybody else first trap reluctance admit complexity turn word happiness useful word anymore apply many different thing think one particular meaning might restrict large something give adopt complicated view well second trap confusion experience memory basically happy life happy life happy life two different concept lumped notion happiness third focusing illusion unfortunate fact think circumstance affect well without distorting importance mean real cognitive trap way getting right like start example somebody question answer session one lecture reported story story said listening symphony absolutely glorious music end recording dreadful screeching sound added really quite emotionally ruined whole experience ruined memory experience experience twenty minute glorious music counted nothing left memory memory ruined memory gotten keep telling u really might thinking people term two self experiencing self life present know present capable living past basically present experiencing self doctor approach know doctor asks hurt touch remembering self remembering self one keep score maintains story life one doctor approach asking question feeling lately trip albania something like two different entity experiencing self remembering self getting confused part mess notion happiness remembering self storyteller really start basic response memory start immediately tell story set tell story memory tell u story get keep experience story let begin one example old study actual patient undergoing painful procedure go detail longer painful day painful study run nineteen ninety asked report pain every sixty second two patient recording asked suffered easy question mean clearly patient b suffered colonoscopy longer every minute pain patient patient b another question much patient think suffered surprise surprise patient much worse memory colonoscopy patient b story colonoscopy different critical part story end neither story inspiring great one distinct one distinctly worse one worse one pain peak end bad story know asked people colonoscopy much later bad whole thing total much worse b memory direct conflict experiencing self remembering self point view experiencing self clearly b worse time could patient actually ran clinical experiment done work could actually extend colonoscopy patient keeping tube without jiggling much cause patient suffer little much le couple minute made experiencing self patient worse remembering self patient lot better endowed patient better story experience defines story true story memory delivers u also true story make defines story change significant moment ending ending important case know ending dominated experiencing self life life continuously moment experience one ask happens moment answer really straightforward lost forever mean moment life calculated know psychological present said three second long mean know life six hundred million month six hundred thousand leave trace completely ignored remembering self yet somehow get sense count happens moment experience life finite resource spending earth spend would seem relevant story remembering self keep u remembering self experiencing self really quite distinct biggest difference handling time point view experiencing self vacation second week good first two week vacation twice good one week vacation way work remembering self remembering self two week vacation barely better one week vacation new memory added changed story way time actually critical variable distinguishes remembering self experiencing self time little impact story remembering self remember tell story actually one make decision patient say two colonoscopy two different surgeon deciding choose one chooses one know memory le bad surgeon chosen experiencing self voice choice actually choose experience choose memory experience even think future think future normally experience think future anticipated memory basically look know tyranny remembering self think remembering self sort dragging experiencing self experience experiencing self need sense go vacation frequently case go vacation large extent service remembering self bit hard justify think mean much consume memory one explanation given dominance remembering self think think vacation antarctica year ago clearly best vacation ever think relatively often relative much think vacation probably consumed memory three week trip would say twenty five minute last four year know ever opened folder six hundred picture would spent another hour three week hour half seems discrepancy may bit extreme know little appetite consuming memory even genuine question put much weight memory relative weight put experience want think thought experiment imagine next vacation know end vacation picture destroyed get amnesic drug remember anything would choose vacation would choose different vacation conflict two self need think adjudicate conflict actually obvious think term time get one answer think term memory might get another answer pick vacation problem confronts u know choice two self two self bring two notion happiness really two concept happiness apply one per self ask happy experiencing self would ask happy moment experiencing self life happiness moment fairly complicated process emotion measured way capable getting pretty good idea happiness experiencing self time ask happiness remembering self completely different thing happily person life satisfied pleased person person think life different notion anyone distinguish notion going mess study happiness belong crowd student well messing study happiness long time precisely way distinction happiness experiencing self satisfaction remembering self recognized recent year effort measure two separately gallup organization world poll half million people asked question think life experience effort along line recent year begun learn happiness two self main lesson think learned really different know satisfied somebody life really teach much happily living life vice versa know give sense correlation correlation point five mean met somebody told oh father six foot tall would much would know height well would know something height lot uncertainty much uncertainty tell somebody ranked life eight scale ten lot uncertainty happy experiencing self correlation low know something control satisfaction happiness self know money important goal important know happiness mainly satisfied people like spending time people like pleasure dominant want maximize happiness two self going end different thing bottom line said really think happiness substitute well completely different notion quickly another reason think straight happiness attend thing think life actually live ask simple question happy people california going get correct answer ask question think people must happier california say live ohio happens think living california thinking contrast california place contrast say climate well turn climate important experiencing self even important reflective self decides happy people reflective self charge may end people may end moving california sort interesting trace going happen people move california hope getting happier well experiencing self going get happier know one thing happen think happier think reminded horrible weather ohio feel made right decision difficult think straight well hope given sense difficult thank thank got question thank thank much phone week ago mentioned quite interesting result came gallup survey something share since moment left sure sure think interesting result found gallup survey number absolutely expect find found respect happiness experiencing self know looked feeling vary income turn income sixty thousand dollar year american large sample american like six hundred thousand large representative sample income six hundred thousand dollar year six sixty thousand sixty thousand sixty thousand sixty thousand dollar year people unhappy get progressively unhappier poorer get get absolutely flat line mean rarely seen line flat clearly happening money buy experiential happiness lack money certainly buy misery measure misery clearly term self remembering self get different story money earn satisfied hold emotion danny whole american endeavor know life liberty pursuit happiness people took seriously finding mean seems turn upside everything believe know example taxation policy forth chance politician country generally would take finding like seriously run public policy based know think recognition role happiness research public policy recognition going slow united state question uk happening country happening people recognizing ought thinking policy happiness think public policy going take going people going debate whether want study experience happiness whether want study life evaluation need debate fairly soon enhance happiness go different way depending think whether think remembering self think experiencing
