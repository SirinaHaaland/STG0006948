RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 75.4 84.66 <NA> <unk> but it 's not just the microbes in our gut that are important microbes all over our body turn out to be really critical to a whole range of differences that make different people who we are 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 84.66 85.89 <NA> so
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 85.47 91.43 <NA> for example <unk> have you ever noticed how some people get bitten by mosquitos way more often than others

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 101.21 107.7 <NA> <unk> and the reason why is that we have different microbes on our skin that produce different chemicals that the mosquitos detect 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 108.11 114.31 <NA> now microbes are also really important in the field of medicine so for example what microbes you have in your gut

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 175 180.61 <NA> we do is we look at their dna sequences and in a project called the human microbiome project
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 180.61 186.28 <NA> nih funded this $ one hundred and seventy three million project where hundreds of researchers came together
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 185.89 194.44 <NA> to map out all the a 's t 's g 's and c 's and all of these microbes in the human body <unk> so when we take them together they look like this 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 194.44 197.97 <NA> it 's a bit more difficult to tell who lives where now isn 't it 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 198.44 199.99 <NA> what my lab does
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 200.7 204.65 <NA> <unk> computational techniques that allow us to take all these terabytes of sequence data

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 207.64 214.48 <NA> and so when we do that with the human microbiome data from two hundred and fifty healthy volunteers it looks like this 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 214.8 222.59 <NA> each point here represents all the complex microbes in an entire microbial community see i told you they basically all look the same 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 222.59 229.91 <NA> so what we 're looking at is each point represents one microbial community from one body site of one healthy volunteer and
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 229.96 232.7 <NA> <unk> you can see that there 's different parts of the map in different colors 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 232.7 240.65 <NA> almost like separate continents <unk> and what it turns out to be is that those as the different regions of the body have very different microbes in them 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 240.16 248.69 <NA> so what we have is we have the oral community up there in green over on the other side we have the skin community in blue the vaginal community
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 248.26 249.9 <NA> in purple <unk> and then right

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 259.67 265.52 <NA> so if i look at just one person 's microbes in the mouth and in the gut 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 265.53 272.29 <NA> it turns out that the difference between those two microbial communities is enormous it 's bigger than the difference between the microbes

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 273.4 275.17 <NA> and the microbes in this prairie
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 276.21 286.33 <NA> <unk> so this is incredible when you think about it what it means is that a few feet of difference in the human body makes more of a difference to your microbial ecology than hundreds of miles on earth <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 286.44 292.55 <NA> and this is not to say that two people look basically the same in the same body habitat either <unk> so
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 292.22 302.29 <NA> you probably heard that we 're pretty much all the same in terms of our human dna you 're ninety nine point nine nine percent identical in terms of your human dna to the person sitting next to you

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 304.93 313.09 <NA> <unk> only share ten percent similarity with the person sitting next to you in terms of your gut microbes so that 's as different as the bacteria on this prairie

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 316.06 323.13 <NA> so these different microbes have all these different kinds of functions that i told you about everything from digesting food to
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 322.97 328.53 <NA> involvement in different kinds of diseases metabolizing drugs and so forth <unk> so how do they do all this stuff
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 329.98 335.89 <NA> in part it 's because although there 's just three pounds of those microbes in our gut they really outnumber us <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 335.89 343.14 <NA> and so how much do they outnumber us well <unk> it depends on what you think of as our bodies is it our cells <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 342.74 352.02 <NA> well each of us consists of about ten trillion human cells <unk> but we harbor as many as one hundred trillion microbial cells <unk> so they outnumber us ten to one 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 352.34 354.67 <NA> now <unk> you might think well

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 356.37 366.22 <NA> but it turns out that each of us has about twenty thousand human genes depending on what you count exactly but as many as two million to twenty million microbial genes <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 365.82 371.17 <NA> so whichever way we look at it we 're vastly outnumbered by our microbial symbionts <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 371.01 379.97 <NA> and it turns out that in addition to traces of our human dna <unk> we also leave traces of our microbial dna on everything we touch we showed in a study

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 387.43 395.33 <NA> so this came out in a scientific journal a few years ago <unk> but more importantly <unk> it was featured on csi miami so you really know it 's true 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 396.7 404.94 <NA> so where do our microbes come from in the first place well if as i do you have dogs or kids you probably have some dark suspicions about that
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 405.2 413.82 <NA> all of which are true by the way so just like we can match you to your computer equipment by the microbes you share we can also match you up to your dog
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 413.39 420.33 <NA> <unk> but it turns out that in adults microbial communities are relatively stable <unk> so even if you live together with someone you

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 440.85 447.1 <NA> and this might be associated with some of the differences in health associated with cesarean birth

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 514.02 523.49 <NA> what i 'm showing you again here is this map of the human microbiome project data <unk> so each point represents a sample from one body site from one of two hundred and fifty healthy adults <unk>

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 548.73 553.74 <NA> and you can see that he 's starting off basically in the vaginal community as we would expect from his delivery mode
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 555.02 558.08 <NA> <unk> over these two and a half years is that he 's going to travel all the way down
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 557.92 566.28 <NA> to resemble the adult fecal community from healthy volunteers down at the bottom <unk> so i 'm just going to start this going and we 'll see how that happens <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 566.54 568.18 <NA> what you can see and
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 568.18 577.59 <NA> remember each step in this is just one week what you can see is that week to week the change in the microbial community of the feces of this one child 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 577.1 579.97 <NA> the differences week to week are much greater than

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 595.33 600.23 <NA> for an ear infection what you can see is this huge change in the community <unk> followed by a relatively
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 602.11 606.47 <NA> <unk> just rewind that for you <unk> and
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 606.01 615.59 <NA> what we can see is that just over these few weeks <unk> we have a much more radical change a setback of many months of normal development <unk> followed by a relatively rapid recovery <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 615.4 618.09 <NA> and by the time he reaches
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 617.86 625.05 <NA> day eight hundred and thirty eight which is the end of this video <unk> you can see that he has essentially reached the healthy adult stool community <unk> despite
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 627.71 637.83 <NA> <unk> so this is really interesting because it raises fundamental questions about what happens when we intervene at different ages in a child 's life <unk> <unk> so does what we do early on where the microbiome is changing so <unk>
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 637.73 644.34 <NA> <unk> rapidly actually matter or is it like throwing a stone into a stormy sea where the ripples will just be lost <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 650.04 657.73 <NA> <unk> months of life they 're more likely to become obese later on than if they don 't get antibiotics then or only get them later <unk> and so
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 657.56 665.44 <NA> what we do early on may have profound impacts on the gut microbial community and on later health that we 're only beginning to understand
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 665.7 679.85 <NA> so this is fascinating because one day in addition to the effects that antibiotics have on antibiotic resistant bacteria which are very important <unk> they may also be degrading our gut microbial ecosystems <unk> and so one day we may come to regard antibiotics with the same
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 679.78 687.11 <NA> <unk> horror that we currently reserve for those metal tools that the egyptians used to use to mush up the brains before they drained them out for embalming
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 686.86 695.6 <NA> so i mentioned that microbes have all these important functions and they 've also now just over the past few years been connected to a whole range of different diseases
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 695.14 700.08 <NA> including inflammatory bowel disease <unk> heart disease colon cancer and even
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 701.06 710.31 <NA> <unk> obesity has a really large effect as it turns out <unk> and today we can tell whether you 're lean or obese with ninety percent accuracy by looking at the microbes in your gut
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 710.24 721.8 <NA> <unk> now although that might sound impressive in some ways it 's a little bit problematic as a medical test <unk> because you can probably tell which of these people is obese without knowing anything about their gut microbes
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 721.43 725.08 <NA> <unk> but it turns out that even if we sequence their complete genomes and had
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 726.39 730.78 <NA> <unk> we could only predict which one was obese with about sixty percent accuracy <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 730.53 740.83 <NA> so that 's amazing right <unk> what it means that the three pounds of microbes that you carry around with you may be more important for some health conditions than every single gene in your genome <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 743.31 750.05 <NA> and then in mice we can do a lot more so in mice microbes have been linked to all kinds of additional conditions including things
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 756.07 761.33 <NA> <unk> but how can we tell whether these microbial differences that correlate with disease are cause or effect 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 760.93 771.23 <NA> well one thing we can do is we can raise some mice without any microbes of their own in a germ free bubble then we can add in some microbes that we think are important <unk> and see what happens 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 771.34 779.31 <NA> when we take the microbes from an obese mouse and transplant them into a genetically normal mouse that 's been raised in a bubble with no microbes of its own
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 779 780 <NA> it becomes fatter
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 779.69 782.91 <NA> <unk> fatter than if it got them from a regular mouse 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 783.65 791.5 <NA> why this happens is absolutely amazing though sometimes what 's going on is that the microbes are helping them digest food more efficiently from the same diet <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 791.5 797.43 <NA> so they 're taking more energy from their food but other times the microbes are actually affecting their behavior <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 797.09 803.05 <NA> what they 're doing is they 're eating more than the normal mouse <unk> so they only get fat if we let them eat as much as they want
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 804.93 811.63 <NA> <unk> this is really remarkable <unk> right the implication is that microbes can affect mammalian behavior <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 812.91 821.38 <NA> so you might be wondering whether we can also do this sort of thing across species <unk> and it turns out that if you take microbes from an obese person and <unk>
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 821.28 828.68 <NA> <unk> transplant them into mice you 've raised germ free those mice will also become fatter than if they received the microbes from a lean person
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 829.84 834.44 <NA> <unk> microbial community that we inoculate them with that prevents them from gaining this weight 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 834.91 840.62 <NA> we can also do this for malnutrition so in a project funded by the gates foundation 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 840.13 845.69 <NA> what we 're looking at is children in malawi who have kwashiorkor a profound form of malnutrition

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 854.98 863.52 <NA> butter based supplement that is used for the children in the clinic <unk> and the mice that receive the community from the healthy identical twins of the kwashiorkor children do fine 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 863.57 874.93 <NA> this is truly amazing because it suggests that we can pilot therapies by trying them out in a whole bunch of different mice with individual people 's gut communities and perhaps tailor those therapies all the way down to the
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 878.31 883.75 <NA> <unk> so i think it 's really important that everyone has a chance to participate in this discovery <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 883.5 891.34 <NA> so a couple of years ago <unk> we started this project called american gut which allows you to claim a place for yourself on this microbial map 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 891.15 904.97 <NA> this is now the largest crowd funded science project that we know of over eight thousand people have signed up at this point what happens is they send in their samples we sequence the dna of their microbes and then release the results back to them <unk> we also release

RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 925.66 929.94 <NA> but i 'm guessing that many of you do and so i brought some kits here
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 929.98 933.96 <NA> if you 're interested in trying this out for yourself <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 934.73 940.66 <NA> so why might we want to do this well it turns out that microbes are not just important for finding out
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 940.44 949.6 <NA> where we are in terms of our health but they can actually cure disease this is one of the newest things we 've been able to visualize with colleagues at the university of minnesota <unk>
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 950.4 957.82 <NA> <unk> so here 's that map of the human microbiome again <unk> what we 're looking at now i 'm going to add in the community of some people with c diff <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 957.82 967.84 <NA> so this is a terrible form of diarrhea where you have to go up to twenty times a day and these people have failed antibiotic therapy for two years before they 're eligible for this trial <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 967.59 971.36 <NA> so what would happen if we transplanted some of the stool
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 971.15 975.29 <NA> from a healthy donor that star down at the bottom into these patients
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 975.28 980 <NA> <unk> would the good microbes do battle with the bad microbes and help to restore their health 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 979.87 982.49 <NA> so let 's watch exactly what happens there 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 982.32 986.68 <NA> four of those patients are about to get a transplant from that healthy donor at the bottom <unk> 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 986.52 993.47 <NA> and what you can see is that immediately you have this radical change in the gut community so one day after you do that transplant 
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 993.47 1000.2 <NA> all those symptoms clear up the diarrhea vanishes <unk> and they 're essentially healthy again <unk> coming to resemble the donor 's community
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 1009.58 1021.35 <NA> <unk> just at the beginning of this discovery we 're just finding out that microbes have implications for all these different kinds of diseases <unk> ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to obesity <unk> and perhaps even autism and depression
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 1021.55 1024.75 <NA> <unk> what we need to do though is we need to develop a kind of microbial
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 1025.88 1028.57 <NA> <unk> just know where we are currently but also
RobKnight_2014 1 RobKnight_2014 1028.57 1036.49 <NA> where we want to go and what we need to do in order to get there <unk> and we need to be able to make this simple enough that even a child can use it
