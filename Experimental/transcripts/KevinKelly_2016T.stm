KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 19.99 29.4 <NA> often technology comes to us <unk> we 're surprised by what it brings <unk> but there 's actually a large aspect of technology that 's much more predictable
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 29.9 39.7 <NA> <unk> that 's because technological systems of all sorts have leanings they have urgencies they have tendencies and those tendencies are derived from the very

KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 45.11 54.97 <NA> and they will make reoccurring patterns again and again and so those patterns produce these these tendencies these leanings you can almost
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 54.99 64.42 <NA> <unk> think of it as sort of like gravity <unk> imagine raindrops falling into a valley <unk> the actual path of a raindrop as it goes down the valley is unpredictable <unk>

KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 69.9 72.2 <NA> and so these
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 73.71 79.91 <NA> <unk> and urgencies in technological systems give us a sense of where things are going at the large
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 79.87 84.26 <NA> <unk> form <unk> so in a large sense i would say that
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 84.01 86.45 <NA> telephones were inevitable <unk>

KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 444.63 454.03 <NA> the second aspect of this is is that we are going to use ai to basically make a second industrial revolution <unk>

KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 454.81 457.43 <NA> <unk> revolution was based on the fact that

KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 517.25 524.71 <NA> artificial power just by plugging something in so this was a source of innovation as well because a farmer could take a
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 524.22 529.94 <NA> manual hand pump <unk> and they could add this artificial power this electricity and he 'd have an electric pump
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 529.98 540.41 <NA> and you multiply that by thousands or tens of thousands of times <unk> and that formula was what brought us the industrial revolution all the things that we see all this progress that we now enjoy <unk>
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 540.36 549.35 <NA> has come from the fact that we 've done that we 're going to do the same thing now with ai we 're going to distribute that on a grid <unk> and now you can take that electric pump <unk> 
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 554.93 565.17 <NA> <unk> million times is going to be this second industrial revolution so now the car is going down the highway it 's two hundred and fifty horsepower but in addition it 's two hundred and fifty minds <unk> that <unk>
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 565.07 577.15 <NA> <unk> 's the auto driven car <unk> it 's like a new commodity it 's a new utility the ai is going to flow across the grid the cloud in the same way electricity did so everything that we had electrified <unk> we 're now going to
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 579.99 582.79 <NA> <unk> the formula for the next ten thousand <unk>
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 583.76 593.59 <NA> is very very simple which is to take x and add ai <unk> that is the formula that 's what we 're going to be doing and that is the
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 593.37 602.54 <NA> way in which we 're going to make this second industrial revolution and by the way right now this minute you can log on to google and you can purchase ai
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 602.54 604.91 <NA> for six cents one hundred hits that
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 604.9 609.03 <NA> <unk> available right now so the third aspect of this
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 608.79 618.41 <NA> is that when we take this ai and embody it we get robots <unk> and robots are going to be bots they 're going to be doing many of the tasks that we have already done <unk>
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 618.43 625.02 <NA> a job is just a bunch of tasks <unk> so they 're going to redefine our jobs because they 're going to do some of those
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 625.46 633.63 <NA> <unk> but they 're also going to create whole new categories a whole new slew of tasks that we didn 't know we wanted to do before <unk>
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 633.63 642.12 <NA> they 're going to actually engender new kinds of jobs new kinds of tasks that we want done just as automation

KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 650.9 653.02 <NA> but it 's important that a lot of the tasks that
KevinKelly_2016T 1 KevinKelly_2016T 655.08 662.87 <NA> <unk> that can be defined in terms of efficiency or productivity if you can specify a task either manual or
