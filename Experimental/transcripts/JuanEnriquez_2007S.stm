JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 830.65 832.55 <NA> that 's one month old 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 833.44 838.19 <NA> you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 838.51 845.06 <NA> <unk> and as you think about this stuff and what the implications of this are we 're going to start not just
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 844.69 846.27 <NA> converting
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 846.27 854.97 <NA> ethanol from corn with very high subsidies we 're going to start thinking about biology entering energy it
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 854.93 860.91 <NA> <unk> is very expensive to process this stuff <unk> both in economic terms and in energy terms
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 860.87 867.12 <NA> <unk> this is what accumulates in the tar sands of alberta these are sulfur blocks 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 867.14 873.7 <NA> because as you separate that petroleum from the sand and use an enormous amount of energy inside that
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 873.47 874.77 <NA> vapor
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 875 883.21 <NA> steam to separate this stuff you also have to separate out the sulfur the difference between light crude and heavy crude well it 's about fourteen bucks a barrel 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 883.35 889.84 <NA> that 's why you 're building these pyramids of sulfur blocks and by the way the scale on these things is pretty large <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 890.25 895.78 <NA> now if you can take part of the energy content out of doing this <unk> you reduce the system 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 896.1 902.17 <NA> and you really do start applying biological principles to energy <unk> this has to be a bridge
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 902.28 904.97 <NA> to the point where you can get to wind to
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 904.93 909.02 <NA> <unk> the point where you can get to solar to the point where you can get to nuclear
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 909.13 915.2 <NA> and hopefully you won 't build the next nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an earthquake fault 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 917.11 918.89 <NA> just a thought
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 921.82 929.91 <NA> <unk> but in the meantime for the next decade at least <unk> the name of the game is hydrocarbons and
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 930.02 935.58 <NA> <unk> that oil be that gas be that coal <unk> this is what we 're dealing with 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 935.6 939.48 <NA> and before i make this talk too long here 's
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 940.73 943.71 <NA> what 's happening in the current energy system
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 944.06 952.98 <NA> eighty six percent of the energy we consume are hydrocarbons <unk> that means eighty six percent of the stuff we 're consuming are probably processed plants
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 952.49 954.79 <NA> and amoebas and the rest of the stuff
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 955.44 961.96 <NA> and there 's a role in here for conservation there 's a role in here for alternative stuff but we 've also got to get that other portion right 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 962.04 965.8 <NA> how we deal with that other portion is our bridge to the future <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 966.09 975.17 <NA> and as we think of this bridge to the future one of the things you should ponder is we are leaving about two thirds of the oil today inside those wells
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 976.51 978.62 <NA> <unk> 're spending an enormous amount of money
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 978.31 980.9 <NA> and leaving most of the energy down there <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 980.74 984.53 <NA> which of course requires more energy to go out and get energy <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 984.34 992.21 <NA> the ratios become idiotic by the time you get to ethanol it may even be a one to one ratio on the energy input and the energy output 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 992.35 995.72 <NA> that is a stupid way of managing this system <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 996.19 1004.97 <NA> last point <unk> last graph one of the things that we 've got to do is to stabilize oil prices <unk> this is what oil
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1004.9 1006.32 <NA> <unk> prices look like 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1006.49 1012.14 <NA> ok this is a very bad system because what happens is your hurdle rate gets set very low 
JuanEnriquez_2007S 1 JuanEnriquez_2007S 1011.83 1022.35 <NA> people come up with really smart ideas for solar panels or for wind or for something else <unk> and then guess what the oil price goes through the floor <unk> that company goes out of business and then you can bring the oil price back up
