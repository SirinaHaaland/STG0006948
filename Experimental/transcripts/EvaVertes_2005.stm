EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 199.73 204.97 <NA> <unk> and i got to go talk to one professor dr jacobs who accepted me into the lab

EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 216.7 219.25 <NA> i started that and
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 219.36 222.26 <NA> worked in his lab for a year <unk> and
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 222.26 229.64 <NA> found the results that i guess you 'd expect to find when you feed fruit flies heavy metals that it really really impaired the nervous system
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 229.93 232.88 <NA> <unk> spinal cord had breaks the neurons were crossing
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 232.68 239.75 <NA> in every which way <unk> and from then i wanted to look not at impairment but at prevention of impairment 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 239.41 242.69 <NA> so that 's what led me to alzheimer 's
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 242.29 247.91 <NA> i started reading about alzheimer 's and tried to familiarize myself with the research

EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 258.7 268.57 <NA> properties and being naive about the whole field i kind of thought oh you have cell death in alzheimer 's which is causing the memory deficit <unk> and then you have
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 268.57 274.84 <NA> this compound purine derivatives that are promoting cell growth and so i thought maybe if it can promote cell

EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 315.15 319.49 <NA> i wanted to explore it all i wanted it all at once but knew i couldn 't really get that 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 319.49 326.39 <NA> and i stumbled across something called cancer stem cells and this is really what i want to talk to you about today about cancer 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 327.13 329.85 <NA> at first when i heard of cancer stem cells
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 329.86 340.41 <NA> i didn 't really know how to put the two together i 'd heard of stem cells and i 'd heard of them as the panacea of the future the therapy of many diseases to come in the future perhaps
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 340.41 347.61 <NA> <unk> but i 'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time so how did the good and bad go together
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 347.15 354.97 <NA> last summer i worked at stanford university doing some research on cancer stem cells and while i was doing
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 354.93 364.78 <NA> <unk> this i was reading the cancer literature trying to again familiarize myself with this new medical field and it seemed that
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 364.53 373.63 <NA> that tumors actually begin from a stem cell <unk> this fascinated me <unk> 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 373.35 379.94 <NA> the more i read the more i looked at cancer differently and almost became less fearful of it
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 379.93 388.83 <NA> it seems that cancer is a direct result to injury <unk> if you smoke you damage your lung tissue <unk> and then
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 388.65 394.92 <NA> lung cancer arises if you drink you damage your liver and then liver cancer occurs 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 394.92 401.01 <NA> and it was really interesting there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture and then bone cancer arises
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 404.93 406.75 <NA> <unk> these phenomenal cells
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 406.75 416.26 <NA> that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue <unk> so <unk> if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 416.05 425.17 <NA> and then it 's initiating cancer it 's almost as if this is a repair response and the cancer the body is saying the lung tissue
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 425.73 434.19 <NA> <unk> we need to repair the lung and cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair because you have this excessive proliferation

EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 439.17 450.43 <NA> but it 's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response but can 't quite control it it hasn 't yet become fine tuned enough to finish what has been initiated <unk> 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 450.03 453.56 <NA> so this really really fascinated me
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 454.81 461.39 <NA> <unk> really think that we can 't think about cancer let alone any disease in such black and white terms 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 461.38 474.88 <NA> if we eliminate cancer the way we 're trying to do now with chemotherapy and radiation we 're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins or with radiation trying to kill it it 's almost as if we 're getting back to this starting point 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 474.88 479.97 <NA> we 're removing the cancer cells but we 're revealing the the previous damage that
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 479.93 488.88 <NA> <unk> the body has tried to fix <unk> shouldn 't we think about manipulation rather than elimination if somehow we can
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 488.66 497.79 <NA> cause these cells to differentiate to become bone tissue lung tissue liver tissue <unk> whatever that cancer has been put there to do
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 497.48 500.32 <NA> it would it would be a repair process
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 507.39 510.04 <NA> <unk> really changed my view of looking at cancer <unk> 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 509.97 514.82 <NA> and while i was reading all these articles about cancer <unk> 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 514.82 521.99 <NA> it seemed that the articles a lot of them focused on you know the genetics of breast cancer and the genesis and the progression of breast cancer
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 521.81 525.05 <NA> tracking the cancer through the body <unk> tracing where
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 528.13 530.63 <NA> <unk> it struck me that i 'd never heard of
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 530.14 535.55 <NA> cancer of the heart or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 535.55 541.67 <NA> and skeletal muscle constitutes fifty percent of our body or over fifty percent of our body <unk> 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 541.18 543 <NA> and so
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 542.81 549.99 <NA> at first i kind of thought well maybe there 's some obvious explanation why skeletal muscle doesn 't get cancer at least not that i know of
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 550.61 557.13 <NA> <unk> i looked further into it found as many articles as i could and it was amazing because
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 557.06 560.71 <NA> it turned out that it was very rare some articles
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 560.71 569.25 <NA> even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer <unk> and furthermore not only to cancer but of <unk>
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 570.46 579.97 <NA> going to skeletal muscle <unk> and what metastases are is when the tumor when a piece breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 580.25 586.55 <NA> that 's what a metastasis is it 's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous if cancer was localized 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 586.55 590.65 <NA> we could likely remove it or somehow
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 590.34 600.14 <NA> you know it 's contained it 's very contained but once it starts moving throughout the body that 's when it becomes deadly so the fact that not not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 600.82 607.43 <NA> <unk> but cancer didn 't seem to go to skeletal muscle there seemed to be something here so these articles were saying you know skeletal
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 607.43 615.71 <NA> metastasis to skeletal muscle is very rare but it was left at that no one seemed to be asking why <unk> so
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 615.49 624.81 <NA> i decided to ask why <unk> at first the first thing i did was i emailed some professors who specialized in skeletal muscle
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 629.81 636.61 <NA> <unk> cancer doesn 't really go to skeletal muscle is there a reason for this and a lot of the replies i got were that
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 636.43 640.41 <NA> muscle is terminally differentiated tissue meaning that
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 640.41 649.29 <NA> you have muscle cells but they 're not dividing so it doesn 't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack <unk> but then again this fact that the <unk>
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 650.4 652.09 <NA> <unk> go to skeletal muscle
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 651.93 658.85 <NA> made that seem unlikely and furthermore that nervous nervous tissue brain gets
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 658.85 665.02 <NA> cancer and brain cells are also terminally differentiated so i decided to ask why and
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 665.67 674.96 <NA> here 's some of i guess my hypotheses that i 'll be starting to investigate this this may at the sylvester cancer
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 675 678.14 <NA> <unk> institute in miami <unk> and
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 678.19 680.99 <NA> i guess i 'll keep investigating until
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 680.79 685.2 <NA> i get the answers but i know that in science once you get the answers <unk> 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 685.2 692.03 <NA> inevitably you 're going to have more questions so i guess you could say that i 'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 691.84 698.15 <NA> some of my hypotheses are that when you first think about skeletal muscle 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 697.84 703.29 <NA> there 's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle <unk> and the first thing that makes me think is that
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 705.47 708.73 <NA> <unk> blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells <unk> 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 708.73 718.14 <NA> tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels and you think the more highways there are in a tissue the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 717.8 725.4 <NA> so first of all i thought <unk> you know wouldn 't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle and as well cancer
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 725 729.97 <NA> tumors require a process called angiogenesis which is really
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 729.66 735.89 <NA> <unk> really the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 735.89 740.33 <NA> without angiogenesis the tumor remains the size
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 740.15 741.82 <NA> of a pinpoint
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 741.36 749.02 <NA> and it 's not harmful <unk> so angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer <unk> 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 748.68 751.61 <NA> and one article that really
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 751.45 754.82 <NA> stood out to me when i was just reading about this trying to figure out why
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 755.08 761.34 <NA> <unk> cancer doesn 't go to skeletal muscle was that it had reported sixteen percent of
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 763.08 770.19 <NA> to skeletal muscle upon autopsy sixteen percent <unk> meaning that there there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 779.96 783.51 <NA> <unk> the angiogenesis is able to control the tumors
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 783.23 785.82 <NA> recruiting these blood vessels 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 785.9 794.44 <NA> we use skeletal muscles so much <unk> it 's the one portion of our body our heart 's always beating we 're always moving our muscles 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 794.44 796.33 <NA> is it possible that
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 796.17 800.23 <NA> muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 800.49 809.71 <NA> <unk> it needs to be constantly contracting so therefore it 's almost selfish it 's grabbing its blood vessels for itself therefore when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue <unk> 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 809.31 814.55 <NA> it can 't get a blood supply and can 't grow <unk> so this suggests that maybe if there
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 816.39 824.75 <NA> <unk> factor in skeletal muscle or perhaps even more an angiogenic routing factor so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 824.75 829.22 <NA> this could be a potential future therapy for cancer and
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 829.84 833.3 <NA> <unk> another thing that 's really interesting is that
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 833.17 835.82 <NA> there 's this whole the way
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 835.42 841.11 <NA> tumors move throughout the body it 's a very complex system and there 's something called the chemokine network 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 841.11 848.42 <NA> and chemokines are essentially chemical attractants and they 're the stop and go signals for cancer <unk> 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 848.02 854.97 <NA> so a tumor a tumor expresses chemokine receptors and another organ a distant organ
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 854.93 856.44 <NA> <unk> somewhere in the body
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 855.98 862.36 <NA> will have the corresponding chemokines and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 862.36 867.75 <NA> is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn 't express this type of molecules 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 867.26 870.81 <NA> and the other really interesting thing is that
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 870.38 874.87 <NA> when skeletal muscle there 's been several reports that when skeletal muscle is
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 875.97 880.81 <NA> <unk> that 's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle <unk> 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 880.71 892.67 <NA> and furthermore when skeletal muscle is injured that 's what causes chemokines these signals saying cancer you can come to me the go signs for the tumors
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 892.44 899.96 <NA> it causes them to highly express these chemokines so there 's so much interplay here
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 905.1 909.49 <NA> for why tumors don 't go to skeletal muscle but it seems like
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 909.5 918.83 <NA> by investigating by attacking cancer <unk> by searching where cancer is not there has got to be something there 's got to be something that 's
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 918.52 924.75 <NA> making this tissue resistant to tumors and can we utilize can we take this
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 931.52 933.9 <NA> <unk> and apply it to
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 934.34 940.23 <NA> cancer therapy in general now one thing that kind of ties the
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 940.1 949.47 <NA> resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 949.34 954.37 <NA> is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 954.89 958.1 <NA> and what myod essentially does
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 957.89 964.03 <NA> is it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells <unk> 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 964.08 970.01 <NA> so this this compound myod has been tested on a lot of different cell types
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 969.82 975.04 <NA> and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 975.22 977.84 <NA> <unk> is it possible that the tumor cells
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 977.47 981.95 <NA> are going to the skeletal muscle tissue but once
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 981.75 990.9 <NA> in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue <unk> myod acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 990.9 998.42 <NA> skeletal muscle cells <unk> maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells and this is why
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 998.02 999.87 <NA> it seems as if it is so
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1000.67 1007.73 <NA> <unk> it 's not harmful it has just repaired the muscle muscle is constantly being used constantly being damaged <unk> 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1007.36 1013.07 <NA> if every time we tore a muscle or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1012.73 1015.23 <NA> cancer occurred
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1017.05 1023.1 <NA> i mean <unk> everybody would have cancer almost and i hate to say that but it it seems as though
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1023.1 1029.97 <NA> muscle cell possibly because of all its use has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1029.9 1036.31 <NA> <unk> injury to fine tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1036.31 1044.82 <NA> which the body wants to finish i really believe that the human body is very very smart and we can 't
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1044.39 1049.78 <NA> counteract something the body is saying to do it 's different when a bacteria comes into the
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1051.87 1061.42 <NA> <unk> a foreign object we want that out but when the body is actually initiating a process and we 're calling it a disease it doesn 't seem as though elimination is the right solution 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1061.42 1062.98 <NA> so even
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1062.64 1065.89 <NA> to go to go from there it 's
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1066.03 1071.75 <NA> possible although far fetched that in the future we could almost think of
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1071.75 1079.55 <NA> cancer being used as a therapy if those diseases where tissues are deteriorating for example alzheimer 's
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1079.89 1088.32 <NA> the brain the brain cells die and we need to restore new brain cells new functional brain cells what if we could 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1088.32 1094.26 <NA> in the future use cancer a tumor put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1093.93 1095.9 <NA> into brain cells 
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1096.31 1104.97 <NA> that 's a very far fetched idea <unk> but i really believe that it may be possible these cells are so versatile these cancer
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1104.93 1113.35 <NA> <unk> cells are so versatile we just have to manipulate them in the right way <unk> and again some of these may be far fetched but
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1113.35 1118.47 <NA> i figured if there 's anywhere to present far fetched ideas it 's here at ted so
EvaVertes_2005 1 EvaVertes_2005 1118.1 1119.65 <NA> thank you very much
