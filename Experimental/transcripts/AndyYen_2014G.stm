AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 13.45 18.2 <NA> <unk> years ago scientists at cern created the world wide web <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 17.8 25.02 <NA> since then the internet has transformed the way we communicate the way we do business and even the way we live
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 27.38 39.36 <NA> <unk> the ideas that gave birth to google facebook <unk> twitter <unk> and so many others have now really transformed our lives <unk> and this has brought us many real benefits such as a more connected society <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 38.93 47.82 <NA> however there are also some downsides to this <unk> today <unk> the average person has an astounding amount of personal information online <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 47.36 49.99 <NA> and we add to this online information
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 50 56.14 <NA> <unk> every single time we post on facebook each time we search on google <unk> and each time we send an email now 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 56.22 61.33 <NA> many of us probably think <unk> well one email there 's nothing in there right <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 60.9 69.64 <NA> but if you consider a year 's worth of emails or maybe even a lifetime of email <unk> collectively this tells a lot 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 69.21 74.9 <NA> it tells where we have been who we have met <unk> and in many ways even what we 're
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 76.63 83.6 <NA> <unk> the more scary part about this is our data now lasts forever <unk> so your data can and will outlive you 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 83.83 89.51 <NA> what has happened is that we 've largely lost control over our data and also our privacy
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 89.65 95.7 <NA> <unk> so this year as the web turns twenty five it 's very important for us to take a moment
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 95.52 99.99 <NA> and think about the implications of this <unk> we have to really think we
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 101.45 105.42 <NA> <unk> but actually what we 've also lost is the idea of privacy itself 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 105.74 111.87 <NA> if you think about it <unk> most of us here today probably remember what life was like before the internet <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 111.5 117.84 <NA> but today there 's a new generation that is being taught from a very young age to share everything online <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 117.47 121.98 <NA> and this is a generation that is not going to remember when data was private <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 121.73 129.16 <NA> so we keep going down this road <unk> twenty years from now the word ' privacy ' is going to have a completely different meaning from what it means to you and
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 130.2 138.28 <NA> so it 's time for us to take a moment and think is there anything we can do about this <unk> and i believe there is 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 138.24 143.74 <NA> let 's take a look at one of the most widely used forms of communication in the world today email 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 143.94 150.31 <NA> before the invention of email <unk> we largely communicated using letters <unk> and the process was quite simple 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 149.94 154.91 <NA> you would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper then you would place it into a
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 154.84 159.98 <NA> <unk> sealed envelope <unk> and from there you would go ahead and send it after you put a stamp and address on it <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 159.61 167.3 <NA> unfortunately today when we actually send an email <unk> we 're not sending a letter what you are sending in many ways is actually a postcard 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 166.93 174.9 <NA> and it 's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 175.16 182.43 <NA> <unk> the entire contents <unk> so the solution to this has been known for some time and there 's many attempts to do it <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 182.78 191.61 <NA> the most basic solution is to use encryption and the idea is quite simple first you encrypt the connection between your computer and the email server 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 191.27 195.81 <NA> then you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 195.59 204.46 <NA> but there 's a problem with this <unk> and that is the email servers also hold the encryption keys <unk> so now you have a really big lock with a key placed right next to it
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 204.96 212.77 <NA> <unk> not only that <unk> any government could lawfully ask for and get the key to your data and this is all without you being aware of it <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 212.76 215.74 <NA> so the way we fix this problem is actually
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 215.25 225.08 <NA> relatively easy in principle you give everybody their own keys <unk> and then you make sure the server doesn 't actually have the keys this seems like common sense
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 226.03 230.21 <NA> <unk> so the question that comes up is why hasn 't this been done yet <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 229.75 237.36 <NA> well <unk> if we really think about it <unk> we see that the business model of the internet today really isn 't compatible with privacy 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 237.36 240.3 <NA> just take a look at some of the biggest names on the web <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 240.06 250.08 <NA> and you see that advertising plays a huge role in fact this year alone <unk> advertising is one hundred and thirty seven billion dollars and to optimize the ads that are shown to us
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 250.16 253.99 <NA> <unk> companies have to know everything about us <unk> they need to know where we live 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 253.78 257.67 <NA> how old we are what we like what we don 't like 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 257.66 265.77 <NA> and anything else they can get their hands on and if you think about it <unk> the best way to get this information is really just to invade our privacy <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 265.4 274.29 <NA> so these companies aren 't going to give us our privacy <unk> if we want to have privacy online what we have to do is we 've got to go out and get it ourselves 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 274.28 279.55 <NA> for many years when it came to email <unk> the only solution was something known as pgp
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 279.84 283.54 <NA> <unk> was quite complicated and only accessible to the tech savvy 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 283.11 288.32 <NA> here 's a diagram that basically shows the process for encrypting and decrypting messages <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 288.32 296.86 <NA> so needless to say this is not a solution for everybody <unk> and this actually is part of the problem because if you think about communication 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 296.61 300.17 <NA> by definition it involves having someone to communicate with
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 301.21 304.2 <NA> <unk> so while pgp does a great job of what it 's designed to do 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 304.2 312.81 <NA> for the people out there who can 't understand how to use it <unk> the option to communicate privately simply does not exist <unk> and this is a problem that we need to solve <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 312.62 318.09 <NA> so if we want to have privacy online <unk> the only way we can succeed is if we get the whole world on board <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 317.88 321.65 <NA> and this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 321.31 324.93 <NA> i think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community what
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 325 328.95 <NA> we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 328.49 336 <NA> so last summer <unk> when the edward snowden story came out several colleagues and i decided to see if we could make this happen 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 335.93 344.41 <NA> at that time we were working at the european organization for nuclear research at the world 's largest particle collider <unk> which collides protons by the way 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 344.41 349.78 <NA> we were all scientists so we used our scientific creativity and came up with a very creative name for our
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 353.4 357.85 <NA> <unk> many startups these days actually begin in people 's garages or people 's basements <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 357.48 366.4 <NA> we were a bit different we started out at the cern cafeteria <unk> which actually is great because look you have all the food and water you could ever want <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 366.06 370.39 <NA> but even better than this is that every day between twelve <unk>
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 372.02 379.67 <NA> free of charge <unk> the cern cafeteria comes with several thousand scientists and engineers <unk> and these guys basically know the answers to everything
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 380.14 383.24 <NA> <unk> so it was in this environment that we began working 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 383.02 394.2 <NA> what we actually want to do is we want to take your email and turn it into something that looks more like this <unk> but more importantly we want to do it in a way that you can 't even tell that it 's happened <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 394.2 398.81 <NA> so to do this <unk> we actually need a combination of technology and also design 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 398.56 399.99 <NA> so how do we go about doing
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 402.56 406.17 <NA> <unk> it 's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 405.83 410.01 <NA> so what we do is we generate encryption keys on your computer 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 409.61 417.58 <NA> and we don 't generate a single key <unk> but actually a pair of keys <unk> so there 's an rsa private key and an rsa public key 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 417.58 423.87 <NA> and these keys are mathematically connected <unk> so let 's have a look and see how this works when multiple people communicate <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 424.04 428.56 <NA> so here we have bob and alice who want to communicate privately
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 429.99 441.18 <NA> <unk> key challenge is to take bob 's message and to get it to alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message <unk> so what we have to do is we have to encrypt it before it even leaves bob 's computer 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 441.18 446.2 <NA> and one of the tricks is we encrypt it using the public key from alice 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 446.13 449.96 <NA> now this encrypted data is sent through the server to
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 451.48 460.33 <NA> <unk> because the message was encrypted using alice 's public key <unk> the only key that can now decrypt it is a private key that belongs to alice 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 460.34 472.34 <NA> and it turns out alice is the only person that actually has this key <unk> so we 've now accomplished the objective <unk> which is to get the message from bob to alice without the server being able to read what 's going on 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 471.85 479.97 <NA> actually what i 've shown here is a highly simplified picture <unk> the reality is much more complex and it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 479.78 485.56 <NA> <unk> this <unk> and that 's actually the key design challenge how do we take all this complexity
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 485.56 490.92 <NA> <unk> all this software and implement it in a way that the user cannot see it <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 490.43 496.56 <NA> i think with protonmail we have gotten pretty close to doing this so let 's see how it works in practice 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 496.55 499.87 <NA> here we 've got bob and alice again who
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 500 506.96 <NA> want to communicate securely <unk> they simply create accounts on protonmail which is quite simple and takes a few moments <unk> and
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 506.75 512.65 <NA> all the key encryption and generation is happening automatically in the background as bob is creating his account 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 512.16 517.94 <NA> once his account is created he just clicks compose and now he can write his email like he does today <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 517.94 523.75 <NA> so he fills in his information and then after that all he has to do is click send 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 523.38 525.26 <NA> and just like that
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 527.38 535.32 <NA> <unk> without doing anything different from how he writes email today bob has just sent an encrypted message what we have here
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 535.14 544.34 <NA> is really just the first step but it shows that with improving technology privacy doesn 't have to be difficult <unk> it doesn 't have to be disruptive 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 543.91 550.31 <NA> if we change the goal from maximizing ad revenue to protecting data we can actually make it accessible 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 550.09 554.94 <NA> now i know a question on everybody 's minds is okay <unk> protecting privacy
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 554.9 560.53 <NA> <unk> this is a great goal <unk> but can you actually do this without the tons of money that advertisements give you 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 560.29 572.49 <NA> and i think the answer is actually yes <unk> because today <unk> we 've reached a point where people around the world really understand how important privacy is and when you have that anything is possible 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 572.49 579.97 <NA> earlier this year protonmail actually had so many users that we ran out of resources and when this happened <unk> our community of users got together
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 579.63 589.51 <NA> <unk> together and donated half a million dollars <unk> so this is just an example of what can happen when you bring the community together towards a common goal we can also leverage the world 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 589.59 595.34 <NA> right now we have a quarter of a million people that have signed up for protonmail and these people come from everywhere <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 595.34 604.82 <NA> and this really shows that privacy is not just an american or a european issue <unk> it 's a global issue that impacts all of us <unk> it 's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 604.96 609.53 <NA> so what do we have to do to solve this problem well 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 609.16 617.81 <NA> first of all we need to support a different business model for the internet one that does not rely entirely on advertisements for revenue and for growth <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 617.38 620.43 <NA> we actually need to build a new internet
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 620.25 629.58 <NA> where our privacy and our ability to control our data is first and foremost <unk> but even more importantly <unk> we have to build an internet
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 629.81 634.71 <NA> <unk> privacy is no longer just an option but is also the default <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 635.42 642.39 <NA> we have done the first step with protonmail but this is really just the first step in a very very long journey <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 641.99 651.49 <NA> the good news i can share with you guys today <unk> the exciting news is that we 're not traveling alone <unk> the movement to protect people 's privacy and freedom online is really gaining momentum 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 651.49 654.82 <NA> and today <unk> there are dozens of projects from all around the
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 654.78 662.43 <NA> <unk> world who are working together to improve our privacy these projects protect things from our chat to voice communications 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 662.44 666.68 <NA> also our file storage our online search our online browsing 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 666.47 677.47 <NA> and many other things <unk> and these projects are not backed by billions of dollars in advertising but they 've found support really from the people from private individuals like you and i from all over the world
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 677.01 679.94 <NA> <unk> this really matters because ultimately
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 680.25 683.53 <NA> privacy depends on each and every one of us <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 683.37 693.77 <NA> and we have to protect it now because our online data is more than just a collection of ones and zeros it 's actually a lot more than that it 's our lives our personal stories <unk>
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 693.72 699.45 <NA> our friends our families and in many ways <unk> also our hopes and our aspirations <unk>
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 704.98 708.12 <NA> because without this <unk> we simply can 't have a free society <unk> 
AndyYen_2014G 1 AndyYen_2014G 707.69 719.01 <NA> so now 's the time for us to collectively stand up and say <unk> yes <unk> we do want to live in a world with online privacy and yes <unk> we can work together to turn this vision into a reality
