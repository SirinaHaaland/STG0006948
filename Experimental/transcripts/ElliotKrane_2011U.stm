ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 26.45 32.5 <NA> <unk> but what i actually mostly do is i manage the pain management service at the packard children 's hospital up at stanford in palo alto <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 32.5 38.74 <NA> and it 's from the experience from about twenty or twenty five years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 38.5 41.58 <NA> that pain is a disease <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 41.12 50.32 <NA> now most of the time you think of pain as a symptom of a disease and that 's true most of the time it 's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 50.25 51.47 <NA> <unk> or an operation 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 51.47 60.8 <NA> but about ten percent of the time after the patient has recovered from one of those events pain persists it persists for
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 60.41 67.25 <NA> months and oftentimes for years and when that happens it is its own disease <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 67.25 75.02 <NA> and before i tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it i want to show you how it feels for my patients
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 75.55 82.25 <NA> <unk> so imagine if you will that i 'm stroking your arm with this feather as i 'm stroking my arm right now <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 81.91 86.54 <NA> now i want you to imagine that i 'm stroking it with this please
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 86.53 88.07 <NA> keep your seat 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 91 94.91 <NA> a very different feeling now what does it have to do with chronic pain <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 94.51 99.81 <NA> imagine if you will <unk> these two ideas together imagine what your life would be like
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 100 104.09 <NA> i were to stroke it with this feather <unk> but your brain was telling you
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 103.93 114.27 <NA> that this is what you are feeling and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain <unk> in fact imagine something even worse imagine i were to stroke your child 's arm with this feather <unk>
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 114.22 119.85 <NA> and their brain [ was ] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 125.64 135.46 <NA> <unk> she was sixteen years old last year when i met her and she aspired to be a professional dancer and during the course of one of her dance rehearsals she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 135.15 141.41 <NA> now you would probably imagine as she did that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person 's life 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 141.41 147.23 <NA> wrap it in an ace bandage <unk> take some ibuprofen for a week or two and that 's the end of the story <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 147.01 150.46 <NA> but in chandler 's case that was the beginning of the story 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 151.05 154.94 <NA> this is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 154.9 156.05 <NA> <unk> sprain 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 155.65 167.24 <NA> you can see that the arm is discolored <unk> purplish in color it was cadaverically cold to the touch the muscles were frozen paralyzed dystonic is how we refer to that 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 167.02 176.65 <NA> the pain had spread from her wrist to her hands to her fingertips from her wrist up to her elbow almost all the way to her shoulder <unk> but the worst part was 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 176.65 179.94 <NA> not the spontaneous pain that was there twenty four hours a day
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 179.98 190.32 <NA> the worst part was that she had allodynia <unk> the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch <unk> the lightest touch of her arm
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 190.12 198.63 <NA> the touch of a hand the touch even of a sleeve of a garment as she put it on caused excruciating burning pain <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 199.22 204.22 <NA> how can the nervous system get this so wrong how can the nervous system
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 205.26 208.63 <NA> <unk> an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 208.46 213.49 <NA> and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 213.18 218.62 <NA> well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 218.16 224.06 <NA> in your house wires run in the wall from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 223.87 229.94 <NA> and from the junction box to the light bulb <unk> and when you turn the switch on the light goes on and when you turn the switch off
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 229.96 234.83 <NA> <unk> light goes off <unk> so people imagine the nervous system is just like that 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 234.88 237.18 <NA> if you hit your thumb with a hammer 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 237.18 250.05 <NA> these wires in your arm that of course we call nerves transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires new nerves take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 251.57 256.11 <NA> <unk> but the situation of course in the human body is far more complicated than that <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 255.62 263.52 <NA> instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 263.03 268.77 <NA> by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 268.4 275.29 <NA> in a linear one on one fashion in fact what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 276.93 285.25 <NA> <unk> up and down in the spinal cord and they start interacting with other adjacent cells <unk> these cells called glial cells 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 284.97 293.09 <NA> were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together like the nerves <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 293.09 296.96 <NA> but it turns out the glial cells have a vital role
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 296.78 300.08 <NA> in the modulation <unk> amplification
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 300.31 302.66 <NA> <unk> in the case of pain the distortion
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 302.46 311.39 <NA> of sensory experiences these glial cells become activated their dna starts to synthesize new proteins which spill out and
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 311.39 318.45 <NA> interact with adjacent nerves and they start releasing their neurotransmitters and those neurotransmitters spill out and
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 318.21 325.13 <NA> activate adjacent glial cells and so on and so forth <unk> until what we have is a positive feedback loop 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 325.1 333.49 <NA> <unk> it 's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch the toilet flushed three doors down 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 333.49 338.07 <NA> or your dishwasher went on or your computer monitor turned off 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 337.58 349.99 <NA> that 's crazy <unk> but that 's in fact <unk> what happens with chronic pain <unk> and that 's why pain becomes its own disease the nervous system has plasticity it changes and it morphs in
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 350 356.65 <NA> <unk> response to stimuli <unk> well what do we do about that what can we do in a case like chandler 's 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 356.94 362.72 <NA> we treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time we treat them with
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 364.07 370.12 <NA> drugs painkillers which are frankly not very effective for this kind of pain <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 369.75 373.75 <NA> we take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 373.74 379.97 <NA> and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics and most importantly what we do is we use a
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 380.07 391.67 <NA> rigorous <unk> and often uncomfortable process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 391.24 396.86 <NA> to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 397.24 404.73 <NA> and we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency <unk> despair and
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 404.66 409.08 <NA> <unk> depression that always accompanies severe chronic pain <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 408.89 413.19 <NA> it 's successful as you can see from this video of chandler <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 412.76 417.09 <NA> who two months after we first met her is now doings a back flip <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 417.09 424.44 <NA> and i had lunch with her yesterday because she 's a college student studying dance at long beach here <unk> and she 's doing absolutely fantastic <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 424.25 426.25 <NA> but the future
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 426.03 429.97 <NA> is actually even brighter the future holds the promise
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 430.56 434.54 <NA> that new drugs will be developed that are not
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 435.75 440.92 <NA> <unk> drugs that simply mask the problem as we have now <unk> but that will be <unk>
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 442.11 443.12 <NA> <unk> drugs
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 442.67 451.81 <NA> that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 451.35 454.67 <NA> that spill over and cause this central nervous system
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 455.04 463.79 <NA> wind up or plasticity that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 463.42 474.29 <NA> so i have hope that in the future the prophetic words of george carlin will be realized <unk> who said my philosophy <unk> no pain <unk> 
ElliotKrane_2011U 1 ElliotKrane_2011U 473.95 475.55 <NA> no pain
