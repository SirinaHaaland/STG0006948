RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 25.12 29.7 <NA> and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff you take about eight
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 30.25 37.08 <NA> eight or so carbon atoms about twenty hydrogen atoms you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid very <unk>
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 38.08 45.99 <NA> and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels it 's great stuff <unk> now <unk> as far as it goes 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 45.53 51.93 <NA> there 's a lot of oil out there in the world <unk> here 's my little pocket map of where it 's all located 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 51.59 54.97 <NA> a bigger one for you to look at but this is it this is the
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 54.93 66.25 <NA> <unk> oil in the world geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is this is about one hundred trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today <unk> 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 65.88 75.02 <NA> now that 's just one story about oil <unk> and we could end it there and say well oil 's going to last forever because well there 's just a lot of it but there 's actually more to
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 75 84.48 <NA> story than that oh by the way if you think you 're very far from some of this oil one thousand meters below where you 're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world <unk> 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 84.48 87.78 <NA> come talk to me about it i 'll fill in some of the details if you want 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 87.59 91.16 <NA> so that 's one of the stories of oil <unk> there 's just a lot of it <unk>
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 90.97 95.51 <NA> but what about oil where is it in the energy system <unk> 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 95.32 103.65 <NA> here 's a little snapshot of one hundred and fifty years of oil <unk> and it 's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those one hundred and fifty years
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 105.05 107.67 <NA> <unk> little secret i 'm going to tell you about 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 107.27 114.9 <NA> for the last twenty five years oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 114.44 124.87 <NA> there was one kind of peak oil in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five when oil represented fifty percent of global energy supply now it 's about thirty five percent it 's been declining and i believe it will continue to
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 127.47 133.41 <NA> <unk> probably peaked in two thousand and seven and is declining so oil is playing a less significant role
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 133.25 143.29 <NA> every year <unk> and so twenty five years ago <unk> there was a peak oil just like in the 1920s there was a peak coal 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 143.13 146.56 <NA> and a hundred years before that there was a peak wood <unk> 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 146.43 154.76 <NA> this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems and what 's been taking up the slack in the last few decades well a lot of natural gas
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 154.78 164.09 <NA> and a little bit of nuclear for starters <unk> and what goes on in the future well <unk> i think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 164.38 171.41 <NA> and beyond that peak renewables now i 'll tell you another little very important
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 171.01 179.97 <NA> story about this picture now i 'm not pretending that energy use in total isn 't increasing it is that 's another part of the story come talk to me about it we 'll fill in some of the
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 179.93 182.58 <NA> <unk> details but there 's a very important message here 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 182.58 190.32 <NA> this is two hundred years of history and for two hundred years we 've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 189.92 204.97 <NA> energy systems of the world becoming progressively year on year decade on decade century on century becoming less carbon intense and that continues into the future with the renewables that we 're developing today <unk> reaching maybe thirty percent of primary energy
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 205.22 206.74 <NA> by mid century 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 206.34 217.34 <NA> now that might be the end of the story okay we just replace it all with conventional renewables but i think actually there 's more to the story than that and to tell the next part of the story and this is looking out say two thousand one hundred
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 216.98 224.71 <NA> and beyond what is the future of truly sustainable carbon free energy <unk> well we have to take a little excursion and we

RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 239.2 249.99 <NA> and it 's different than this limestone <unk> you can see that you wouldn 't build a building out of this stuff <unk> and you wouldn 't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this yeah it 's very different no it 's not different it 's not different 
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 254.27 257.46 <NA> <unk> what 's different is how the molecules are put together <unk>

RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 286.13 290.21 <NA> than this and why because the lowly abalone

RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 336.71 346.38 <NA> nature didn 't need to because unlike the abalone shell the survival of a species didn 't depend on building those materials <unk> until maybe now
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 345.98 354.97 <NA> when it might just matter so when we think about the future of energy <unk> imagine what would it be like
RichardSears_2010U 1 RichardSears_2010U 354.66 362.32 <NA> <unk> like if instead of this we could build the energy equivalent of this
