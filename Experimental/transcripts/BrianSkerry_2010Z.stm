BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 22.69 29.88 <NA> i guess i became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because i fell in love with the sea as a child <unk> and i wanted

BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 36.83 46.11 <NA> and after even thirty years of doing this after thirty years of exploring the ocean i never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that i have while i 'm at sea 
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 45.77 50.02 <NA> but more and more frequently these days i 'm seeing terrible things underwater as

BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 52.63 62.47 <NA> and i 've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story i want people to see what 's happening underwater both the horror and the magic <unk> 
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 62.31 72.61 <NA> the first story that i did for national geographic where i recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage was a story i proposed on harp seals
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 72.61 79.97 <NA> the story i wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 79.93 91.53 <NA> <unk> from the canadian arctic to the gulf of st lawrence in canada to engage in courtship mating and to have their pups and all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide <unk> 
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 91.53 99.96 <NA> and because i 'm an underwater photographer i wanted to do this story from both above and below to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups making its very first
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 102.47 107.16 <NA> <unk> but as i got more involved in the story i realized that there were two big environmental issues i couldn 't ignore 
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 106.96 109.95 <NA> the first was that these animals continue to be hunted 
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 109.75 120.22 <NA> killed with hakapiks at about eight fifteen days old it actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year <unk> 
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 120.22 129.28 <NA> but as disturbing as that is i think the bigger problem for harp seals is the loss of sea ice due to global warming this is an aerial picture that i made that shows the gulf of
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 129.81 138.82 <NA> <unk> during harp seal season and even though we see a lot of ice in this picture there 's a lot of water as well which wasn 't there historically and the ice that is there is quite thin 
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 138.82 150.02 <NA> the problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms <unk> they only need twelve days from the moment they 're born until they 're on their own but if they don 't get twelve days they can fall into the ocean
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 150.85 164.19 <NA> <unk> this is a photo that i made showing one of these pups that 's only about five or seven days old still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly that has fallen in because of the thin ice and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase 
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 163.95 174.44 <NA> this problem has continued to grow each year since i was there i read that last year the pup mortality rate was one hundred percent in parts of the gulf of st lawrence so clearly this species has a lot of problems <unk>
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 174.34 179.88 <NA> <unk> going forward <unk> this ended up becoming a cover story at national geographic and it received quite a bit of attention
BrianSkerry_2010Z 1 BrianSkerry_2010Z 179.89 194.35 <NA> and with that i saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems <unk> so i proposed a story on the global fish crisis in part because i had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last thirty years but also because i read a scientific paper
