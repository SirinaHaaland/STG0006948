NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 155.05 162.74 <NA> <unk> difference on mars right now from the time that we 're at is because the martian day is longer than the earth day <unk>
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 162.74 173.48 <NA> our earth day is twenty four hours because that 's how long it takes the earth to rotate how long it takes to go around once <unk> so our day is twenty four hours

NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 194.57 203.61 <NA> living on earth but working on mars so we have to think as if we are actually on mars with the rover

NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 238.93 249.96 <NA> so in order to come to work on the earth at the same time every day on mars like let 's say i need to be at work at five zero p m this team needs to be at work
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 251.36 257.17 <NA> <unk> mars time every day then we have to come to work on the earth

NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 261.62 269.41 <NA> in order to stay in sync with mars that 's like moving a time zone every day so one day you come in at eight zero 
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 269.41 272.79 <NA> the next day forty minutes later at eight forty 
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 272.33 274.99 <NA> the next day forty minutes later at
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 276.03 284.14 <NA> <unk> the next day at ten zero so you keep moving forty minutes every day until soon you 're coming to work in the middle of the night

NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 298.93 304.97 <NA> right and we didn 't start out i got this watch in two thousand and four when spirit and opportunity
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 305.16 318.65 <NA> the rovers back then we didn 't start out thinking that we were going to need mars watches right we thought ok we 'll just have the time on our on our computers and on the mission control screens and that would be enough 
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 318.65 329.97 <NA> yeah not so much because we weren 't just working on mars time we were actually living on mars time and we got just instantaneously confused about what time it was
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 329.78 332.61 <NA> <unk> was <unk> so you really needed something
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 332.12 337.86 <NA> on your wrist to tell you what time is it on the earth what time is it on mars <unk> 
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 337.86 349.2 <NA> and it wasn 't just the time on mars that was confusing we also needed to be able to talk to each other about it 
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 348.86 349.99 <NA> so a
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 351.27 359.8 <NA> <unk> a martian day again twenty four hours and forty minutes so when we 're talking about something that 's happening on the earth <unk> we will say <unk> today 
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 359.73 363.16 <NA> so for mars we say tosol

NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 369.38 375.11 <NA> for mars <unk> again we didn 't start out thinking oh let 's invent a language
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 375.31 383.51 <NA> <unk> it was just very confusing i remember somebody walked up to me and said i would like to do this activity on the vehicle tomorrow on the rover and i said 
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 383.17 392.76 <NA> tomorrow <unk> tomorrow or mars <unk> tomorrow we started this terminology because we needed a way to talk to

NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 439.95 454.55 <NA> but even the earth daylight could confuse us if you think that right now you 've come to work and it 's the middle of the martian night and there 's light streaming in from the windows that 's going to be confusing as well
NaginCox_2016X 1 NaginCox_2016X 455.05 465.23 <NA> <unk> so you can see from this image of the control room that all of the blinds are down so that there 's no light to distract us the blinds went down all over the building <unk>
