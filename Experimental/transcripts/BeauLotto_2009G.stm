BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 13.42 18.27 <NA> <unk> i want to start with a game <unk> okay <unk> and to win this game 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 18.27 26.48 <NA> all you have to do is see the reality that 's in front of you as it really is all right <unk> so we have two panels here of colored dots 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 26.38 28.01 <NA> and
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 27.52 29.94 <NA> one of those dots is the same
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 29.93 37.68 <NA> <unk> in the two panels <unk> <unk> and you have to tell me which one <unk> now i narrowed it down to
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 37.94 47.4 <NA> the gray one the green one and say the orange one <unk> so by a show of hands we 'll start with the easiest one <unk> show of hands how many people think it 's the gray one <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 47.96 53.31 <NA> really okay <unk> how many people think it 's the green one <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 54.9 57.01 <NA> <unk> many people think it 's the orange one
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 58.35 66.49 <NA> pretty even split <unk> let 's find out what the reality is here is the orange one 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 68.46 74.87 <NA> laughter here is the green one <unk> and here is the gray
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 85.96 99.78 <NA> <unk> so this is pretty amazing isn 't it because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another so for us seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does and yet even at this most fundamental
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 103.25 109.5 <NA> <unk> what i 'm going to talk about is not that context is everything <unk> but why context is everything because it 's
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 109.1 114.04 <NA> answering that question that tells us not only why we see what we do <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 114.04 117.84 <NA> but who we are as individuals and who we are as a society <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 119 125.1 <NA> but first we have to ask another question which is what is color for and instead of telling you i 'll just show you 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 125.34 132.52 <NA> <unk> what you see here is a jungle scene <unk> and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that those surfaces reflect 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 132.06 136.57 <NA> now can any of you see the predator that 's about to jump out at you 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 136.41 140.32 <NA> and if you haven 't seen it yet you 're dead right 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 140.4 149.9 <NA> can anyone see it anyone no now let 's see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect <unk> and now you see it <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 151.3 162.47 <NA> <unk> color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect <unk> but what you 've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 162.22 169.94 <NA> why because as berkeley tells us we have no direct access to our physical world other than through our senses <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 169.45 175.02 <NA> and the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world not only the color
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 175 186.66 <NA> <unk> of objects but also the color of their illumination <unk> and the color of the space between us and those objects you vary any one of those parameters <unk> and you 'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 187.7 195.72 <NA> this is a huge problem because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real world sources
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 195.53 199.87 <NA> let me show you what i mean <unk> imagine that this is the back of your eye <unk> okay <unk>
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 200.1 202.46 <NA> <unk> and these are two projections from the world 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 202.22 206.54 <NA> they 're identical in every single way identical in shape 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 206.54 212.44 <NA> size <unk> spectral content they are the same as far as your eye is concerned <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 212.43 217.33 <NA> and yet they come from completely different sources <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 217.71 225.02 <NA> the one on the right comes from a yellow surface in shadow <unk> oriented facing the left
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 225.16 227.84 <NA> <unk> viewed through a pinkish medium <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 227.62 237.5 <NA> the one on the left comes from an orange surface under direct light facing to the right <unk> viewed through sort of a bluish medium completely different meanings 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 237.5 244.43 <NA> giving rise to the exact same retinal information <unk> and yet it 's only the retinal information that we get 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 244.57 247.97 <NA> so how on earth do we even see <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 247.93 254.55 <NA> so if you remember anything in this next eighteen minutes remember this that the light that falls onto your eye
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 255.11 259.77 <NA> <unk> information is meaningless <unk> because it could mean literally anything 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 259.49 267.72 <NA> and what 's true for sensory information is true for information generally there 's no inherent meaning in information it 's what we do with that information that matters
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 268.25 272.34 <NA> so how do we see well we see by learning to see
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 271.97 279.67 <NA> the brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns finding relationships in information and associating those
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 279.63 282.19 <NA> <unk> relationships with a behavioral meaning 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 281.99 285.1 <NA> a significance by interacting with the world we
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 285.1 293.45 <NA> 're very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes like language <unk> i 'm going to give you some letter strings and i want you to read them out for me if you can
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 304.93 315.15 <NA> <unk> priori reason why an h has to go between that w and a but you put one there why <unk> because in the statistics of your past experience it would have been useful to do so so you do so again <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 315.15 322.34 <NA> and yet you don 't put a letter after that first t why <unk> because it wouldn 't have been useful in the past <unk> so you don 't do it again <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 322.48 324.87 <NA> so let me show you how quickly our
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 325 331.74 <NA> brains can redefine normality even at the simplest thing the brain does which is color so if i could have the lights down up here 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 331.85 338.79 <NA> i want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same one is simply the flipping of the other <unk> <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 339.62 345.37 <NA> now i want you to look at that dot between the green and the red <unk> <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 345.37 350.77 <NA> and i want you to stare at that dot don 't look anywhere else we 're going to look at it for about thirty seconds which is a bit of a killer in an
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 354.99 357.97 <NA> <unk> you to learn and i 'll tell you don 't look anywhere else <unk>
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 357.57 369.61 <NA> i 'll tell you what 's happening in your head your brain is learning and it 's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination the left side of its visual field is under green illumination that 's what it 's learning 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 369.93 374.75 <NA> okay now <unk> when i tell you i want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 381.61 387.14 <NA> <unk> have the lights up again <unk> i take it from your response they don 't look the same anymore right 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 387.34 397.19 <NA> why because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light and the left one is still under green light that 's your new normal 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 397.18 399.9 <NA> okay so what does this mean for context it means i can
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 401.99 406.56 <NA> <unk> put them in light and dark surrounds and the one on the dark surround looks lighter than on the light surround <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 406.07 413.83 <NA> what 's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter it 's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 413.83 417.76 <NA> so i 'll show you what i mean here we have that exact same illusion <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 417.57 424.17 <NA> we have two identical tiles on the left one in a dark surround one in a light surround <unk> and the same thing over on the right
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 423.86 429.97 <NA> now i 'll reveal those two scenes <unk> but i 'm not going to change anything within those boxes except
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 429.93 433.12 <NA> <unk> their meaning <unk> and see what happens to your perception 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 432.9 440.3 <NA> notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite one very white and one very dark 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 440.3 444.31 <NA> right <unk> whereas on the right <unk> the two tiles look nearly the same <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 443.94 454.94 <NA> and yet there is still one on a dark surround <unk> and one on a light surround <unk> why <unk> because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow <unk> and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 454.87 462.26 <NA> <unk> eye as the one outside the shadow it would have to be more reflective <unk> so you see it that way <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 461.77 467.43 <NA> whereas on the right <unk> the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 467.43 474.26 <NA> if they 're under the same light reflecting the same amount of light to your eye <unk> then they must be equally reflective so you see it that way <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 474.16 479.97 <NA> which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions this is one i made a few years
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 480.02 486.61 <NA> <unk> ago and you 'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top and a bright orange tile at the side 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 486.61 491.79 <NA> that is your perceptual reality the physical reality is that those two tiles are the same <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 493.61 499.56 <NA> here you see four gray tiles on your left seven gray tiles on the right i
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 499.07 504.97 <NA> 'm not going to change those tiles at all but i 'm going to reveal the rest of the scene <unk> and see what happens to your perception
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 505.92 513.49 <NA> the four blue tiles on the left are gray <unk> the seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 513.15 517.69 <NA> they are the same <unk> okay <unk> don 't believe me <unk> let 's watch it again <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 518.97 524.75 <NA> what 's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion so here we
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 526.51 535.1 <NA> <unk> turn this around a diamond <unk> and what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to hold it here <unk> and i 'm going to spin it 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 536.41 542.03 <NA> and for all of you you 'll see it probably spinning this direction <unk> now i want you to keep looking at it 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 542.11 550.02 <NA> move your eyes around blink maybe close one eye <unk> and suddenly it will flip and start spinning the opposite direction <unk> yes raise your hand if
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 552.5 558.99 <NA> <unk> keep blinking every time you blink it will switch <unk> so i can ask you which direction is it rotating 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 559.67 561.51 <NA> how do you know 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 561.71 569.4 <NA> your brain doesn 't know because both are equally likely so depending on where it looks it flips between the two possibilities 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 569.75 575.05 <NA> are we the only ones that see illusions the answer to this question is no <unk> even the beautiful
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 575.76 581.49 <NA> <unk> with its mere one million brain cells which is two hundred and fifty times fewer cells than you have in one retina 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 581.27 582.94 <NA> sees illusions 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 582.94 595.75 <NA> does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can 't do so in my lab we work on bumblebees because we can completely control their experience and see how it alters the architecture of their brain we do this in what we call the bee matrix <unk>
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 595.59 599.99 <NA> here you have the hive you can see the queen bee the large bee in the middle those are her
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 601.24 606.05 <NA> <unk> they go back and forth between this hive and the arena via this tube <unk>
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 608.38 613.4 <NA> you 'll see one of the bees come out here you see how she has a little number on her
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 613.54 617.03 <NA> there 's another one coming out she also has a number on her 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 616.99 624.75 <NA> now they 're not born that way right <unk> we pull them out put them in the fridge and they fall asleep then you can superglue little numbers on them 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 626.3 629.76 <NA> <unk> and now in this experiment they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 629.76 640.65 <NA> they land on the flower stick their tongue in there called a proboscis and drink sugar water she 's drinking a glass of water that 's about that big to you and i will do that about three times <unk> then fly
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 643.64 649.99 <NA> and sometimes they learn not to go to the blue but to go where the other bees go so they copy each other they can count to
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 650.37 659.2 <NA> <unk> they can recognize faces and here she comes down the ladder and she 'll come into the hive find an empty honey pot and throw up and that 's honey <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 658.95 660.58 <NA> now remember 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 662.25 669.19 <NA> she 's supposed to be going to the blue flowers but what are these bees doing in the upper right corner it looks like they 're going to green flowers <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 669.06 674.87 <NA> now <unk> are they getting it wrong <unk> and the answer to the question is no those are actually blue
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 675.7 684.89 <NA> <unk> but those are blue flowers under green light <unk> so they 're using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle <unk> which is exactly what we do 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 684.7 693.52 <NA> so <unk> illusions are often used especially in art in the words of a more contemporary artist to demonstrate the fragility of our senses 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 693.52 695.72 <NA> okay this is complete rubbish
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 695.26 699.38 <NA> <unk> the senses aren 't fragile and if they were we wouldn 't be here
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 700.46 701.64 <NA> <unk> color tells us
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 701.47 706.11 <NA> something completely different that the brain didn 't actually evolve to see the world the way it is 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 705.86 712.5 <NA> we can 't instead the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 712.34 717.12 <NA> and how we see is by continually redefining normality <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 719 722.91 <NA> so how can we take this
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 722.9 729.82 <NA> incredible capacity of of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience their world differently well one of the ways we do
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 730.02 737.92 <NA> <unk> lab and studio is we translate the light into sound and we enable people to hear their visual world
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 738.12 741.82 <NA> <unk> and they can navigate the world using their ears 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 741.84 750.05 <NA> here 's david on the right and he 's holding a camera on the left is what his camera sees and you 'll see there 's a faint line going across that
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 753.07 759.53 <NA> <unk> each square we calculate the average color and then we just simply translate that into sound <unk> and now he 's going to
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 759.52 766.74 <NA> turn around close his eyes and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 792.5 800.4 <NA> <unk> investigate how people literally make sense of the world <unk> but we can also do something else <unk> we can also make music with color <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 800.21 804.94 <NA> so working with kids they created images <unk> thinking about
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 804.9 814.16 <NA> <unk> what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them <unk> and then we translated these images <unk> and this is one of those images <unk> and this is a six year old child composing a
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 850.04 851.4 <NA> <unk> all this mean <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 852.17 860.58 <NA> what this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature <unk> okay <unk> we 're not defined by our central properties by the bits that make us up we
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 860.24 865.86 <NA> 're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment by our ecology 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 865.67 871.86 <NA> and that ecology is necessarily relative <unk> historical and empirical
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 871.76 876.88 <NA> <unk> so what i 'd like to finish with
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 876.67 879.91 <NA> is this over here because what i 've been trying to do is really
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 879.84 884.86 <NA> <unk> celebrate uncertainty because i think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 884.52 892.18 <NA> so if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain i 'd like to do this one <unk> so if we have the lights down 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 891.87 893.47 <NA> and
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 893.22 895.36 <NA> what we have
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 895.56 897.28 <NA> here
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 897.9 899.95 <NA> can everyone see
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 904.99 911.72 <NA> <unk> call it yellowish surfaces on your right <unk> so now what i want to do i 'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 911.35 915.53 <NA> under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 916.66 923.75 <NA> <unk> now you can see that changes the light that 's coming through there right because now the light is going through a
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 923.47 929.97 <NA> yellowish filter and then a purplish filter i 'm going to do the opposite on the left
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 930.05 932.85 <NA> <unk> here <unk> i 'm going to put the middle nine
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 932.78 940.95 <NA> under a purplish light <unk> now <unk> some of you will have noticed
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 940.67 949.99 <NA> that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right <unk> or your left is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 954.24 959.8 <NA> <unk> so they are physically the same let 's pull the covers off <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 961.56 963.37 <NA> now remember
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 965.22 971.14 <NA> you know that the middle nine are exactly the same do they look the same <unk> 
BeauLotto_2009G 1 BeauLotto_2009G 971.82 977.84 <NA> no the question is is that an illusion and i 'll leave you with that so thank you very much
