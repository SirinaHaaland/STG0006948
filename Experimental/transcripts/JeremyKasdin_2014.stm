JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 37.62 47.46 <NA> and they speculate that up to one fifth of them have an earth like planet that might be able to harbor life <unk> but we haven 't seen any of them we 've only detected them indirectly 
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 47.03 49.81 <NA> this is nasa 's famous picture of the pale blue

JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 64.01 74.93 <NA> why haven 't we done that why is that hard <unk> well to see let 's imagine we take the hubble space telescope and we turn it around and we move it out to the orbit of mars we 'll see something like that a slightly

JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 90.51 100.11 <NA> here we are at the edge of the solar system out at the kuiper belt <unk> now it 's not resolved at all it 's that pale blue dot of carl sagan 's but let 's move yet again ten times further

JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 110.38 125.2 <NA> we 're at alpha centauri our nearest neighbor star and the planet is gone all we 're seeing is the big beaming image of the star that 's ten billion times brighter than the planet <unk> which should be in that little red circle <unk> that 's what we want to see that 's why it 's hard the light from the star
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 126.21 136.54 <NA> <unk> it 's scattering inside the telescope creating that very bright image that washes out the planet so to see the planet <unk> we have to do something about all of that light we have to get rid of it i have a lot <unk>
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 136.44 150.05 <NA> <unk> of colleagues working on really amazing technologies to do that but i want to tell you about one today that i think is the coolest and probably the most likely to get us an earth in the next decade it was first suggested by lyman spitzer the father of the space telescope
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 151.57 153.96 <NA> <unk> and he took his inspiration from an eclipse you
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 153.75 164.03 <NA> 've all seen that that 's a solar eclipse the moon has moved in front of the sun it blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it it would be the same thing if i put my thumb up and <unk>
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 163.93 170.99 <NA> <unk> blocked that spotlight that 's getting right in my eye <unk> i can see you in the back row <unk> well what 's going on well the moon
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 179.9 183.77 <NA> <unk> removed and we can see that dim fine structure in the corona 
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 183.61 193.83 <NA> spitzer 's suggestion was we do this in space <unk> we build a big screen we fly it in space <unk> we put it up in front of the star we block out most of the light we fly a space <unk>
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 193.73 200.1 <NA> <unk> telescope in that shadow that 's created and boom we get to see planets <unk> well that would look something like this 
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 204.96 215.11 <NA> <unk> well because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope it 's like water bending around a rock in a stream <unk> and <unk>
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 215.01 224.63 <NA> <unk> all that light just destroys the shadow it 's a terrible shadow <unk> and we can 't see planets <unk> but spitzer actually knew the answer if we can feather the edges soften those edges so we can control
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 225.55 233.04 <NA> <unk> well then we can see a planet <unk> and in the last ten years or so we 've come up with optimal solutions for doing that it looks something like
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 232.86 234.29 <NA> that 
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 233.92 244.31 <NA> we call that our flower petal starshade if we make the edges of those petals exactly right if we control their shape we can control diffraction <unk> and now we have a great shadow <unk>
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 244.21 249.99 <NA> <unk> it 's about ten billion times dimmer than it was before and we can see the planets beam out just like that
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 250.46 264.96 <NA> <unk> of course has to be bigger than my thumb that starshade is about the size of half a football field and it has to fly fifty thousand kilometers away from the telescope that has to be held right in its shadow <unk> and then we can see those planets this sounds formidable <unk> but
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 264.73 271.24 <NA> brilliant engineers colleagues of mine at jpl came up with a fabulous design for how to do that and it looks like this it
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 271.24 274.96 <NA> starts wrapped around a hub it separates from the telescope 
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 276.33 287.02 <NA> <unk> they open up the telescope turns around then you 'll see it flip and fly out that fifty thousand kilometers away from the telescope <unk> it 's going to move in front of the star
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 286.68 294.28 <NA> just like that <unk> creates a wonderful shadow <unk> boom <unk> we get planets orbiting about it thank
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 297.93 300.02 <NA> that 's not science fiction
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 300.07 310.26 <NA> <unk> we 've been working on this for the last five or six years last summer we did a really cool test out in california at northrop grumman so those are four petals this is a sub scale
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 310.21 320.6 <NA> <unk> star shade it 's about half the size of the one you just saw you 'll see the petals unfurl those four petals were built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at jpl <unk> now you 're seeing it deploy <unk>
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 320.55 329.55 <NA> those petals have to rotate into place the base of those petals has to go to the same place every time to within a tenth of a millimeter <unk> we ran this test sixteen times
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 329.78 339.88 <NA> <unk> sixteen times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter this has to be done very precisely but if we can do this if we can build this technology if we can get it into space 
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 339.83 346.2 <NA> <unk> you might see something like this that 's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the hubble space telescope 
JeremyKasdin_2014 1 JeremyKasdin_2014 350.13 360.76 <NA> <unk> put it out there fly an occulter in front of it what we might see is something like that that 's a family portrait of our solar system but not ours we 're hoping it 'll be someone else 's solar system
