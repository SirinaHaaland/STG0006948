JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 12.76 19.01 <NA> <unk> some years ago i set out to try to understand if there was a possibility to develop biofuels
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 18.7 25.14 <NA> on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels but not compete with agriculture
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 28.67 30.07 <NA> <unk> so here 's what i came up with 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 30.07 41.59 <NA> imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it just underwater <unk> and we fill it with wastewater and some form of microalgae that produces oil <unk> and we make it out of some kind of flexible material that moves with waves underwater <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 41.36 50.17 <NA> and the system that we 're going to build of course will use solar energy to grow the algae and they use co2 which is good <unk> and they produce oxygen as they grow
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 50.61 52.75 <NA> <unk> the algae that grow
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 52.41 65.25 <NA> are in a container that distributes the heat to the surrounding water and you can harvest them and make biofuels and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed and of course you 'd have to make a large area of this so you 'd
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 65.26 75.17 <NA> have to worry about other stakeholders like fishermen and ships and such things but hey we 're talking about biofuels and we know the importance
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 75.16 77.99 <NA> <unk> of potentially getting an alternative liquid fuel <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 78.19 81.2 <NA> why are we talking about microalgae 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 80.98 91.19 <NA> here you see a graph showing you the different types of crops that are being considered for making biofuels <unk> so you can see some things like soybean <unk>
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 91.14 97.98 <NA> which makes fifty gallons per acre per year or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 100 102.96 <NA> <unk> graph there shows what microalgae can contribute 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 102.65 111.24 <NA> that is to say microalgae contributes between two thousand and five thousand gallons per acre per year compared to the fifty gallons per acre per year from soy <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 111.17 117.7 <NA> so what are microalgae microalgae are micro that is they 're extremely small as you can see here
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 117.37 122.07 <NA> a picture of those single celled organisms compared to a human hair 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 122.12 129.79 <NA> those small organisms have been around for millions of years and there 's thousands of different species of microalgae in the world
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 129.99 135.82 <NA> <unk> some of which are the fastest growing plants on the planet and produce as i just showed you lots and lots of oil 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 135.54 139.42 <NA> now <unk> why do we want to do this offshore <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 138.93 146.41 <NA> well <unk> the reason we 're doing this offshore is because if you look at our coastal cities there isn 't a choice 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 146.22 154.37 <NA> because we 're going to use waste water as i suggested <unk> and if you look at where most of the waste water treatment plants are they 're embedded in the cities
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 155.11 164.75 <NA> <unk> this is the city of san francisco which has nine hundred miles of sewer pipes under the city already <unk> and it releases its waste water offshore <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 164.74 166.46 <NA> so
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 166.72 178.5 <NA> different cities around the world treat their waste water differently some cities process it some cities just release the water <unk> but in all cases the water that 's released is perfectly adequate for growing microalgae 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 178.5 179.97 <NA> so let 's envision what the system
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 179.9 189.09 <NA> <unk> might look like we call it omega which is an acronym for offshore membrane enclosures for growing algae at nasa you have to have good acronyms <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 189.53 195.63 <NA> so how does it work i sort of showed you how it works already <unk> we put waste water and some source of <unk>
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 196.63 204.19 <NA> into our floating structure <unk> and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow <unk> and they sequester
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 204.96 208.12 <NA> <unk> otherwise go off into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 207.63 218 <NA> they of course use solar energy to grow and the wave energy on the surface provides energy for mixing the algae <unk> and the temperature is controlled by the surrounding water temperature 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 218 224.96 <NA> the algae that grow produce oxygen as i 've mentioned <unk> and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 226.48 228.32 <NA> <unk> products of interest <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 228.28 237.62 <NA> and the system is contained what do i mean by that it 's modular let 's say something happens that 's totally unexpected to one of the modules it leaks it 's struck by lightning
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 237.4 247.82 <NA> <unk> the waste water that leaks out is water that already now goes into that coastal environment <unk> and the algae that leak out are biodegradable <unk> and because they 're living in waste water they 're fresh water algae <unk>
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 247.77 253.08 <NA> which means they can 't live in salt water so they die <unk> the plastic we 'll build it out of is some kind of
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 254.93 260.13 <NA> <unk> have good experience with and we 'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 260.54 275.11 <NA> so we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about this system that i 'm showing you and that is to say we need to think in terms of the water the fresh water <unk> which is also going to be an issue in the future and we 're working on methods now for recovering the waste
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 276.24 280 <NA> <unk> the other thing to consider is the structure itself it provides
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 279.83 293.66 <NA> a surface for things in the ocean <unk> and this surface which is covered by seaweeds and and other organisms in the ocean will become enhanced marine habitat so it increases biodiversity <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 293.66 300.02 <NA> and finally because it 's an offshore structure <unk> we can think in terms of how it might contribute to an aquaculture
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 302.35 308.45 <NA> <unk> so you 're probably thinking gee this sounds like a good idea what can we do to try to see if it 's real 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 308.11 315.5 <NA> well <unk> i set up laboratories in santa cruz at the california fish and game facility
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 315.34 325.16 <NA> <unk> and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks to test some of these ideas <unk> we also set up experiments in san francisco at one of the three waste water treatment plants 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 325.16 329.97 <NA> again a facility to test ideas <unk> and finally we wanted to see where
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 329.63 333.99 <NA> <unk> where we could look at what the impact of this structure would be
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 333.59 336.46 <NA> in the marine environment <unk> and we set up
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 336.22 346.71 <NA> a field site at a place called moss landing marine lab in monterey bay where we worked in a harbor to see what impact this would have on marine organisms 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 347.12 350.05 <NA> the laboratory that we set up in santa cruz was our
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 350.64 362.95 <NA> <unk> it was a place where we were growing algae and welding plastic and building tools and making a lot of mistakes or as edison said we were finding the ten thousand ways that the system wouldn 't work 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 362.82 365.8 <NA> now we grew algae in waste water <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 365.8 378.35 <NA> and we built tools that allowed us to get into the lives of algae so that we could monitor the way they grow what makes them happy how do we make sure that we 're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 380.05 393.27 <NA> <unk> important feature that we needed to develop were these so called photobioreactors or pbrs these were the structures that would be floating at the surface made out of some inexpensive plastic material that 'll allow the algae to grow <unk> and we had built lots and lots of designs 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 393.27 403.46 <NA> most of which were horrible failures and when we finally got to a design that worked at about thirty gallons we scaled it up to four hundred and fifty gallons in san francisco <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 403.12 404.97 <NA> so let me show you how the system
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 404.96 415.23 <NA> <unk> works we basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it <unk> and we circulate it through this floating structure this tubular flexible plastic structure <unk> and <unk>
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 415.13 429.79 <NA> <unk> it circulates through this thing and there 's sunlight of course it 's at the surface and the algae grow on the nutrients but this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag the algae are not going to suffocate because of co2 as we would they suffocate because they produce
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 429.78 435.89 <NA> <unk> oxygen and they don 't really suffocate but the oxygen that they produce is problematic <unk> and they use up all the co2 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 435.89 448.94 <NA> so the next thing we had to figure out was how we could remove the oxygen which we did by building this column which circulated some of the water and put back co2 which we did by bubbling the system before we recirculated the water <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 448.73 449.99 <NA> and what you see here is
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 450.91 458.42 <NA> <unk> which was the first attempt at building this type of column <unk> the larger column that we then installed in san francisco in the installed system <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 458.17 471.77 <NA> so the column actually had another very nice feature and that is the algae settle in the column <unk> and this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass in a context where we could easily harvest it <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 471.31 479.97 <NA> so we would remove the algaes that concentrated in the bottom of this column and then we could harvest that by a procedure where you float
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 480.14 484.11 <NA> <unk> the algae to the surface and can skim it off with a net <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 484.37 496.68 <NA> so we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact of this system in the marine environment <unk> and i mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site in moss landing marine lab <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 496.49 504.97 <NA> well <unk> we found of course that this material became overgrown with algae and we needed then to develop a cleaning procedure <unk> and we also looked at how
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 505.04 512.75 <NA> seabirds and marine mammals interacted and in fact you see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting and would periodically
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 512.54 521.31 <NA> work its way across this little floating water bed <unk> and we wanted to hire this guy or train him to be able to clean the surface of these things but that 's for the future <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 521.31 529.91 <NA> now really what we were doing we were working in four areas our research covered the biology of the system which included studying the way algae grew but
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 529.87 533.09 <NA> <unk> also what eats the algae and what kills the algae <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 533.09 543.56 <NA> we did engineering to understand what we would need to be able to do to build this structure <unk> not only on the small scale but how we would build it on this enormous scale that will ultimately be required 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 543.28 550.17 <NA> i mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals and looked at basically the environmental impact of the system
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 550.43 560.64 <NA> <unk> and finally we looked at the economics <unk> and what i mean by economics is what is the energy required to run the system do you get more energy out of the system than you have to put into the system <unk>
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 560.54 570.12 <NA> <unk> to be able to make the system run <unk> and what about operating costs and what about capital costs <unk> and what about just the whole economic structure <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 579.87 588.49 <NA> <unk> don 't have a lot of time and i 'd like to show you the artist 's conception of how this system might look if we find ourselves in a protected bay
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 588.32 597.31 <NA> somewhere in the world <unk> and we have in the background in this image the waste water treatment plant and a source of flue gas for the co2 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 597 603.07 <NA> but when you do the economics of this system you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 602.88 604.91 <NA> unless you look at the
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 604.84 609.35 <NA> <unk> system as a way to treat waste water <unk> sequester carbon <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 608.86 614.54 <NA> and potentially for photovoltaic panels or wave energy or even wind energy 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 614.54 621.36 <NA> and if you start thinking in terms of integrating all of these different activities you could also include in such a
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 621.12 628.74 <NA> facility aquaculture <unk> so we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture where we 're growing mussels or scallops
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 629.81 640.08 <NA> <unk> growing oysters and things that would be producing high value products and food and this would be a market driver as we build the system to larger and larger scales so that it becomes <unk>
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 640.03 645.96 <NA> <unk> ultimately competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 650 653.51 <NA> plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation right now 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 653.51 660.91 <NA> and so we 've been thinking cradle to cradle what are we going to do with all this plastic that we 're going to need to use in our marine environment <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 660.63 668.61 <NA> well <unk> i don 't know if you know about this but in california there 's a huge amount of plastic that 's used in fields right now as plastic mulch <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 668.61 677.65 <NA> and this is plastic that 's making these tiny little greenhouses right along the surface of the soil <unk> and this provides warming the soil to increase the growing season <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 677.37 679.97 <NA> it allows us to control weeds
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 680.16 683.87 <NA> and of course it makes the watering much more efficient <unk> 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 683.47 694.4 <NA> so the omega system will be part of this type of an outcome <unk> and that when we 're finished using it in the marine environment we 'll be using it hopefully on fields 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 694.12 699.84 <NA> where are we going to put this <unk> and what will it look like offshore <unk> here 's an image of what we could do in san

JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 740.64 752.36 <NA> <unk> there 's of course <unk> san francisco bay as i mentioned san diego bay is another example mobile bay or chesapeake bay <unk> but the reality is as sea level rises there 's going to be lots and lots of new opportunities to consider
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 755.1 758.7 <NA> laughter so what i 'm telling you about is a system of
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 758.52 766.7 <NA> integrated activities biofuels production is integrated with alternative energy is integrated with aquaculture 
JonathanTrent_2012G 1 JonathanTrent_2012G 766.6 769.13 <NA> i set out to find
