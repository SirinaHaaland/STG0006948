AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 27.37 29.67 <NA> <unk> my backyard in berkeley california
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 30.29 37.23 <NA> until last year i 'd never kept bees before <unk> but national geographic asked me to photograph a story about them and i
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 36.92 42.09 <NA> decided to be able to take compelling images i should start keeping bees myself 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 41.72 49.32 <NA> and as you may know bees pollinate one third of our food crops <unk> and lately they 've been having a really hard time 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 49.4 54.97 <NA> so as a photographer i wanted to explore what this problem really looks like <unk> so i 'm going
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 54.93 60.31 <NA> <unk> to show you what i found over the last year <unk> this furry little creature
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 59.85 64.6 <NA> is a fresh young bee halfway emerged from its brood cell 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 64.23 71.68 <NA> and bees right now are dealing with several different problems including pesticides <unk> diseases <unk> and habitat loss <unk> 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 71.22 74.84 <NA> but the single greatest threat is a parasitic mite from
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 78.46 83.3 <NA> <unk> and this pinhead sized mite crawls onto young bees and sucks their blood <unk> 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 83.29 88.88 <NA> this eventually destroys a hive because it weakens the immune system of the bees 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 88.51 92.66 <NA> and it makes them more vulnerable to stress and disease 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 93.55 101.69 <NA> now bees are the most sensitive when they 're developing inside their brood cells <unk> and i wanted to know what that process really looks like <unk> 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 101.23 104.97 <NA> so i teamed up with a bee lab at u c davis and figured out
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 104.93 113.7 <NA> <unk> how to raise bees in front of a camera i 'm going to show you the first twenty one days of a bee 's life condensed into sixty seconds 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 115.34 117.31 <NA> this is a bee egg
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 117.13 122.97 <NA> as it hatches into a larva <unk> and those newly hatched larvae
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 122.97 128.65 <NA> swim around their cells feeding on this white goo that nurse bees secrete for them
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 131.06 139.03 <NA> <unk> then their head and their legs slowly differentiate as they transform into pupae here
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 141.3 147.01 <NA> 's that same pupation process and you can actually see the mites running around in the cells <unk> 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 146.64 151.27 <NA> then the tissue in their body reorganizes
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 150.99 154.94 <NA> and the pigment slowly develops in their eyes
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 158.29 163.55 <NA> the last step of the process is their skin shrivels up
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 164.71 166.59 <NA> and they sprout hair
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 187.49 192.24 <NA> <unk> as you can see halfway through that video the mites were running around on the baby bees 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 192.24 199.44 <NA> and the way that beekeepers typically manage these mites is they treat their hives with chemicals <unk> 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 200 207.13 <NA> <unk> that 's bad news <unk> so researchers are working on finding alternatives to control these mites 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 207.9 215.62 <NA> this is one of those alternatives it 's an experimental breeding program at the usda bee lab in baton rouge <unk> 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 215.31 219.16 <NA> and this queen and her attendant bees are part of that program 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 219.3 220.96 <NA> now 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 221.01 229.46 <NA> the researchers figured out that some of the bees have a natural ability to fight mites so they set out to breed a line of
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 229.92 238.53 <NA> mite resistant bees this is what it takes to breed bees in a lab the virgin queen is sedated
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 238.29 242.48 <NA> and then artificially inseminated using this precision instrument 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 243.07 249.98 <NA> now this procedure allows the researchers to control exactly which bees are being crossed <unk> 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 249.61 254.97 <NA> but there 's a tradeoff in having this much control they succeeded in breeding
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 255.01 263.52 <NA> mite resistant bees <unk> but in that process those bees started to lose traits like their gentleness and their ability to store honey <unk> 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 263.21 270.12 <NA> so to overcome that problem these researchers are now collaborating with commercial beekeepers 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 269.66 279.27 <NA> this is bret adee opening one of his seventy two thousand beehives <unk> he and his brother run the largest beekeeping operation in the world <unk> 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 280.04 285.08 <NA> the usda is integrating their mite resistant bees into his operation
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 284.84 290.71 <NA> with the hope that over time they 'll be able to select the bees that are not only <unk> mite resistant
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 290.25 295.81 <NA> but also retain all of these qualities that make them useful to us <unk> 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 295.71 304.19 <NA> and to say it like that makes it sound like we 're manipulating and exploiting bees and the truth is we 've been doing that for thousands of years
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 304.9 311.64 <NA> <unk> we took this wild creature and put it inside of a box <unk> practically domesticating it 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 311.64 315.26 <NA> and originally that was so that we could harvest their honey <unk> 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 314.98 325.11 <NA> but over time we started losing our native pollinators our wild pollinators <unk> and there are many places now where those wild pollinators can no longer meet the pollination
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 327.53 332.31 <NA> <unk> so these managed bees have become an integral part of our food system 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 332 340.29 <NA> so when people talk about saving bees my interpretation of that is we need to save our relationship to bees 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 339.98 344.88 <NA> and in order to design new solutions 
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 345.23 350.07 <NA> we have to understand the basic biology of bees
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 350.24 354.88 <NA> and understand the effects of stressors
AnandVarma_2015 1 AnandVarma_2015 355.05 361.49 <NA> <unk> we sometimes cannot see in other words we have to understand bees up close <unk> thank you
