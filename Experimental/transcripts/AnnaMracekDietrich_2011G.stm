AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 1 AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 41.45 54.91 <NA> we looked at the historical attempts that had been out there and realized that despite the fact that we have a lot of modern innovations to draw on today that weren 't available previously we have modern composite materials we have aircraft

AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 1 AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 84.25 88.04 <NA> and the result is the terrafugia transition it 's a <unk>

AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 1 AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 140.85 154.97 <NA> the picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time and we were all very flattered to see that image become a symbol of accomplishing something that people had thought was impossible really the world over
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 1 AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 155.8 160.64 <NA> the flight testing that followed that was as basic and low risk as we could make it 
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 1 AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 160.64 174.95 <NA> but it still accomplished what we needed to to take the program to the next step and to gain the credibility that we needed within our eventual market the general aviation community and with the regulators that govern the use of design of aircraft particularly in the states 
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 1 AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 175.67 184.02 <NA> <unk> about a year ago gave us an exemption for the transition to allow us to have an additional one hundred and ten lbs within the light sport aircraft category 
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 1 AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 183.82 191.7 <NA> now that doesn 't sound like a lot but it 's very important because being able to deliver the transition as a light sport aircraft makes it simpler for us to certify it 
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 1 AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 191.7 195.7 <NA> but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it 
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 1 AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 195.46 199.71 <NA> a sport pilot can be certificated in as little as twenty hours of flight time 
AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 1 AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 199.22 204.28 <NA> and at one hundred and ten lbs that 's very important for solving the other side of the equation

AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 1 AnnaMracekDietrich_2011G 206.1 214.82 <NA> it turns out that driving with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles is actually a harder problem to solve than flying
