JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 18.52 25.2 <NA> <unk> i 've studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neurotransmitters dopamine
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 25.1 30.57 <NA> <unk> things like that all the way through circuit analysis so that 's what i normally do <unk> but then for some reason 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 30.29 39.63 <NA> i got into something else <unk> just recently <unk> and it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me to analyze a bunch of brains of psychopathic killers <unk> 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 39.65 50.1 <NA> and so this would be the typical talk i would give and the question is how do you end up with a psychopathic killer what i mean by psychopathic killer are these people these types of people 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 50.1 54.88 <NA> and so some of the brains that i 've studied are people you know about when i get the brains i don
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 54.99 63.1 <NA> <unk> i 'm looking at it 's blind experiments they also gave me normal people <unk> and everything so i 've looked at about seventy of these and what came up was a number of pieces of data <unk> 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 62.61 68.05 <NA> so we look at these sorts of things theoretically on the basis of genetics 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 67.68 75.16 <NA> and brain damage <unk> and interaction with environment and exactly how that machine works so we 're interested in exactly where in the brain 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 75.15 78.32 <NA> and what 's the most important part of the brain so
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 78.15 79.61 <NA> we 've been looking at this
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 80.05 84.68 <NA> <unk> interaction of genes <unk> what 's called epigenetic effects 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 84.34 87.87 <NA> brain damage and environment <unk> and how these are tied together 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 87.87 95.16 <NA> and how you end up with a psychopath and a killer depends on exactly when the damage occurs it 's really a very precisely
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 94.71 97.71 <NA> timed thing you get different kinds of psychopaths <unk> 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 97.71 104.97 <NA> so we 're going along with this <unk> and here 's just to give you the pattern the pattern is that those people every one of them i looked at who was a murderer
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 105.19 106.9 <NA> and was a serial killer 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 106.66 111.31 <NA> had damage to their orbital cortex which is right above the eyes the orbits <unk> 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 111.31 119.04 <NA> and also the interior part of the temporal lobe so there is the pattern that every one of them had but they all were a little different too they had other sorts of brain damage 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 119.06 122.91 <NA> a key thing is that the major
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 122.48 124.75 <NA> violence genes it 's called the
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 130.08 138.82 <NA> <unk> population some of you have this <unk> and it 's sex linked it 's on the x chromosome <unk> and so in this way you can only get it from your mother <unk> 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 139.02 147.59 <NA> and in fact this is probably why mostly men boys are psychopathic killers or are very aggressive <unk> because a
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 147.38 149.02 <NA> daughter can get
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 148.62 154.91 <NA> one x from the father one x from the mother it 's kind of diluted out <unk> but for a son he can only get the
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 154.92 157.46 <NA> x chromosome from his mother so this is how it 's passed from
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 157.29 162.56 <NA> from mother to son <unk> and it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development which
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 162.52 167.4 <NA> is kind of interesting because serotonin is supposed to make you calm and relaxed <unk> 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 167.4 174.81 <NA> but if you have this gene in utero your brain is bathed in this so your whole brain becomes insensitive to
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 175.31 177.75 <NA> <unk> so it doesn 't work later on in life 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 177.89 186.13 <NA> and i 'd given this one talk in israel <unk> just this past year <unk> and it does have some consequences theoretically
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 185.74 191.61 <NA> what this means is that in order to express this gene in a violent way 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 191.24 199.81 <NA> very early on before puberty you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic not a little stress not being spanked or something but really
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 203.67 211.33 <NA> <unk> the mirror neuron system works <unk> and so if you have that gene <unk> and you see a lot of violence
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 210.9 216.19 <NA> in a certain situation this is the recipe for disaster <unk> absolute disaster <unk> 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 215.88 224.83 <NA> and what i think might happen in these areas of the world where we have constant violence you end up having generations of kids
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 224.4 229.7 <NA> that are seeing all this violence <unk> and if i was a young girl somewhere in a violent area
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 229.9 231.5 <NA> <unk> fourteen year old and i want to
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 231.04 239.03 <NA> find a mate i 'd find some tough guy right to protect me <unk> well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes <unk> 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 238.78 246.66 <NA> and now the boys and the girls get them so i think after several generations <unk> and here is the idea we really have a tinderbox <unk> so that was
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 246.47 254.97 <NA> the idea <unk> but then my mother said to me i hear you 've been going around talking about psychopathic killers <unk> and you 're talking as if you come from
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 254.93 259.44 <NA> <unk> a normal family i said what the hell are you talking about she then
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 258.95 267.09 <NA> told me about our own family tree now she blamed this on my father 's side of course this was one of these cases because she has no violence in her background <unk> 
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 266.63 275.05 <NA> but my father did <unk> well she said there is good news and bad news one of your cousins is ezra cornell founder of cornell university <unk> but the bad
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 284.16 290.24 <NA> <unk> no it gets worse read this book and here is this killed strangely and it 's this historical book <unk> and the first murder
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 290.06 293.08 <NA> of a mother by a son was my
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 293.34 300.16 <NA> great great great great great great grandfather okay so that 's the first case of matricide and that book is very interesting because it 's about
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 299.85 304.73 <NA> witch trials and how people thought back then <unk> but it doesn 't stop there
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 305.02 311.3 <NA> there were seven more men on my father 's side <unk> starting then cornells that were all murderers
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 311.62 314.15 <NA> okay <unk> now this
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 313.98 315.77 <NA> gives one a little pause <unk>
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 316.03 324.99 <NA> because my father himself and my three uncles in world war ii were all conscientious objectors all pussycats <unk> but every once in a while like lizzie
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 325.37 326.77 <NA> <unk> like three times a century
JimFallon_2009 1 JimFallon_2009 359.58 360.62 <NA> <unk> the bad news is
