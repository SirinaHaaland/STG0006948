AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 248.68 252.18 <NA> to me the most shocking thing about grit
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 251.97 254.97 <NA> is how little we know how little science
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 255.2 256.98 <NA> <unk> knows about building it 
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 256.55 264.58 <NA> every day parents and teachers ask me how do i build grit in kids what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethic

AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 267.38 271.23 <NA> the honest answer is i don 't know 
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 271.52 275.08 <NA> laughter what i do know is that talent doesn 't make you gritty
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 275.61 277.96 <NA> <unk> our data show very clearly
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 277.47 283.64 <NA> that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments 
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 283.64 288.11 <NA> in fact in our data grit is usually unrelated
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 287.93 296.66 <NA> or even inversely related to measures of talent <unk> so far the best idea i 've heard about building grit in kids
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 296.45 304.82 <NA> is something called growth mindset this is an idea developed at stanford university by carol dweck <unk> and it is the belief
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 304.87 311.12 <NA> that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with your effort dr 
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 311.02 319.34 <NA> dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge 
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 319.34 328.49 <NA> they 're much more likely to persevere when they fail <unk> because they don 't believe that failure is a permanent condition 
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 328.63 329.97 <NA> so growth mindset
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 330.11 334.83 <NA> <unk> is a great idea for building grit <unk> but we need more 
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 334.4 346.32 <NA> and that 's where i 'm going to end my remarks because that 's where we are that 's the work that stands before us we need to take our best ideas our strongest intuitions and we need to test them 
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 346.32 354.97 <NA> we need to measure whether we 've been successful and we have to be willing to fail to be wrong to start over again with lessons
AngelaDuckworth_2013S 1 AngelaDuckworth_2013S 354.96 362.93 <NA> <unk> learned in other words <unk> we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier <unk> thank you
