JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 12.79 21.8 <NA> <unk> you know cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy for students it 's quite an experience 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 21.37 25.23 <NA> but for a school <unk> it could be very difficult
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 25.02 29.85 <NA> or expensive to maintain <unk> so we learned the
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 29.78 32.56 <NA> <unk> majority of anatomic classes taught 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 32.35 35.45 <NA> they do not have a cadaver dissection lab <unk> 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 35.46 44.38 <NA> maybe those reasons <unk> or depending on where you are cadavers may not be easily available <unk> so to address this 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 44.17 48.03 <NA> we developed with a dr brown in stanford <unk> 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 47.54 50.05 <NA> virtual dissection table
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 55.32 60.28 <NA> <unk> so with this anatomage table students can experience
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 60.28 68.56 <NA> the dissection without a human cadaver and the table form is important and since <unk>
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 69.98 79.97 <NA> just like the way they do dissections in the lab or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 80.02 83.6 <NA> <unk> with your table our digital body
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 83.11 86.48 <NA> is one to one life size <unk> 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 86.48 92.9 <NA> so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy i
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 93.64 96.3 <NA> 'm going to do
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 96.11 100.29 <NA> some demonstrations <unk> as you can see
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 101.15 104.97 <NA> <unk> i use my finger to interact with my digital body
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 104.96 112.65 <NA> <unk> i 'm going to do some cuts i can cut any way i want to so i cut right here <unk> 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 113.27 116.43 <NA> then it 's going to show inside 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 117.62 123.33 <NA> and i can change my cut to see different parts <unk> 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 125.9 128.8 <NA> maybe i can cut there see the brain
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 130.59 136.6 <NA> <unk> and i can change my cut you can see some internal organs
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 138.18 140.02 <NA> <unk> so we call this
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 140.02 142 <NA> the slicer mode <unk> 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 151.36 153.29 <NA> <unk> going to do another cut 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 156.85 158.93 <NA> right there 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 161.26 165.08 <NA> this shows a lot of internal structures
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 165.31 170.09 <NA> <unk> so if i want to see the back side i can flip
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 170.83 173.24 <NA> and see from behind 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 180.32 187.14 <NA> <unk> images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you that means
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 186.91 189.18 <NA> we did the right job <unk> 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 189.32 193.29 <NA> so our doctors said these are eye candies
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 193.25 204.25 <NA> <unk> so instead of just butchering the body <unk> i 'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to peel off all the skin
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 204.75 209.92 <NA> <unk> muscles and bones <unk> just to see a few internal organs <unk> 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 211.35 213.13 <NA> right here <unk> 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 214.77 216.46 <NA> let 's say
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 216.33 220.57 <NA> i 'm going to cut the liver right here
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 226.84 233.16 <NA> <unk> let 's say i 'm interested in looking at the heart <unk> i 'm going to do some surgery here
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 266.57 268.59 <NA> <unk> going to make a cut right there <unk> 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 271.28 279.88 <NA> and then you can see the inside of the heart you can see the atrium and the ventricles how blood flows to our
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 280.11 281.47 <NA> <unk> and veins
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 281.16 287.57 <NA> <unk> just like this students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 287.57 294.49 <NA> it doesn 't have to be always dissection since it 's digital we can do reverse dissection 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 294.78 302.69 <NA> so let me show you i 'm going to start with the skeletal structure and i can add a few internal organs
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 305.46 309.53 <NA> yep maybe i can add quickly this way 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 311.95 318.05 <NA> and i can build muscles gradually just
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 319.3 322.94 <NA> like that we can see tendons and muscles 
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 324.1 326.91 <NA> wish i could build my muscle this fast
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 330.11 331.23 <NA> <unk> way to
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 331.23 341.1 <NA> learn anatomy another thing i can show you is more often than not doctors get to meet patients
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 340.67 350.05 <NA> in x ray form so anatomage table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 356.49 359.65 <NA> <unk> and also if you want you can compare
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 359.73 369.13 <NA> with how anatomy would appear in x ray too so when you are done <unk> just bring back
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 369.13 370.42 <NA> the body
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 371.67 375.43 <NA> and then it 's ready for another session it
JackChoi_2012 1 JackChoi_2012 375.54 381.86 <NA> looks like our table also can transform gender too it 's a female now
