AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 13.45 22.13 <NA> <unk> any power in design that 's the power of synthesis <unk> the more complex the problem <unk> the more the need for simplicity <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 21.85 28.64 <NA> so allow me to share three cases where we tried to apply design 's power of synthesis <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 28.9 29.97 <NA> let 's start
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 29.69 33.26 <NA> <unk> start with the global challenge of urbanization <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 33.26 40.47 <NA> it 's a fact that people are moving towards <unk> cities and even if counterintuitive <unk> it 's good news <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 40.01 43.95 <NA> evidence shows that people are better off in cities <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 44.12 48.84 <NA> but there 's a problem that i would call the 3s menace <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 48.47 54.7 <NA> the scale <unk> speed and scarcity of means with which we will have to respond to this phenomenon
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 54.87 57.22 <NA> <unk> has no precedence in history 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 57.22 65.41 <NA> for you to have an idea out of the three billion people living in cities today one billion are under the line of poverty 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 64.95 71.26 <NA> by two thousand and thirty out of the five billion people that will be living in cities 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 71.26 74.83 <NA> two billion are going to be under the line of poverty 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 75.22 79.13 <NA> <unk> that means that we will have to build
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 81.1 82.34 <NA> a one <unk>
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 85 88.16 <NA> city per week
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 89.59 93.74 <NA> with ten thousand dollars per family
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 95.14 104.91 <NA> during the next fifteen years a one million person city per week with ten thousand dollars per family if we don 't solve this equation it is not that people
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 104.87 107.97 <NA> <unk> will stop coming to cities they will come anyhow <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 107.77 113.71 <NA> but they will live in slums favelas and informal settlements <unk> so what to do <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 113.71 118.68 <NA> well an answer may come from favelas and slums themselves 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 119.51 129.97 <NA> a clue could be in this question we were asked ten years ago <unk> we were asked to accommodate one hundred families that had been occupying
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 130.07 132.44 <NA> illegally half a hectare
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 132.26 142.04 <NA> in the center of the city of iquique in the north of chile using a $ ten thousand subsidy with which we had to buy the land 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 142.04 150.23 <NA> provide the infrastructure and build the houses that in the best of the cases would be of around forty square meters
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 151.12 153.26 <NA> <unk> and by the way they said 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 153.26 161.48 <NA> the cost of the land because it 's in the center of the city is three times more than what social housing can normally afford <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 161.92 169.85 <NA> due to the difficulty of the question we decided to include the families in the process of understanding the constraints <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 170.23 175.05 <NA> and we started a participatory design process and testing what was available
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 186.02 190.8 <NA> <unk> only way to accommodate all of them was by building in height 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 190.55 203.19 <NA> and they threatened us to go on a hunger strike if we even dared to offer this as a solution <unk> because they could not make the tiny apartments expand <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 202.97 204.94 <NA> so the conclusion with the
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 204.87 213.58 <NA> <unk> families and this is important not our conclusion with the families was that we had a problem we had to innovate <unk> so what did we do 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 215.46 219.16 <NA> well a middle class family
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 219.57 224.99 <NA> lives reasonably well in around eighty square meters <unk> but
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 225 231.2 <NA> when there 's no money what the market does is to reduce the size of the house
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 231.94 239.36 <NA> to forty square meters <unk> what we said was what if <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 240.76 244.85 <NA> instead of thinking of forty square meters
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 244.96 254.73 <NA> as a small house why don 't we consider it half of a good one when you rephrase the
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 254.66 262.38 <NA> <unk> problem as half of a good house instead of a small one <unk> the key question is which half do we do <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 262.37 269.28 <NA> and we thought we had to do with public money the half that families won 't be able to do individually
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 270.2 275.05 <NA> <unk> we identified five design conditions that belonged to the hard half
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 275.13 281.92 <NA> <unk> a house and we went back to the families to do two things join forces and split tasks 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 282.27 288.09 <NA> our design was something in between a building and a house 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 288.09 293.32 <NA> as a building it could pay for expensive well located land <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 292.86 296.23 <NA> and as a house <unk> it could expand if
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 296.61 304.85 <NA> in the process of not being expelled to the periphery while getting a house families kept their network and their jobs
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 304.84 313.76 <NA> <unk> we knew that the expansion would begin right away <unk> so we went from this initial social housing
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 313.48 319.91 <NA> to a middle class unit achieved by families themselves within a couple of weeks 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 320.68 329.79 <NA> this was our first project in iquique ten years ago this is our last project in chile <unk> different designs
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 329.84 335.49 <NA> <unk> same principle you provide the frame <unk> and from then on families take over <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 336.74 338.55 <NA> so
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 338.09 341.07 <NA> the purpose of design 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 340.58 349.96 <NA> trying to understand and trying to give an answer to the 3s menace scale speed and scarcity is to channel people 's own building
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 350.61 359.35 <NA> <unk> we won 't solve the one million people per week equation unless we use people 's own power for building <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 359.04 368.02 <NA> so with the right design slums and favelas may not be the problem but actually the only possible solution <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 368.25 375.02 <NA> the second case is how design can contribute to sustainability in two thousand and
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 375.31 384.44 <NA> <unk> we entered the competition for the angelini innovation center and the aim was to build the right environment for knowledge creation <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 384.79 394.18 <NA> it is accepted that for such an aim knowledge creation interaction among people face to face contact it 's important and we agreed on that 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 394.18 404.97 <NA> but for us the question of the right environment was a very literal question we wanted to have a working space with the right light with the right temperature with
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 404.93 406.62 <NA> <unk> the right air <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 406.19 408.55 <NA> so we asked ourselves 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 408.55 416.64 <NA> does the typical office building help us in that sense <unk> well how does that building look typically <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 416.69 424.69 <NA> it 's a collection of floors one on top of each other with a core in the center with
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 429.03 432.7 <NA> <unk> and then a glass skin on the outside
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 432.63 440.83 <NA> that due to direct sun radiation <unk> creates a huge greenhouse effect inside <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 441.09 452.59 <NA> in addition to that let 's say a guy working on the seventh floor goes every single day through the third floor but has no idea what the guy on that floor is working on <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 452.37 454.94 <NA> so we thought well <unk> maybe we have
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 454.93 463.37 <NA> <unk> to turn this scheme inside out <unk> and what we did was let 's have an open atrium a
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 463.51 472.19 <NA> hollowed core <unk> the same collection of floors <unk> but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 471.97 474.2 <NA> so that
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 473.71 474.87 <NA> when the sun
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 476.69 481.44 <NA> <unk> 's not impacting directly glass but a wall 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 482.36 491.37 <NA> when you have an open atrium inside you are able to see what others are doing from within the building and you have a better way to control light <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 491.18 499.69 <NA> and when you place the mass and the walls in the perimeter <unk> then you are preventing direct sun radiation <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 499.69 502.21 <NA> you may also open those windows and get
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 504.93 515.98 <NA> <unk> we just made those openings of such a scale that they could work as elevated squares <unk> outdoor spaces throughout the entire height of the building <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 516.75 524.54 <NA> none of this is rocket science <unk> you don 't require sophisticated programming it 's not about technology this is just
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 528.76 540.05 <NA> <unk> and by using common sense <unk> we went from one hundred and twenty kilowatts per square meter per year <unk> which is the typical energy consumption for cooling a glass tower 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 540.05 541.92 <NA> to forty
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 541.71 550.08 <NA> kilowatts per square meter per year <unk> so with the right design sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use of common
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 553.31 560.7 <NA> <unk> last case i would like to share is how design can provide more comprehensive answers against natural disasters 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 560.6 569.61 <NA> you may know that chile in two thousand and ten was hit by an eight point eight richter scale earthquake and tsunami <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 569.6 574.99 <NA> and we were called to work in the reconstruction of the constitucin in the southern part of the
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 575.76 578.24 <NA> <unk> we were given one hundred days 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 578.24 587 <NA> three months to design almost everything from public buildings to public space <unk> street grid transportation housing and mainly
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 586.67 590.65 <NA> how to protect the city against future tsunamis <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 590.88 593.96 <NA> this was new in chilean urban design <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 593.96 604.67 <NA> and there were in the air a couple of alternatives first one <unk> forbid installation on ground zero <unk> thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 604.96 613.1 <NA> this is exactly what 's being discussed in japan nowadays and if you have a disciplined population like the japanese this may work 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 612.61 622.25 <NA> but we know that in chile <unk> this land is going to be occupied illegally anyhow <unk> so this alternative was unrealistic and undesirable 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 622.33 625.11 <NA> second alternative build a
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 624.9 629.76 <NA> big wall heavy infrastructure to resist the energy of the waves
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 630.02 643.83 <NA> <unk> this alternative was conveniently lobbied by big building companies because it meant forty two million dollars in contracts and was also politically preferred because it required no land expropriation <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 643.7 649.84 <NA> but japan proved that trying to resist the force of nature is useless <unk>
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 660.96 663.56 <NA> <unk> and we started a participatory design process
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 711.86 719.08 <NA> <unk> i don 't know if you were able to read the subtitles but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 729.99 735.04 <NA> <unk> it is actually not even with the families trying to find the right answer <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 734.7 744.07 <NA> it is mainly trying to identify with precision what is the right question there is nothing worse than answering well the wrong question <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 743.88 749.35 <NA> so it was pretty obvious after this process that well <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 749.04 754.97 <NA> we chicken out here and go away because it 's too tense <unk> or we go even further
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 755.1 761.81 <NA> in asking what else is bothering you what other problems do you have and you want us to take care of now that the city
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 761.61 764.78 <NA> will have to be rethought from scratch <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 765.46 774.9 <NA> and what they said was look <unk> fine to protect the city against future tsunamis we really appreciate but the next one is going to come in what twenty years <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 774.9 779.22 <NA> but every single year <unk> we have problems of flooding due to rain
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 780.26 789.96 <NA> <unk> in addition we are in the middle of the forest region of the country <unk> and our public space sucks <unk> it 's poor and it 's scarce 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 790.55 803.71 <NA> and the origin of the city our identity is not really connected to the buildings that fell <unk> it is connected to the river <unk> but the river cannot be accessed publicly because its shores are privately owned
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 804.87 809.23 <NA> <unk> so we thought that we had to produce a third alternative <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 808.95 816.7 <NA> and our our approach was against geographical threats have geographical answers 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 816.9 821.74 <NA> what if <unk> in between the city
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 823.08 825.13 <NA> and the sea
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 828.48 829.94 <NA> we have a forest
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 831.28 840.08 <NA> a forest that doesn 't try to resist the energy of nature <unk> but dissipates it by introducing friction 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 839.77 846.26 <NA> a forest that may be able to laminate the water and prevent the flooding 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 846.26 851.42 <NA> that may pay the historical debt of public space <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 851.23 854.13 <NA> and that may provide finally
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 854.87 856.59 <NA> <unk> access to the river <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 856.52 865.29 <NA> so as a conclusion of the participatory design <unk> the alternative was validated politically and socially but there was still the problem of the cost
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 865.67 875.02 <NA> forty eight million dollars <unk> so what we did was a survey in the public investment system <unk> and found out that
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 875 883.58 <NA> were three ministries with three projects in the exact same place not knowing of the existence of the other projects the sum of them
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 884.63 886.21 <NA> million dollars <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 885.99 897.7 <NA> so design 's power of synthesis is trying to make a more efficient use of the scarcest resource in cities which is not money but coordination 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 897.57 904.97 <NA> by doing so we were able to save four million dollars and that is why the forest is today under construction
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 909.01 910.55 <NA> so
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 910.18 913.31 <NA> be it the force of self construction 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 913 922.31 <NA> the force of common sense <unk> or the force of nature <unk> all these forces need to be translated into form <unk> 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 922.24 927.72 <NA> and what that form is modeling and shaping is not cement
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 930.02 931.86 <NA> <unk> life itself 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 931.82 942.51 <NA> design 's power of synthesis is just an attempt to put at the innermost core of architecture the force of life 
AlejandroAravena_2014G 1 AlejandroAravena_2014G 942.14 943.3 <NA> thank you so much
