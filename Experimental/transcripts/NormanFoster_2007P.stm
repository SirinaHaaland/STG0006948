NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 532.99 540.3 <NA> for example if you take <unk> and you make a comparison between a recent kind of
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 540.08 554.97 <NA> city <unk> what i 'll call simplistically a north american city and detroit is not a bad example it is very car dependent <unk> the city goes out in annular rings consuming more and more green space and more
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 555.07 561.96 <NA> and more roads <unk> and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 561.96 571.92 <NA> which again the city center as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial again becomes dead if you compared detroit
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 571.49 578.89 <NA> with a city of a northern european example and munich is not a bad example of that
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 579.81 589.03 <NA> <unk> with the greater dependence on walking and cycling then a city which is
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 588.57 594.65 <NA> really only twice as dense is only using <unk> one tenth of the energy <unk> 
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 594.65 600.46 <NA> in other words you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous <unk> 
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 600.87 604.85 <NA> so basically if you wanted to generalize
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 604.93 606.74 <NA> <unk> can demonstrate
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 606.46 613.05 <NA> that as the density increases along the bottom there that the
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 612.84 622.29 <NA> energy consumed reduces dramatically of course you can 't separate this out from issues like social diversity mass transit

NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 628.75 640.58 <NA> again you can see detroit in yellow at the top extraordinary consumption down below copenhagen and copenhagen although it 's a dense city is not dense compared
NormanFoster_2007P 1 NormanFoster_2007P 640.59 650.02 <NA> with the really dense cities <unk> in the year two thousand a rather interesting thing happened you had for the first time mega cities
