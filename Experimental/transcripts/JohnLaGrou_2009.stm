JohnLaGrou_2009 1 JohnLaGrou_2009 32.9 41.31 <NA> what if we could prevent electrical fires before they start well a couple of friends and i figured out how to do this 
JohnLaGrou_2009 1 JohnLaGrou_2009 41.18 49.9 <NA> so how does electricity ignite residential fires <unk> well it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical
JohnLaGrou_2009 1 JohnLaGrou_2009 50.67 59.11 <NA> <unk> our invention had to address all of these issues <unk> so what about circuit breakers <unk> well thomas edison invented the circuit breaker in <unk>
JohnLaGrou_2009 1 JohnLaGrou_2009 62.34 72.07 <NA> <unk> technology and this is a problem because over eighty percent of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers 
JohnLaGrou_2009 1 JohnLaGrou_2009 71.97 79.73 <NA> hmmm so we considered all of this and we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power
JohnLaGrou_2009 1 JohnLaGrou_2009 79.69 89.87 <NA> <unk> receptacle itself any electrical device an appliance an extension cord whatever must be able to tell the power outlet hey power outlet i 'm drawing too much <unk>
JohnLaGrou_2009 1 JohnLaGrou_2009 89.77 98.39 <NA> <unk> current shut me off now before i start a fire and the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it so here is what we did 
JohnLaGrou_2009 1 JohnLaGrou_2009 104.96 111.03 <NA> <unk> we put an inexpensive wireless data reader inside the receptacle so they could communicate <unk>
