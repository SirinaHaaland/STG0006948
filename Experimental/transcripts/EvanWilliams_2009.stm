EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 13.45 18.98 <NA> on the ted stage i announced a company i was working with at the time called odeo <unk> 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 18.91 25.62 <NA> and because of that announcement we got a big article in the new york times which led to more press which led
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 25.46 29.85 <NA> to more attention and me deciding to become ceo of that company whereas i was
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 30.05 31.32 <NA> <unk> an adviser
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 31.07 35.64 <NA> and raising a round of venture capital and ramping up hiring <unk> 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 35.6 43.32 <NA> one of the guys i hired was an engineer named jack dorsey and a year later when we were trying to decide which way to go with odeo <unk> 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 43.22 51.33 <NA> jack presented an idea he 'd been tinkering around with for a number of years that was based around sending simple status updates to friends 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 50.84 54.97 <NA> we were also playing with sms at the time at odeo so we kind of put two and two together
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 55.1 59.74 <NA> <unk> and in early two thousand and six we launched twitter as a side project at odeo <unk> 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 59.94 65.17 <NA> now it 's hard to justify doing a side project at a startup where focus is so critical <unk> 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 65.17 71.23 <NA> but i had actually launched blogger as a side project to my previous company thinking it was just a little thing we 'd do on the side 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 70.89 79.67 <NA> and it ended up taking over not only the company but my life for the next five or six years so i learned to follow hunches even though you can 't necessarily
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 80.14 84.98 <NA> <unk> them or know where they 're going to go <unk> and that 's kind of what 's happened with twitter time after time 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 85.06 90.67 <NA> so for those of you unfamiliar twitter is based around a very simple seemingly trivial concept 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 90.45 94.08 <NA> you say what you 're doing in one hundred and forty characters or less 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 94.08 101.84 <NA> and people who are interested in you get those updates if they 're really interested they get the update as a text message on their cell phone <unk> 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 101.59 104.97 <NA> so for instance i may twitter right now that i 'm giving a talk
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 104.96 107.01 <NA> <unk> at ted <unk> and
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 106.81 112.95 <NA> in my case when i hit send up to sixty thousand people will receive that message in a matter of seconds 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 113.57 122.46 <NA> now the fundamental idea is that twitter lets people share moments of their lives whenever they want be they momentous occasions
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 122.12 124.14 <NA> or mundane ones it
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 125.87 129.88 <NA> is by sharing these moments as they 're happening that lets

EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 134.4 138.11 <NA> this is the primary use we saw of twitter from the beginning 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 138.11 146.92 <NA> and what got us excited what we didn 't anticipate was the many many other uses that would evolve from this very simple system <unk> 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 146.58 149.99 <NA> one of the things we realized was how important twitter
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 152.5 163.19 <NA> <unk> when the wildfires broke out in san diego in october of two thousand and seven people turned to twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them <unk> 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 162.7 175.7 <NA> but it wasn 't just individuals the l a times actually turned to twitter to dispense information as well <unk> and put a twitter feed on the front page <unk> and the l a fire department and red cross used it to dispense news and updates as well 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 175.51 180 <NA> at this event dozens of people here are twittering and thousands of people around the world
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 180.08 184.26 <NA> <unk> are following along because they want to know what it feels like to be here and what 's happening 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 185.09 189.66 <NA> among the other interesting things that have cropped up are many things from businesses 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 189.32 192.66 <NA> from marketing and communications and predictable things 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 192.65 199.87 <NA> to an insanely popular korean barbecue taco truck that drives around l a and twitters where it stops <unk> causing a line to form around the

EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 232.42 240.83 <NA> twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium you send one message and it goes out to everybody and you receive the messages you 're interested in 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 240.67 249.87 <NA> one of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 252.68 262.32 <NA> <unk> that shaquille o 'neal 's using here to reply to one of his fans was completely invented by users and we didn 't build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 262.22 270.51 <NA> this is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system another is via the api we built an application programming interface which basically means that
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 270.11 277.89 <NA> programmers can write software that interacts with twitter we currently know about over two thousand pieces of software that can send twitter updates
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 277.61 278.95 <NA> interfaces

EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 289.74 297.55 <NA> probably the most important <unk> third party development came from a little company in virginia called summize summize built a twitter search engine <unk> 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 297.54 304.97 <NA> and they tapped into the fact that if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they 're doing and what 's around them you have an incredible resource
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 307.14 316.1 <NA> any topic or event while it 's going on this really changed how we perceived twitter for instance here 's what people are saying about ted <unk>
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 317.37 322.47 <NA> this is another way that our mind was shifted and twitter wasn 't what we thought it was 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 322.47 327.65 <NA> we liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product <unk> 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 327.16 329.85 <NA> this not only lets you view
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 329.78 338.58 <NA> <unk> twitters in different ways but it introduces new use cases as well one of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in atlanta <unk> 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 338.39 351.75 <NA> some users figured out that they would twitter when they found gas where it was and how much it cost and then appended the keyword # atlgas which let other people search for that and find gas themselves and
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 351.74 354.88 <NA> this trend of people using this communication network to help each other

EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 375.87 379.97 <NA> it seems like when you give people easier
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 379.93 383.27 <NA> <unk> ways to share information more good things happen 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 384.49 392.19 <NA> i have no idea what will happen next with twitter <unk> i 've learned to follow the hunch but never assume where it will go
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 405.13 410.64 <NA> live this is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do after they 've been to an event <unk> 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 410.3 413.19 <NA> it 's totally intimidating so <unk> 
EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 412.79 421.38 <NA> this would be the twitter search screen so we 're going to just type a couple of random words into twitter for example evan

EvanWilliams_2009 1 EvanWilliams_2009 443.4 449.99 <NA> <unk> in the eight minutes he was talking there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk so he 'll see every aspect of the reaction the fact that
