SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 98.05 102.02 <NA> let me tell you about how miniaturization might get us there 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 102.64 104.94 <NA> this is a microscope in a typical lab

SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 133.41 142.06 <NA> now what that means is instead of taking a sample from a patient and sending it to the microscope you can bring the microscope to the patient 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 142.06 150.11 <NA> and then instead of requiring a specialist to look at the images you can train the computer to score normal

SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 200.1 206.33 <NA> <unk> now as engineers we think of this as straight up miniaturization you took a big thing and you made it little 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 206.12 215.53 <NA> but what i told you before about computers was that they transformed our lives when they became small enough for us to take them everywhere <unk> 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 215.53 220.49 <NA> so what is the transformational equivalent like that in medicine <unk> 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 220.26 221.56 <NA> well <unk> 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 221.1 229.94 <NA> what if you had a detector that was so small that it could circulate in your body <unk> find the tumor all by itself
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 230.07 233 <NA> and send a signal to the outside world 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 232.57 239.25 <NA> it sounds a little bit like science fiction <unk> but actually <unk> nanotechnology allows us to do just that 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 239.25 250.05 <NA> nanotechnology allows us to shrink the parts that make up the detector from the width of a human hair <unk> which is one hundred microns to a thousand times smaller
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 250.34 255.4 <NA> <unk> which is one hundred nanometers <unk> and that has profound implications 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 255.4 261.24 <NA> it turns out that materials actually change their properties at the nanoscale 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 260.78 270.78 <NA> you take a common material like gold <unk> and you grind it into dust into gold nanoparticles and it changes from looking gold to looking red 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 270.56 277.12 <NA> if you take a more exotic material like cadmium selenide forms a big black crystal
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 276.91 279.97 <NA> if you make nanocrystals out of this material and
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 279.99 283.21 <NA> <unk> put it in a liquid <unk> and you shine light on it 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 282.72 292.87 <NA> they glow and they glow blue green <unk> yellow <unk> orange <unk> red <unk> depending only on their size it
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 292.41 301.18 <NA> 's wild can you imagine an object like that in the macro world it would be like all the denim jeans in your closet
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 301.02 304.97 <NA> are all made of cotton <unk> but they are different colors
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 304.6 308.27 <NA> <unk> colors depending only on their size 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 310.45 318.88 <NA> so as a physician what 's just as interesting to me is that it 's not just the color of materials that changes at the nanoscale 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 318.88 322.91 <NA> the way they travel in your body also changes 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 322.66 329.4 <NA> and this is the kind of observation that we 're going to use to make a better cancer detector <unk> so let me show you what i mean
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 330.17 335.44 <NA> this is a blood vessel in the body <unk> surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor we
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 335.44 343.35 <NA> 're going to inject nanoparticles into the blood vessel and watch how they travel from the bloodstream into the tumor <unk> 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 342.98 352.56 <NA> now it turns out that the blood vessels of many tumors are leaky and so nanoparticles can leak out from the bloodstream into the tumor 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 352.13 354.97 <NA> whether they leak out depends on their
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 354.96 362.62 <NA> <unk> size <unk> so in this image the smaller hundred nanometer blue nanoparticles are leaking out and the larger <unk>
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 363.69 366.85 <NA> <unk> red nanoparticles are stuck in the bloodstream <unk> 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 366.36 376.45 <NA> so that means as an engineer <unk> depending on how big or small i make a material i can change where it goes in your body 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 376.74 379.4 <NA> in my lab we recently made
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 379.96 387.32 <NA> <unk> cancer nanodetector that is so small that it could travel into the body and look for tumors

SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 396.4 404.97 <NA> for a tumor to break out of the tissue that it 's born in it has to make chemicals called enzymes to chew through the scaffolding of tissues
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 405.26 411.03 <NA> we designed these nanoparticles to be activated by these enzymes 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 410.57 419.1 <NA> one enzyme can activate a thousand of these chemical reactions in an hour <unk> now in engineering we call that <unk>
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 420.19 425.02 <NA> ratio a form of amplification and it makes something ultrasensitive so
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 429.96 435.59 <NA> <unk> but how do i get this activated signal to the outside world where i can act on it 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 435.59 441.4 <NA> for this we 're going to use one more piece of nanoscale biology <unk> and that has to do with the kidney
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 441.12 448.99 <NA> the kidney is a filter its job is to filter out the blood and put waste into the urine 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 448.74 454.43 <NA> it turns out that what the kidney filters is also dependent on size
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 455.02 463.82 <NA> <unk> in this image what you can see is that everything smaller than five nanometers is going from the blood through the kidney into the urine <unk> 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 463.82 467.09 <NA> and everything else that 's bigger is retained <unk> 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 466.72 469.26 <NA> ok <unk> so if i make
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 470.68 479.76 <NA> <unk> 100 nanometer cancer detector i inject it in the bloodstream it can leak into the tumor where it 's activated by tumor enzymes
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 480.05 487.77 <NA> <unk> to release a small signal that is small enough to be filtered out of the kidney and put into the urine 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 487.43 492.42 <NA> i have a signal in the outside world that i can detect <unk> 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 492.14 499.93 <NA> ok but there 's one more problem this is a tiny little signal so how do i detect it well the signal is just a
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 500.91 509.98 <NA> <unk> they 're molecules that we designed as engineers they 're completely synthetic <unk> and we can design them so they are compatible with our tool of choice 
SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 509.98 518.59 <NA> if we want to use a really sensitive <unk> fancy instrument called a mass spectrometer then we make a molecule with a unique mass

SangeetaBhatia_2015P 1 SangeetaBhatia_2015P 522.23 529.85 <NA> then we make molecules that we can trap on paper like a pregnancy test in fact there 's a whole world of
