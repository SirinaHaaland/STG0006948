WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 113.5 125.05 <NA> or is it because we have now started labeling individuals with autism <unk> simply giving them a diagnosis when they were still present there before yet simply
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 130.5 140.11 <NA> <unk> legislation was passed that actually provided individuals with autism with resources with access to educational materials that would help them

WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 177.34 179.94 <NA> but let me be very clear
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 180.01 185.31 <NA> <unk> vaccines do not cause autism

WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 236.37 243.75 <NA> in the year one thousand nine hundred and ninety two and you can see that it really did not have an effect in what happened with the prevalence of autism <unk> 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 251.54 262.08 <NA> <unk> in fact there 's probably not one single answer <unk> just as autism is a spectrum there 's a spectrum of etiologies a spectrum of causes <unk> based on epidemiological data <unk>
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 262.03 272.46 <NA> <unk> we know that one of the causes or one of the associations i should say is advanced paternal age that is increasing age of the father at the time of conception

WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 301.6 307.69 <NA> <unk> and one of the things i 'm going to spend a lot of time focusing on are the genes that can cause autism <unk> 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 307.47 317.81 <NA> i 'm focusing on this not because genes are the only cause of autism <unk> but it 's a cause of autism that we can readily define and be able to better understand the <unk>
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 317.71 324.89 <NA> <unk> biology and understand better how the brain works so that we can come up with strategies to be able to intervene 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 325.04 335.19 <NA> <unk> one of the genetic factors that we don 't understand however is the difference that we see in terms of males and females males are affected four to one <unk>
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 335.09 341.34 <NA> <unk> compared to females with autism <unk> and we really don 't understand what that cause is 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 351.15 355.78 <NA> <unk> what 's the probability that another sibling in that family will have autism <unk> 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 355.61 359.64 <NA> and we can look in particular at three types of siblings <unk>

WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 383.58 393.23 <NA> and when you look at those concordance ratios one of the striking things that you will see is that in identical twins that concordance rate is seventy seven percent 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 392.86 400.02 <NA> remarkably though <unk> it 's not one hundred percent <unk> it is not that genes account for all of the risk for
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 400.85 408.48 <NA> <unk> but yet they account for a lot of that risk because when you look at fraternal twins that concordance rate is only thirty one percent 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 407.99 421.2 <NA> on the other hand <unk> there is a difference between those fraternal twins and the siblings <unk> suggesting that there are common exposures for those fraternal twins that may not be shared as commonly with siblings alone 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 421.13 429.94 <NA> so this provides some of the data that autism is genetic well how genetic is it when we compare it to other conditions that we 're familiar with
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 430.01 440.41 <NA> things like cancer <unk> heart disease diabetes in fact genetics plays a much larger role in autism than it does in any of these other conditions <unk>
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 440.36 450.47 <NA> <unk> but with this that doesn 't tell us what the genes are it doesn 't even tell us in any one child is it one gene or potentially a combination of genes <unk>

WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 456.07 462.86 <NA> that is that it is one single powerful deterministic gene that causes the autism <unk> 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 462.43 466.09 <NA> however in other individuals <unk> it 's genetic 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 466.09 475.02 <NA> that is that it 's actually a combination of genes in part with the developmental process that ultimately determines that risk for autism
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 475.64 482.6 <NA> <unk> we don 't know in any one person necessarily <unk> which of those two answers it is until we start digging deeper 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 482.38 491.31 <NA> so the question becomes how can we start to identify what exactly those genes are and let me pose something that might not be intuitive <unk> 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 491.11 493.54 <NA> in certain individuals <unk> 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 493.54 501.42 <NA> they can have autism for a reason that is genetic but yet not because of autism running in the family 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 500.99 504.94 <NA> and the reason is because in certain individuals they can actually have
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 504.87 514.27 <NA> <unk> genetic changes or mutations that are not passed down from the mother or from the father but actually start brand new in them 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 513.78 523.42 <NA> mutations that are present in the egg or the sperm at the time of conception but have not been passed down generation through generation within the family <unk> 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 523.05 529.94 <NA> and we can actually use that strategy to now understand and to identify those genes causing autism in those

WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 530.76 538.7 <NA> so in fact at the simons foundation we took two <unk> thousand six hundred individuals that had no family history of autism <unk> 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 538.7 548.18 <NA> and we took that child and their mother and father and used them to try and understand what were those genes causing autism in those cases 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 547.75 554.97 <NA> to do that we actually had to comprehensively be able to look at all that genetic information and determine what those
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 554.99 559.32 <NA> <unk> differences were between the mother the father and the child <unk> 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 559.28 566.26 <NA> in doing so i apologize i 'm going to use an outdated analogy of encyclopedias rather than wikipedia <unk> 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 566.26 575.61 <NA> but i 'm going to do so to try and help make the point that as we did this inventory we needed to be able to look at massive amounts of information 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 575.12 578.8 <NA> our genetic information is organized into a set of
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 580.34 593.22 <NA> <unk> and when we did that we had to be able to account for each of those forty six volumes <unk> because in some cases with autism <unk> there 's actually a single volume that 's missing <unk> we had to get more granular than that though <unk> and so we had to start opening those books 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 593.22 596.83 <NA> and in some cases the genetic change was more subtle 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 596.4 600.13 <NA> it might have been a single paragraph that was missing 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 599.88 604.55 <NA> or yet even more subtle than that a single letter
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 604.84 614.96 <NA> <unk> one out of three billion letters that was changed that was altered yet had profound effects in terms of how the brain functions and affects behavior <unk> 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 614.96 629.61 <NA> in doing this within these families <unk> we were able to account for approximately twenty five percent of the individuals and determine that there was a single powerful genetic factor that caused autism within those families
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 630.17 634.2 <NA> <unk> on the other hand there 's seventy five percent that we still haven 't figured out 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 634.46 638.31 <NA> as we did this though it was really quite humbling 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 638.31 648.99 <NA> because we realized that there was not simply one gene for autism in fact the current estimates are that there are two hundred to four hundred different genes that can cause autism <unk> 
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 648.53 654.16 <NA> and that explains in part why we see such a broad spectrum in terms of its effects
WendyChung_2014 1 WendyChung_2014 654.75 665.2 <NA> <unk> although there are that many genes <unk> there is some method to the madness <unk> it 's not simply random two hundred four hundred different genes <unk> but in fact they fit together <unk>
