NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 801.66 811.93 <NA> <unk> and this survey is even larger than what i 've shown here if we zoom out to the full extent of the survey <unk> you can see i found three hundred thousand of these radio galaxies <unk> 
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 811.65 813.8 <NA> so it 's truly
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 814.04 821.74 <NA> epic journey we 've discovered all of these galaxies right back to the very first supermassive black holes i
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 821.46 824.71 <NA> 'm very proud of this and it will be published next week 
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 826.18 828.95 <NA> <unk> that 's not all i 've
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 828.46 835.97 <NA> explored the furthest reaches of the galaxy with this survey <unk> but there 's something even more in this image 
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 835.81 844.79 <NA> now i 'll take you right back to the dawn of time when the universe formed it was a big bang <unk> 
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 844.45 848.9 <NA> which left the universe as a sea of hydrogen neutral hydrogen <unk> 
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 848.41 854.97 <NA> and when the very first stars and galaxies switched on they ionized that hydrogen <unk> so the universe went
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 855.01 860.14 <NA> from neutral to ionized that imprinted a signal
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 859.93 868.68 <NA> all around us everywhere it pervades us like the force <unk> now <unk> because that happened so long ago <unk> 
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 868.52 871.2 <NA> the signal was redshifted 
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 871.07 879.88 <NA> so now that signal is at very low frequencies <unk> it 's at the same frequency as my survey <unk> but it 's so faint <unk> it 's a billionth
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 879.9 883.06 <NA> <unk> the size of any of the objects in my survey <unk>
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 882.84 888.16 <NA> so our telescope may not be quite sensitive enough to pick up this signal 
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 887.79 890.61 <NA> however there 's a new radio telescope 
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 890.62 900.08 <NA> so i can 't have a starship but i can hopefully have one of the biggest radio telescopes in the world <unk> we 're building the square kilometre array a new radio telescope
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 900.25 908.09 <NA> <unk> and it 's going to be a thousand times bigger than the mwa a thousand times more sensitive and have an even better resolution so we should find tens of millions of galaxies 
NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 1 NatashaHurleyWalker_2016X 908.09 917.78 <NA> and perhaps deep in that signal i will get to look upon the very first stars and galaxies switching on the beginning of time itself <unk>
