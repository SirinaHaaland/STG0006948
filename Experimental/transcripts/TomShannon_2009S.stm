TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 14.98 17.45 <NA> <unk> start with a question that has just been
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 16.96 26.57 <NA> consuming me since i first became familiar with your work in you work there 's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 26.68 29.97 <NA> in some sort of interplay with creative force
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 30.14 32.6 <NA> are they ever in equilibrium
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 32.38 39.4 <NA> in the way that you see your work tom shannon yeah <unk> the subject matter that i 'm looking for it 's usually to solve a question i
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 39.22 48.16 <NA> had the question popped into my head what does the cone that connects the sun and and the earth look like if you could connect the two spheres 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 48.16 49.96 <NA> and in proportion what would
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 50.52 55.3 <NA> <unk> the size of the sphere and the length and what would the taper be to the earth 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 55.3 61.51 <NA> and so i went about and made that sculpture <unk> turning it out of solid bronze and
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 61.38 69.17 <NA> i did one that was about thirty five feet long the sun end was about four inches in diameter and then it tapered over
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 69.17 71.32 <NA> about thirty five feet to
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 70.86 77.23 <NA> about a millimeter at the earth end and so for me it was really exciting just to see
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 76.83 79.94 <NA> what it looks like if you could step outside
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 79.98 86.9 <NA> and into a larger context <unk> as though you were an astronaut and see these two things as an object <unk> because they
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 86.9 93.72 <NA> are so intimately bound and one is meaningless without the other jh is there a relief
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 93.56 101.25 <NA> in playing with these forces <unk> and i 'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 104.9 113.73 <NA> <unk> that that silver one there that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets trying to find a way to make something float
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 113.3 117.06 <NA> with the least possible connection to the ground so
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 117.06 123.94 <NA> i got it down to just one tether to be able to support that jh now is this electromagnetic here or are these
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 123.71 124.92 <NA> static ts those are
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 137.31 140.51 <NA> <unk> the magnetic works are a combination of gravity
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 140.51 149.75 <NA> and and magnetism so it 's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything <unk> the sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 150.82 154.52 <NA> <unk> and the earth 's magnetic field protects us from the sun so
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 154.12 159.86 <NA> there 's this huge invisible shape structures that
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 159.66 164.04 <NA> that magnetism takes in the universe <unk> but
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 164.04 173.48 <NA> with the pendulum <unk> it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets magnets up my
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 172.99 174.9 <NA> sculptures are
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 175.22 179.02 <NA> <unk> normally very simplified i try to refine them down to
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 178.78 184.91 <NA> very simple forms but the paintings become very complex because i think the fields
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 184.91 192.9 <NA> that are supporting them they 're billowing and they 're interpenetrating and <unk> they 're interference patterns jh and they 're <unk>
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 193.85 200.2 <NA> <unk> i mean you don 't know necessarily where you 're headed when you begin <unk> even though the forces can be calculated
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 206.67 211.25 <NA> <unk> first one i did was in the late seventy 's and i just had a simple
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 211.01 214.21 <NA> cone with a spigot at the bottom of it 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 213.87 218.48 <NA> i threw it into an orbit and it only had one color and
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 218.48 226.07 <NA> when it got to the center the paint kept running out so i had to run in there didn 't have any control over the spigot remotely <unk> 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 225.85 229.61 <NA> so that told me right away i need a remote control device
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 229.93 240.26 <NA> <unk> i started dreaming of having six colors <unk> i sort of think about it as the dna these colors <unk> the red blue yellow <unk> the primary colors and white and black and <unk>
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 240.21 249.23 <NA> if you put them together in different combinations just like printing in a sense like how a magazine color is printed and put them under certain forces <unk> 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 255.17 263.34 <NA> <unk> these amazing things started appearing jh it looks like we 're loaded for bear here ts yeah <unk> well let 's put a couple of canvases i 'll ask a
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 263.03 266.05 <NA> couple of my sons to set up the canvases
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 279.93 285.38 <NA> <unk> going to throw this into an orbit and see if i can paint everybody 's shoes in the front
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 310.75 314.42 <NA> <unk> as a demo <unk> and it 's more playful <unk> but
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 314.35 316.31 <NA> inevitably
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 316.18 323.09 <NA> all of this can be used <unk> i can redeem this painting just continuing on 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 322.66 327.36 <NA> doing layers upon layers and i keep it around for a couple of weeks
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 329.99 337.95 <NA> <unk> do another session with it and bring it up to another level where all of this becomes

TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 345.05 348.46 <NA> so the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 355.26 360.22 <NA> and they can pinch them very tight and stop it or you can have them wide open 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 360.27 372.13 <NA> and all all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom you can always be changing colors put aluminum paint or i could put anything into this it could be

TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 394.84 399.87 <NA> images in and of themselves or are they records of a physical event
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 405.65 414.81 <NA> <unk> i wanted to do something very simple a simple iconic image of two two ripples interfering <unk> so the one on the right was done first <unk> 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 414.35 424.14 <NA> and then the one on the left was done over over it and then i left gaps so you could see the one that was done before <unk> and then when i did the second one 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 424.14 427.9 <NA> it really disturbed the piece these big blue lines
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 427.62 428.62 <NA> crashing through
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 429.86 441.13 <NA> so it created a kind of tension and an overlap <unk> there are lines in front of the one on the right and there are lines behind the one on the left and so it
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 441.13 449.93 <NA> takes it into different planes what it 's also about just the little events 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 454.78 463.88 <NA> <unk> two things that happened there 's an interference pattern and then a third thing happens there are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 463.78 466.02 <NA> two events that are happening
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 467.28 475.16 <NA> very interested in that like the occurrence of moire patterns like this green one this is a painting i did about
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 474.94 479.58 <NA> ten years ago <unk> but it has some see in the upper third
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 479.87 488.64 <NA> <unk> there there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery and that 's something that in painting i 've never seen
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 488.64 496.5 <NA> done i 've never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns <unk> which are
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 496.46 499.81 <NA> so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 500.49 503.35 <NA> <unk> is that a literal part of the image or is my eye
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 503.12 509.57 <NA> making that interference pattern is my eye completing that interference pattern ts it is the paint actually
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 509.33 511 <NA> <unk> makes it real <unk> 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 511 520.84 <NA> it 's really manifested there if i throw a very concentric circle or concentric ellipse <unk> it just dutifully makes these
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 520.35 524.93 <NA> evenly spaced lines <unk> which get closer and closer together <unk> 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 525 534.98 <NA> which describes how gravity works there 's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that that i really enjoy and i love the shapes
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 534.52 537.74 <NA> that i see in in scientific
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 538.15 544.43 <NA> observations and apparatus especially astronomical forms
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 544.43 550.14 <NA> and the idea of the vastness of it the scale is very interesting to me
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 551.93 560.13 <NA> <unk> in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology <unk> some of these paintings when you look at them very close <unk> 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 559.91 564.6 <NA> odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 564.71 574.53 <NA> crocodiles <unk> elephants there are lots of things that appear when you look into it it 's sort of like looking at cloud patterns but sometimes they 're very modeled and
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 575.76 582.88 <NA> <unk> and then there are all these forms that we don 't know what they are but they 're equally <unk> well resolved and complex <unk> 
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 582.39 587.59 <NA> so i think conceivably those could be predictive <unk> because since
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 587.1 589.84 <NA> it has the ability to make
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 589.56 594.46 <NA> forms that look like forms that we 're familiar with in biology
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 593.97 600.23 <NA> it 's also making other forms that we 're not familiar with and maybe it 's the kind of forms we 'll discover underneath
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 613.24 623.03 <NA> <unk> at this stage in your life <unk> you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 622.93 629.49 <NA> i suppose it 's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your parkinson 's and this creative force that
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 629.86 637.8 <NA> both the the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life <unk> is that <unk>
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 638.92 646.99 <NA> as it turns out this device kind of comes in handy because i don 't have to have the the fine motor skills
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 646.99 650.14 <NA> to do that i can operate slides which is
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 650.34 656.38 <NA> <unk> more of a mental process <unk> i 'm looking at it and making decisions it needs more red it needs
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 655.92 661.78 <NA> more blue it needs a different shape and so i make these creative decisions
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 662.22 669.05 <NA> and can execute them in a much much simpler way <unk> i mean i 've got the symptoms
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 669.05 675.11 <NA> i guess parkinson 's kind of creeps up over the years but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 677.53 687.51 <NA> <unk> my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also <unk> i 'm left handed and so i i draw all my

TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 703.19 710.98 <NA> i couldn 't get the pencil to stand still jh so you 're not a gatekeeper for these forces you don 't think of yourself as the
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 710.98 716.88 <NA> master of these forces you think of yourself as the servant ts nature is
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 716.48 719.16 <NA> well it 's a godsend <unk> it just
TomShannon_2009S 1 TomShannon_2009S 718.73 726.49 <NA> has so much in it and i think nature wants wants to express itself in the sense that
