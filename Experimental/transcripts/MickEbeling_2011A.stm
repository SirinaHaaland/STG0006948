MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 12.73 19.91 <NA> <unk> i have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects but the coolest i ever worked on
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 19.63 25.02 <NA> was around this guy this guy 's name is tempt tempt was one of the foremost graffiti
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 26.6 32.43 <NA> <unk> and he came up home from a run one day and said dad my legs are tingling and that was the onset of als 
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 31.94 37.23 <NA> so tempt is now completely paralyzed he only has use of his eyes 
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 37.23 46.44 <NA> i was exposed to him i have a company that does design and animation so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of of what we admire and respect in the art world 
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 46.16 53.89 <NA> and so we decided that we were going to sponsor tony tempt <unk> and his cause so i went and met with his brother and father and said
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 54.93 64.04 <NA> <unk> this money what are you going to do with it and his brother said i just want to be able to talk to tony again <unk> i just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me 
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 64.04 70.9 <NA> and i said wait a second isn 't that i 've seen stephen hawking don 't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices 
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 70.53 74.99 <NA> and he said no unless you 're in the upper echelon and
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 82.42 90.68 <NA> <unk> everyone seen the movie the diving bell and the butterfly that 's how they communicate so run their finger along i said that 's archaic how can that be 
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 90.19 95.09 <NA> so i showed up with the desire to just write a check 
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 95.02 100.1 <NA> and instead i wrote a check that i had no freaking idea how i was going to cash
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 103.61 106.52 <NA> <unk> here 's the deal <unk> tony 's going to speak we 're going to get him a machine 
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 106.53 114.45 <NA> and we 're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again because it 's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn 't able to communicate it 
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 114.08 126.18 <NA> so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that i met these guys called grl graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then with a laser pointer 
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 126.18 129.91 <NA> draw on it and it just registers the negative space so they go around and
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 130.04 138.37 <NA> art installations like this all the things that go up there they said there 's a life cycle first it starts with the sexual organs then it starts with
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 138.39 141.16 <NA> cuss words then it was bush
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 141.16 149.93 <NA> slanders and then people actually got to art but there was always a life cycle to their presentations so i went home and was having dinner with my wife and and was telling her about
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 151.26 160.82 <NA> if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things why don 't we figure out a way for tempt to control a laser and he could do graf again well that would be awesome 
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 160.82 163.88 <NA> so that started the journey <unk> and about
MickEbeling_2011A 1 MickEbeling_2011A 163.63 178.22 <NA> two years later about a year later after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around we 'd accomplished a couple things one we battered down the doors of the insurance companies <unk> and we actually got tempt a machine that let him communicate
