PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 962.84 967.43 <NA> so i had to actually give a presentation to to
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 966.98 973.04 <NA> a city council and neighborhood constituents and i went to pittsburgh and i said you
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 973.04 979.16 <NA> know really what you have here are all these underpasses that separate the neighborhood from the center of town
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 980.05 988.43 <NA> <unk> don 't you celebrate them and make the underpasses landmarks so i began doing this crazy presentation of these installations
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 988.06 991.13 <NA> potential installations on
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 990.73 998.67 <NA> these underpass bridges and stood up in front of the city council and was a little bit scared <unk> i have to admit <unk> 
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 998.67 1004.97 <NA> but i was so utterly unqualified for this project and so utterly ridiculous
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1005.1 1007.25 <NA> and ignored the brief
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1006.91 1013.29 <NA> so desperately that i think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness just
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1013.29 1018.95 <NA> completely because it was so goofy to begin with and this is the bridge they 're actually
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1018.52 1024.96 <NA> painting up and preparing as we speak it will change every six months and it will become an art installation in the north side of
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1025.94 1030.82 <NA> <unk> and it will probably become a landmark in the area <unk> john hockenberry told you

PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1031.78 1034.26 <NA> my travail with citibank
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1034.16 1045.36 <NA> <unk> that is now a 10 year relationship and i still work with them and i actually am amused by them and like them and think that as a very very very very very big corporation they actually
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1044.87 1054.88 <NA> keep their graphics very nice <unk> i drew the logo for citibank on a napkin in the first meeting that was the play part of the job <unk> and then i spent
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1054.87 1064.99 <NA> <unk> year going to long tedious <unk> boring meetings <unk> trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the to the point <unk>
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1064.89 1075.02 <NA> <unk> of tears i thought i was going to go crazy at the end of this year we made idiotic presentations showing how the citi logo made sense and how it was really derived from an umbrella and we made
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1075 1080.15 <NA> <unk> animations of these things and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1079.66 1087.47 <NA> it was worth it because they bought this thing and it played out on such a grand scale and it 's so internationally recognizable <unk> 
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1087.16 1099.93 <NA> but for me it was actually a very very depressing year as a matter of fact they actually never bought onto the logo until fallon put it on its very good live richly campaign and then everybody accepted it all
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1102.02 1110.05 <NA> <unk> during this time i needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy crazy existence of going to these long idiotic meetings <unk> 
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1109.87 1120.42 <NA> and i was up in my country house and for some reason i began painting these very big very involved laborious complicated maps <unk>

PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1165.76 1174.42 <NA> one of my favorites was this painting i did of florida after the two thousand election that has the election results rolling around in

PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1206.49 1219.16 <NA> this is a print from the united states which we did in red white and blue we began doing these big silkscreen prints <unk> and they started selling too so the gallery wanted me to have another show in two years 
PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1219.57 1229.94 <NA> which meant that i really had to paint these paintings much faster than i had ever done them and i they started to become more political and i

PaulaScher_2008P 1 PaulaScher_2008P 1250.28 1258 <NA> <unk> these things so while they became successful i know how to make them so i 'm not a neophyte <unk>
