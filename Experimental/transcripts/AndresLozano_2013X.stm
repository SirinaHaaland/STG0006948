AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 12.85 15.45 <NA> <unk> one of the things i want to establish right from the start is that
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 15.45 23.3 <NA> not all neurosurgeons wear cowboy boots i just wanted you to know that so i am indeed a neurosurgeon <unk> and
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 22.99 25.26 <NA> i follow a long tradition
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 26.24 36.66 <NA> <unk> i 'm going to tell you about today is adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain being able to go anywhere in the brain and turning areas of the brain up or down to help our patients <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 36.2 41.79 <NA> so as i said <unk> neurosurgery comes from a long tradition it 's been around for about
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 41.48 50.17 <NA> seven thousand years in mesoamerica <unk> there used to be neurosurgery and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 51.27 57.25 <NA> <unk> and they were trying to they knew that the brain was involved in neurological and psychiatric disease they didn
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 57.25 60.97 <NA> 't know exactly what they were doing not much has changed by the way
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 62.99 70.69 <NA> they thought that if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease it must be because you are possessed by an evil spirit 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 70.32 75.08 <NA> so if you are possessed by an evil spirit causing neurologic or psychiatric problems
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 76 82.97 <NA> <unk> the way to treat this is of course to make a hole in your skull and let the evil spirit escape <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 82.93 86.4 <NA> so this was the thinking back then and
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 86.24 90.23 <NA> these individuals made these holes <unk> sometimes
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 90.1 100.05 <NA> the patients were a little bit reluctant to go through this because you can tell that the holes are made partially and then i think there was some trepanation and then they left very quickly and it was only a partial
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 101.51 113.52 <NA> <unk> they survived these procedures but this was common <unk> there were some sites where one percent of all the skulls have these holes and so you can see that neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common and it was also quite common
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 113.48 119.88 <NA> about seven thousand years ago <unk> now in the course of time we 've come to realize that
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 119.88 129.97 <NA> different parts of the brain do different things so there are areas of the brain that are dedicated to controlling your movement or your vision or your memory or your appetite <unk> and so on <unk> and when things
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 129.96 140.23 <NA> <unk> work well then the nervous system works well and everything functions but once in a while things don 't go so well and there 's trouble in these circuits and there are some rogue neurons <unk>
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 140.13 150.05 <NA> <unk> that are misfiring and causing trouble or sometimes they 're underactive and they 're not quite working as they should now the manifestation of this depends on where
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 150.04 158.37 <NA> <unk> in the brain these neurons are so when these neurons are in the motor circuit you get dysfunction in the movement system and you get things like parkinson 's disease <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 158.37 170.78 <NA> when the malfunction is in a circuit that regulates your mood you get things like depression and when it is in a circuit that controls your memory and cognitive function then you get things like alzheimer 's disease <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 170.38 174.99 <NA> so what we 've been able to do is to pinpoint where these disturbances are in the
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 175.55 185.67 <NA> <unk> and we 've been able to intervene within these circuits in the brain to either turn them up or turn them down so this is very much like choosing the correct station on the radio <unk>
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 185.57 200.77 <NA> <unk> dial once you choose the right station whether it be jazz or opera in our case whether it be movement or mood we can put the dial there and then we can use a second button to adjust the volume to turn it up or turn it down <unk> so what i 'm going to tell you about is using
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 205.02 215.44 <NA> <unk> up and down to see if we can help our patients <unk> and this is accomplished using this kind of device <unk> and this is called deep brain stimulation <unk> so what we 're doing is placing these electrodes throughout the brain <unk>
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 215.39 229.25 <NA> again we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime putting an electrode in and then this electrode is completely underneath the skin down to a pacemaker in the chest and with a remote control very much like a
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 229.99 238.25 <NA> <unk> control we can adjust how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain we can turn it up or down on or off 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 238.25 250.37 <NA> now about a hundred thousand patients in the world have received deep brain stimulation <unk> and i 'm going to show you some examples of using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement <unk> disorders of mood and disorders of cognition <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 251.11 254.94 <NA> so this looks something like this when it 's in the brain you see the electrode going
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 254.9 266.31 <NA> <unk> through the skull into the brain and resting there and we can place this really anywhere in the brain i tell my friends that no neuron is safe from a neurosurgeon because we can really reach just about anywhere in the brain quite safely now 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 266.99 275.05 <NA> now the first example i 'm going to show you is a patient with parkinson 's disease and this lady has parkinson 's disease and she has these electrodes in her brain
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 275.19 284.29 <NA> <unk> and i 'm going to show you what she 's like when the electrodes are turned off and she has her parkinson 's symptoms and then we 're going to turn it on <unk> so this looks something like this the electrodes are
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 284.85 287.33 <NA> turned off now and you can see that she has tremor
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 305.82 312.86 <NA> <unk> and this works like that <unk> instantly <unk> and the difference between shaking in this way and not 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 317.02 325.08 <NA> the difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior of twenty five thousand neurons in her subthalamic nucleus
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 325.46 338.77 <NA> <unk> so we now know how to find these troublemakers and tell them gentlemen that 's enough we want you to stop doing that and we do that with electricity so we use electricity to dictate how they fire <unk> and we try to block their misbehavior using electricity <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 338.53 342.49 <NA> so in this case we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 342.49 349.23 <NA> we started using this technique in other problems and i 'm going to tell you about a fascinating problem that we encountered a case of dystonia <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 350.58 361.64 <NA> <unk> is a disorder affecting children it 's a genetic disorder and it involves a twisting motion and these children get progressively more and more twisting until they can 't breathe until they get sores <unk> urinary infections and then they die <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 361.64 368.95 <NA> so back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven i was asked to see this young boy <unk> perfectly normal he has this genetic form of dystonia <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 368.49 372.7 <NA> there are eight children in the family <unk> five of them have dystonia <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 373.53 375.02 <NA> so here he is
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 375.88 384.33 <NA> <unk> this boy is nine years old <unk> perfectly normal until the age six <unk> and then he started twisting his body <unk> first the right foot then the
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 384.33 388.04 <NA> left foot <unk> then the right arm <unk> then the left arm <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 388.06 397.76 <NA> then the trunk <unk> and then by the time he arrived within the course of one or two years of the disease onset he could no longer walk he could no longer stand he was crippled <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 397.76 404.97 <NA> and indeed the natural progression as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted progressively disabled and many of these children
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 404.96 406.35 <NA> <unk> do not survive
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 408.5 414.63 <NA> so he is one of five kids the only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 414.47 422.55 <NA> he did not respond to any drugs we did not know what to do with this boy <unk> we did not know what operation to do where to go in the brain 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 422.15 429.94 <NA> but on the basis of our results in parkinson 's disease we reasoned why don 't we try to suppress the same area in the brain that we
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 429.9 431.32 <NA> <unk> suppressed in
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 431.12 439.15 <NA> parkinson 's disease and let 's see what happens <unk> so here he was we operated on him hoping that he would get better <unk> we did not know 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 439.8 446.39 <NA> so here he is now back in israel where he lives three months after the procedure <unk> and here he is
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 457.18 464.84 <NA> <unk> on the basis of this result this is now a procedure that 's done throughout the world and there have been hundreds of children that have been helped with this kind of surgery <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 465.46 468.05 <NA> this boy is now in university
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 467.62 477.24 <NA> and leads quite a normal life this has been one of the most satisfying cases that i have ever done in my entire career to restore movement and walking to this kind of
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 484.07 487.32 <NA> we realized that perhaps we could use this technology not <unk>
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 487.22 494.85 <NA> <unk> only in circuits that control your movement but also circuits that control other things and the next thing that we took on was circuits that control your mood 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 504.66 517.99 <NA> <unk> electroconvulsive therapy <unk> but there are millions of people <unk> and there are still ten or twenty percent of patients with depression that do not respond and it is these patients that we want to help and let 's see if we can use this technique to help these patients with depression <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 517.86 525.17 <NA> so the first thing we did was we compared what 's different in the brain of someone with depression and someone who is normal <unk> and what we did was pet scans
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 525.16 531.03 <NA> <unk> look at the blood flow of the brain and what we noticed is that in patients with depression compared to normals 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 530.82 541.19 <NA> areas of the brain are shut down and those are the areas in blue <unk> so here you really have the blues <unk> and the areas in blue are areas that are involved in motivation in drive <unk>
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 541.09 547.55 <NA> <unk> and decision making and indeed if you 're severely depressed as these patients were those are impaired you lack motivation and drive 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 554.12 565.32 <NA> <unk> is the sadness center of the brain if i make any of you sad for example i make you remember the last time you saw your parent before they died or a friend before they died this area of the brain lights up it is the sadness center of the brain <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 565.32 573.46 <NA> and so patients with depression have hyperactivity the area of the brain for sadness is on red hot <unk> the thermostat is set at one hundred degrees <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 573.24 575.02 <NA> and the other areas of the brain involved in
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 575.67 585.91 <NA> <unk> are shut down <unk> so we wondered can we place electrodes in this area of sadness and see if we can turn down the thermostat can we turn down the activity <unk> and what will be the consequence of that <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 585.57 599.96 <NA> so we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression this is work done with my colleague helen mayberg from emory <unk> and we placed electrodes in area twenty five and in the top scan you see before the operation area twenty five the sadness area is red hot <unk> and the frontal lobes are shut down in
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 600.58 610.1 <NA> <unk> and then after three months of continuous stimulation twenty four hours a day or six months of continuous stimulation <unk> we have a complete reversal of this we 're able to drive down area twenty five 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 610.1 619.88 <NA> down to a more normal level <unk> and we 're able to turn back online the frontal lobes of the brain <unk> and indeed we 're seeing very striking results in these patients with severe depression <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 619.84 629.28 <NA> so now we are in clinical trials and are in phase iii clinical trials <unk> and this may become a new procedure if it 's safe and we find that it 's effective to treat patients with severe depression
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 631.58 635.38 <NA> i 've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation to
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 635.2 643.3 <NA> treat the motor system in cases of parkinson 's disease and dystonia <unk> i 've shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit in cases of depression <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 643.3 647.67 <NA> can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 648.29 651.22 <NA> laughter anybody interested in that
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 655.08 664.72 <NA> <unk> we can right so what we 've decided to do is we 're going to try to turbocharge the memory circuits in the brain we
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 664.29 673.03 <NA> 're going to place electrodes within the circuits that regulate your memory and cognitive function to see if we can turn up their activity <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 673.03 674.78 <NA> now we 're not going to do this in normal
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 675.52 688.37 <NA> <unk> 're going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits <unk> and we 've chosen to treat patients with alzheimer 's disease who have cognitive and memory deficits as you know this is the main symptom of early onset alzheimer 's disease <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 688.17 698.66 <NA> so we 've placed electrodes within this circuit in an area of the brain called the fornix <unk> which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory <unk>
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 698.56 703.89 <NA> <unk> circuit <unk> and whether that can in turn help these patients with alzheimer 's disease
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 705.01 715.14 <NA> it turns out that in alzheimer 's disease <unk> there 's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain <unk> the brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose it uses twenty <unk>
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 715.04 723.85 <NA> <unk> percent of all your even though it only weighs two percent it uses ten times more glucose than it should based on its weight twenty percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 729.87 735.59 <NA> <unk> alzheimer 's disease <unk> then there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose they shut down they turn off 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 735.59 744.49 <NA> and indeed what we see is that these areas in red around the outside ribbon of the brain are progressively getting more and more blue until they shut down completely 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 744.99 754.73 <NA> this is analogous to having a power failure in an area of the brain a regional power failure so the lights are out in parts of the brain in patients with alzheimer 's disease
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 754.93 763.26 <NA> <unk> and the question is are the lights out forever or can we turn the lights back on can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 763.26 772.4 <NA> so this is what we did we implanted electrodes in the fornix of patients with alzheimer 's disease we turned it on <unk> and we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 772.06 775.02 <NA> and indeed at the top you 'll see before the surgery
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 775.13 785.03 <NA> <unk> the areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal predominantly the parietal and temporal lobes these areas of the brain are shut down the lights are out in these areas of the brain <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 784.87 795.21 <NA> we then put in the dbs electrodes and we wait for a month or a year and the areas in red represent the areas where we increase glucose utilization and indeed we are able to get these areas of the brain <unk>
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 795.16 804.97 <NA> that were not using glucose to use glucose once again <unk> so the message here is that in alzheimer 's disease <unk> the lights are out but there is someone home <unk> and we 're able to turn the power back
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 804.99 810.64 <NA> <unk> on to these areas of the brain <unk> and as we do so we expect that their functions will return <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 810.39 821.12 <NA> so this is now in clinical trials <unk> we are going to operate on fifty patients with early alzheimer 's disease to see whether this is safe and effective whether we can improve their neurologic function
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 829.96 838.85 <NA> <unk> message i want to leave you with today is that <unk> indeed <unk> there are several circuits in the brain that are malfunctioning across various disease states 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 838.85 850.08 <NA> whether we 're talking about parkinson 's disease <unk> depression schizophrenia alzheimer 's <unk> we are now learning to understand what are the circuits what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for the clinical
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 850 861.24 <NA> signs and the symptoms of those diseases we can now reach those circuits <unk> we can introduce electrodes within those circuits <unk> we can graduate the activity of those circuits we can turn them
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 860.84 873.45 <NA> down if they are overactive if they 're causing trouble trouble that is felt throughout the brain or we can turn them up if they are underperforming <unk> and in so doing <unk> we think that we may be able to help the overall function of the brain <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 873.11 875.08 <NA> the implications of this of course
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 875.04 887.14 <NA> <unk> is that we may be able to modify the symptoms of the disease but i haven 't told you but there 's also some evidence that we might be able to help the repair of damaged areas of the brain using electricity <unk> and this is something for the future to see if indeed 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 886.65 892.15 <NA> we not only change the activity but also some of the reparative functions of the brain can be harvested <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 892.15 897.92 <NA> so i envision that we 're going to see a great expansion of indications of this technique we
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 897.71 904.19 <NA> 're going to see electrodes being placed for many disorders of the brain <unk> one of the most exciting things about this is that indeed it involves
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 905.14 913.36 <NA> <unk> work it involves the work of engineers of imaging scientists of basic scientists of neurologists psychiatrists neurosurgeons and certainly at the interface
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 913.2 916.26 <NA> of these multiple disciplines that there 's the excitement <unk> 
AndresLozano_2013X 1 AndresLozano_2013X 916.26 928.44 <NA> and i think that we will see that we will be able to chase more of these evil spirits out from the brain as time goes on <unk> and the consequence of that of course will be that we will be able to help many more patients
