RachelSussman_2010G 1 RachelSussman_2010G 241.71 254.73 <NA> so i 'm not sure if there are any in this photo but i do know the fungus is down there <unk> and then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree <unk> so that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood
RachelSussman_2010G 1 RachelSussman_2010G 255.14 265.33 <NA> <unk> is the mycelial felt of the fungus <unk> and what it 's doing it 's actually slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients <unk>

RachelSussman_2010G 1 RachelSussman_2010G 500 513.32 <NA> <unk> names carved into its trunk <unk> but it also records some natural events <unk> so the baobabs as they get older tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out and this can create great natural shelters for animals
