ElizabethMurchison_2011G 1 ElizabethMurchison_2011G 400 408.15 <NA> studying the tasmanian devil cancer 's dna this was work from many people but i 'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that i did a few years ago the

ElizabethMurchison_2011G 1 ElizabethMurchison_2011G 449.71 451.94 <NA> were as different from each other
ElizabethMurchison_2011G 1 ElizabethMurchison_2011G 451.7 454.13 <NA> as you and the person sitting next to you

ElizabethMurchison_2011G 1 ElizabethMurchison_2011G 472.33 479.91 <NA> so how come a tumor that that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on jonas ' face
ElizabethMurchison_2011G 1 ElizabethMurchison_2011G 479.92 486.73 <NA> well the next breakthrough came from studying hundreds of tasmanian devil cancers from all around tasmania <unk>

ElizabethMurchison_2011G 1 ElizabethMurchison_2011G 533.62 545.33 <NA> this tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer it 's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it it spreads through the population has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system
