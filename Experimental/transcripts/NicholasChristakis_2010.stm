NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 13.93 24.14 <NA> <unk> this story begins about fifteen years ago when i was a hospice doctor at the university of chicago <unk> and i was taking care of people who were dying and their families in the south side of chicago <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 24.09 29.4 <NA> <unk> and i was observing what happened to people and their families over the course of their terminal illness
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 29.93 42.77 <NA> <unk> in my lab i was studying the widower effect which is a very old idea in the social sciences going back one hundred and fifty years known as dying of a broken heart so when i die my wife 's risk of death can double for instance in the first year <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 42.77 49.81 <NA> and i had gone to take care of one particular patient a woman who was dying of dementia <unk> and in this case <unk> unlike this
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 50.4 57.34 <NA> <unk> she was being cared for by her daughter and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 57.21 60.79 <NA> and the daughter 's husband he also

NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 63.87 72.83 <NA> and i was driving home one day and i get a phone call from the husband 's friend <unk> calling me because he was depressed about what was happening to his friend <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 72.83 79.97 <NA> so here i get this call from this random guy that 's having an experience that 's being influenced by people at some social distance
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 80.19 92.3 <NA> and so i suddenly realized two very simple things first the widowhood effect was not restricted to husbands and wives <unk> and second it was not restricted to pairs of people 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 92.29 104.67 <NA> and i started to see the world in a whole new way like pairs of people connected to each other <unk> and then i realized that these individuals would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby and
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 104.84 114.94 <NA> <unk> fact these people were embedded in other sorts of relationships marriage and spousal and friendship and other sorts of ties and that in fact these connections were vast
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 114.89 124.99 <NA> <unk> and that we were all embedded in this broad set of connections with each other so i started to see the world in a completely new way and i became obsessed with this <unk> i
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 125 130.78 <NA> became obsessed with how it might be that we 're embedded in these social networks and how they affect our lives <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 130.58 140.83 <NA> so <unk> social networks are these intricate things of beauty and they 're so elaborate and so complex and so ubiquitous in fact that one has to ask what purpose they serve <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 140.78 147.58 <NA> <unk> why are we embedded in social networks <unk> i mean how do they form how do they operate and how do they effect us <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 153.97 167.87 <NA> <unk> it had become trendy to speak about the obesity epidemic and <unk> along with my collaborator james fowler we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic and could it spread from person to person like the four people i discussed earlier <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 167.92 175.02 <NA> so this is a slide of some of our initial results it 's two thousand two hundred people in the year two thousand every dot is a person
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 175.16 180.67 <NA> <unk> we make the dot size proportional to people 's body size <unk> so bigger dots are bigger people
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 180.46 188.45 <NA> in addition if your body size if your bmi your body mass index is above thirty if you 're clinically obese we also colored the dots yellow 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 188.46 200.02 <NA> so if you look at this image right away you might be able to see that there are clusters of obese and non obese people in the image <unk> but the visual complexity is still very high it 's not obvious exactly what
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 201 214 <NA> <unk> in addition some questions are immediately raised how much clustering is there is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone how big are the clusters how far do they reach and most importantly what causes the clusters <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 213.87 225.05 <NA> so we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters this here shows on the y axis the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and on the x axis
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 225 235.16 <NA> <unk> the degrees of separation between the two people on the far left you see the purple line it says that if your friends are obese your risk of obesity is forty five percent higher <unk> and the next bar over the <unk>

NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 256.61 269.22 <NA> well <unk> what might be causing this clustering there are at least three possibilities one possibility is that as i gain weight <unk> it causes you to gain weight a kind of induction a kind of spread from person to person 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 268.88 278.07 <NA> another possibility very obvious is homophily or birds of a feather flock together here i form my tie to you because you and i share a similar body size 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 277.76 279.82 <NA> and the last possibility is what is known as
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 279.75 289.93 <NA> <unk> confounding because it confounds our ability to figure out what 's going on and here the idea is not that my weight gain is causing your weight gain nor that i preferentially form a tie with you because you and i <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 289.83 299.03 <NA> <unk> share the same body size <unk> but rather that we share a common exposure to something like a health club that makes us both lose weight at the same time
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 300 311.03 <NA> we found evidence for all of these things <unk> including for induction <unk> and we found that if your friend becomes obese <unk> it increases your risk of obesity by about fifty seven percent in the same given time period
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 310.72 324.29 <NA> there can be many mechanisms for this effect one possibility is that your friends say to you something like you know they adopt a behavior that spreads to you like they say let 's go have muffins and beer which is a terrible combination 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 326.21 330.06 <NA> <unk> you adopt that combination and then you start gaining weight like them
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 329.69 343.57 <NA> another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is here what 's spreading from person to person is not a behavior <unk> but rather a norm an idea is spreading <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 343.57 349.93 <NA> now <unk> headline writers had a field day with our studies <unk> i think the headline in the new york times was

NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 354.99 361.3 <NA> <unk> is that the european headline writers had a different take they said are your friends gaining weight <unk> perhaps you are to blame 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 365.64 370.29 <NA> and we thought this was a very interesting comment on america and a kind of self serving 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 370.29 379.97 <NA> not my responsibility kind of phenomenon now i want to be very clear we do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all

NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 382.09 386.06 <NA> our next questions was could we actually visualize this spread 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 385.66 390.5 <NA> was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 390.5 400.02 <NA> and this was complicated because we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure the architecture of the ties was changing across time in addition because obesity is not
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 402.08 412.23 <NA> <unk> a patient zero of the obesity epidemic if we find that guy there was a spread of obesity out from him it 's a multicentric epidemic <unk> lots of people are doing things at the same time and i 'm about to show <unk>

NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 440.16 450.14 <NA> <unk> lot of complexity a lot is happening just in this 30 year period that includes the obesity epidemic and by the end you 're going to see clusters of obese and non obese individuals within
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 455.83 457.67 <NA> <unk> changed the way i see things 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 457.33 471.81 <NA> because this thing this network that 's changing across time it has a memory <unk> it moves things flow within it it has a kind of consistency people can die but it doesn 't die it still
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 471.65 474.99 <NA> persists and it has a kind of resilience
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 475 482.19 <NA> <unk> that allows it to persist across time and so i came to see these kinds of social networks as living things 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 482 488.4 <NA> as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope to study and analyze and understand <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 487.91 500.5 <NA> and we used a variety of techniques to do this <unk> and we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena we looked at smoking and drinking behavior <unk> and voting behavior <unk> and divorce which can spread and altruism 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 500.5 503.67 <NA> and eventually we became interested in emotions 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 503.63 504.94 <NA> now
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 505.53 509.17 <NA> when we have emotions <unk> we show them <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 508.86 511.33 <NA> why do we show our emotions <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 510.87 521.23 <NA> i mean there would be an advantage to experiencing our emotions inside you know anger or happiness <unk> but we don 't just experience them we show them and not only do we show them <unk> but others can read them and not only can <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 521.13 527.83 <NA> <unk> they read them <unk> but they copy them <unk> there 's emotional contagion that takes place in human populations <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 529.81 535.27 <NA> <unk> suggests that in addition to any other purpose they serve <unk> they 're a kind of primitive form of communication 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 535.28 544.46 <NA> and that in fact if we really want to understand human emotions <unk> we need to think about them in this way now we 're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way in simple <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 544.03 550.14 <NA> sort of brief periods of time so for example <unk> i was giving this talk recently in new york city
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 551.39 560.55 <NA> <unk> when you 're on the subway and the other person across the subway car smiles at you and you just instinctively smile back and they looked at me and said we don 't do that in new york city 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 561.14 565.35 <NA> and i said everywhere else in the world that 's normal human behavior 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 565.13 574.81 <NA> and so there 's a very instinctive way in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other <unk> and in fact emotional contagion can be broader still like we could have punctuated
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 576.12 582.8 <NA> <unk> as in riots <unk> the question that we wanted to ask was could emotion spread in a more sustained way
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 582.56 593.05 <NA> than riots across time and involve large numbers of people not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car <unk> maybe there 's a kind of below the surface quiet <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 592.95 599.93 <NA> <unk> riot that animates us all the time <unk> maybe there are emotional stampedes that ripple through social networks <unk> maybe in
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 600.19 610.31 <NA> <unk> emotions have a collective existence not just an individual existence <unk> and this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon <unk> again a social network but now we color the people <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 610.21 620.42 <NA> <unk> yellow if they 're happy and blue if they 're sad and green in between and if you look at this image you can right away see clusters of happy and unhappy people again spreading to three degrees <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 620.32 629.82 <NA> <unk> of separation and you might form the intuition that the unhappy people occupy a different structural location within the network there 's a middle and an edge to this
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 629.75 634.1 <NA> <unk> network and the unhappy people seem to be located at the edges <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 633.94 644.31 <NA> so to invoke another metaphor if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity i 'm connected to you and you to her on out endlessly into the distance this <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 644.21 650.26 <NA> <unk> fabric is actually like an old fashioned american quilt <unk> and it has patches on it happy and unhappy patches
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 650.37 656.41 <NA> <unk> and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 656.37 658.3 <NA> so 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 658.08 668.41 <NA> this work with emotions which are so fundamental then got us to thinking about maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 668.36 675.02 <NA> <unk> because human social networks whenever they are mapped always kind of look like this <unk> the picture of the network <unk> but
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 675 682.94 <NA> <unk> they never look like this <unk> why do they not look like this <unk> why don 't we form human social networks that look like a regular lattice <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 683.02 696.89 <NA> well <unk> the striking patterns of human social networks <unk> their ubiquity and their apparent purpose beg questions about whether we evolved to have human social networks in the first place <unk> and whether we evolved to form networks with a particular structure <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 696.64 699.96 <NA> and notice first of all so to understand this though we need to dissect
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 700 707.43 <NA> <unk> network structure a little bit first and notice that every person in this network has exactly the same structural location as every other person <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 706.94 709.8 <NA> but that 's not the case with real networks 
NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 709.6 719.97 <NA> so for example here is a real network of college students at an elite northeastern university and now i 'm highlighting a few dots if you look here at the dots <unk> compare node b in <unk>

NicholasChristakis_2010 1 NicholasChristakis_2010 829.9 838.27 <NA> <unk> think the reason for this is that some people like to introduce their friends to each other you know who you are and others of you keep them apart and don 't introduce your friends to each other <unk>
