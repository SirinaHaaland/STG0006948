ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 26.63 35.13 <NA> that 's in part because it requires technicians and experts to apply these clunky belts on her to monitor her uterine contractions 
ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 35.03 38.79 <NA> another reason jane is not so happy
ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 38.48 47.01 <NA> is because she 's worried in particular she 's worried about what happens after her 10 day stay on bed rest at the hospital

ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 308.68 316.55 <NA> in many digital health discussions people believe in and embrace the idea that we can simply digitize the data

ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 334.82 343.77 <NA> what that means is we have to be mindful about her data plan and how much it would cost for her to be sending out a continuous stream of data 
ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 343.85 349.05 <NA> there 's another challenge that not everyone in the medical profession is comfortable talking about 
ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 348.89 353.97 <NA> and that is that jane does not have the most trust in the medical establishment

ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 364.92 373.93 <NA> that means that we have to be mindful of questions of privacy jane might not feel that happy about all that data being processed into the cloud <unk> 
ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 374.19 375.71 <NA> and jane
ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 375.54 379.85 <NA> cannot be fooled she reads the news she knows that if the

ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 386.47 390.17 <NA> and so with that in mind <unk> we had an epiphany 
ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 390.31 396.47 <NA> we cannot outsmart all the hackers in the world <unk> but perhaps we can present them a smaller target <unk> 
ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 396.46 404.1 <NA> what if we could actually <unk> rather than have those algorithms that do data interpretation run in the cloud

ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 479.93 482.1 <NA> <unk> do is to think about ways to have

ToddColeman_2015P 1 ToddColeman_2015P 500.96 504.64 <NA> another thing we have going for us is that insurance companies
