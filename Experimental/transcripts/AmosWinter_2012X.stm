AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 29.72 41.85 <NA> if you 're crossing the street you have sidewalk cutouts and if you have to travel some distance farther than you can do under your own power there 's accessible vehicles and if you can 't afford one of those there 's accessible public transportation
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 41.63 44.37 <NA> but in the developing world things are quite different
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 44.17 48.13 <NA> there 's forty million people who need a wheelchair but don 't have one
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 48.13 54.79 <NA> and the majority of these people live in rural areas where the only connections to community to employment to education
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 54.96 66.85 <NA> <unk> are by traveling long distances on rough terrain often under their own power and the devices usually available to these people are not made for that context break down quickly and are hard to repair
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 66.96 79.73 <NA> i started looking at wheelchairs in developing countries in two thousand and five when i spent the summer assessing the state of technology in tanzania and i talked to wheelchair users wheelchair manufacturers disability groups
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 80.08 90.47 <NA> <unk> and what stood out to me is that there wasn 't a device available that was designed for rural areas that could go fast and efficiently on many types of terrain so being a mechanical <unk>
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 90.37 96.17 <NA> <unk> engineer being at mit and having lots of resources available to me i thought i 'd try to do something about it
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 105.79 116.04 <NA> and you can shift to a low gear if you have to climb a hill or go through mud or sand and you get a lot of torque but a low speed and if you want to go faster say on pavement you can shift to a high gear <unk>
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 115.99 130 <NA> and you get less torque but higher speeds so the logical evolution here is to just make a wheelchair with mountain bike components which many people have done but these are two products available in the u s that would be difficult to transfer into developing countries
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 130.19 139.09 <NA> because they 're much much too expensive and the context i 'm talking about is where you need to have a product that is less than two hundred dollars
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 138.63 148.99 <NA> and this ideal product would also be able to go about five kilometers a day so you could get to your job get to school and do it on many many different types of terrain but when you get home or want <unk>
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 148.89 155 <NA> <unk> to go indoors at your work it 's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside and furthermore
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 155.22 163.91 <NA> if you want it to last a long time out in rural areas it has to be repairable using the local tools materials and knowledge in those contexts
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 165.04 177.88 <NA> so the real crux of the problem here is how do you make a system that 's a simple device but gives you a large mechanical advantage how do you make a mountain bike for your arms that doesn 't have the mountain bike cost and complexity
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 177.88 179.79 <NA> so as is the case with simple
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 179.75 188.28 <NA> <unk> solutions oftentimes the answer is right in front of your face and for us it was levers we use levers all the time in tools doorknobs bicycle parts
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 188.12 197.97 <NA> and that moment of inspiration that key invention moment was when i was sitting in front of my design notebook and i started thinking about somebody grabbing a lever and if they grab near the end <unk>
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 197.87 203.56 <NA> <unk> of the lever they can get an effectively long lever and produce a lot of torque as they push back and forth
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 204.87 207.85 <NA> <unk> gear and as they slide their hand down the lever
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 207.68 216.81 <NA> they can push with a smaller effective lever length but push through a bigger angle every stroke which makes a faster rotational speed and gives you an effective high gear
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 216.81 224.99 <NA> so what 's exciting about this system is that it 's really really mechanically simple and you could make it using technology that 's been around for hundreds of years
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 224.76 229.58 <NA> so seeing this in practice this is the leveraged freedom chair that after a few years of
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 230.35 240.14 <NA> we 're now going into production with and this is a full time wheelchair user he 's paralyzed in guatemala and you see he 's able to traverse pretty rough terrain
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 239.86 252 <NA> again the key innovation of this technology is that when he wants to go fast he just grabs the levers near the pivots and goes through a big angle every stroke and as the going gets tougher he just slides his hands up the levers
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 251.81 254.97 <NA> creates more torque and kind of bench presses his way out of trouble
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 254.93 258.66 <NA> <unk> through the rough terrain now the big important point here
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 258.35 260.55 <NA> is that the person
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 260.32 270.96 <NA> is the complex machine in this system it 's the person that 's sliding his hands up and down the levers so the mechanism itself can be very simple and composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere <unk>
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 270.86 280 <NA> <unk> in the world because those bicycle parts are so ubiquitously available they 're super cheap they 're made by the gazillions in china and india and we can source them anywhere in the world build
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 279.99 288.55 <NA> <unk> the chair anywhere and most importantly repair it even out in a village with a local bicycle mechanic who has local tools knowledge and parts available
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 289.14 292.36 <NA> now when you want to use the lfc indoors
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 291.9 296.86 <NA> all you have to do is pull the levers out of the drivetrain stow them in the frame
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 296.86 304.97 <NA> and it converts into a normal wheelchair that you can use just like any other normal wheelchair and we sized it like a normal wheelchair so it 's narrow enough to fit
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 304.9 306.56 <NA> <unk> through a standard doorway
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 307.21 310.28 <NA> it 's low enough to fit under a table
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 310.87 320.73 <NA> and it 's small and maneuverable enough to fit in a bathroom and this is important so the user can get up close to a toilet and be able to transfer off just like he could

AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 325.54 329.34 <NA> now there 's three important points that i want to stress that
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 329.9 332.19 <NA> <unk> think really hit home in this project
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 332.09 341.91 <NA> the first is that this product works well because we were effectively able to combine rigorous engineering science and analysis with user centered design <unk>
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 341.81 351.97 <NA> <unk> focused on the social and usage and economic factors important to wheelchair users in the developing countries so i 'm an academic at mit and i 'm a mechanical engineer so i can do things like
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 354.87 365.11 <NA> <unk> resistance it should impose look at the parts we have available and mix and match them to to figure out what sort of gear trains we can use and then look at the power and force you can get out of your upper body <unk>
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 365.06 373.31 <NA> to analyze how fast you should be able to go in this chair as you put your arms up and down the levers so as a wet behind the ears student excited
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 375.43 382.17 <NA> <unk> brought that prototype to tanzania kenya and vietnam in two thousand and eight and found it was terrible
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 381.99 392.31 <NA> because we didn 't get enough input from users so because we tested it with wheelchair users with wheelchair manufacturers we got that feedback from them not just articulating their problems
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 392.26 405 <NA> <unk> but articulating their solutions and worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design which we brought back to east africa in nine that worked a lot better than a normal wheelchair on rough terrain but it still didn 't work well indoors because it was too big
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 405.1 415.26 <NA> it was heavy it was hard to to move around so again with that user feedback we went back to the drawing board came up with a better design twenty pounds lighter as narrow as a regular wheelchair tested <unk>
AmosWinter_2012X 1 AmosWinter_2012X 415.16 421.98 <NA> <unk> that in a field trial in guatemala and that advanced the product to the point where we have now that it 's going into production
