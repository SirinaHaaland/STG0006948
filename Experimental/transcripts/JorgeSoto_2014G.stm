JorgeSoto_2014G 1 JorgeSoto_2014G 280.62 284.83 <NA> so micrornas are small molecules that regulate gene expression <unk> 
JorgeSoto_2014G 1 JorgeSoto_2014G 284.67 292.33 <NA> unlike dna which is mainly fixed micrornas can vary depending on internal and environmental conditions at any given time

JorgeSoto_2014G 1 JorgeSoto_2014G 338.3 346.77 <NA> however the problem with micrornas is that we cannot use existing dna based technology to detect them in a reliable way
