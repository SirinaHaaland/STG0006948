XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 12.49 20.12 <NA> <unk> my work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 19.81 29.16 <NA> where architecture grows from the natural local conditions and traditions <unk> today i brought two recent projects as an example of this
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 30.53 37.23 <NA> <unk> both projects are in emerging countries one in ethiopia and another one in tunisia <unk> and also they have in common
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 36.74 40.14 <NA> that the different analyses from different perspectives
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 39.91 43.92 <NA> becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 44.45 53.1 <NA> the first example started with an invitation to design a multistory shopping mall in ethiopia 's capital city addis ababa <unk> and this
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 52.61 54.97 <NA> is the type of building we were shown as
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 54.93 63.13 <NA> <unk> an example to my team and myself of what we had to design at first the first thing i thought was i want to run away 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 64.95 69.37 <NA> after seeing a few of these buildings there are many in the city
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 68.94 78.98 <NA> we realized that they have three very big points first these buildings they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 79.75 86.67 <NA> <unk> second they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside <unk> 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 86.67 92.43 <NA> and then you need a lot of cooling in a city where this shouldn 't happen because they have really mild weather
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 92.22 97.25 <NA> that ranges from twenty to twenty five degrees the whole year <unk> and third
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 96.76 99.99 <NA> is that their image has nothing to do with africa and
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 101.66 103.06 <NA> <unk> a pity in a place
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 102.85 106.08 <NA> that has such rich culture and traditions 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 106.34 114.09 <NA> also during our first visit to ethiopia i was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open air structure
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 113.69 121.88 <NA> where thousands of people they go and buy things every day from small vendors <unk> and also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 121.88 124.9 <NA> to create activity <unk> so i thought this is
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 128.97 138.27 <NA> <unk> but the question was how we could do a multistory contemporary building with these principles <unk> the next challenge was when we looked at the site that is in
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 138.28 141.73 <NA> a really growing area of the city where most of these buildings that <unk>
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 142.71 149.99 <NA> <unk> were not there <unk> and it 's also between two parallel streets that don 't have any connection for hundreds of meters <unk> so the first thing
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 150 159.2 <NA> we did was to create a connection between these two streets <unk> putting all the entrances of the building <unk> and this extends with an inclined atrium
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 158.95 164.39 <NA> that creates an open air space in the building that self protects itself with its own shape
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 164.02 166.04 <NA> from the sun and the rain 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 166.18 174.35 <NA> and around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops that change in each floor because of the shape of the void 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 174.43 179.61 <NA> i also thought how to close the building <unk> and i really wanted to find a solution that would
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 179.72 182.4 <NA> <unk> respond to the local climate conditions 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 182.27 190.02 <NA> and i started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 189.86 195.49 <NA> and also the light but in a filtered way <unk> and then the inspiration came from
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 195.3 204.97 <NA> these beautiful patterns of the ethiopian women 's dresses that they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade and we are building that with these
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 204.72 209 <NA> <unk> these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 209 216.94 <NA> and the light in a controlled way inside the building <unk> and this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 216.51 221.5 <NA> to light up the building at night with these ideas
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 221.25 225.02 <NA> it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 231.4 239.18 <NA> <unk> we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall because basically they had more shops to sell <unk> 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 238.78 241.74 <NA> and also that the idea of the facade
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 241.29 248.13 <NA> was much much cheaper not only because of the material compared with the glass but also because we didn 't need to have air conditioning anymore <unk> 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 248.13 252.35 <NA> so we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project <unk> 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 251.86 254.88 <NA> and the first implementation was to think about how we
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 255.02 264.93 <NA> <unk> make the building self sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day <unk> so we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof <unk> 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 264.56 267.07 <NA> and then under those panels
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 266.65 273.51 <NA> we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis <unk> 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 273.29 278.92 <NA> and these porches on the roof all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 280.11 288.11 <NA> <unk> hopefully by the beginning of next year because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction <unk> the second example is a master plan
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 287.87 295.54 <NA> of two thousand apartments and facilities in the city of tunis <unk> and for doing such a big project <unk> the biggest project i 've ever designed 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 295.29 299.56 <NA> i really needed to understand the city of tunis but also its surroundings
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 301.96 305.48 <NA> <unk> during that analysis i paid special attention to the medina that is this <unk>
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 306.55 315.81 <NA> <unk> structure that used to be closed by a wall <unk> opened by twelve different gates <unk> connected by almost straight lines <unk> when i went to the site <unk> the first
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 315.81 317.93 <NA> design operation we did
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 317.5 324.99 <NA> was to extend the existing streets <unk> creating twelve initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in barcelona
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 325.07 326.67 <NA> <unk> other cities in europe
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 326.3 330.84 <NA> with these courtyards on top of that we selected some strategic points
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 330.64 336.36 <NA> reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines <unk> and this modified this initial pattern <unk> 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 336.35 341.8 <NA> and the last operation was to think about the cell <unk> the small cell of the project like the apartment <unk> 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 341.8 347.26 <NA> as an essential part of the master plan <unk> and for that i thought what would be the best orientation
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 347.08 349.87 <NA> in the mediterranean climate for an apartment <unk> and it
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 350.52 354.04 <NA> <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 353.55 356.71 <NA> and then a natural ventilation 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 356.37 362.5 <NA> so we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction <unk> 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 362.5 372.77 <NA> and this is the result that is almost like a combination of the european block and the arab city it has these blocks with courtyards <unk> and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians <unk> 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 372.53 379.88 <NA> and also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor and
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 379.87 388.04 <NA> <unk> it also reinforces this idea of the gates <unk> the volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 388.04 399.84 <NA> and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood and in the courtyards there are the different facilities such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by a series of commercial [ spaces ] that bring activity to the ground floor
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 401.6 414.81 <NA> <unk> which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction and it 's where all the neighbors they can go up and socialize <unk> and do activities such as having a two kilometer run in the morning jumping from one building to another 
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 415.73 424.81 <NA> these two examples <unk> they have a common approach in the design process <unk> and also they are in emerging countries where you can see the
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 426.84 431.32 <NA> <unk> these cities the impact of architecture in people 's lives of today and tomorrow
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 431.32 440.84 <NA> changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow for this reason i see even more importance to look at architecture
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 440.63 444.13 <NA> finding simple but affordable solutions
XavierVilalta_2013G 1 XavierVilalta_2013G 443.67 452.99 <NA> that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people <unk> thank you very much
