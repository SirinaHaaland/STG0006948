WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 918.88 929.97 <NA> but what 's even more interesting from this study is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer <unk> those who ate more servings of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 930.01 933.3 <NA> <unk> so this human study is a prime example
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 933.1 940.41 <NA> of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels can have an impact on cancer 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 940.22 946.93 <NA> and we 're now studying the role of a healthy diet with dean ornish at ucsf and tufts university
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 946.93 952.05 <NA> the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 952.19 954.97 <NA> obviously <unk> what i 've shared with you has some
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 954.95 965.17 <NA> far ranging implications even beyond cancer research because if we 're right it could impact consumer education food services <unk> public health and even the insurance industry <unk> 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 964.86 972.64 <NA> and in fact some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines <unk> check out this ad from bluecross blueshield of minnesota
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 972.96 975.02 <NA> for many people around the world
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 975 978.69 <NA> dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution <unk> 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 978.51 982.11 <NA> because not everybody can afford expensive end stage cancer treatments 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 982.11 989.09 <NA> but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local sustainable antiangiogenic crops 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 989.74 991.46 <NA> now <unk> 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 991.27 999.69 <NA> finally <unk> i 've talked to you about food and i 've talked to you about cancer <unk> so there 's just one more disease that i have to tell you about and that 's
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1000.97 1005.72 <NA> <unk> because it turns out that adipose tissue fat is highly <unk>
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1007.17 1014.72 <NA> and like a tumor fat grows when blood vessels grow so the question is can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply <unk>
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1015.01 1020.04 <NA> the top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1019.86 1024.75 <NA> that eats nonstop until it turns fat like this furry tennis ball
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1026 1036.15 <NA> <unk> and the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse if you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor <unk> it loses weight <unk> stop the treatment gains the weight back <unk> restart the treatment loses <unk>
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1036.05 1043.78 <NA> <unk> the weight stop the treatment it gains the weight back and in fact you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting angiogenesis <unk> 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1050.52 1058.99 <NA> <unk> truly interesting thing about this is that we can 't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse 's weight is supposed to be 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1058.74 1062.71 <NA> in other words <unk> we can 't create supermodel mice 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1063.09 1067.57 <NA> and this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy set points <unk> 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1068.04 1075.1 <NA> albert szent gyrgi once said discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen <unk> and thinking what no one has thought 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1074.79 1079.61 <NA> i hope i 've convinced you that for diseases like cancer <unk> obesity and other conditions
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1079.92 1087.39 <NA> there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator angiogenesis and that 's what i think the world needs now <unk> thank you
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1104.98 1111.76 <NA> for anyone out here who has cancer <unk> what would you recommend do you recommend pursuing these treatments now for most cancer patients
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1132.42 1135.4 <NA> <unk> consider the approved ones look for clinical trials <unk> 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1135.17 1148.09 <NA> but then between what the doctor can do for you we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves <unk> this is one of the themes i 'm talking about we can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors can 't do for us which is to use knowledge and take action <unk> 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1148.09 1149.93 <NA> and if mother nature has given us
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1150.88 1158.76 <NA> <unk> we think there might be a new future in the value of how we eat and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day jc right 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1158.76 1170.28 <NA> and along those lines for people who might have risk factors for cancer would you recommend pursuing any treatments prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce wl 
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1170.05 1175.05 <NA> well you know there 's abundant epidemiological evidence and i think in the information age it doesn
WilliamLi_2010 1 WilliamLi_2010 1175.13 1188.32 <NA> <unk> take long to go to a credible source like pubmed the national library of medicine to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications <unk> and that 's certainly something that anybody can look into
