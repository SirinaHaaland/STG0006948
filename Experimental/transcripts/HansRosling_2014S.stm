HansRosling_2014S 1 HansRosling_2014S 669.65 674.93 <NA> helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of and we seek causality where there
HansRosling_2014S 1 HansRosling_2014S 676.69 679.28 <NA> <unk> we then get an illusion
HansRosling_2014S 1 HansRosling_2014S 679.08 688.52 <NA> of confidence where we believe that we are the best car drivers <unk> above the average everybody answered that question yeah i drive cars better
