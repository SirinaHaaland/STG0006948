BenGoldacre_2012P 1 BenGoldacre_2012P 59.37 70.24 <NA> so firstly thinking just about precognition as it turns out just last year a researcher called daryl bem conducted a piece of research where he found evidence of precognitive powers in undergraduate <unk>

BenGoldacre_2012P 1 BenGoldacre_2012P 215.07 223.45 <NA> early on its development they did a very small trial just under a hundred patients fifty patients got lorcainide and of those patients ten died

BenGoldacre_2012P 1 BenGoldacre_2012P 417.66 429.91 <NA> but it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias has actually been very very well studied so here is one example of how you approach it the classic model is you get a bunch of studies where you know that they 've been conducted and completed and then you go and see if they
BenGoldacre_2012P 1 BenGoldacre_2012P 429.9 440.05 <NA> <unk> been published anywhere in the academic literature so this took all of the trials that had ever been conducted on antidepressants that were approved over a fifteen year period by the fda they took all <unk>
