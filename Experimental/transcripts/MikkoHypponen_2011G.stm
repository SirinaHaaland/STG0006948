MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 602.85 604.85 <NA> is one exploit file
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 604.93 617.84 <NA> here i 'm looking at the hex dump of an image file <unk> which contains an exploit and that basically means if you 're trying to view this image file on your windows computer it actually takes over your computer and runs code now if
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 617.44 624.78 <NA> you 'll take a look at this image file well there 's the image header and there the actual code of the attack
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 625.34 630.31 <NA> <unk> and that code has been encrypted so let 's decrypt it it has been encrypted with

MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 636.11 639.51 <NA> we can go here and actually start decrypting it 
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 639.51 649.69 <NA> well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted and i know it doesn 't really look much different from the original but just keep staring at it you 'll actually see that down here you can see a web
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 655.95 663.73 <NA> <unk> and when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program and that 's a backdoor which will take over your computer <unk> 
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 663.69 669.71 <NA> but even more interestingly if we continue decrypting we 'll find this mysterious string which says
MikkoHypponen_2011G 1 MikkoHypponen_2011G 679.87 683.42 <NA> <unk> anything and i was looking at that trying to figure out what it means <unk>
