MarkForsyth_2012X 1 MarkForsyth_2012X 291.93 296.77 <NA> second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure 
MarkForsyth_2012X 1 MarkForsyth_2012X 299.04 302.36 <NA> you can still be waiting two hundred and
MarkForsyth_2012X 1 MarkForsyth_2012X 304.93 309.5 <NA> <unk> the third thing you can learn and this is the really important one the point i want to leave you on
MarkForsyth_2012X 1 MarkForsyth_2012X 309.22 310.94 <NA> is that
MarkForsyth_2012X 1 MarkForsyth_2012X 310.74 317.87 <NA> the title president of the united states of america doesn 't sound that humble at all these days does it 
MarkForsyth_2012X 1 MarkForsyth_2012X 317.71 324.53 <NA> something to do with the slightly over five thousand nuclear warheads he has at his disposal and the

MarkForsyth_2012X 1 MarkForsyth_2012X 357.63 363.97 <NA> and so in the end <unk> the senate won and the house of representatives lost 
MarkForsyth_2012X 1 MarkForsyth_2012X 364.02 372.16 <NA> because nobody 's going to feel that humble when they 're told that they are now the president of the united states of america <unk> 
MarkForsyth_2012X 1 MarkForsyth_2012X 372.72 379.55 <NA> and that 's the important lesson i think you can take away and the one i want to leave you with politicians try to pick and use words to shape
