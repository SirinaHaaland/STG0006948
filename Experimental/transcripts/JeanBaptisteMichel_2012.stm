JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 13.51 23.48 <NA> <unk> that mathematics is a very powerful language <unk> it has generated considerable insight in physics in biology and economics <unk> but not that much in the humanities and in history <unk> 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 22.99 29.97 <NA> i think there 's a belief that it 's just impossible that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind that you cannot measure history
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 30.23 33.65 <NA> but i don 't think that 's right i want to show you a couple of examples why <unk> 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 33.65 42.06 <NA> so my collaborator erez and i were considering the following fact that two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 41.57 49.96 <NA> that 's a powerful historical force <unk> so the king of england alfred the great <unk> will use a vocabulary and and grammar that is quite different from the king of hip hop
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 55.08 62.98 <NA> <unk> changes over time and it 's a powerful force <unk> so erez and i wanted to know more about that so we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule past tense conjugation <unk> 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 62.98 68.15 <NA> so you just add ed to a verb at the end to signify the past today i walk yesterday i walked 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 67.92 71.02 <NA> but some verbs are irregular yesterday i thought 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 70.77 74.93 <NA> now what 's interesting about that is irregular verbs between alfred and
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 75.37 79.46 <NA> <unk> have become more regular like the verb to wed that you see here has become regular <unk> 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 79.12 85.11 <NA> so erez and i followed the fate of over one hundred irregular verbs through twelve centuries of english language 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 84.87 90.92 <NA> and we saw that there 's actually a very simple mathematical pattern that captures this complex historical change <unk> 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 90.91 97.07 <NA> namely if a verb is one hundred times more frequent than another it regularizes ten times slower 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 97.03 99.75 <NA> that 's a piece of history <unk> but it comes in a
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 101.93 107.73 <NA> <unk> in some cases math can even help explain or propose explanations for historical forces <unk> 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 107.36 115.84 <NA> so here steve pinker and i were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries there 's actually a well known regularity to them
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 115.45 120.9 <NA> where the number of wars that are one hundred times deadlier is ten times smaller <unk> 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 120.53 129.94 <NA> so there are thirty wars that are about as deadly as the six days war but there 's only four wars that are one hundred times deadlier like world war i so what kind of
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 129.87 133.75 <NA> <unk> historical mechanism can produce that what 's the origin of this <unk> 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 133.41 136.59 <NA> so steve and i through mathematical analysis 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 136.59 147.62 <NA> propose that there 's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this which lies in our brains this is a very well known feature in which we perceive quantities in relative ways
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 147.43 149.99 <NA> quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 152.17 159.65 <NA> <unk> committing ten thousand soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot it 's relatively enormous if you 've already committed one thousand soldiers previously <unk> 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 159.58 167.42 <NA> but it doesn 't sound so much <unk> it 's not relatively enough it won 't make a difference if you 've already committed one hundred thousand soldiers previously <unk> 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 167.29 174.96 <NA> so you see that because of the way we perceive quantities as the war drags on the number of soldiers committed to
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 175.22 179.83 <NA> <unk> and the casualties will increase not linearly like ten thousand eleven thousand twelve thousand
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 179.83 189.76 <NA> but exponentially ten thousand later twenty thousand later forty thousand <unk> and so that explains this pattern that we 've seen before <unk> so here mathematics is able to link
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 189.55 192.45 <NA> a well known feature of the individual mind
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 193.87 199.99 <NA> historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents <unk> so these types of
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 201.36 202.54 <NA> <unk> few of them <unk> 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 202.17 210.04 <NA> but i think in the next decade they will become commonplace the reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace <unk> 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 209.67 214.75 <NA> so there 's about one hundred and thirty million books that have been written since the dawn of time <unk> 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 214.68 219.01 <NA> companies like google have digitized many of them above twenty million actually 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 218.64 222.5 <NA> and when the stuff of history is available in digital form 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 222.5 229.19 <NA> it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently review trends in our history and our culture
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 230.08 235.55 <NA> <unk> so i think in the next decade the sciences and the humanities will come closer together
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 235.38 238.47 <NA> to be able to answer deep questions about mankind 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 238.23 242.91 <NA> and i think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that 
JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 1 JeanBaptisteMichel_2012 242.91 250.92 <NA> it will be able to reveal new trends in our history <unk> sometimes to explain them and maybe even in the future to predict what 's going to happen
