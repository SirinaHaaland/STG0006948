DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 582.21 591.32 <NA> we will we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board but simply funding this thing 
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 591.32 592.88 <NA> it looks like
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 592.67 600.17 <NA> a fairly simple thing but this was a half a million dollar project dr well we knew that if it wasn 't privately funded it wasn 't going to happen <unk> and we also

DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 644.81 650.14 <NA> <unk> could be in new york <unk> because the key was not raising a lot of objection and
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 654.96 664.9 <NA> <unk> up with the idea of setting up a foundation <unk> mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this he would not agree to

DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 713.78 721.56 <NA> we had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform

DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 740.79 754.97 <NA> <unk> that needs to be kind of dignified and a place to reflect and remember <unk> and i 've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together watching the crowds that gathered at saint paul which is just to the right and moving around the site and i live down there so we spent a lot of time
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 755.07 762.98 <NA> looking at the need <unk> and i think people were amazed at two things i think they were amazed at the destruction

DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 767.83 773.9 <NA> that i found very moving just the sort of everyday heroics of new yorkers <unk> so
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 773.98 779.94 <NA> we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said i 'm going to lock the door because this developer will not

DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 783.93 795.66 <NA> and we said well this is half the size it doesn 't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone everyone in the city we 'd have to go back to to the beginning to do this 
DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 795.77 801.09 <NA> and i convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed

DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 896.82 904.94 <NA> kind of quiet place so it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters

DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1011.52 1019.13 <NA> thoughts about our work in general is number one the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done and kevin kennon

DavidRockwell_2002 1 DavidRockwell_2002 1035.72 1043.38 <NA> so the notion of collaboration i think this reinforces how important that is and in terms of the temporary nature of it
