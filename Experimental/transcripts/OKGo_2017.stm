OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 235.3 236.96 <NA> <unk> we are ok go and
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 236.95 240.27 <NA> we 've been together as a band since one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 240.27 250.08 <NA> but in the last decade we 've become known as much for the elaborate music videos like the one we just saw as for the songs they accompany <unk> so we will play
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 250.04 256.21 <NA> <unk> along with another one of those in a few minutes but in the meantime we want to address this question that we get asked all the time
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 256.03 263.13 <NA> but we <unk> we 've really never come up with an adequate answer for it and that is how do we think of those ideas <unk> 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 262.91 270.48 <NA> the videos are not all rube goldberg machines by the way last year we did a dance in zero gravity <unk> and once we set up
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 270.5 279.76 <NA> an obstacle course out of thousands of musical instruments in the desert and then played them by stunt driving a car through them for one of the videos we
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 279.69 285.91 <NA> <unk> choreographed hundreds of people with umbrellas in an abandoned parking lot outside tokyo <unk> and then
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 285.51 292 <NA> filmed them from a drone a half a mile in the air <unk> so it 's all of these ideas that people are curious about 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 291.99 300.28 <NA> and the reason we 've had so much trouble describing how we think of these ideas is that it doesn 't really feel like we think of them at all 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 299.88 302.32 <NA> it feels like we find them 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 303.51 304.97 <NA> and by way of explanation
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 305.38 307.76 <NA> well i have
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 307.53 309.86 <NA> a compulsive habit i play
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 309.66 322.76 <NA> parallax and perspective games with my eyes pretty much all the time and it 's something i 've been doing since i was a teenager and i think the big contributing factor may have been that this is how i decorated my high school bedroom 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 322.87 325.05 <NA> laughter and being a teenager what
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 325.04 328.51 <NA> <unk> i did in there of course was just talk on the phone for
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 328.51 336.66 <NA> staggering amounts of time so i was in this visual maelstrom just pretty much usually sitting in one place <unk> and
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 336.2 341.7 <NA> i guess just the overload in general my my brain kind of tried to make sense of it and i would
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 341.42 354.91 <NA> if i could move my head off to one side a little bit the edge of the desk would line up just perfectly with that poster on the opposite wall or if i put my thumb out i could close first my left eye and then my right <unk> and my thumb would bounce back and forth between jimi hendrix 's left eye
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 354.92 360.86 <NA> and his right it was not a conscious thing of course this is just
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 360.65 367.67 <NA> kind of the equivalent of doodling while you 're talking <unk> and it 's still something i do all the time this is my wife kristin 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 367.67 368.89 <NA> yeah woo 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 370.89 379.7 <NA> and it 's not uncommon that we are out at dinner and in the middle of a great conversation she 'll just stop <unk> mid sentence and when she stops is when i
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 380.11 388.43 <NA> <unk> that i 'm the one who 's acting weird because i 'm like bobbing and weaving and what i 'm trying to do is get that ficus back there to stick out of her head like a ponytail 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 390.31 398.39 <NA> laughter the point of telling you all this is that for me this is what it feels like to have an idea it 's like they 're made of these disparate
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 398.56 401.85 <NA> parts these disparate chunks sort of floating out there and if
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 404.9 408.88 <NA> <unk> and crucially if you 're in exactly the right place you can get them to just
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 408.88 415.3 <NA> line up <unk> so if you get used to if it 's your job to think of ideas this way they 'll start
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 414.88 420.85 <NA> beckoning to you the way that jimi 's eyes beckoned from that poster or the ficus beckons from behind kristin 's head
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 420.85 425.58 <NA> writing music feels like that process just over and over again like you 've got a
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 425.21 429.97 <NA> bunch of sounds or a groove or a chord progression and you 're just looking for that
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 430.04 432.16 <NA> thing on the other side 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 431.91 440.39 <NA> that little chunk over there that puzzle piece that clicks right in and when it does click <unk> it doesn 't feel like you thought up that puzzle piece it feels like
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 440.06 444.88 <NA> you found it like like it was a set of relationships that you unlocked <unk> 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 445.26 454.49 <NA> but with the videos in particular <unk> we 're usually looking for this specific feeling which is wonder <unk> and there 's always a component of surprise to wonder
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 454.81 463.82 <NA> <unk> so we 're not just looking for good ideas we 're looking for good ideas that surprise us in some way <unk> and this causes something of a problem <unk> because 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 464.74 474.74 <NA> the process that we all use to make stuff it actually has a very strong bias against surprising ideas the process i 'm talking about is the one you all know we all do it all the time 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 474.49 479.94 <NA> you think of an idea you just sit and think of your brilliant idea and then you come up with a plan
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 479.96 493.68 <NA> <unk> for how you 're going to make that idea happen and then with that plan in mind you go back and double check your original idea and maybe revise it and then bouncing back and forth between the idea and the plan the plan and the idea eventually you come up with a truly great plan 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 493.25 497.2 <NA> and then once you have that and only then do you go out
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 496.99 500.11 <NA> and you execute <unk> and this is like
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 500.55 505.19 <NA> <unk> this is sort of a flawless system in terms of maximizing your resources because this
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 504.95 506.83 <NA> super cheap <unk> 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 507.15 517.6 <NA> thinking usually costs very little but this is really expensive most of the time so by the time you get there you want to make sure you 're super prepared and you can squeeze every last drop out of what you 've got <unk> 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 517.26 522.67 <NA> but there are problems with this and math will help us reveal the biggest one 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 522.42 524.53 <NA> go back to that video
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 524.04 529.88 <NA> that we just showed you that rube goldberg machine it had about one hundred and thirty interactions in it that was one
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 529.84 531.62 <NA> <unk> hundred and thirty things
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 531.7 542.27 <NA> that we had to have go according to our plan <unk> so let 's let 's assume that we want to make a new video now similarly complex one hundred and thirty moving parts 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 542.32 547.16 <NA> if we 're really good planners in that system it seems like
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 546.91 554.64 <NA> maybe we could be good enough to get every part of that system to be ninety percent reliable <unk> ninety percent sounds good right
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 554.72 558.14 <NA> <unk> well <unk> it 's not it 's terrible actually the numbers say so 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 558.14 568.18 <NA> the chance of getting all one hundred and thirty things to not fail at the same time is 9 for ninety percent to the 130th power so calculate that out and you get
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 579.96 584.23 <NA> <unk> literally one in a million 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 584.7 591.67 <NA> i mean that 's not a gamble i want to take so let 's ratchet up that reliability to ninety nine percent <unk>
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 593.61 594.97 <NA> <unk> power is
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 597 599.99 <NA> <unk> percent significantly less daunting like this might even
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 600 604.31 <NA> be usable but really think about that how many parts of your lives are <unk>
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 605.29 613.22 <NA> <unk> percent reliable <unk> and could you really get one hundred and thirty of them all in one place at once and if you really could 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 613 617.52 <NA> doesn 't it seem like you deserve to succeed like that is
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 617.34 624.9 <NA> that thing is going to work right but no <unk> it actually fails three times more often than it succeeds so the upshot of all this is that
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 625.16 628.14 <NA> <unk> if your project is pretty complex like 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 628.14 635.74 <NA> you know every ambitious project is if you 've got a lot of moving parts you 're basically constrained to just reshuffling
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 635.38 640.95 <NA> ideas that have already demonstrably proven that they 're one hundred percent reliable <unk> 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 640.52 645.46 <NA> so now go back to me sitting with my thumb in the air trying to line up something surprising 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 645.46 654.25 <NA> if the only things i 'm allowed to consider in the first place are ideas that have already been done over and over and over again i am screwed
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 655.5 670.03 <NA> however there are ways around this because we all know that there are tons of untried ideas still out there and plenty of them will turn out to be every bit as reliable as we need it 's just that we don 't yet know they are reliable when we are at this planning phase <unk> 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 670.02 679.43 <NA> so what we do is we try to identify some place where there might just be a ton of those untried ideas we try to find a sandbox
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 679.78 685.34 <NA> <unk> gamble a whole bunch of our resources on getting in that sandbox and playing 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 686.02 695.39 <NA> because we have to trust that it 's the process in the sandbox that will reveal to us which ideas are not only surprising but surprisingly reliable <unk> 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 695.38 698.3 <NA> so some of the sandboxes that we 've started videos with 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 698.17 700.17 <NA> let 's play
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 699.98 704.97 <NA> with optical illusions let 's try to dance on moving surfaces let 's
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 704.9 709.26 <NA> <unk> 's try to make toast with a laser cutter or
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 708.92 718.83 <NA> let 's do something in one of those zero gravity airplanes but then instead of actually trying to sit there and think out what that something is we spent a full third of our budget <unk>
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 718.78 724.14 <NA> getting in an actual vomit comet and bouncing off the walls for a week <unk> 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 729.96 734.14 <NA> <unk> at this point we don 't yet know what our idea is we don 't have a plan
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 733.97 736.75 <NA> to be testing <unk> so we 're
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 736.75 746.65 <NA> just we 're just playing we 're just trying everything we can think of because we need to get this idea space filled up with a chaos like the one in my high school bedroom <unk> 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 746.19 753.71 <NA> because then if we can do the bob and weave thing if we can put our thumbs up and get just a few things to line up
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 754.93 764.72 <NA> <unk> are no one else has ever made those same things line up before <unk> and when we 're done with that project people will ask us again how we thought of that idea and we 'll be stumped <unk> because
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 764.23 768.92 <NA> from our perspective it doesn 't feel like we thought of it at all it just feels like we found it 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 768.55 777.12 <NA> so we 'll play another video for you now and the song along with it this is for the song the one moment and for this one the sandbox was
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 776.93 778.71 <NA> ballistics and math
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 780.32 790.11 <NA> i spent a full month putting together a giant spreadsheet for this it was like my playspace was four hundred lines long and twenty five columns wide
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 790.07 797.82 <NA> which i presume that if anybody is going to understand that it 's this crowd nothing is better than a giant spreadsheet right well 
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 800.31 803 <NA> <unk> very much we are ok go and this is called the one moment
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 914.29 924.3 <NA> <unk> reclaims our footprints <unk> and while our bones keep looking back at the overgrowth that 's swallowing the path
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 930.29 931.75 <NA> <unk> the grace of god go
OKGo_2017 1 OKGo_2017 1005.05 1009.12 <NA> <unk> we remember and this will be the one moment
