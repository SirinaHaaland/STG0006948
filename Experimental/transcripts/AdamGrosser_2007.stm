AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 13.39 14.45 <NA> <unk> this is
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 14.05 23.7 <NA> a work in process <unk> based on some comments that were made at ted two years ago about the need for the storage
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 65.49 74.96 <NA> <unk> years ago i had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration one of those things that stuck in my head a lot like the stirling engine it was cool but you didn 't know what to do with
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 77.89 86.42 <NA> <unk> by this guy ferdinand carr but he couldn 't actually build anything with it because of the of the tools at the time this crazy canadian named powel crosley
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 86.25 89.64 <NA> commercialized this thing called the icyball in one thousand nine hundred
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 89.64 103.95 <NA> and twenty eight it was a really neat idea and i 'll get to why it didn 't work but here 's how it works there 's two spheres and they 're separated in distance one has a working fluid water and ammonia and the other is a is a condenser you heat up one side the hot side the ammonia evaporates and it
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 104.99 107.73 <NA> <unk> side <unk> you let it cool to room temperature 
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 107.81 115.14 <NA> and then as the ammonia reevaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side <unk> it creates a powerful cooling effect <unk> 
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 114.89 119.1 <NA> so it was a great idea that didn 't work at all they blew up 
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 119.57 129.97 <NA> because you 're using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong it topped four hundred psi the ammonia was toxic it sprayed everywhere but it was kind of an interesting thought
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 130.13 136.97 <NA> <unk> so the great thing about two thousand and six there 's a lot of really great computational work you can do so we
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 136.73 145.81 <NA> got the whole thermodynamics department at stanford involved a lot of computational fluid dynamics we proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong <unk> 
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 145.62 150.4 <NA> we found some nontoxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures we
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 150.24 153.71 <NA> brought in a team from the uk a lot of great refrigeration people it turns
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 154.84 160.77 <NA> <unk> and built a test rig and proved that in fact we could make a low pressure nontoxic refrigerator <unk> 
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 160.77 168.83 <NA> so this is the way it works you put it on a cooking fire most people have cooking fires in the world whether it 's camel dung or wood <unk> it heats up for about thirty minutes <unk> 
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 168.61 170.72 <NA> cools for an hour you
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 170.86 179.97 <NA> put it into a container and it will refrigerate for twenty four hours it looks like this this is the fifth prototype it 's not quite done it weighs about eight pounds
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 179.75 180.9 <NA> <unk> pounds 
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 180.5 185.55 <NA> and this is the way it works you put it into a 15 liter vessel about three gallons 
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 185.32 192.65 <NA> and it 'll cool it down to just above freezing three degrees above freezing for twenty four hours in a thirty degree c environment 
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 192.65 198.88 <NA> it 's really cheap we think we can build these in high volumes for about twenty five dollars in low volumes for about forty dollars 
AdamGrosser_2007 1 AdamGrosser_2007 198.67 202.72 <NA> and we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have thank you
