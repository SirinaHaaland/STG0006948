SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 12.79 14.4 <NA> <unk> i came here to show you
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 14.22 17.87 <NA> the fotokite it 's a tethered flying camera <unk> 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 17.47 25.14 <NA> but before i do that i want to tell you a bit about where it came from what motivated it so i was born in russia and
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 25.1 29.76 <NA> <unk> three years ago in two thousand and eleven there were the russian federal elections 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 29.39 36.84 <NA> there were massive irregularities reported and people came out to protest which was very unlikely for russia <unk> 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 36.68 38.02 <NA> and
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 37.57 44.19 <NA> no one really knew how significant these protests were because for whatever reason the world media largely ignored it 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 43.85 52.32 <NA> now there was a group of photographers who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby usually photographing things like the sphinx 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 52.1 54.13 <NA> the pyramids who
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 55.14 57.95 <NA> <unk> to be right around the corner and they they flew a camera
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 57.74 66.08 <NA> and they took some snapshots some panoramas of this demonstration just completely independent entity <unk> completely random occurrence <unk> 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 66.08 69.82 <NA> and the image when i saw it it really struck me 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 69.42 72.2 <NA> here 's one of the panoramas <unk> so
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 72.04 74.92 <NA> in a single image you can really see
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 83.05 89.03 <NA> <unk> you just can 't consider this insignificant all in a single image which was really cool to me <unk> 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 88.93 97.2 <NA> and i think in the future journalism and many other professions <unk> there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there but
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 97.02 99.96 <NA> i think <unk> you wait a few months a few years and
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 100 103.29 <NA> for many professions it 's really going to be a requirement <unk> 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 103.25 112.47 <NA> and it make sense it 's such a unique perspective <unk> nothing really communicates this scale for example in context in a way that this does 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 112.47 113.59 <NA> but there are a few
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 113.26 116.61 <NA> hurdles and they are quite basic and quite fundamental 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 116.57 122.34 <NA> one is piloting so for this image <unk> they flew a camera a
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 122 126.9 <NA> five kilogram device with an slr under it
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 126.62 127.99 <NA> it 's
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 127.83 129.94 <NA> quite heavy <unk> lots of spinning
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 130.02 131.21 <NA> <unk> sharp things <unk> 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 131.21 141.11 <NA> it 's a bit uncomfortable to fly probably also for the operator in fact <unk> you can see that on the back of the pilot 's shirt it says no questions until landing 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 140.89 143.05 <NA> in russian and in english
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 142.86 150.02 <NA> because people are curious and they 'll go tap you and then you lose your focus and things happen and these guys are great they 're professionals
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 151.57 159.35 <NA> <unk> careful in what they do so in the protests maybe you noticed they flew over the river so it was quite safe <unk> but
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 159.01 165.53 <NA> this doesn 't necessarily apply to all people and all conditions so we really have to make piloting easier 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 165.07 174.93 <NA> the other problem is regulations or rather the lack of good regulation for many good reasons it 's just difficult to come up with common sense laws
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 179.96 192 <NA> <unk> has a smartphone with a camera right there are more and more of them <unk> you hear about people with google glass being attacked you hear about actually a drone pilot a hobbyist was attacked two weeks ago because he was flying near a beach 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 191.9 199.51 <NA> here 's some personal input i didn 't expect just yesterday i was attacked by a guy who claimed that i was filming him 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 199.51 202.17 <NA> i was checking my email right here
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 202.07 204.94 <NA> easy way to get input for your talk
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 205.53 210.16 <NA> but i think there are better solutions i think we have to defuse the situation
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 210.16 217.57 <NA> we have to come up with responsible solutions that address the privacy issues and the safety accountability issues
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 217.26 225.02 <NA> but still give us that perspective <unk> and this is one potential solution <unk> so
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 231.46 236.3 <NA> <unk> 's kind of special about it is there 's a leash <unk> it 's literally a dog leash it 's very convenient 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 236.47 243.05 <NA> and the neat thing about it is to fly it <unk> there 's no joysticks nothing like this you just turn it on
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 243.94 249.6 <NA> and you point in the direction that you want to fly you give it a little twist that 's kind of the way you communicate
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 265.85 274.87 <NA> <unk> the interaction is super simple it 's like a personal flying pet it just always maintains a certain angle to you and if i move around with it it 'll actually follow
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 276.69 285.37 <NA> <unk> and of course we can build on top of this so this leash has some additional electronics you can turn it on and now <unk> it 's like
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 284.88 291.52 <NA> telling your dog to fly lower if you have such a dog <unk> so i can press a button and
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 291.52 300.05 <NA> and manipulate it rather easily so i just shifted its position <unk> and it 's really safe <unk> <unk> i don 't know about you guys in the front row
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 301.15 306.51 <NA> <unk> at least in principle you have to agree that you feel safer because there is a physical connection 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 306.3 316.76 <NA> live demos are hard right things go wrong all the time but no matter what this thing will actually prevent this thing from going into you what 's more it tells you immediately <unk>
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 316.66 321.26 <NA> <unk> that i am the one responsible for this device you don 't have to look for someone controlling it 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 330.8 336.33 <NA> and and launch it <unk> and if i can do this
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 336.32 342.54 <NA> on stage live then i can show each and every one of you in five minutes how to operate one of these devices <unk> 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 351.62 353.89 <NA> so now we have two eyes in the sky
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 355.68 358.03 <NA> and now the trick is getting them back 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 363.3 365.95 <NA> so my question now to you is 
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 365.76 373.09 <NA> well it 's a nice solution it 's very accessible it 's safe <unk> what would you use it for what would you use
SergeiLupashin_2014S 1 SergeiLupashin_2014S 372.75 375.83 <NA> such a camera for in your life <unk> thank you
