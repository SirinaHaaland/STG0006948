ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 234.4 238.35 <NA> and i 'm essentially taking a piece of your history
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 238.16 247.19 <NA> and putting it inside the framing of the story <unk> but then i started thinking okay well that 's a part of you <unk> but how do i put

ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 293.34 299.99 <NA> but then i started thinking about frames <unk> and what do they represent <unk> and a frame is just a window <unk>

ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 339.65 346.5 <NA> so <unk> it 's difficult to explain why is it difficult to explain it 's difficult because it 's a very experiential medium
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 346.25 349.96 <NA> <unk> you feel your way inside of it it 's a machine but inside of
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 350.43 359.62 <NA> <unk> it feels like real life <unk> it feels like truth <unk> and you feel present in the world that you 're inside and you feel present with the people that you 're inside of it with

ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 360.48 363.36 <NA> i 'm going to show you a demo of a virtual reality film 
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 363.37 372.01 <NA> a full screen version of all the information that we capture when we shoot virtual reality <unk> so we 're shooting in every direction this is a camera system that we built
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 372.09 379.79 <NA> that has 3d cameras that look in every direction and binaural microphones that face in every direction we take this and we
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 379.93 383.39 <NA> <unk> build basically a sphere of a world that you inhabit 
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 383.17 389.67 <NA> so what i 'm going to show you is not a view into the world it 's basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle <unk> 
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 389.43 392.82 <NA> so this film is called clouds over sidra 
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 392.82 399.99 <NA> and it was made in conjunction with our virtual reality company called <unk> vrse and the united nations and

ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 501.36 505.12 <NA> <unk> so we took this film to the world economic forum in davos
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 504.63 510.28 <NA> in january <unk> and we showed it to a group of people whose decisions
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 510.28 516.43 <NA> affect the lives of millions of people and these are people who might not otherwise be sitting
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 516.12 522.34 <NA> in a tent in a refugee camp in jordan <unk> but
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 522.78 529.31 <NA> in january <unk> one afternoon in switzerland they suddenly all found themselves there

ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 540.28 542.57 <NA> so we 're going to make more of them 
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 543.52 546.21 <NA> we 're working with the united nations
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 546.02 554.91 <NA> right now to shoot a whole series of these films we just finished shooting a story in liberia <unk> and now we 're going to shoot a story in india
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 554.95 557.06 <NA> and we 're taking these films <unk> 
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 556.84 562.56 <NA> and we 're showing them at the united nations to people that work there and people that are visiting there 
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 562.56 568.86 <NA> and we 're showing them to the people that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films <unk> 
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 568.61 572.98 <NA> and that 's where i think we just start to scratch the surface
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 572.79 574.99 <NA> of the true power of
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 576.36 581.63 <NA> <unk> it 's not a video game peripheral it connects humans to other humans
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 581.42 589.9 <NA> in a profound way that i 've never seen before in any other form of media and it can change people 's perception of each other 
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 590.04 595.63 <NA> and that 's how i think virtual reality has the potential to actually change the world <unk> 
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 598.08 600.29 <NA> so <unk> it 's a machine
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 601.3 604.18 <NA> <unk> but through this machine we become
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 603.96 609.5 <NA> more compassionate we become more empathetic <unk> and we become
ChrisMilk_2015 1 ChrisMilk_2015 609.5 615.14 <NA> more connected and ultimately we become more human
