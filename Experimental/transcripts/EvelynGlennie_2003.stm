EvelynGlennie_2003 1 EvelynGlennie_2003 33.14 37.5 <NA> interesting things of course is the combination of

EvelynGlennie_2003 1 EvelynGlennie_2003 109.25 117.87 <NA> and so therefore because time is short <unk> if i just played you literally the first maybe 
EvelynGlennie_2003 1 EvelynGlennie_2003 118.25 120.48 <NA> two lines or so it
EvelynGlennie_2003 1 EvelynGlennie_2003 120.17 127.41 <NA> 's very straightforward there 's nothing too difficult about the piece but here i 'm being told that the piece of music is very quick
