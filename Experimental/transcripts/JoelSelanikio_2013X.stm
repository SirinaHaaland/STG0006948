JoelSelanikio_2013X 1 JoelSelanikio_2013X 137.11 145.73 <NA> why we don 't know anything at all is that the information technology systems that we use in global health to find the data to solve these problems

JoelSelanikio_2013X 1 JoelSelanikio_2013X 490.13 499.87 <NA> but the problem is twenty or thirty programs like training twenty or thirty programs to use this technology that is a tiny drop in the bucket <unk> the demand for

JoelSelanikio_2013X 1 JoelSelanikio_2013X 547.74 550.34 <NA> i identified the main obstacle 
JoelSelanikio_2013X 1 JoelSelanikio_2013X 549.97 554.97 <NA> and the main obstacle it turned out and this is a sad realization the main obstacle was
JoelSelanikio_2013X 1 JoelSelanikio_2013X 555.02 564.75 <NA> <unk> me <unk> so what do i mean by that i had developed a process whereby i was the center of the universe of this technology
