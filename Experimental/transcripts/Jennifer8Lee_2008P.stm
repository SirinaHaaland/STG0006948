Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 55.14 56.19 <NA> <unk> and
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 56 66.01 <NA> americans loved their chinese foods so much they 've actually brought it into space nasa for example serves thermal stabilized sweet and sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 66.21 71.41 <NA> so let me present the question to you if our benchmark for americanness is apple pie
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 71.41 76.09 <NA> you should ask yourself how often do you eat apple pie versus how often do you eat chinese food
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 80.83 83.03 <NA> <unk> and if you think about it
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 83.41 88.38 <NA> a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or americans think of as chinese food
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 88.38 93.59 <NA> are barely recognizable to chinese for example beef with broccoli egg rolls
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 93.13 102.51 <NA> general tso 's chicken fortune cookies chop suey the take out boxes for example i took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to china gave them to chinese to see how they would react

Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 142.71 146.38 <NA> <unk> they from the short answer is actually they 're from japan and <unk>
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 145.95 154.76 <NA> in kyoto outside there are still small family run bakeries that make fortune cookies as they did over one hundred years ago thirty years before
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 154.84 155.94 <NA> <unk> fortune cookies
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 155.76 164.39 <NA> were introduced in the united states if you see them side by side there 's yellow and brown theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste so they 're not as sweet
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 164.39 171.32 <NA> as our version so how did they get to the united states well the short answer is the japanese immigrants came over and a bunch of
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 171.22 179.94 <NA> the bakers introduced them including at least one in los angeles and one here in san francisco called benkyo do which is on the corner of sutter and buchanan they
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 179.99 192.49 <NA> <unk> back then actually made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in kyoto so the interesting question is how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is japanese to being something that is chinese well
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 192.49 200.2 <NA> the short answer is we locked up all the japanese during world war ii including those that made fortune cookies so that 's the time when the chinese moved in kind of saw a market opportunity
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 200.16 201.21 <NA> <unk> and took over
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 202.8 210.4 <NA> so fortune cookies invented by the japanese popularized by the chinese but ultimately consumed by americans they are more american than anything else
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 210.24 216.58 <NA> another one of my favorite dishes general tso 's chicken which by the way in the us naval academy is called admiral tso 's chicken
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 217.41 223.99 <NA> i love this dish the original name in my book was actually called the long march of general tso and he has marched very far indeed
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 223.8 228.68 <NA> because he is sweet he is fried and he is chicken all things that americans love
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 230.41 236.48 <NA> <unk> he has marched so far actually that the chef who originally originally invented the dish doesn 't recognize it he 's kind of horrified
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 247.06 250.11 <NA> he 's in taiwan right now he 's retired deaf
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 250 251.4 <NA> <unk> and plays a lot of mahjong
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 251.23 255.57 <NA> so he after this i showed him he got up and he 's like
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 255.57 264.84 <NA> mominqimiao which means this is all nonsense and goes back to play his mahjong game during the afternoon so another dish one of my favorites beef with broccoli
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 264.38 265.95 <NA> broccoli
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 265.82 274.99 <NA> is not a chinese vegetable in fact it is originally an italian vegetable it was introduced into the united states in the eighteen hundreds but became popularized in the
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 276.69 284.31 <NA> <unk> in fact the chinese had their own version of broccoli which is called chinese broccoli but right now what they what they 've now discovered american broccoli and are importing it
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 284.15 297.15 <NA> as a sort of exotic delicacy i guarantee you general tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life and indeed that actually was a picture of general tso i went to his home town this is a billboard that says welcome to the birthplace of general tso
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 297.15 299.12 <NA> and i went looking for
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 298.9 299.9 <NA> chicken
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 300.22 306.74 <NA> <unk> found a cow and did find chicken believe it or not these guys were actually crossing the road and i
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 310.33 316.34 <NA> actually found a whole bunch of general tso 's relatives who are still in the little town this this guy is now five generations removed <unk>
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 316.24 321.45 <NA> <unk> from the general this guy this guy is about seven showed them all the pictures of general tso chicken that i showed you
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 325 329.34 <NA> because it doesn 't look like chinese food to them but they weren 't kind of
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 328.97 342 <NA> surprised i traveled around the world to visit them because in in their eyes he is after all a famous qing dynasty military hero he played an important role in the taiping rebellion which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of god and the baby brother of jesus christ
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 341.54 348.42 <NA> and caused the war that killed twenty million people still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 348.41 354.94 <NA> so you know i realized when i was there general tso is kind of a lot like colonel sanders in america in that he 's known
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 355.2 360.55 <NA> for chicken and not war but in china this guy 's actually known for war and not chicken
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 360.27 369.82 <NA> but the granddaddy of all the chinese american dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey which was introduced around the turn of the twentyth century
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 369.63 374.96 <NA> and according to new york times in one thousand nine hundred and four there was an outbreak of chinese restaurants all over town
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 375.28 381.39 <NA> <unk> city has gone chop suey mad so it took about thirty years before the americans realized that whoa
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 381.39 390.65 <NA> chop suey is actually not known in china and as this article points out the average native of any city in china knows nothing of chop suey
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 390.28 397.59 <NA> you know back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl you could take her out on a chop suey date
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 397.59 404.88 <NA> i like to say chop suey 's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another because chop suey if you translate into chinese means tsap sui which if you
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 404.84 406.75 <NA> <unk> translate back means odds and ends
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 406.75 418.14 <NA> so these people are going around china asking for chop suey which is sort of like a japanese guy coming here and saying i understand you have a very popular dish in your country called leftovers and it is particularly
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 419.42 420.63 <NA> right
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 422.75 428.68 <NA> and not only that this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call thanksgiving
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 430.32 434.89 <NA> <unk> so why why and where did chop suey come from let 's go back to
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 434.94 439.81 <NA> mid one thousand eight hundreds when the chinese first came to america now back then
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 439.81 447.04 <NA> the americans were not clamoring to eat chinese food in fact they saw this people who landed at their shores as alien
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 446.58 455 <NA> these people weren 't eating dogs they were eating cats and they weren 't eating cats they were eating rats in fact the new york times my esteemed employer in one thousand eight hundred and eighty three ran an article that asked
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 454.96 456.92 <NA> <unk> do chinese eat rats
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 456.97 460.82 <NA> and not the most pc question to be asked
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 460.78 468.02 <NA> today but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time not so outlandish this is actually a real
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 467.86 470.45 <NA> advertisement for rat poison
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 469.99 479.94 <NA> from the late one thousand eight hundreds and if you see under the word clears very small it says they must go which refers not only to the rats but to the chinese in their midst because the way
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 479.87 483.18 <NA> <unk> that the food was perceived was
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 483.08 492.75 <NA> that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us and another way that you saw sort of this sort of this antipathy towards the chinese is through documents like this this is actually in the library of congress <unk>
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 492.65 501.25 <NA> <unk> it is a pamphlet published by samuel gompers hero of our american labor movement and it 's called some reason for chinese exclusion meat versus rice
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 505.05 512.56 <NA> <unk> made the argument that chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for american men who ate meat
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 512.56 522.14 <NA> and as a matter of fact then this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country so with sentiments like these the chinese exclusion act was sort of passed between one thousand eight hundred and eighty two and
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 530.25 532.37 <NA> national origin or ethnicity
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 532.17 537.96 <NA> so in a way because the chinese were attacked and chop suey was created as a defense mechanism
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 537.78 550.1 <NA> now who came up with the idea of chop suey there 's a lot of different mysteries a lot of different legends but of the ones that i 've found that i thought was most interesting is this article from one thousand nine hundred and four a chinese guy named lem sen shows up in chinatown new york city and says
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 550.1 554.97 <NA> i want you guys all to stop making chop suey because i am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 555.05 559.2 <NA> <unk> known as chop suey and the way that he tells it there was a guy
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 559.07 562.35 <NA> there was a famous chinese diplomat that showed up
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 561.95 571.65 <NA> and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could quote pass as chinese and as he said we would never print this today but basically the american man
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 571.49 579.97 <NA> has become very rich lem sen who 's this guy i would have made this money too but i 've spent all this time looking for the american man who stole my recipe now i 've come and found him and
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 579.93 588.34 <NA> <unk> i want my recipe back and i want everyone to stop making chop suey or pay me for the right to do the same so it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 588.27 593.56 <NA> so the things is this kind of idea of chinese american food doesn 't exist only
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 593.56 601.27 <NA> in america in fact if you think about it chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet served on all seven continents even antarctica
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 600.84 604.88 <NA> because monday night is chinese food night at mcmurdo station which is the main
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 604.81 614.3 <NA> <unk> scientific station in antarctica so you see different varieties of chinese food for example there is french chinese food where they serve salt and pepper frog legs
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 614.29 627.57 <NA> there is italian chinese food where they don 't have fortune cookies so they serve fried gelato my downstairs neighbor alessandra was completely shocked when i told her dude fried gelato is not chinese she 's like it 's not but they serve it in all the chinese restaurants in italy
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 631.94 639.57 <NA> and even the brits have their own version this is a dish called crispy shredded beef which has a lot of crisp a lot of shred and not a lot of beef
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 639.2 649.93 <NA> there is west indian chinese food there 's jamaican chinese food there is middle eastern chinese food there 's mauritian chinese food this is a dish called magic bowl that i discovered there 's indian chinese food
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 650 657.74 <NA> korean chinese food japanese chinese food where they take the bao the little buns and they make them into pizza versions and they take
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 657.5 665.34 <NA> and they like totally randomly they 'll take chinese noodle dishes and they 'll just ramen ize them this is like this is something that in the chinese version has no soup
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 665.35 672.55 <NA> so there 's peruvian chinese food which should not be mixed with mexican chinese food where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 672.06 673.54 <NA> and then
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 673.41 677.36 <NA> one thing they have things like risotto chop suey my personal favorite of all the restaurants
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 680.05 681.5 <NA> <unk> called kung food
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 685 687.71 <NA> so let 's take a step back and kind of
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 687.71 692.87 <NA> understand what is to be appreciated in america mcdonald 's
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 692.62 699.39 <NA> has sort of garnered a lot of attention a lot of respect for basically standardizing
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 923.77 924.99 <NA> <unk> chinese food where they serve
Jennifer8Lee_2008P 1 Jennifer8Lee_2008P 976.42 977.46 <NA> <unk> in american history
