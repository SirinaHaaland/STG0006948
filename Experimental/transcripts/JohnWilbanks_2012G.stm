JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 16.93 21.99 <NA> so the bad news is that we all get sick <unk> i get sick <unk> you get sick <unk> 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 21.99 29.97 <NA> and every one of us gets sick and the question really is how sick do we get is it something that kills us is it something that we survive is it something that we can
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 29.93 37.92 <NA> <unk> treat <unk> and we 've gotten sick as long as we 've been people <unk> and so we 've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick <unk> 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 37.82 43.14 <NA> and for a long time it was the gods right the gods are angry with me or the gods are testing me right

JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 48.02 49.42 <NA> and as long as we 've looked for
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 51.63 56.77 <NA> <unk> we 've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science <unk> which is hypotheses as to why we get sick <unk> 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 56.49 65.77 <NA> and as long as we 've had hypotheses about why we get sick we 've tried to treat it as well so this is avicenna he wrote a book over a thousand years ago called the canon of medicine 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 65.61 70.67 <NA> and the rules he laid out for testing medicines are actually really similar to the rules we have today that
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 70.44 79.97 <NA> the disease and the medicine must be the same strength the medicine needs to be pure <unk> and in the end we need to test it in people <unk> and so if you put together these themes of a narrative or a hypothesis
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 80.43 82.37 <NA> in human testing 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 82.72 88.76 <NA> right you get some beautiful results even when we didn 't have very good technologies this is a guy named carlos finlay <unk>

JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 104.54 107.02 <NA> <unk> hypothesis and he tested it in people 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 107.02 121.56 <NA> so he got volunteers to go move to cuba and live in tents and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever <unk> so some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes and some of the people were in tents that were full of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever <unk> 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 121.25 124.9 <NA> and it definitively proved that it wasn 't this magic dust called

JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 157.06 164.55 <NA> informed consent is an idea that we should be very proud of as a society right it 's something that separates us from the nazis at nuremberg <unk> 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 164.55 171.38 <NA> enforced medical experimentation it 's the idea that agreement to join a study without understanding isn 't agreement

JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 183.92 194.02 <NA> of narrative hypothesis experimentation in humans and informed consent and you get what we call clinical study <unk> and it 's how we do the vast majority of medical work it
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 194.02 197.29 <NA> doesn 't really matter if you 're in the north the south the east the west

JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 410.27 414.33 <NA> that we have this information and we can 't use it and it 's an accident <unk> 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 414.65 418.5 <NA> so the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous

JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 427.59 437.48 <NA> so the good news is that some things have changed and the most important thing that 's changed is that we can now measure ourselves in ways that used to be the dominion of the health system <unk> 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 437.48 442.93 <NA> so a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust i like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 442.5 449.99 <NA> we can reach back and grab that dust <unk> and we can learn a lot about health from it so if our choices are part of our health what we eat is a
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 450 459.62 <NA> <unk> really important aspect of our health so you can do something very simple and basic and take a picture of your food and if enough people do that we can learn a lot about how our food affects our health 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 459.16 468.41 <NA> one interesting thing that came out of this this is an app for iphones called the eatery is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier than other people 's pizza is okay and
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 469.9 479.97 <NA> it seems like a trivial result but this is the sort of research that used to take the health system years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish it was done in five months by a startup
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 479.93 483.99 <NA> <unk> company of a couple of people i don 't have any financial interest in it 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 483.95 489.81 <NA> but more nontrivially we can get our genotypes done and although our genotypes aren 't dispositive they give us clues <unk> 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 489.81 502.02 <NA> so i could show you mine it 's just a 's t 's c 's and g 's this is the interpretation of it as you can see i carry a thirty two percent risk of prostate cancer twenty two percent risk of psoriasis and a fourteen percent risk of alzheimer 's disease <unk> 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 501.83 503.11 <NA> so that means if
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 504.98 508.3 <NA> you told everyone you carry the apoe e4 allele what 's wrong with you right 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 508.86 517.93 <NA> when i got these results i started talking to doctors and they told me not to tell anyone and my reaction is is that going to help anyone cure me when i get the disease 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 518.13 520.63 <NA> and no one could tell me yes <unk> 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 520.68 529.79 <NA> and i live in a web world where when you share things beautiful stuff happens not bad stuff so i started putting this in my slide decks <unk> and i got even more obnoxious
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 529.93 532.67 <NA> <unk> to my doctor and i said i 'd like to actually get my bloodwork <unk> 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 532.21 545.75 <NA> please give me back my data so this is my most recent bloodwork as you can see i have high cholesterol <unk> i have particularly high bad cholesterol <unk> and i have some bad liver numbers but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine the night before we ran the test 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 547.12 549.9 <NA> but look at how non computable this information
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 550.46 554.43 <NA> <unk> this is like the the photograph of my granddad holding my mom
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 554.09 558.6 <NA> from a data perspective <unk> and i had to go into the system and get it out <unk> 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 559.19 567.9 <NA> so the thing that i 'm proposing we do here is that we reach behind us and we grab the dust that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 567.9 574.53 <NA> and we reach into the medical system and we grab our records <unk> and we use it to build something together <unk> which is a commons

JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 588.78 594.46 <NA> right that 's all a commons is it 's something that we build together because we think it 's important 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 594.18 599.53 <NA> and a commons of data is something that 's really unique because we make it from our own data <unk> 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 599.25 604.97 <NA> and although a lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control around data and obsess around privacy at least some
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 604.93 607.58 <NA> <unk> of us really like to share as a form of control 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 607.21 615.8 <NA> and what 's remarkable about digital commonses is you don 't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough to generate something massive and beautiful 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 615.52 620.93 <NA> so not that many programmers write free software <unk> but we have the apache web server 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 621.07 625.08 <NA> not that many people who read wikipedia edit <unk> but it works
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 626.03 631.5 <NA> <unk> so as long as some people like to share as their form of control we can build a commons as long as we can get the information out 
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 631.52 635.73 <NA> and in biology the numbers are even better so vanderbilt ran a study asking people we 'd
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 635.73 642.09 <NA> like to take your biosamples your blood and share them in a biobank and only five percent of the people opted out

JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 647.51 654.43 <NA> but only five percent of the people wanted out <unk> so people like to share <unk> if you give them the opportunity and the choice
JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 655.32 662.05 <NA> <unk> and the reason that i got obsessed with this besides the obvious family aspects is that i spend a lot of time around mathematicians

JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 736.26 743.77 <NA> you can actually go through an online informed consent process because the donation to the commons must be voluntary and it must be informed

JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 801.53 804.94 <NA> and so being simple doesn 't mean being simplistic and being weak

JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 855.92 862.57 <NA> and the other thing about these systems is that it only takes a small number of really unreasonable people working together

JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 868.7 876.66 <NA> and we 're not supposed to be unreasonable in health and so i hate this word patient i don 't like being patient when systems are broken <unk>

JohnWilbanks_2012G 1 JohnWilbanks_2012G 915.62 920.45 <NA> so this is the athena breast health network it 's a study of one hundred and fifty thousand women in california <unk>
