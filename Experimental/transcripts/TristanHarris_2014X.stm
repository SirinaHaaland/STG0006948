TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 245.32 254.1 <NA> chat text messaging <unk> so let 's say there 's two people nancy 's on the left and she 's working on a document and john 's on the right

TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 315.45 323.78 <NA> because nancy and john are in this all or nothing relationship nancy might want to disconnect but then she 'd be worried <unk> what if i 'm missing something important <unk>
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 323.8 325.08 <NA> design
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 327.5 342.27 <NA> <unk> let 's say you have nancy again on the left john on the right <unk> and john remembers i need to send nancy that document except this time nancy can mark that she 's focused let 's say she drags a slider and says i want to be focused for thirty minutes so bam she 's focused <unk>

TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 355.92 362.26 <NA> so that nancy can still focus <unk> but john can get the thought off of his mind <unk> 
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 362.34 368.42 <NA> but this only works if one last thing is true <unk> which is that nancy needs to know
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 368.23 375.46 <NA> that if something is truly important john can still interrupt but
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 375.72 379.94 <NA> instead of having constant accidental or mindless interruptions

TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 384.49 393.38 <NA> so we 're doing two things here we 're creating a new choice for both nancy and john but there 's a second subtle thing we 're doing here too 
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 393.49 400.26 <NA> and it 's that we 're changing the question we 're answering <unk> instead of the goal of chat
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 402.02 409.17 <NA> <unk> let 's design it so it 's easy to send a message that 's the goal of chat it should be really easy to send a message to someone
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 409.28 418.21 <NA> we change the goal to something deeper and a human value which is let 's create the highest possible quality communication in a relationship
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 418.21 422.34 <NA> between two people <unk> so we upgraded the goal 
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 423.35 429.52 <NA> now do designers actually care about this do we want to have conversations about what
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 429.78 439.03 <NA> <unk> deeper human goals are well i 'll tell you one story <unk> a little over a year ago i got to

TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 482.42 487.11 <NA> he joked in our conversation that what if instead of a spell check <unk>

TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 497.65 504.76 <NA> does this kind of conversation happen in the real world not just in these design meetings <unk> well the answer is yes
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 504.9 514.75 <NA> <unk> one of my favorites is couchsurfing if you didn 't know couchsurfing is a website that matches people who are looking for a place to stay

TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 523.68 528.59 <NA> well you would think it 's to match guests with hosts
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 530.25 539.99 <NA> that 's a pretty good goal but that would kind of be like our goal with messaging before where we 're just trying to deliver a message <unk> so what 's the deeper human goal 
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 539.62 550.01 <NA> well they set their goal as the need to create lasting positive experiences and relationships between people who 've never met before 
TristanHarris_2014X 1 TristanHarris_2014X 550.81 554.97 <NA> and the most amazing thing about this was in two thousand and seven they introduced a way
