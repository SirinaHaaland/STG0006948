TomShannon_2003 1 TomShannon_2003 130.37 136.24 <NA> thing is is that it 's slightly dangerous normally it 's sort of cordoned off when it 's in a museum
TomShannon_2003 1 TomShannon_2003 136.24 140.95 <NA> but it 's uh let 's see if i can manipulate it a little bit without um
TomShannon_2003 1 TomShannon_2003 143.07 151.28 <NA> so this is just floating <unk> floating on a permanent magnetic field <unk> which stabilizes it
TomShannon_2003 1 TomShannon_2003 151.12 154.19 <NA> in all directions except there is a slight tether here

TomShannon_2003 1 TomShannon_2003 189.38 192.7 <NA> so here is the earth it 's a little less than a millimeter
TomShannon_2003 1 TomShannon_2003 192.46 195.6 <NA> that was turned of solid bronze
