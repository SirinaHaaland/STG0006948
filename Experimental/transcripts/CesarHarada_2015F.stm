CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 13.78 20.3 <NA> <unk> when i was a kid my parents would tell me you can make a mess <unk> but you have to clean up after yourself 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 19.93 29.3 <NA> so freedom came with responsibility <unk> but my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 29.96 35.56 <NA> <unk> grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance i should say because
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 35.35 39.87 <NA> adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 39.41 46.26 <NA> and growing up i found out that adults make a mess and they 're not very good at cleaning up after themselves <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 46.88 50.2 <NA> fast forward i am an adult now <unk> and i teach
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 50.19 54.29 <NA> <unk> citizen science and invention at the hong kong harbour school <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 54.05 59.87 <NA> and it doesn 't take too long before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 59.87 66.76 <NA> so as good citizens <unk> we clean up the beaches and no he is not drinking alcohol <unk> and if he is i did not
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 66.27 67.93 <NA> give it to him 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 69.48 76.61 <NA> and so it 's sad to say but today more than eighty percent of the oceans have plastic in them it 's a horrifying fact 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 76.61 79.97 <NA> and in past decades we 've been taking those big ships out
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 79.75 88.16 <NA> <unk> out and those big nets <unk> and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope and we sort them and then we put this data onto a map <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 88 96.33 <NA> but that takes forever <unk> it 's very expensive and so it 's quite risky to take those big boats out so with my students <unk> ages six to
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 96.14 104.94 <NA> fifteen <unk> we 've been dreaming of inventing a better way <unk> so we 've transformed our tiny hong kong classroom into a workshop <unk> and so we started building
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 104.93 113.85 <NA> <unk> this small workbench with different heights so even really short kids can participate <unk> and let me tell you kids with power tools are awesome and safe 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 113.99 116.25 <NA> not really and
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 116.69 124.05 <NA> so back to plastic we collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean which is very small because it breaks down <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 123.56 129.97 <NA> and so this is how we work i let the imaginations of my students run wild <unk> and my job is to try
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 129.99 132.74 <NA> <unk> to collect the best of each kid 's idea
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 132.56 137.35 <NA> and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 137.49 148.36 <NA> and so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits we are going to collect only the data so we 're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot so robots kids get very excited 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 148.36 150.05 <NA> and the next thing we do we do what
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 151.33 157.67 <NA> <unk> we are so rapid at prototyping that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we 're hacking it and
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 157.36 168.89 <NA> we hack table lamps and webcams into plumbing fixtures and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water and through the plastic that we have there
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 168.69 175.17 <NA> and this is the image that we get in the robot so we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 175.17 179.94 <NA> and the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of each
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 179.9 185.28 <NA> <unk> particle <unk> so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 185.03 191.81 <NA> so we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called instructables 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 191.81 194.7 <NA> in the hope that somebody would make it even better 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 195.38 202.27 <NA> what was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem <unk> and boom they are trying to immediately address it
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 204.9 213.07 <NA> <unk> students in hong kong are hyperconnected kids <unk> and they watch the news they watch the internet <unk> and they came across this image 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 213.36 218.33 <NA> this was a child probably under ten cleaning up an oil spill bare handed 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 218.33 224.74 <NA> in the sundarbans <unk> which is the world 's largest mangrove forest in bangladesh <unk> so they were very shocked
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 225.76 232.19 <NA> <unk> because this is the water they drink this is the water they bathe in this is the water they fish in this is the place where they live 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 231.82 240.09 <NA> and also you can see the water is brown the mud is brown and oil is brown <unk> so when everything is mixed up it 's really hard to see what 's in the water 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 240.09 244.05 <NA> but there 's a technology that 's rather simple that 's called spectrometry 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 243.83 249.09 <NA> that allows you see what 's in the water <unk> so we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 248.85 254.85 <NA> and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums <unk> so that
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 254.93 256.47 <NA> <unk> help you identify
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 256.24 257.97 <NA> what 's in the water <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 257.84 267.39 <NA> so we packed this prototype of a sensor <unk> and we shipped it to bangladesh <unk> so what was cool about this project was that beyond
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 267.08 274.75 <NA> addressing a local problem <unk> or looking at a local problem my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative to help 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 278.7 284.69 <NA> <unk> i was very compelled by doing the second experiments and i wanted to take it even further maybe addressing an
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 284.69 294.67 <NA> even harder problem <unk> and it 's also closer to my heart <unk> so i 'm half japanese and half french <unk> and maybe you remember in two thousand and eleven
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 294.18 304.13 <NA> there was a massive earthquake in japan <unk> it was so violent that it triggered several giant waves they are called tsunami and those tsunami
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 305.02 314.15 <NA> <unk> destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of japan <unk> more than fourteen thousand people died in an instant 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 315.16 322.04 <NA> also it damaged the nuclear power plant of fukushima the nuclear power plant just by the water 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 322 327.42 <NA> and today i read the reports and an average of three hundred
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 327.24 329.97 <NA> tons are leaking from the nuclear power plant
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 329.96 335.64 <NA> <unk> into the pacific ocean <unk> and today the whole pacific ocean has traces of contamination of <unk>
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 337.49 342.12 <NA> if you go outside on the west coast you can measure fukushima everywhere <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 341.93 349.99 <NA> but if you look at the map <unk> it can look like most of the radioactivity has been washed away from the japanese coast and most of it is now it looks like it 's safe it 's
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 351.69 362.26 <NA> <unk> reality is a bit more complicated than this so i 've been going to fukushima every year since the accident <unk> and i measure independently and with other scientists on land in the river
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 361.77 368.17 <NA> and this time we wanted to take the kids <unk> so of course we didn 't take the kids the parents wouldn 't allow that <unk>
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 370.98 379.61 <NA> <unk> but every night we would report to mission control different masks they 're wearing <unk> it could look like they didn 't take the work seriously but
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 379.87 387.48 <NA> <unk> they really did because they 're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life <unk> and so what we did with them
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 387.27 394.7 <NA> is that we 'd discuss the data we collected that day <unk> and talk about where we should be going next strategy itinerary etc 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 394.24 400.11 <NA> and to do this we built a very rough topographical map of the region around the nuclear
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 401.21 407.73 <NA> <unk> and so we built the elevation map <unk> we sprinkled pigments to represent real time data for radioactivity <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 407.73 412.3 <NA> and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 412.09 421.86 <NA> and with this we could see that the radioactive dust was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system and leaking into the ocean <unk> so it was a rough rough estimate <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 422.15 425.05 <NA> but with this in mind we organized this
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 425.7 430.34 <NA> <unk> which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant <unk> we are sailing
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 430.13 433.49 <NA> one point five kilometers away from the nuclear power plant 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 433.31 441.18 <NA> and with the help of the local fisherman <unk> we are collecting sediment from the seabed with a custom sediment sampler we we 've invented and built 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 441.18 443.98 <NA> we pack the sediment into small bags
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 444.06 448.7 <NA> <unk> we then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags that we send to different universities <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 448.7 454.43 <NA> and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity <unk> especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 455.1 460.16 <NA> that we will have improved the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 460.48 466.92 <NA> you can see a progression here we 've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 466.92 470.94 <NA> and it 's been super exciting to work at these different scales with also very simple
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 472.5 474.78 <NA> technologies <unk> but at the same time it 's been
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 475 476.83 <NA> increasingly frustrating
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 476.65 485.31 <NA> because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done <unk> we haven 't even started to try to solve the problems <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 485.15 489.99 <NA> and so i wonder if we should just take a leap and try to
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 489.65 494.76 <NA> invent better ways to do all these things <unk> and so
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 494.33 499.99 <NA> the classroom started to feel a little bit small so we found an industrial site in hong kong <unk> and
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 503.01 510.22 <NA> <unk> focused on social and environmental impact <unk> it 's in central hong kong <unk> and it 's a place we can work with wood metal <unk> 
CesarHarada_2015F 1 CesarHarada_2015F 509.73 514.45 <NA> chemistry a bit of biology a bit of optics basically you can build pretty much everything there
