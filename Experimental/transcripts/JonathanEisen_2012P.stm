JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 68.25 71.39 <NA> something festered inside me after this happened 
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 71.39 79.97 <NA> what i thought about was what caused the diabetes you see diabetes is an autoimmune disease where your body fights itself and at the time people thought

JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 84.07 93.42 <NA> had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen and then kill the cells that make insulin and this is what i thought for a long period of time and that 's in fact what
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 93.37 100.43 <NA> <unk> medicine and people have focused on quite a bit the microbes that do bad things and that 's where i need my
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 105.74 112.86 <NA> so i went yesterday i apologize i skipped a few of the talks and i went over to the national academy of sciences building
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 112.91 114.85 <NA> <unk> and they
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 114.66 120.24 <NA> sell toys <unk> giant microbes and
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 119.96 124.9 <NA> here we go <unk> so you you have caught <unk> flesh eating disease if you

JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 134.79 136.33 <NA> so
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 135.9 144.4 <NA> <unk> unfortunately or not surprisingly <unk> most of the microbes they sell at the national academy building are pathogens 
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 143.91 148.69 <NA> everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that 's what i was focusing on 
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 148.29 149.65 <NA> and
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 149.31 154.97 <NA> it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes and those microbes actually
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 155.43 158.99 <NA> do us good much of the time rather than killing us <unk> 
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 158.95 167.3 <NA> and so we 've known about this for some period of time people have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us i know you 're not paying attention to me but 
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 169.12 172.19 <NA> the microbes that cover us <unk> and
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 171.91 180 <NA> if you look at them in the microscope you can see that we actually have ten times as many cells of microbes on us as we have
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 180.25 186.27 <NA> human cells there 's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain

JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 190.79 204.82 <NA> and unfortunately if you want to learn about the microorganisms just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient and so we just heard about the dna sequencing it turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes and to understand them is to look at their dna
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 204.99 212.18 <NA> <unk> and that 's what i 've been doing for twenty years using dna sequencing <unk> collecting samples from various places including the human body <unk> 
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 212.18 224.99 <NA> reading the dna sequence and then using that dna sequencing to tell us about the microbes that are in a particular place <unk> and what 's amazing when you use this technology for example looking at humans we 're not just covered in a sea of
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 225.97 231.06 <NA> <unk> there are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us <unk>

JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 254.83 265.29 <NA> and illness differences between us <unk> and that comes back to the diabetes story i was telling you it turns out that people now think that one of the triggers for type one diabetes is not fighting <unk>
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 265.19 272.17 <NA> <unk> a pathogen <unk> but is in fact trying to miscommunicating with the microbes that live in and on you

JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 283.41 293.59 <NA> and so what i want to tell you about for a few minutes is what people have learned using dna sequencing techniques in particular to study the microbial cloud <unk>
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 293.54 302.83 <NA> that lives in and on us <unk> and i want to tell you a story about a personal project my first personal experience with studying the microbes on the human body actually came
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 304.9 313.53 <NA> <unk> corner from here at georgetown i gave a talk and a family friend who happened to be the dean of georgetown medical school was at the talk and came up to me afterwards saying 
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 313.53 320.4 <NA> they were doing a study of ileal transplants in people and they wanted to look at the microbes
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 320.17 329.94 <NA> after the transplants <unk> and so i started a collaboration with this person michael zasloff and thomas fishbein to look at the microbes that colonized these ilea
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 330.13 332.67 <NA> after they were transplanted into a recipient <unk> 
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 332.66 344.23 <NA> and i can tell you all the details about the microbial study that we did there but the reason i want to tell you this story is something really striking that they did at the beginning of this project <unk> they take the donor ileum <unk> 
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 344.02 352.02 <NA> which is filled with microbes from a donor and they have a recipient who might have a problem with their microbial community say crohn 's disease 
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 351.65 354.91 <NA> and they sterilized the donor ileum
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 354.92 364.24 <NA> cleaned out all the microbes and then put it in the recipient <unk> they did this because this was common practice in medicine even though it was
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 364.01 365.47 <NA> obvious
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 365.47 375.14 <NA> that this was not a good idea <unk> and fortunately in the course of this project the transplant surgeons and the other people decided <unk> forget common
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 376.06 383.41 <NA> <unk> we have to switch so they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial community in the ileum 
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 383.41 390.06 <NA> they leave the microbes with the donor and theoretically that might help the people who are receiving this
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 389.83 399.99 <NA> ileal transplant <unk> and so people this is a study that i did now in the last few years there 's been a great expansion in using dna technology to study the microbes
JonathanEisen_2012P 1 JonathanEisen_2012P 400.07 408.83 <NA> <unk> and on people there 's something called the human microbiome project that 's going on in the united states and metahit going on in europe and a lot of other projects and when people have done
