NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 55.77 67.99 <NA> i find weather extremely fascinating weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us <unk> so i use sculpture and music to make it not just visible but also tactile and audible 
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 67.65 74.09 <NA> all of my work begins very simple i extract information from a specific environment using very low tech
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 74.09 79.88 <NA> data collecting devices generally anything i can find in the hardware store <unk> i then compare my information

NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 114.7 124.32 <NA> i use natural reed <unk> because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that i cannot fully control that means that it is the numbers that control the form not me 
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 123.92 129.88 <NA> what i come up with are forms like these these forms are completely made up of weather data or science data
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 129.89 142.37 <NA> every colored bead every colored string represents a weather element and together these elements not only construct the form but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two dimensional graph 
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 142.37 149.81 <NA> when you step closer you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers the vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 150.4 161.87 <NA> <unk> so all the way around you have a 24 hour timeline but it 's also used to assign a temperature range on that grid i can then weave the high tide readings water temperature air temperature and moon phases <unk> 
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 161.56 171.86 <NA> i also translate weather data into musical scores and musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it so all of these <unk>
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 171.76 179.85 <NA> <unk> scores are made up of weather data every single color dot every single line is a weather element and together these variables construct a score
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 179.89 188.01 <NA> i use these scores to collaborate with musicians this is the one thousand nine hundred and thirteen trio performing one of my pieces at the milwaukee art museum <unk> 
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 188.09 191.68 <NA> meanwhile i use these scores as blueprints
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 191.35 200.63 <NA> to translate into sculptural forms like this that function still in the sense of being a three dimensional weather visualization but now they 're

NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 205.88 216.08 <NA> what i love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art versus science this piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it 
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 216.03 227.77 <NA> <unk> you place it in an art museum it becomes a sculpture you place it in a science museum it becomes a three dimensional visualization of data you place it in a music hall it all of a sudden becomes a musical score <unk> 
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 230.07 242.65 <NA> the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music the other reason why i really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point point into the complexity of science 
NathalieMiebach_2011G 1 NathalieMiebach_2011G 242.65 246.99 <NA> and not everyone has a ph d in science so for me that was my way into it thank you
