MattKillingsworth_2011X 1 MattKillingsworth_2011X 367.68 379.94 <NA> now you might look at this result and say <unk> okay <unk> sure on average people are less happy when they 're mind wandering but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn 't very enjoyable to begin with at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us
MattKillingsworth_2011X 1 MattKillingsworth_2011X 380.35 386.6 <NA> nope <unk> as it turns out people are less happy when they 're mind wandering no matter what they 're doing <unk>
