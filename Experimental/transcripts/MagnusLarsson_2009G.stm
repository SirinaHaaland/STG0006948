MagnusLarsson_2009G 1 MagnusLarsson_2009G 390.31 395.81 <NA> and the answer is perhaps that you use these guys bacillus pasteurii <unk>

MagnusLarsson_2009G 1 MagnusLarsson_2009G 469.72 477.49 <NA> how do we construct something like this well i 'll quickly show you two options the first is to create a kind of balloon structure fill it with bacteria 
MagnusLarsson_2009G 1 MagnusLarsson_2009G 477.49 479.94 <NA> then allow the sand to wash over the balloon
MagnusLarsson_2009G 1 MagnusLarsson_2009G 480.04 488.59 <NA> pop the balloon as it were disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it then a few years afterwards using permacultural strategies <unk> 
MagnusLarsson_2009G 1 MagnusLarsson_2009G 488.59 491.19 <NA> we green that part of the desert 
MagnusLarsson_2009G 1 MagnusLarsson_2009G 490.73 496.56 <NA> the second alternative would be to use injection piles so we pushed the piles down through the dune 
MagnusLarsson_2009G 1 MagnusLarsson_2009G 496.56 502.27 <NA> and we create an initial bacterial surface <unk> we then pull the piles up through the dune
MagnusLarsson_2009G 1 MagnusLarsson_2009G 502.03 504.82 <NA> and we 're able to create almost any conceivable shape

MagnusLarsson_2009G 1 MagnusLarsson_2009G 530.07 534.71 <NA> in sokoto and i realized that if i scaled them up they would provide me with good
