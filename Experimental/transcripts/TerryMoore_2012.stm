TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 21.22 24.99 <NA> now i know we learned that in math class <unk> but now it
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 33.38 34.77 <NA> <unk> that come from 
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 34.46 42.84 <NA> about six years ago i decided that i would learn arabic which turns out to be a supremely logical language 
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 42.83 54.36 <NA> to write a word or a phrase or a sentence in arabic is like crafting an equation because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information 
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 54.93 60.77 <NA> <unk> of the reasons so much of what we 've come to think of as western science and mathematics and engineering
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 60.77 70.49 <NA> was really worked out in the first few centuries of the common era by the persians and the arabs and the turks this includes the little system in arabic called

TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 84.91 92.22 <NA> the arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to europe which is to say spain
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 93.93 99.75 <NA> and when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a european
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 101.06 104.82 <NA> <unk> but there were problems one problem is
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 104.65 114.06 <NA> there there are some sounds in arabic that just don 't make it through a european voice box without lots of practice <unk> trust me on that one 
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 113.9 121.8 <NA> also <unk> those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in european languages 
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 121.79 129.49 <NA> here 's one of the culprits this is the letter sheen and it makes the sound we think of as sh
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 129.96 133.83 <NA> <unk> it 's also the very first letter of the word shalan 
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 133.84 141.07 <NA> which means something just like the the english word something some undefined unknown thing <unk> 
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 140.7 146.75 <NA> now in arabic we can make this definite by adding the definite article al so this is
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 147.83 154.31 <NA> the unknown thing <unk> and this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics such as this
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 155.08 157.25 <NA> <unk> derivation of proofs 
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 159.82 166.07 <NA> the problem for the medieval spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 165.58 175.32 <NA> is that the letter sheen and the word shalan can 't be rendered into spanish because spanish doesn 't have that sh that sh sound
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 177.26 182.14 <NA> <unk> they created a rule in which they borrowed the ck sound ck 
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 182.14 187.53 <NA> sound from the classical greek in the form of the letter kai 
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 187.4 199.75 <NA> later when this material was translated into a common european language <unk> which is to say latin <unk> they simply replaced the greek kai with the latin x and once that

TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 202.95 208.32 <NA> it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost six hundred years 
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 208.32 213.77 <NA> but now we have the answer to our question why is it that x is the unknown 
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 213.53 216.44 <NA> x is the unknown because
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 216.26 219.25 <NA> you can 't say sh in spanish 
TerryMoore_2012 1 TerryMoore_2012 221.31 223.25 <NA> and i thought that was worth sharing
