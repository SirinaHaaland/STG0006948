SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 13.33 21.77 <NA> <unk> i want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genomes of living people and extinct humans <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 21.46 29.97 <NA> but before doing that i just briefly want to remind you about what you already know that our genomes our genetic material are stored in almost all cells
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 30.02 36.9 <NA> <unk> in our bodies in chromosomes in the form of dna <unk> which is this famous double helical molecule <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 36.62 45.09 <NA> and the genetic information is contained in the form of a sequence of four bases abbreviated with the letters a <unk> t c and g 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 44.78 50.17 <NA> and the information is there twice one on each strand which is important
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 50.1 59.56 <NA> <unk> because when new cells are formed these strands come apart new strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates in an almost perfect process <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 59.46 68.44 <NA> but nothing of course in nature is totally perfect so sometimes an error is made and a wrong letter is built in <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 68.13 76.99 <NA> and we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare dna sequences among us here in the room for example <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 76.99 79.91 <NA> if we compare my genome to the genome of
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 79.87 86.36 <NA> <unk> you approximately every one thousand two hundred one thousand three hundred letters will differ between us 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 86.14 90.91 <NA> and these mutations accumulate approximately as a function of time <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 90.92 99.11 <NA> so if we add in a chimpanzee here we will see more differences approximately one letter in a hundred will differ from a chimpanzee <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 99.13 104.97 <NA> and if you 're then interested in the history of a piece of dna or the whole genome you can reconstruct the
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 104.96 114.04 <NA> <unk> history of the dna with those differences you observe <unk> and generally we depict our ideas about this history in the form of trees like this 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 114.04 125.32 <NA> in this case it 's very simple the two human dna sequences go back to a common ancestor quite recently <unk> farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 125.85 130.93 <NA> <unk> and because these mutations happen approximately as a function of time 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 130.47 140.38 <NA> you can transform these differences to estimates of time where the two humans typically will share a common ancestor about half a million years ago <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 140.38 145 <NA> and with the chimpanzees it will be in the order of five million years ago <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 144.63 149.9 <NA> so what has now happened in the last few years is that there are account technologies around that allow you to
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 150.49 153.53 <NA> <unk> many pieces of dna very quickly <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 153.13 158.06 <NA> so we can now in a matter of hours <unk> determine a whole human genome 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 158.06 164.24 <NA> each of us of course contains two human genomes one from our mothers and one from our fathers <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 163.75 166.8 <NA> and they are around three billion
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 166.44 168.53 <NA> such letters long <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 168.07 176.72 <NA> and we will find that the two genomes in me or one genome of mine we want to use will have about three million differences in the order of that 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 177.07 179.85 <NA> and what you can then also begin to do is to say
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 180.11 184.26 <NA> <unk> are these genetic differences distributed across the world 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 184.13 190.11 <NA> and if you do that you find a certain amount of genetic variation in africa <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 189.62 195.07 <NA> and if you look outside africa you actually find less genetic variation 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 195.07 203.77 <NA> this is surprising of course because in the order of six to eight times fewer people live in africa than outside africa
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 204.69 208.84 <NA> <unk> people inside africa have more genetic variation <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 208.56 218.02 <NA> moreover almost all these genetic variants we see outside africa have closely related dna sequences that you find inside africa <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 217.68 225.28 <NA> but if you look in africa there is a component of the genetic variation that has no close relatives outside 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 225.39 229.97 <NA> so a model to explain this is that a part of the african variation
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 230.17 235.1 <NA> <unk> but not all of it [ has ] gone out and colonized the rest of the world <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 235.21 243.14 <NA> and together with the methods to date these genetic differences this has led to the insight that modern humans
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 242.68 252.33 <NA> humans that are essentially indistinguishable from you and me evolved in africa <unk> quite recently between one hundred and two hundred thousand years ago
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 254.9 260.97 <NA> <unk> hundred and fifty thousand years ago or so went out of africa to colonize the rest of the world <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 260.72 272.28 <NA> so what i often like to say is that from a genomic perspective <unk> we are all africans we either live inside africa today <unk> or in quite recent exile 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 272 273.7 <NA> another
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 273.54 279.94 <NA> consequence of this recent origin of modern humans is that genetic variants are generally
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 279.87 289.96 <NA> <unk> distributed widely in the world in many places <unk> and they tend to vary as gradients from a bird <unk> 's eye perspective at least <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 289.83 301.01 <NA> and since there are many genetic variants and they have different such gradients <unk> this means that if we determine a dna sequence a genome from one individual
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 300.85 303.08 <NA> we can quite accurately
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 302.85 304.97 <NA> estimate where that person comes from
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 305.1 310.31 <NA> provided that its parents or grandparents haven 't moved around too much <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 310.12 319.64 <NA> but does this then mean as many people tend to think that there are huge genetic differences between groups of people on different continents for example <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 319.27 324.48 <NA> well we can begin to ask those questions also there is for example a project
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 324.3 329.97 <NA> that 's underway to sequence a thousand individuals their genomes from different parts of the world
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 330.08 339 <NA> they 've sequenced one hundred and eighty five africans from two populations in africa [ they 've ] sequenced approximately equally [ as ] many people
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 338.83 342.3 <NA> in europe and in china <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 341.93 351.67 <NA> and we can begin to say how much variance do we find how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequences and it 's a lot
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 355.13 364.69 <NA> <unk> but we can then ask are there any absolute differences between africans and non africans perhaps the biggest difference most of us would imagine existed <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 364.35 374.98 <NA> and with absolute difference and i mean a difference where people inside africa at a certain position where all individuals one hundred percent have one letter <unk>
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 374.93 379.97 <NA> <unk> and everybody outside africa has another letter <unk> and the answer to that
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 380.05 384.89 <NA> <unk> among those millions of differences is that there is not a single such position 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 385.72 400.08 <NA> this may be surprising <unk> maybe a single individual is misclassified or so <unk> so we can relax the criterion a bit and say how many positions do we find where ninety five percent of people in africa have one variant <unk> ninety five
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 400.04 403.59 <NA> <unk> percent another variant <unk> and the number of that is twelve <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 403.7 413.91 <NA> so this is very surprising <unk> it means that when we look at people and see a person from africa and a person from europe or asia <unk> we cannot <unk>
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 413.86 424.89 <NA> for a single position in the genome with one hundred percent accuracy predict what the person would carry <unk> and only for twelve positions can we hope to be ninety five percent right <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 425.19 433.12 <NA> <unk> this may be surprising because we can of course look at these people and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 432.93 442.6 <NA> so what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so readily see facial features skin color hair structure
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 442.17 446.18 <NA> are not determined by single genes with big effects <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 446.18 453.34 <NA> but are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 453.51 454.94 <NA> there is another
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 455.1 467.48 <NA> thing with those traits that we so easily observe in each other that i think is worthwhile to consider and that is that in a very literal sense <unk> they 're really on the surface of our bodies <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 467.47 474.99 <NA> they are what we just said facial features <unk> hair structure skin color there are also a number of features that vary
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 475 481.08 <NA> between continents like that that have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 480.62 487.56 <NA> or that have to do with how our immune systems deal with microbes that try to invade our bodies <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 487.16 493.86 <NA> but so those are all parts of our bodies where we very directly interact with our environment in a direct
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 493.4 500.14 <NA> confrontation if you like it 's easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 500.25 507.76 <NA> <unk> were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes that are involved in them <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 507.48 517.99 <NA> but if we look on other parts of our bodies where we don 't directly interact with the environment our kidneys our livers our hearts there is no way to say by just looking <unk>
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 517.89 521.32 <NA> <unk> at these organs <unk> where in the world they would come from <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 522.63 529.88 <NA> so there 's another interesting thing that comes from this realization that humans have a recent
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 529.84 530.85 <NA> <unk> common
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 530.46 532.55 <NA> origin in africa <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 532.39 542.36 <NA> and that is that when those humans emerged around one hundred thousand years ago or so they were not alone on the planet there were other forms of humans around 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 541.99 545.43 <NA> most famously perhaps neanderthals
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 545.22 549.87 <NA> these robust forms of humans compared to the left here with
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 550.37 552.93 <NA> <unk> modern human skeleton on the right
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 552.56 559.02 <NA> that existed in western asia and europe since several hundreds of thousands of years 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 558.62 564.15 <NA> so an interesting question is what happened when we met what happened to the neanderthals 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 563.84 574.74 <NA> and to begin to answer such questions my research group since over twenty five years now works on methods to extract dna from remains of neanderthals <unk>
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 574.69 579.27 <NA> and extinct animals that are tens of thousands of years old 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 580.05 587.57 <NA> <unk> involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the dna how you convert it to a form you can sequence you
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 587.57 594.37 <NA> have to work very carefully to avoid contamination of experiments with dna from yourself <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 594.51 596.08 <NA> and
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 595.59 604.97 <NA> this then in conjunction with these methods that allow very many dna molecules to be sequenced very rapidly <unk> allowed us last year to present
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 605.02 617.03 <NA> <unk> the first version of the neanderthal genome so that any one of you can now look on the internet on the neanderthal genome or at least on the fifty five percent of it that we 've been able to reconstruct so far <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 616.84 621.98 <NA> and you can begin to compare it to the genomes of people who live today <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 621.97 629.55 <NA> and one question that you may then want to ask is what happened when we met <unk> did we mix or not
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 629.99 635.22 <NA> <unk> and the way to ask that question is to look at the neanderthal that comes from southern europe
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 634.99 639.06 <NA> and compare it to genomes of people who live today <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 638.87 643.04 <NA> so we then look to do this with pairs of individuals 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 643.04 650.14 <NA> starting with two africans looking at the two african genomes finding places where they differ from each other
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 650.28 656.71 <NA> <unk> and in each case ask what is a neanderthal like does it match one african or the other african 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 656.46 667.12 <NA> we would expect there to be no difference because neanderthals were never in africa <unk> they should be equal have no reason to be closer to one african than another african <unk>
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 667.07 675.02 <NA> <unk> and that 's indeed the case <unk> statistically speaking there is no difference in how often the neanderthal matches one african or the other
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 676.03 681.92 <NA> <unk> but this is different if we now look at the european individual and an african then 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 681.92 687.77 <NA> significantly more often <unk> does a neanderthal match the european rather than the african 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 687.76 696.53 <NA> the same is true if we look at a chinese individual versus an african the neanderthal will match the chinese individual more often 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 696.58 701.51 <NA> this may also be surprising because the neanderthals were never in china
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 701.02 703.07 <NA> so the model we 've
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 702.61 704.91 <NA> proposed to explain this
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 704.92 712.35 <NA> is that when modern humans came out of africa sometime after one hundred thousand years ago <unk> they met neanderthals <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 711.95 717.33 <NA> presumably they did so first in the middle east where there were neanderthals living 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 716.9 729.97 <NA> if they then mixed with each other there then those modern humans that became the ancestors of everyone outside africa carried with them this neanderthal component in their genome to the rest of the world
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 730.01 738.61 <NA> <unk> so that today the people living outside africa have about two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 738.3 749.9 <NA> so having now a neanderthal genome on hand as a reference point and having the technologies to look at ancient remains and extract the dna we can
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 750.19 758.31 <NA> <unk> begin to apply them elsewhere in the world <unk> and the first place we 've done that is in southern siberia in the altai mountains
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 758.07 762.67 <NA> at a place called denisova a cave site in this mountain here 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 762.67 775.14 <NA> where archeologists in two thousand and eight found a tiny little piece of bone this is a copy of it that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 776.84 785.5 <NA> <unk> and it was well enough preserved so we could determine the dna from this individual even to a greater extent than for the neanderthals actually 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 785.5 790.2 <NA> and start relating it to the neanderthal genome and to people today <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 790.07 799.86 <NA> and we found that this individual shared a common origin for his dna sequences with neanderthals around six hundred and forty thousand years ago <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 799.43 804.88 <NA> and further back eight hundred thousand years ago is there a common origin with present day
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 804.96 806.26 <NA> <unk> humans <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 806.04 814.27 <NA> so this individual comes from a population that shares an origin with neanderthals but far back and then have a long independent history 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 814.27 824.57 <NA> we call this group of humans that we then described for the first time from this tiny tiny little piece of bone the denisovans after this place where they were first described
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 825.91 828.15 <NA> <unk> we can then ask for denisovans
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 827.91 834.62 <NA> the same things as for the neanderthals <unk> did they mix with ancestors of present day people 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 834.37 846.02 <NA> if we ask that question and compare the denisovan genome to people around the world <unk> we surprisingly find no evidence of denisovan dna in any people living
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 846.07 854.73 <NA> even close to siberia today <unk> but we do find it in papua new guinea and in other islands in melanesia and the pacific
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 855.17 865.5 <NA> so this presumably means that these denisovans had been more widespread in the past since we don 't think that the ancestors of melanesians were ever in siberia <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 865.01 870.24 <NA> so from studying these genomes of extinct humans <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 869.93 875.17 <NA> we 're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like when modern humans started
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 875.1 876.82 <NA> <unk> coming out of africa 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 876.33 885.18 <NA> in the west there were neanderthals in the east there were denisovans maybe other forms of humans too that we 've not yet described <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 885.19 895.45 <NA> we don 't know quite where the borders between these people were but we know that in southern siberia <unk> there were both neanderthals and denisovans at least at some time in the past <unk>

SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 905.11 915.32 <NA> <unk> to spread over the world <unk> and somewhere in southeast asia they meet denisovans and mix with them and continue on out into the pacific <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 915.13 919.09 <NA> and then these earlier forms of humans disappear <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 919.09 928.92 <NA> but they live on a little bit today in some of us in that people outside of africa have two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 928.69 929.85 <NA> and people in
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 929.81 935.46 <NA> <unk> melanesia actually have an additional five percent approximately from the denisovans <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 935.72 945.21 <NA> does this then mean that there is after all some absolute difference between people outside africa and inside africa in that people outside africa <unk>
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 945.11 951.78 <NA> <unk> have this old component in their genome from these extinct forms of humans <unk> whereas africans do not <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 955.11 961.57 <NA> <unk> modern humans emerged somewhere in africa <unk> they spread across africa also of course <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 961.37 971.62 <NA> and there were older earlier forms of humans there and since we mixed elsewhere i 'm pretty sure that one day when we will perhaps have a genome of also these earlier forms <unk>
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 971.52 977.86 <NA> <unk> in africa <unk> we will find that they have also mixed with early modern humans in africa <unk> 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 979.9 984.59 <NA> <unk> have we learned from studying genomes of present day humans and
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 984.43 986.22 <NA> extinct humans 
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 986.22 994.56 <NA> we learn perhaps many things <unk> but one thing that i find sort of important to mention is that i think
SvantePaabo_2011G 1 SvantePaabo_2011G 994.23 1004.6 <NA> the lesson is that we have always mixed we mixed with these earlier forms of humans <unk> wherever we met them and we mixed with each other ever since
