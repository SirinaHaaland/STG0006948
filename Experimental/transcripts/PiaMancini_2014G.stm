PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 14.11 23.56 <NA> that we can all agree that we 're moving towards a new model of the state and society <unk> but we 're absolutely clueless
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 23.56 29.97 <NA> as to what this is or what it should be <unk> it seems like we need to have a conversation
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 30.52 37.29 <NA> about democracy in our day and age <unk> let 's think about it this way we <unk>
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 38.63 43.9 <NA> <unk> citizens doing our very very best to interact with
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 45.95 49.93 <NA> <unk> institutions that are based on an information technology
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 52.59 56.02 <NA> <unk> let 's have a look at some of the characteristics of this system 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 55.59 63.07 <NA> first of all <unk> it 's designed for an information technology that 's over five hundred years old <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 63.07 72.53 <NA> and the best possible system that could be designed for it is one where the few make daily decisions in the name of the many <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 72.3 75.05 <NA> and the many get to vote once
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 75.19 77.06 <NA> <unk> every couple of years 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 77.08 82.85 <NA> in the second place the costs of participating in this system are incredibly high <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 82.85 88.64 <NA> you either have to have a fair bit of money and influence or you have to
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 88.27 98.69 <NA> devote your entire life to politics you have to become a party member and slowly start working up the ranks until maybe <unk>
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 98.64 103.97 <NA> one day you 'll get to sit at a table where a decision is being made <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 104.84 109.36 <NA> <unk> least the language of the system it 's incredibly cryptic it
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 109.36 115.23 <NA> 's done for lawyers by lawyers <unk> and no one else can understand <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 115.13 124.87 <NA> so it 's a system where we can choose our authorities <unk> but we are completely left out on how those authorities reach their
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 126.93 135 <NA> <unk> in a day where a new information technology allows us to participate globally in any conversation
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 135.01 146.59 <NA> our barriers of information are completely lowered and we can more than ever before express our desires and our concerns 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 146.31 152.83 <NA> our political system remains the same for the past two hundred years
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 152.43 154.94 <NA> and expects us to be contented
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 155.19 160.52 <NA> with being simply passive recipients of a monologue <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 160.42 170 <NA> so it 's really not surprising that this kind of system is only able to produce two kinds of results <unk> silence
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 169.87 174.84 <NA> or noise <unk> silence in terms of citizens not
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 175.91 178.74 <NA> <unk> simply not wanting to participate 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 178.25 181.95 <NA> there 's this commonplace [ idea ] that i truly truly dislike 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 181.75 189 <NA> and it 's this idea that we citizens are naturally apathetic that we shun commitment 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 189 203.29 <NA> but can you really blame us for not jumping at the opportunity of going to the middle of the city in the middle of a working day to attend physically a public hearing that has no impact whatsoever
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 205.31 214.63 <NA> is bound to happen between a system that no longer represents <unk> nor has any dialogue capacity <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 214.17 222.38 <NA> and citizens that are increasingly used to representing themselves and then we find noise
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 230.74 239.31 <NA> their citizens have access to the ballot boxes <unk> but they still feel the need they need to take to the streets
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 239.31 245.48 <NA> in order to be heard to me <unk> it seems like
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 247.26 251.97 <NA> slogan that was the basis for the formation of our modern democracies
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 254.42 262.59 <NA> <unk> representation can now be updated to no representation without a conversation 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 262.82 264.96 <NA> we want
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 264.59 267.09 <NA> our seat at the table 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 267.35 275.23 <NA> and rightly so <unk> but in order to be part of this conversation we need to know what we want to do next
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 276.09 281.45 <NA> <unk> because political action is being able to move from agitation
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 281.24 283.48 <NA> to construction 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 283.35 292.12 <NA> my generation has been incredibly good at using new networks and technologies to organize protests 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 291.66 296.5 <NA> protests that were able to successfully impose agendas <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 296.22 299.9 <NA> roll back extremely pernicious legislation
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 301.24 307.07 <NA> <unk> authoritarian governments and we should be immensely proud of this 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 307.3 315.06 <NA> but we also must admit that we haven 't been good at using those same networks and technologies
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 314.87 320.54 <NA> to successfully articulate an alternative to what we 're seeing
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 320.2 329.97 <NA> and find the consensus and build the alliances that are needed to make it happen <unk> and so the risk that we face is that we
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 329.93 339.28 <NA> <unk> can create these huge power vacuums that will very quickly get filled up by de facto powers like the military
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 339.28 346.98 <NA> or highly motivated and already organized groups that generally lie on the extremes <unk> but our <unk>
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 347.98 354.91 <NA> is neither just a matter of voting once every couple of years <unk> but it 's not either the
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 354.84 358.18 <NA> <unk> ability to bring millions onto the streets 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 358.44 365.21 <NA> so the question i 'd like to raise here and i do believe it 's the most important question we need to answer 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 365.21 373.9 <NA> is this one if internet is the new printing press <unk> then what is democracy for the internet era 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 374.52 377.96 <NA> what institutions do we want to build for
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 381.1 383.33 <NA> i don 't have the answer <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 383.26 386.4 <NA> just in case i don 't think anyone does <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 386.4 399.32 <NA> but i truly believe we can 't afford to ignore this question anymore so i 'd like to share our experience and what we 've learned so far and hopefully contribute two cents to this conversation 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 399.49 404.73 <NA> two years ago with a group of friends from argentina <unk> we started thinking
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 405.02 411.69 <NA> <unk> can we get our representatives our elected representatives to represent us 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 413.12 422.44 <NA> marshall mcluhan once said that politics is solving today 's problems with yesterday 's tools 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 422.44 429.94 <NA> so the question that motivated us was can we try and solve some of today 's problems with the tools that we
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 429.81 437.14 <NA> <unk> use every single day of our lives our first approach was to design and develop a piece of software called <unk>
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 439.65 450.02 <NA> <unk> is an <unk> open source web application that is designed to become a bridge between citizens and their elected representatives to make it easier for
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 452.23 456.65 <NA> <unk> from our everyday lives <unk> so first of all you can get informed
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 456.34 466.64 <NA> so every new project that gets introduced in congress gets immediately translated and explained in plain language on this platform <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 466.21 474.69 <NA> but we all know that social change is not going to come from just knowing more information but from doing
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 475 484.71 <NA> something with it so better access to information should lead to a conversation about what we 're going to do next and democracyos allows for that 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 484.28 491.79 <NA> because we believe that democracy is not just a matter of stacking up preferences one on top of each other 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 491.42 499.47 <NA> but that our healthy and robust public debate should be once again one of its fundamental values 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 500.58 502.21 <NA> <unk> is about persuading
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 502.04 512.44 <NA> and being persuaded <unk> it 's about reaching a consensus as much as finding a proper way of channeling our disagreement 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 512.04 514.39 <NA> and finally you can vote
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 513.96 518.43 <NA> how you would like your elected representative to vote 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 518.43 526.46 <NA> and if you do not feel comfortable voting on a certain issue you can always delegate your vote to someone else allowing for a
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 526.28 529.97 <NA> dynamic and emerging social leadership
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 530.8 544.58 <NA> it suddenly became very easy for us to simply compare these results with how our representatives were voting in congress <unk> but it also became very evident that technology was not going to do the trick 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 544.21 550.94 <NA> what we needed to do to was to find actors that were able to grab this
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 550.48 554.82 <NA> distributed knowledge in society and use it
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 554.96 558 <NA> <unk> make better and more fair decisions <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 557.72 563.78 <NA> so we reached out to traditional political parties and we offered them democracyos 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 563.79 568.09 <NA> we said look here you have a platform that you can use to build
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 579.93 581.71 <NA> <unk> like little kids
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 581.58 588.19 <NA> <unk> amongst other things we were called naive <unk> and i must be honest i think in hindsight <unk> we were <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 587.96 593.57 <NA> because the challenges that we face they 're not technological <unk> they 're cultural 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 593.57 599.5 <NA> political parties were never willing to change the way they make their decisions <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 599.25 604.94 <NA> so it suddenly became a bit obvious that if we wanted to move forward with this idea
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 604.98 607.31 <NA> we needed to do it ourselves <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 607.57 619.76 <NA> and so we took quite a leap of faith <unk> and in august last year we founded our own political party <unk> el partido de la red or the net party in the city of buenos aires <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 619.72 629.46 <NA> and taking an even bigger leap of faith <unk> we ran for elections in october last year with this idea
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 630.05 641.34 <NA> <unk> if we want a seat in congress <unk> our candidate <unk> our representatives were always going to vote according to what citizens decided on democracyos 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 641.21 650.25 <NA> every single project that got introduced in congress <unk> we were going vote according to what citizens decided on an online platform <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 650.21 654.01 <NA> it was our way of hacking the political system
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 654.96 660.37 <NA> <unk> understood that if we wanted to become part of the conversation to have a seat at the table <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 660.17 668.21 <NA> we needed to become valid stakeholders <unk> and the only way of doing it is to play by the system rules <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 668.03 676.51 <NA> but we were hacking it in the sense that we were radically changing the way a political party makes its decisions 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 676.51 679.97 <NA> for the first time <unk> we were making our decisions
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 680.25 684.91 <NA> together with those who we were affecting directly
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 684.75 686.96 <NA> by those decisions it
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 686.89 692.81 <NA> was a very very bold move for a two month old party in the city of buenos aires 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 692.41 700.05 <NA> but it got attention <unk> we got twenty two thousand votes that 's one point two percent of the votes <unk> and we came
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 700.04 703.02 <NA> <unk> in second for the local options <unk> 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 702.83 711 <NA> so even if that wasn 't enough to win a seat in congress <unk> it was enough for us to become part of the conversation 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 710.54 720.19 <NA> to the extent that next month congress <unk> as an institution is launching for the first time in argentina 's history
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 721.57 724.96 <NA> to discuss with the citizens <unk> three pieces of
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 726.69 732.34 <NA> <unk> on urban transportation and one on the use of public space of course 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 732 741.97 <NA> our elected representatives are not saying yes we 're going to vote according to what citizens decide but they 're willing to try they 're willing to open <unk>
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 741.87 749.8 <NA> <unk> up a new space for citizen engagement and hopefully they 'll be willing to listen as well 
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 755.29 763.76 <NA> <unk> it by destroying it but by rewiring it with the tools that internet affords us now but
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 763.33 775.26 <NA> a real challenge is to find to design to create to empower those connectors that are able to innovate to transform
PiaMancini_2014G 1 PiaMancini_2014G 775.97 780.13 <NA> <unk> and silence into signal and finally bring our democracies
