RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1043.16 1047.37 <NA> <unk> so these are tuned toes there are six of them
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1047.36 1053.38 <NA> <unk> and they use the principles that i just talked about collectively for the blueprint
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1055.98 1067.24 <NA> <unk> so this is not using any suction any glue and it will ultimately when it 's attached to the robot it 's as biologically inspired as the as the animal hopefully be able to climb
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1066.75 1074.9 <NA> any kind of a surface here you see it next going up the side of a building at stanford
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1076.57 1081.53 <NA> <unk> it 's a foot climbing it 's not the whole robot yet we 're working on it now you can see how it 's attaching these tuned structures
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1081.53 1089.4 <NA> allow the spines friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs to grab onto very challenging difficult
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1088.98 1097.19 <NA> surfaces <unk> and so they were able to get this thing this is now sped up twenty times can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor 
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1096.94 1100.05 <NA> ok you can visualize this now it 's not impossible it 's a very
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1101.75 1103.68 <NA> <unk> but more to come later to finish <unk> 
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1103.25 1107.15 <NA> we 've gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built <unk> 
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1106.93 1115.02 <NA> we 've learned we should distribute control to smart parts don 't put it all in the brain <unk> but put some of the control in tuned feet <unk> legs and even body 
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1114.82 1121.68 <NA> that nature uses hybrid solutions not a single solution to these problems and they 're integrated and beautifully robust 
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1121.68 1125.05 <NA> and third <unk> we believe strongly that we do not
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1125 1135.35 <NA> want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology and use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there to make potentially something
RobertFull_2005 1 RobertFull_2005 1135.35 1136.37 <NA> better than nature
