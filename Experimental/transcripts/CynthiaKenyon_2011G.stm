CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 12.91 21.23 <NA> <unk> have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer and put off aging <unk> this is a dream of the ages but scientists
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 21.23 28.86 <NA> have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible <unk> they thought you just wear out there 's nothing you can do about it kind of like an old shoe
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 29.96 35.52 <NA> <unk> if you look in nature <unk> you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 35.18 47.61 <NA> now these animals are different from one another because they have different genes <unk> so that suggests that somewhere in these genes somewhere in the dna are genes for aging <unk> genes that allow them to have different lifespans <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 47.18 54.94 <NA> so if there are genes like that <unk> then you can imagine that if you could change one of the genes in an experiment an aging gene
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 54.95 58.99 <NA> maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 58.62 66.34 <NA> and if you could do that then you could find the genes for aging and if they exist and you can find them then maybe one could eventually do something about it 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 66.54 74.96 <NA> so we 've set out to look for genes that control aging and we didn 't study any of these animals instead we studied a little tiny round worm called c 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 75.82 84.62 <NA> <unk> which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence <unk> and we were really optimistic that we could find something because there had been a report of a long lived mutant <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 84.31 97.43 <NA> so we started to change genes at random looking for long lived animals and we were very lucky to find that mutations that damage one single gene called daf 2 doubled the lifespan of the little worm <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 97.42 99.99 <NA> so you can see in black <unk> after a month
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 100.67 109.24 <NA> <unk> that 's why we like to study them for studies of aging in black <unk> after a month the normal worms are all dead <unk> but at that time <unk> most of the mutant worms
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 109.03 117.84 <NA> are still alive <unk> and it isn 't until twice as long that they 're all dead <unk> and now i want to show what they actually look like in this movie here <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 117.8 126.18 <NA> so the first thing you 're going to see is the normal worm when it 's about college student age a young adult it 's quite a cute little fellow <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 127.28 129.22 <NA> and next you 're going to see the
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 130.01 137.53 <NA> when it 's young so this animal is going to live twice as long is it miserable it doesn 't seem to be it 's active you can 't tell the difference really 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 137.53 142 <NA> and they can be completely fertile have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 141.81 150.05 <NA> now get out your handkerchiefs here you 're going to see in just two weeks the normal worms are old <unk> you can see the little head moving down at the bottom there
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 150.79 157.61 <NA> <unk> everything else is just lying there the animal 's clearly in the nursing home <unk> and if you look at the tissues of the animal they 're starting to deteriorate 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 157.6 165.66 <NA> you know even if you 've never seen one of these little c elegans which probably most of you haven 't seen one you can tell they 're old isn 't that interesting so there 's something about
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 165.44 168.8 <NA> aging that 's kind of universal <unk> and now here is the <unk>
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 169.86 175.05 <NA> one gene is changed out of twenty thousand and look at it it 's the same age but it 's not in the nursing
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 179.93 186.34 <NA> <unk> what 's really cool it 's aging more slowly it takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 186.34 194.65 <NA> and when i tell people about this they tend to think of maybe an eighty or ninety year old person who looks really good for being ninety or eighty but it 's really more like this
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 205.14 212.8 <NA> <unk> and you say well how old are you she says i 'm sixty that 's what it 's like and you would never know you would never know until she told you 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 217.83 222.68 <NA> so what is the daf 2 gene well as you know genes which are part of the dna 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 222.68 229.82 <NA> they 're instructions to make a protein that does something and the daf 2 gene encodes a hormone receptor
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 229.93 240.08 <NA> <unk> so what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell so part of it is like a baseball glove part of it 's on the outside and it 's catching the hormone as it <unk>
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 239.98 245.51 <NA> <unk> comes by in green <unk> and the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 254.96 261.93 <NA> <unk> the animal lives longer <unk> so that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 261.95 269.55 <NA> that 's what that arrow means it speeds up aging it makes it go faster <unk> so it 's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself speeding up aging
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 269.69 273.93 <NA> so this is altogether really really interesting it says that
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 273.56 279.82 <NA> aging is subject to control by the genes and specifically by hormones <unk> so what kind of hormones are
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 280.1 286.67 <NA> there 's lots of hormones there 's testosterone adrenalin you know about a lot of them these hormones are similar to
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 286.49 289 <NA> hormones that we have in our bodies 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 288.54 302.77 <NA> the daf 2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and igf 1 now you 've all heard of at least insulin insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 304.9 312.87 <NA> <unk> growth <unk> so these functions were known for these hormones for a long time <unk> but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 312.69 314.75 <NA> maybe they also affect aging 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 314.75 326.69 <NA> and it 's looking like that 's the case so after we made our discoveries with little c elegans people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking if we made the same daf 2 mutation the hormone receptor mutation 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 326.26 329.97 <NA> in other animals will they live longer and that is the
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 329.93 337.7 <NA> <unk> case in flies <unk> if you change this hormone pathway in flies they live longer and also in mice and mice are mammals like us <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 337.71 350.17 <NA> so it 's an ancient pathway because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution such that it still works in all these animals and also the common precursor also gave rise to people so maybe it 's working in people the same way
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 350.37 359.47 <NA> <unk> and there are hints of this so for example there was one study that was done in a population of ashkenazi jews in new york city and just like any population most of the people
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 359.01 365.53 <NA> live to be about seventy or eighty <unk> but some live to be ninety or one hundred and what they found was that
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 365.04 374.96 <NA> people who lived to ninety or one hundred were more likely to have daf 2 mutations that is changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for igf 1 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 377.26 378.56 <NA> <unk> made the gene
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 379.06 383.63 <NA> not act as well as the normal gene would have acted <unk> it damaged the gene
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 383.62 388.77 <NA> so those are hints suggesting that humans are susceptible to the effects of the hormones
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 388.59 390.11 <NA> for aging <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 389.95 404.97 <NA> so the next question of course is is there any effect on age related disease as you age you 're much more likely to get cancer <unk> alzheimer 's disease <unk> heart disease all sorts of diseases it turns out that these long lived mutants are more resistant to
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 404.9 408.91 <NA> <unk> all these diseases they hardly get cancer <unk> and when they do it 's not as severe <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 408.91 416.82 <NA> so it 's really interesting <unk> and it makes sense in a way that they 're still young so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 416.9 419.83 <NA> <unk> so it suggests that if we could
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 419.62 429.67 <NA> have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age related diseases all at once
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 430.05 434.54 <NA> <unk> so how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging <unk> how could that work 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 434.33 437.74 <NA> well it turns out that in the daf 2 mutants 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 437.74 445.93 <NA> a whole lot of genes are switched on in the dna that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues and repair damage <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 445.62 454.85 <NA> and the way that they 're switched on is by a gene regulator protein called foxo so in a daf 2 mutant you see that i have the x drawn here
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 455.05 464 <NA> <unk> the receptor the receptor isn 't working as well under those conditions the foxo protein in blue has gone into the nucleus that little compartment there in the middle of the cell
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 463.8 470.96 <NA> and it 's sitting down on a gene binding to it you see one gene there are lots of genes actually that bind on foxo and it 's just sitting on one of them 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 470.47 474.78 <NA> so foxo turns on a lot of genes and the genes it turns on includes antioxidant
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 477.5 479.28 <NA> <unk> whose protein products
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 478.94 488.55 <NA> actually help other proteins to function well to fold correctly and function correctly and it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they 're damaged 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 488.3 494.53 <NA> dna repair genes are are more active in these animals <unk> and the immune system is more active <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 494.53 499.96 <NA> and many of these different genes we 've shown actually contribute to the long lifespan of the
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 500.91 507.71 <NA> <unk> so it 's really interesting these animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 507.71 513.94 <NA> they have the ability to protect themselves from many kinds of damage <unk> which we think makes them live longer <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 514.23 519.14 <NA> so what about the normal worm well when the daf 2 receptor is active <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 519.14 524.9 <NA> then it triggers a series of events that prevent foxo from getting into the nucleus where the
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 525.88 527.69 <NA> <unk> so it can 't turn the genes on 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 527.52 538.19 <NA> that 's how it works that 's why we don 't see the long lifespan until we have the daf 2 mutant <unk> but what good is this for the worm <unk> well we think that insulin and igf 1 hormones are hormones that are particularly <unk>
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 538.09 544.19 <NA> <unk> active under favorable conditions in the good times when food is plentiful and there 's not a lot of stress in the environment 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 551.33 558.72 <NA> <unk> we think is that <unk> under conditions of stress <unk> the levels of these hormones drop for example having limited food supply
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 558.98 567.66 <NA> <unk> and that we think is registered by the animal as a danger signal a signal that things are not okay and that it should roll out its protective capacity <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 567.65 572.32 <NA> so it activates foxo foxo goes to the dna and that triggers
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 572.11 579.61 <NA> the expression of these genes that improves the ability of the cell to protect itself and repair itself and that 's why we think the animals live longer
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 580.26 582.88 <NA> <unk> so you can think of foxo as being like
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 582.71 593.02 <NA> a building superintendent <unk> so maybe he 's a little bit lazy but he 's there he 's taking care of the building <unk> but it 's deteriorating and then suddenly he learns that there 's going to be a hurricane 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 592.74 594.43 <NA> so
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 593.97 599.93 <NA> he doesn 't actually do anything himself he gets on the on the telephone just like foxo gets on the dna
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 599.93 604.94 <NA> and he calls up the roofer <unk> the window person the painter
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 604.92 617.21 <NA> the floor person and they all come and they fortify the house and then the hurricane comes through and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in and not only that it can also just last longer <unk> even if there isn 't a hurricane <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 616.96 619.83 <NA> so that that 's the concept here
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 619.38 626.22 <NA> for how we think this life extension ability exists now the really cool thing about foxo is that
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 626.22 629.88 <NA> there are different forms of it we all have foxo genes
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 631.81 640.9 <NA> exactly the same form of the foxo gene just like we all have eyes <unk> but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes and there are certain forms of the foxo gene
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 640.72 646.03 <NA> that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be ninety or one hundred <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 646.03 654.88 <NA> and that 's the case all over the world as you can see from these stars and each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked okay are there differences in the type of
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 654.75 666.44 <NA> <unk> foxo genes among people who live a really long time and there are we don 't know the details of how this works but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 666.44 670.93 <NA> and that means that maybe if we tweak it a little bit we can increase
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 670.83 679.94 <NA> the health and longevity of people <unk> so this is really exciting to me a foxo is a protein that we found in these little round worms to affect lifespan and here it
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 679.9 684.87 <NA> <unk> affects lifespan in people <unk> so we 've been trying in our lab now to develop drugs
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 684.66 689.79 <NA> that will activate this foxo cell using human cells now
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 689.58 694.8 <NA> in order to try and come up with drugs that will delay aging and age related diseases <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 694.8 699.81 <NA> and i 'm really optimistic that this is going to work there are lots of different proteins that are known to affect
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 700.7 707.55 <NA> <unk> and for at least one of them there is a drug <unk> there 's one called tor which is another nutrient sensor like the insulin pathway <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 707.09 715.71 <NA> and mutations that damage the tor gene just like the daf 2 mutations extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 716.18 722.88 <NA> but in this case there 's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the tor protein and inhibits its activity <unk> 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 722.6 729.91 <NA> and you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse even when it 's pretty old like age sixty for a human that old for a mouse if you give the
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 729.87 730.92 <NA> <unk> mouse
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 730.59 738.35 <NA> rapamycin it will live longer <unk> now i don 't want you all to go out taking rapamycin it is a drug for people but the reason is
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 738.35 746.74 <NA> it suppresses the immune system so people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected <unk> so this may not be the perfect drug
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 746.37 754.97 <NA> for staying young longer <unk> but still here in the year two thousand and eleven <unk> there 's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 755.04 759 <NA> <unk> which comes out of this science that 's been done in all these different animals 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 759 766.86 <NA> so i 'm really optimistic and i think it won 't be too long i hope <unk> before this age old dream begins to come true <unk> thank you
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 780.59 786.83 <NA> <unk> let me get this straight <unk> although you 're looking for a drug that can solve aging in
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 786.67 788.55 <NA> old men like me 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 788.54 794.61 <NA> what you could do now pretty well in the lab if you were allowed ethically 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 794.12 799.87 <NA> is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 801.75 807.97 <NA> <unk> the kinds of drugs i was talking about would not change the genes <unk> they would just bind to the protein itself
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 807.77 813.82 <NA> and change its activity <unk> so if you stop taking the drug the protein would go back to normal 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 813.42 821.12 <NA> you could change the genes in principle there isn 't the technology to do that but i don 't think that 's a good idea and the reason is
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 821.12 829.94 <NA> that these these hormones like the insulin and the igf hormones and the tor pathway <unk> they 're essential if you knock them out completely
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 829.98 837.95 <NA> then you 're very sick <unk> so it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 837.64 842.15 <NA> any problems and i think that 's much better that kind of control would be much better
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 841.87 848.64 <NA> as a drug and also there are other ways of activating foxo that don 't even involve insulin or igf 1 that might even be safer
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 857.33 867.12 <NA> <unk> a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about which is a negligible senescence there are some creatures on this planet already that don 't really
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 866.96 875.05 <NA> do aging <unk> just move to one side for us if you would ck there are there are some animals that don 't seem to age for
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 876.09 878.17 <NA> <unk> tortoises called blanding 's turtles 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 877.94 890.39 <NA> and they they grow to be about this size and they 've been tagged <unk> and they 've been found to be seventy years old and when you look at these seventy year old turtles <unk> you can 't tell the difference just by looking between those turtles and twenty year old turtles 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 890.18 898.24 <NA> and the seventy year old ones actually they 're better at scouting out the good nesting places <unk> and they also have more progeny every year
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 898.24 904.97 <NA> and there are other examples of these kinds of animals like turns certain kinds of birds are like this and nobody knows
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 905.16 910.43 <NA> if they really can live forever or what keeps them from aging it 's not clear <unk>

CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 920.29 929.64 <NA> <unk> hydrogen peroxide things like that and our <unk> long lived mutants are too they 're more resistant to these kinds of stresses <unk> so it could be that the pathways that i 've been talking about
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 929.84 933.94 <NA> <unk> which are set to run really quickly in the worm have a different

CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 935.32 943.56 <NA> in in something like a bird so that a bird can live a lot longer and maybe they 're even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all but we don 't know mr 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 943.13 946.62 <NA> but what you 're talking about here is not

CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 953.1 959.47 <NA> <unk> that 's right it 's more like say if you were a dog <unk> you notice that you 're getting old and you look at your human and you think 
CynthiaKenyon_2011G 1 CynthiaKenyon_2011G 958.98 968.44 <NA> why isn 't this human getting old they 're not getting old in the dog 's lifespan it 's more like that <unk> but now we 're the human looking out and imagining a different human
