MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 16.66 19.7 <NA> i didn 't know it was impossible and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 19.87 22.34 <NA> that 's how i was able to do it 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 22.21 29.97 <NA> mars et avril is a science fiction film it 's set in montreal some fifty years in the future <unk> no one had done that
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 29.93 34.08 <NA> <unk> kind of movie in quebec before because it 's expensive it 's set
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 33.83 37.5 <NA> in the future and it 's got tons of visual effects and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 37.16 46.05 <NA> it 's shot on green screen <unk> yet this is the kind of movie that i wanted to make ever since i was a kid really back when i was reading some comic books and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 45.56 50.14 <NA> dreaming about what the future might be <unk> when american
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 61.86 67.75 <NA> <unk> for only two point three million so you might wonder what 's the deal here how did i do this well
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 67.74 75.05 <NA> it 's two things first it 's time <unk> when you don 't have money you must take time and it took me seven years to do
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 80.04 90.44 <NA> i got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved <unk> and it seems like every department had nothing so they had to rely on our on our creativity and turn every problem <unk>
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 90.34 98.07 <NA> <unk> into an opportunity <unk> and that brings me to the point of my talk actually how constraints big creative constraints can boost creativity 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 103.01 112.8 <NA> <unk> i did some graphic novels but they weren 't your usual graphic novels they were books telling a science fiction story through images and text and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 112.49 121.77 <NA> most of the actors who are now starring in the movie adaptation they were already involved in these in these books portraying characters into
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 121.28 125.2 <NA> a sort of experimental <unk> theatrical simplistic
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 126.6 128.53 <NA> <unk> one of these actors is
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 128.07 137.21 <NA> the great stage director and actor robert lepage and i just love this guy i 've been in love with this guy since i was a kid his
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 137.21 147.2 <NA> career i admire a lot <unk> and i wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project <unk> and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 148.32 149.37 <NA> <unk> a
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 159.76 163.7 <NA> <unk> he was a perfect fit for for the part and robert is actually the one who
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 163.47 168.75 <NA> gave me my first chance he was the the one who believed in me and encouraged me to
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 168.75 174.93 <NA> to do an adaptation of my books into a into a film and to write direct <unk> and produce the film
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 177.05 183.23 <NA> <unk> robert is actually the very first example of how constraints can boost creativity 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 183.23 190.38 <NA> because this guy is the busiest man on the planet i mean his agenda is booked until two thousand and forty two and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 189.98 198.18 <NA> he 's really hard to to get <unk> and i wanted him to be in in the movie to reprise his role in the movie <unk> 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 197.99 204.94 <NA> but the thing is had i waited for for him until two thousand and forty two my film wouldn 't be a futuristic film anymore
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 205.22 214.36 <NA> i just couldn 't do that right <unk> but that 's kind of a big problem how do you get somebody who is too busy to star in a movie <unk> 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 214.44 223.04 <NA> well <unk> i said as a joke in a production meeting and this is a true story by the way i said why don 't we turn this guy into a hologram <unk> 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 223.04 229.67 <NA> because you know he is everywhere and nowhere on the planet at the same time and he 's an illuminated being in my mind
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 229.9 232.1 <NA> <unk> he 's in between
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 231.93 238.31 <NA> reality and virtual reality so it would make perfect sense to turn this guy into a hologram 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 237.94 245.28 <NA> everybody around the table laughed <unk> but the joke was kind of a good solution so that 's what we ended up doing 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 245.28 254.94 <NA> here 's how we did it we shot robert with six cameras he was dressed in green and he was like in a green aquarium <unk> each camera was covering sixty
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 254.93 258.27 <NA> <unk> degrees of his head so that in post production we could
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 257.78 261.04 <NA> use pretty much any angle we needed and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 260.83 270.49 <NA> we shot only his head <unk> six months later there was a guy on set a mime portraying the body the vehicle for the head <unk> 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 270.49 273.36 <NA> and he was wearing a green hood
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 273.02 279.97 <NA> so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction and replace it with robert lepage 's head <unk> so he became like a renaissance
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 280.2 282.38 <NA> <unk> man and here 's what it looks like in the movie
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 344.63 348.72 <NA> <unk> my second example of how constraints can boost creativity
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 348.35 354.76 <NA> because i desperately needed these objects in my movie they are objects of desire they are imaginary
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 355.17 361.24 <NA> <unk> instruments and they carry a nice story with them <unk> actually <unk> i knew what these
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 361.2 366.05 <NA> things would look like in my mind for many many years <unk> but
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 365.72 370.13 <NA> my problem was i didn 't have the money to to pay for them <unk> 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 370.13 377.68 <NA> i couldn 't afford them <unk> so that 's kind of a big problem too how do you get something that you can 't afford 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 377.37 378.76 <NA> and 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 378.54 379.97 <NA> you know i woke up one
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 379.93 386.06 <NA> <unk> morning with a pretty good idea i said what if i have somebody else pay for them <unk>
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 389.27 397.88 <NA> but who on earth would be interested by seven not yet built musical instruments inspired by women 's bodies <unk> 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 397.63 400.14 <NA> and i thought of cirque du soleil in montreal
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 401.51 410.1 <NA> <unk> who better to understand the kind of crazy poetry that i wanted to put on screen <unk> so i found my way to guy lalibert cirque du soleil 's ceo and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 410.1 416.95 <NA> i presented my crazy idea to him with with sketches like this and visual references and something
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 416.47 419.08 <NA> pretty amazing happened guy was
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 419.08 426.66 <NA> interested by this idea not because i was asking for his money but because i came to him with a good idea
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 426.92 429.91 <NA> in which everybody was happy it was kind of a
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 429.9 432.34 <NA> <unk> perfect triangle in which the
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 431.88 432.91 <NA> the
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 432.74 440.83 <NA> art buyer was happy because he got the instruments at a cheaper price <unk> because they weren 't even made he took a leap of faith <unk> 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 440.34 449.38 <NA> and the artist dominique engel <unk> brilliant guy he was happy too because he had a dream project to work on for a year <unk> 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 448.89 454.88 <NA> and obviously i was happy because i got the instruments in my film for free which was
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 454.84 460.37 <NA> <unk> kind of what i tried to do <unk> so here they are and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 460.27 465.65 <NA> my last example of how constraints can boost creativity comes from
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 466.27 470.24 <NA> the green because this is a
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 470.24 479.97 <NA> weird color a crazy color and you need to replace the the green screens eventually and you must figure that out sooner rather than later <unk> and i had again pretty much
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 479.78 485.49 <NA> <unk> much <unk> ideas in my mind as to what the the world would be <unk> but
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 485.39 489.97 <NA> then again i turned to my childhood imagination and went to
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 489.73 496.81 <NA> the work of belgian comic book master <unk> franois schuiten in belgium and this guy
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 496.81 504.73 <NA> is another guy i admire a lot and i wanted him to be involved in the movie as a production designer <unk> but people told me you know
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 504.99 510.74 <NA> <unk> it 's impossible the guy is too busy and he will say no well i said you know what instead of
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 510.74 515.51 <NA> mimicking his style i might as well call the real guy and ask him <unk> and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 515.12 517.19 <NA> i sent him my books and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 517.01 522.4 <NA> he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 522.4 529.94 <NA> a big fish in a small aquarium in other words there was space for him to dream with me so here i was with
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 529.99 534.95 <NA> <unk> of my childhood heroes drawing every single frame that 's in the film
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 534.55 538.07 <NA> to turn that into montreal in the future <unk> 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 537.61 542.6 <NA> and it was an amazing collaboration to work with this great artist whom i admire <unk> 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 542.59 548.42 <NA> but then you know <unk> eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 547.99 554.97 <NA> so again my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that i could think of and there 's this
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 554.96 563.52 <NA> <unk> guy in montreal another quebecois called carlos monzon and he 's a very good vfx artist this guy had been
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 563.3 575.11 <NA> lead compositor on such films as avatar and star trek and transformers and other unknown projects like this and i knew he was the perfect fit for the job <unk> and i had to convince him and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 576.27 585.93 <NA> <unk> instead of working on the next spielberg movie he accepted to work on mine <unk> why because i offered him a space to dream so if you don 't have
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 585.94 590.62 <NA> money to offer to people you must strike their imagination with
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 590.13 598.84 <NA> something as as nice as you can think of so this is what happened on this movie and that 's how it got made and we went to this very nice
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 598.84 602.48 <NA> postproduction company in montreal called vision globale and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 605.28 613.61 <NA> artists to work full time for six months to do this crazy film <unk> so i want to tell you that if you have some
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 613.15 624.99 <NA> crazy ideas in your mind <unk> and that people tell you that it 's impossible to make well that 's an even better reason to want to do it because people have a tendency to see the problems rather than the
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 626.6 631.38 <NA> <unk> if you start to deal with problems as being your allies rather than your opponents
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 631.38 637.08 <NA> life will start to dance with you in the most amazing way i have experienced it 
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 636.59 640.89 <NA> and you might end up doing some crazy projects and
MartinVilleneuve_2013 1 MartinVilleneuve_2013 640.52 646.06 <NA> who knows you might even end up going to mars thank you
