GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 17.68 25.05 <NA> michelangelo had this elegant way of describing it when he said every block of stone has a statue inside of it and it 's the task
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 25 27.21 <NA> <unk> the sculptor to discover it 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 26.81 33.14 <NA> but what if he worked in the opposite direction not from a solid block of stone but from a pile of dust <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 33.15 37.71 <NA> somehow gluing millions of these particles together to form a statue 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 37.25 46.42 <NA> i know that 's an absurd notion it 's probably impossible the only way you get a statue from a pile of dust is if the statue built itself
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 46.26 54.13 <NA> if somehow we could compel millions of these particles to come together to form the statue now as odd as that sounds that
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 55.07 61.67 <NA> exactly the problem i work on in my lab <unk> i don 't build with stone i build with nanomaterials they 're these
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 61.49 71.53 <NA> just impossibly small fascinating little objects <unk> they 're so small that if this controller was a nanoparticle a human hair would be the size of this entire room 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 71.04 74.69 <NA> and they 're at the heart of a field we call nanotechnology which
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 74.53 79.07 <NA> i 'm sure we 've all heard about and we 've all heard how it is going to change everything
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 79.93 87.69 <NA> <unk> i was a graduate student it was one of the most exciting times to be working in nanotechnology there were scientific breakthroughs happening all the time <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 87.69 92.42 <NA> the conferences were buzzing there was tons of money pouring in from funding agencies <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 92.29 99.81 <NA> and the reason is when objects get really small they 're governed by a different set of physics that govern ordinary objects like the ones we
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 100 112.89 <NA> interact with we call this physics quantum mechanics and what it tells you is that you can precisely tune their behavior just by making seemingly small changes to them like adding or removing a handful of atoms or twisting the material <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 112.43 119.86 <NA> it 's like this ultimate toolkit you really felt empowered you felt like you could make anything and we were doing it and by we i mean
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 119.7 124.57 <NA> my whole generation of graduate students we were trying to make blazing fast computers using
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 125.67 135.61 <NA> <unk> we were constructing quantum dots that could one day go in your body and find and fight disease there were even groups trying to make an elevator to space using carbon nanotubes 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 135.15 137.5 <NA> you can look that up that 's true
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 138.24 143.69 <NA> <unk> anyways we thought it was going to affect all parts of science and technology from computing to medicine <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 143.69 150.34 <NA> and i have to admit i drank all of the kool aid i mean every last drop <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 150.03 152.3 <NA> but that was fifteen years ago
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 154.87 157.86 <NA> <unk> science was done really important work we 've learned a lot <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 157.86 165.23 <NA> we were never able to translate that science into new technologies into technologies that could actually impact people 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 164.8 174.93 <NA> and the reason is these nanomaterials they 're like a <unk> double edged sword the same thing that makes them so interesting their small size also makes them impossible to work
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 175.1 182.19 <NA> <unk> it 's literally like trying to build a statue out of a pile of dust and we just don 't have the tools that are small enough to work with them 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 182.15 190.5 <NA> but even if we did it wouldn 't really matter because we couldn 't one by one place millions of particles together to build a technology <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 190.28 195.18 <NA> so because of that all of the promise and all of the excitement has remained just that 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 195.18 204.55 <NA> promise and excitement we don 't have any disease fighting nanobots there 's no elevators to space <unk> and the thing that i 'm most interested in no new types of computing
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 205.08 215.24 <NA> <unk> now that last one that 's a really important one we just have come to expect the pace of computing advancements to go on indefinitely we 've built entire economies on this idea 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 215.24 221.32 <NA> and this pace exists because of our ability to pack more and more devices onto a computer chip <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 220.89 228.95 <NA> and as those devices get smaller they get faster they consume less power and they get cheaper <unk> and it 's this convergence that
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 230.05 240.11 <NA> <unk> this incredible pace as an example if i took the room sized computer that sent three men to the moon and back and somehow compressed it
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 239.92 246.23 <NA> compressed the world 's greatest computer of its day so it was the same size as your smartphone
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 245.8 254.82 <NA> your actual smartphone that thing you spent three hundred bucks on and just toss out every two years would blow this thing away you would not be impressed
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 254.93 260.76 <NA> <unk> couldn 't do anything that your smartphone does <unk> it would be slow you couldn 't put any of your stuff on it 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 260.54 265.83 <NA> you could possibly get through the first two minutes of a walking dead episode if you 're lucky 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 265.64 277.84 <NA> the point is the progress it 's not gradual <unk> the progress is relentless <unk> it 's exponential it compounds on itself year after year to the point where if you compare a technology from one generation to the next
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 279.89 289.09 <NA> and we owe it to ourselves to keep this progress going we want to say the same thing ten twenty thirty years from now look what we 've done over the last thirty years <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 288.69 297.86 <NA> yet we know this progress may not last forever in fact the party 's kind of winding down it 's like last call for alcohol right if you look under the covers 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 297.86 299.99 <NA> by many metrics like speed
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 300.61 303.68 <NA> <unk> the progress has already slowed to a halt <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 303.28 309.65 <NA> so if we want to keep this party going <unk> we have to do what we 've always been able to do and that is to innovate 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 309.19 318.6 <NA> so our group 's role and our group 's mission is to innovate by employing carbon nanotubes because we think that they can provide a path to continue this pace 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 318.6 329.4 <NA> they are just like they sound they 're tiny hollow tubes of carbon atoms <unk> and their nanoscale size that small size gives rise to these just outstanding electronic properties 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 329.99 340.77 <NA> <unk> the science tells us if we could employ them in computing we could see up to a ten times improvement in performance <unk> it 's like skipping through several technology generations in just one step <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 340.34 344.17 <NA> so there we have it we have this really important problem
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 344 350.98 <NA> and we have what is basically the ideal solution the science is screaming at us this is what you should be doing to solve your problem
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 354.9 366.86 <NA> <unk> started let 's do this but you just run right back into that <unk> double edged sword this ideal solution contains a material that 's impossible to work with i 'd have to arrange billions of them just to make one single computer chip <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 366.86 371.14 <NA> it 's that same conundrum it 's like this undying problem <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 370.86 375.14 <NA> at this point we said let 's just stop <unk> let 's not go down that same
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 375.43 377.72 <NA> <unk> 's just figure out what 's missing
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 377.26 381.5 <NA> what are we not dealing with what are we not doing that needs to be done 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 381.01 389.24 <NA> it 's like in the godfather right when fredo betrays his brother michael we all know what needs to be done fredo 's got to go 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 388.93 395.09 <NA> but michael he puts it off fine i get it their mother 's still alive it would make her upset 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 395.08 404.64 <NA> we just said what 's the fredo in our problem what are we not dealing with what are we not doing but needs to be done to make this a success
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 405.14 418.32 <NA> <unk> and the answer is that the statue has to build itself we have to find a way somehow to compel to convince billions of these particles to assemble themselves into the technology 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 417.92 424.53 <NA> we can 't do it for them <unk> they have to do it for themselves and it 's the hard way and this is not trivial <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 425.19 427.45 <NA> <unk> in this case it 's the only way <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 427.11 431.26 <NA> now as it turns out this is not that alien of a problem
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 430.83 438.62 <NA> <unk> we just don 't build anything this way <unk> people don 't build anything this way <unk> but if you look around and there 's examples everywhere
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 438.44 446.77 <NA> mother nature builds everything this way everything is built from the bottom up <unk> you can go to the beach you 'll find these simple
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 446.34 454.97 <NA> organisms that use proteins basically molecules to template what is essentially sand just plucking it from the sea and building these extraordinary architectures
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 455.08 456.83 <NA> <unk> with extreme diversity 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 456.46 466.23 <NA> and nature 's not crude like us just hacking away <unk> she 's elegant and smart building with what 's available molecule by molecule making structures with a complexity
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 466.05 475.17 <NA> and a diversity that we can 't even approach <unk> and she 's already at the nano <unk> she 's been there for hundreds of millions of years we 're the ones that are late to the party
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 476.57 479.39 <NA> <unk> 're going to use the same tool that
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 479.17 485.4 <NA> nature uses and that 's chemistry chemistry is the missing tool and chemistry works in this case
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 485.23 493.5 <NA> because these nanoscale objects are about the same size as molecules so we can use them to steer these objects around much like a tool that
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 493.31 499.69 <NA> 's exactly what we 've done in our lab we 've developed chemistry that goes into the pile of dust into the pile of
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 500.34 508.06 <NA> <unk> and pulls out exactly the ones we need then we can use chemistry to arrange literally billions of these particles into the pattern we need
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 507.89 516.27 <NA> to build circuits and because we can do that we can build circuits that are many times faster than what anyone 's been able to make using nanomaterials before 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 516.27 523.93 <NA> chemistry 's the missing tool and every day our tool gets sharper and gets more precise <unk> and eventually and we hope this is within
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 523.65 525.2 <NA> a handful of years
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 525.4 528.77 <NA> <unk> we can deliver on one of those original promises <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 528.34 530.74 <NA> now computing is just one example <unk> 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 530.52 539.91 <NA> it 's the one that i 'm interested in that my group is really invested in <unk> but there are others in renewable energy in medicine in structural materials 
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 539.91 544.26 <NA> where the science is going to tell you to move towards the nano <unk> that 's where the biggest
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 544.08 550.05 <NA> benefit is <unk> but if we 're going to do that the scientists of today and tomorrow are going to need new tools
GeorgeTulevski_2016S 1 GeorgeTulevski_2016S 554.36 569.19 <NA> <unk> and they will need chemistry that 's the point the beauty of science is that once you develop these new tools they 're out there they 're out there forever and anyone anywhere can pick them up and use and use them <unk> and help to deliver on the promise of nanotechnology
