EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 12.97 18.5 <NA> <unk> i 'm a creative technologist and the focus of my work is on public installations <unk> 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 19.39 25.08 <NA> one of my driving passions is this idea of exploring nature and trying to find hidden
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 27.11 30.55 <NA> <unk> it seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 30.31 36.96 <NA> all around us everything gives out some kind of data whether it 's sound or smell or vibration 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 36.96 42.13 <NA> through my work i 've been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 41.92 43.35 <NA> and so
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 42.89 51.69 <NA> this basically led me to a subject called cymatics <unk> now cymatics is the process of visualizing sound
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 51.69 54.88 <NA> by basically vibrating a medium
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 54.81 57.82 <NA> <unk> such as sand or water as you can see there 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 57.54 68.08 <NA> so <unk> if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics beginning with the observations of resonance by da vinci <unk> galileo the english scientist robert hook and then ernest <unk>
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 67.98 75.32 <NA> <unk> chladni he created an experiment using a metal plate <unk> covering it with sand and then bowing it
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 79.81 93.92 <NA> <unk> moving on from this the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called hans jenny in the <unk> 1970s he actually coined the term cymatics then bringing us into the present day is a fellow collaborator of mine and cymatics expert <unk> 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 93.49 99.35 <NA> john stewart reed he 's kindly recreated for us the chladni experiment 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 98.89 103.73 <NA> what we can see here is the metal sheet this time connected to a sound driver
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 103.33 104.55 <NA> and being fed by
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 105.23 110.58 <NA> as the frequencies increase <unk> so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 110.6 112.8 <NA> as you can see with your own eyes 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 120.05 121.38 <NA> so 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 121.22 128.04 <NA> what excites me about cymatics well <unk> for me cymatics is an almost magical tool it 's like
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 127.61 129.97 <NA> a looking glass into a hidden world
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 129.98 137.53 <NA> through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 137.3 147.67 <NA> devices like the cymascope which you can see here have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns and the list of scientific applications is growing every day for <unk>
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 147.57 154.97 <NA> <unk> example in oceanography a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created by basically visualizing the sonar beams
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 154.99 160.49 <NA> <unk> that the dolphins emit <unk> and hopefully in the future we 'll be able to gain some deeper understanding of how they communicate <unk>
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 160.27 172.46 <NA> we can also use cymatics for healing and education this is an installation developed with school children where their hands are tracked it allows them to control and position cymatic patterns and the reflections that are caused by them 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 172 179.94 <NA> we can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form this image here is created from a snippet of beethoven 's ninth
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 179.87 187.38 <NA> <unk> symphony playing through a cymatic device <unk> so it kind of flips things on its head a little bit this is pink floyd 's machine 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 186.92 189.87 <NA> playing in real time through the cymascope 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 194.75 204.97 <NA> we can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature and we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature <unk> so for example here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 205.01 212.29 <NA> <unk> then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake <unk> and here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish and there is thousands of these <unk> 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 212.01 215.24 <NA> so what does this all mean well 
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 215.24 225.08 <NA> there is still a lot to explore in its early days and there 's not many people working in this field but consider for a moment that sound does have form we 've seen that it can affect matter
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 225.04 228.65 <NA> <unk> and cause form within matter then sort of
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 228.28 234.9 <NA> take a leap and think about the universe forming and think about the immense sound of the universe forming <unk> and if we
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 234.9 240.45 <NA> kind of ponder on that then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself
EvanGrant_2009G 1 EvanGrant_2009G 263.36 264.79 <NA> <unk> the substance of things not seen
