AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 12.94 18.65 <NA> <unk> it 's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what 's on their bookshelves 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 19.18 25.02 <NA> what do my bookshelves say about me <unk> well when i asked myself this question a
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 25 28.68 <NA> few years ago <unk> i made an alarming discovery 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 28.61 38.01 <NA> i 'd always thought of myself as a fairly cultured <unk> cosmopolitan sort of person <unk> but my bookshelves told a rather different story 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 37.91 45.72 <NA> pretty much all the titles on them were by british or north american authors <unk> and there was almost nothing in translation 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 45.83 54.94 <NA> discovering this massive <unk> cultural blind spot in my reading came as quite a shock <unk> and when i thought about it it seemed like a real shame
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 55.05 62.32 <NA> i knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there by writers working in languages other than english <unk> 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 61.83 68.11 <NA> and it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits meant i would probably never encounter them 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 67.95 74.35 <NA> so i decided to prescribe myself an intensive course of global reading two thousand and
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 74.07 79.97 <NA> twelve was set to be a very international year for the uk it was the year of the london olympics
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 80.27 91.88 <NA> and so i decided to use it as my time frame to try to read a novel short story collection or memoir from every country in the world <unk> 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 92.32 93.93 <NA> and so i did <unk> 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 93.93 102.08 <NA> and it was very exciting and i learned some remarkable things and made some wonderful connections that i want to share with you today <unk> 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 101.59 104.94 <NA> but it started with some practical problems
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 105.32 112.62 <NA> <unk> after i 'd worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world to use for my project <unk> 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 112.25 120.93 <NA> i ended up going with the list of un recognized nations to which i added taiwan which gave me a total of one hundred and ninety six countries 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 120.65 129.12 <NA> and after i 'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging about roughly four books a week around working five days a week 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 130.1 136.15 <NA> had to face up to the fact that i might even not be able to get books in english from every country 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 136.05 142.81 <NA> only around four point five percent of the literary works published each year in the uk are translations 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 142.61 146.47 <NA> and the figures are similar for much of the english speaking world <unk> 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 146.47 152.59 <NA> although the proportion of translated books published in many other countries is a lot higher <unk> 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 152.61 154.91 <NA> four point five percent is tiny
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 154.87 156.23 <NA> <unk> enough to start with 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 156.23 169.58 <NA> but what that figure doesn 't tell you is that many of those books will come from countries with strong publishing networks and lots of industry professionals primed to go out and sell those titles to english language publishers 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 169.21 176.04 <NA> so for example although well over one hundred books are translated from french and published in the uk each year 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 176.04 179.49 <NA> most of them will come from countries like france or

AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 185.81 194.82 <NA> the upshot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations that may have little or even no commercially available literature in english 
AnnMorgan_2015G 1 AnnMorgan_2015G 194.54 199.9 <NA> their books remain invisible to readers of the world 's most published
