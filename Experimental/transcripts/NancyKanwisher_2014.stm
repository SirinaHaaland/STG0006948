NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 182.51 190.38 <NA> so here 's how this works <unk> brains are like muscles when they get active they need increased blood flow to supply that activity <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 190.1 193.89 <NA> and lucky for us blood flow control to the brain is local <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 193.89 200.49 <NA> so if a bunch of neurons say right there get active and start firing <unk> then blood flow increases just right there <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 200.03 204.88 <NA> so functional mri picks up on that blood flow increase producing a higher

NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 208.44 215.74 <NA> so to give you a concrete feel for how a functional mri experiment goes and what you can learn from it and what you can 't 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 215.55 218.71 <NA> let me describe one of the first studies i ever did <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 218.79 226.64 <NA> we wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces and there was already reason to think there might be such a thing
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 226.42 229.94 <NA> based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia that i described a moment ago
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 230.04 236.45 <NA> <unk> but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain in a normal person so we set out to look for it 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 236.35 243.42 <NA> so i was the first subject <unk> i went into the scanner <unk> i lay on my back i held my head as still as i could
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 243.23 246.14 <NA> while staring at pictures of faces
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 245.83 247.7 <NA> like these
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 247.93 250.38 <NA> and objects like these
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 255.83 261.88 <NA> <unk> so as somebody who has pretty close to the world record of total number of hours spent inside an mri scanner <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 261.88 266.38 <NA> i can tell you that one of the skills that 's really important for mri research
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 265.99 269.31 <NA> is bladder control 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 269.51 273.31 <NA> when i got out of the scanner <unk> i did a quick analysis of the data 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 273.31 279.55 <NA> looking for any parts of my brain that produced a higher response when i was looking at faces than when i was looking at objects
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 280.02 288.07 <NA> <unk> and here 's what i saw now this image looks just awful by today 's standards <unk> but at the time i thought it was beautiful <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 288.06 298.58 <NA> what it shows is that region right there that little blob <unk> it 's about the size of an olive and it 's on the bottom surface of my brain about an inch straight in from right there
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 299.22 304.36 <NA> and what that part of my brain is doing is producing a higher mri response 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 304.9 313.52 <NA> <unk> higher neural activity when i was looking at faces than when i was looking at objects <unk> so that 's pretty cool but how do we know this isn 't a fluke 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 313.3 317.21 <NA> well the easiest way is to just do the experiment again <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 316.84 323.45 <NA> so i got back in the scanner <unk> i looked at more faces and i looked at more objects and i got a similar blob <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 323.2 325.28 <NA> and then i did it again
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 325.3 329.73 <NA> and i did it again and again and again
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 330.08 333.63 <NA> <unk> and around about then i decided to believe it was for real <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 333.98 335.73 <NA> but still <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 335.36 340.41 <NA> maybe this is something weird about my brain and no one else has one of these things in there <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 339.98 349.62 <NA> so to find out we scanned a bunch of other people and found that pretty much everyone has that little face processing region in a similar neighborhood of the brain <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 350.12 355 <NA> so the next question was what does this thing really do is it really specialized just
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 355.02 356.56 <NA> <unk> for face recognition 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 357.18 365.36 <NA> well maybe not right maybe it responds not only to faces but to any body part <unk> maybe it responds to anything human
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 364.91 372.88 <NA> or anything alive or anything round the only way to be really sure that that region is specialized for face recognition
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 372.88 375.14 <NA> is to rule out all of those hypotheses
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 375.82 388.94 <NA> <unk> so we spent much of the next couple of years scanning subjects while they looked at lots of different kinds of images <unk> and we showed that that part of the brain responds strongly when you look at any images that are faces of any kind <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 388.6 395.63 <NA> and it responds much less strongly to any image you show that isn 't a face like some of these 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 395.23 399.81 <NA> so have we finally nailed the case that this region is necessary for face
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 402.47 412.23 <NA> <unk> brain imaging can never tell you if a region is necessary for anything all you can do with brain imaging is watch regions turn on and off as people think different thoughts 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 412.19 420.27 <NA> to tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function you need to mess with it and see what happens <unk> and normally we don 't get to do that 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 420.47 425.92 <NA> but an amazing opportunity came about very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 425.73 429.97 <NA> tested this man who has epilepsy and who is shown here
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 429.93 437.29 <NA> <unk> in his hospital bed where he 's just had electrodes placed on the surface of his brain to identify the source of his seizures <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 437.25 444.67 <NA> so it turned out by total chance that two of the electrodes happened to be right on top of his face area <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 444.45 452.63 <NA> so with the patient 's consent <unk> the doctors asked him what happened when they electrically stimulated that part of his brain
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 455.16 459.05 <NA> doesn 't know where those electrodes are and he 's never heard of the face area <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 458.8 467.57 <NA> so let 's watch what happens <unk> it 's going to start with a control condition that will say sham nearly invisibly in red in the lower left 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 467.35 469.79 <NA> when no current is delivered 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 469.63 473.31 <NA> and you 'll hear the neurologist speaking to the patient first so let 's watch
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 492.35 493.86 <NA> <unk> look at my face 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 525.27 529.79 <NA> <unk> this experiment finally nails the case that this region of the brain is not only
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 529.75 534.68 <NA> <unk> selectively responsive to faces but causally involved in face perception <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 534.73 545.18 <NA> so i went through all of these details about the face region to show you what it takes to really establish that a part of the brain is selectively involved in a specific mental process <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 544.72 551.75 <NA> next i 'll go through much more quickly some of the other specialized regions of the brain that we and others have found <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 551.8 554.97 <NA> so to do this i 've spent a lot of time in the scanner over the
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 554.93 555.94 <NA> <unk> last month
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 555.58 559.51 <NA> so i can show you these things in my brain <unk> so let 's get started 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 559.51 567.87 <NA> here 's my right hemisphere <unk> so we 're oriented like that you 're looking at my head this way imagine taking the skull off and looking at the surface of the brain like that okay
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 567.41 577.08 <NA> now as you can see the surface of the brain is all folded up <unk> so that 's not good stuff could be hidden in there we want to see the whole thing <unk> so let 's inflate it so we can see the whole thing <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 576.92 579.97 <NA> next let 's find that face area i 've been talking about
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 579.93 587.89 <NA> <unk> that responds to images like these to see that let 's turn the brain around and look on the inside surface on the bottom and there it is that 's my face area 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 588.09 595.48 <NA> just to the right of that is another region that is shown in purple that responds when you process color information <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 595.41 600.32 <NA> and near those regions are other regions that are involved in perceiving places
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 600.4 606.33 <NA> <unk> like right now i 'm seeing this layout of space around me and these regions in green right there are really active <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 606.33 611.42 <NA> there 's another one out on the outside surface again where there 's a couple more face regions as well <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 611.56 619.25 <NA> also in this vicinity is a region that 's selectively involved in processing visual motion like these moving dots here <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 618.91 621.71 <NA> and that 's in yellow at the bottom of the brain <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 621.76 629.97 <NA> and near that is a region that responds when you look at images of bodies and body parts like these and that region is shown in lime
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 630.02 631.89 <NA> <unk> green at the bottom of the brain <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 632.15 639.21 <NA> now all these regions i 've shown you so far are involved in specific aspects of visual perception 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 639.05 642.13 <NA> do we also have specialized brain regions
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 641.8 647.61 <NA> for other senses <unk> like hearing <unk> yes we do <unk> so if we turn the brain around a little bit 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 647.6 654.88 <NA> here 's a region in dark blue that we reported just a couple of months ago <unk> and this region responds strongly when you hear
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 654.81 657.73 <NA> <unk> sounds with pitch like these 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 662.76 670.97 <NA> music in contrast that same region does not respond strongly when you hear perfectly familiar sounds that don 't have a clear pitch <unk> like these
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 680.01 685.94 <NA> pitch region is another set of regions that are selectively responsive when you hear the sounds of speech okay 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 686.23 695.54 <NA> now let 's look at these same regions in my left hemisphere there 's a similar arrangement not identical but similar and most of the same regions are in here <unk> albeit sometimes different <unk>
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 695.44 702.74 <NA> <unk> in size <unk> now everything i 've shown you so far are regions that are involved in different aspects of perception <unk> vision and hearing <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 704.93 708.39 <NA> <unk> really fancy complicated mental processes 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 708.02 709.56 <NA> yes we do 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 709.13 712.77 <NA> so here in pink are my language regions 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 712.57 724.22 <NA> so it 's been known for a very long time that that general vicinity of the brain is involved in processing language <unk> but we showed very recently that these pink regions respond extremely selectively 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 724.22 729.94 <NA> they respond when you understand the meaning of a sentence <unk> but not when you do other complex mental things
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 730.13 738.97 <NA> like mental arithmetic or holding information in memory or appreciating the complex structure in a piece of music <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 741.06 745.79 <NA> the most amazing region that 's been found yet is this one right here
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 745.79 754.97 <NA> in turquoise this region responds when you think about what another person is thinking <unk> so that may seem crazy
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 754.63 759.14 <NA> <unk> crazy <unk> but actually we humans do this all the time you
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 759.07 766.01 <NA> 're doing this when you realize that your partner is going to be worried if you don 't call home to say you 're running late <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 765.82 777.59 <NA> i 'm doing this with that region of my brain right now when i realize that you guys are probably now wondering about all that gray <unk> uncharted territory in the brain and what 's up with that 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 777.22 779.97 <NA> well i 'm wondering about that too <unk> and we 're running a
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 779.93 788.97 <NA> <unk> bunch of experiments in my lab right now to try to find a number of other possible specializations in the brain for other very specific mental functions <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 788.93 796.06 <NA> but importantly <unk> i don 't think we have specializations in the brain for every important mental function 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 796.06 799.2 <NA> even mental functions that may be critical for survival 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 799.37 804.97 <NA> in fact a few years ago there was a scientist in my lab who became quite convinced that he 'd found
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 804.93 805.98 <NA> <unk> a brain region
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 805.79 812.26 <NA> for detecting food <unk> and it responded really strongly in the scanner when people looked at images like this 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 812.07 819.67 <NA> and further he found a similar response in more or less the same location in ten out of twelve subjects 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 819.33 825.02 <NA> so he was pretty stoked <unk> and he was running around the lab telling everyone that he was going to go on oprah
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 825 831.39 <NA> with his big discovery <unk> but then he devised the critical test he showed subjects
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 831.21 839.81 <NA> images of food like this and compared them to images with very similar color and shape <unk> but that weren 't food like these 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 839.32 843.86 <NA> and his region responded the same to both sets of images <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 843.37 849.41 <NA> so it wasn 't a food area <unk> it was just a region that liked colors and shapes <unk> so much for oprah 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 852.16 853.86 <NA> but then the question of course
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 854.99 859.23 <NA> <unk> process all this other stuff that we don 't have specialized brain regions for well i
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 859.31 872.31 <NA> think the answer is that in addition to these highly specialized components that i 've been describing we also have a lot of very general purpose machinery in our heads that enables us to tackle whatever problem comes along 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 872.06 874.77 <NA> in fact we 've shown recently that
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 875 883.12 <NA> <unk> regions here in white respond whenever you do any difficult mental task at all well of the seven that we 've tested <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 884.28 887.98 <NA> so each of the brain regions that i 've described to you today
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 887.78 899.53 <NA> is present in approximately the same location in every normal subject i could take any of you pop you in the scanner <unk> and find each of those regions in your brain and it would look a lot like my brain <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 899.53 903.68 <NA> although the regions would be slightly different in their exact location and in their size
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 905.08 907.25 <NA> <unk> what 's important to me about this work
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 907.08 917.3 <NA> is not the particular locations of these brain regions <unk> but the simple fact that we have selective specific components of mind and brain in the first place 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 916.84 919.43 <NA> i mean it could have been otherwise 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 919.33 929.28 <NA> the brain could have been a single general purpose processor more like a kitchen knife than a swiss army knife instead what brain imaging has delivered
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 930.01 937.23 <NA> rich and interesting picture of the human mind <unk> so we have this picture of very general purpose machinery in our heads
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 936.74 942 <NA> in addition to this surprising array of very specialized components it
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 943.37 951.27 <NA> 's early days in this enterprise we 've painted only the first brushstrokes in our neural portrait of the human mind <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 950.96 954.27 <NA> the most fundamental questions remain unanswered 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 954.96 964.06 <NA> <unk> example what does each of these regions do exactly <unk> why do we need three face areas and three place areas and what 's the division of labor between them 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 964.38 969.22 <NA> second <unk> how are all these things connected in the brain <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 969 975.13 <NA> with diffusion imaging you can trace bundles of neurons that connect to different parts of the brain <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 975.03 979.79 <NA> and with this method shown here you can trace the connections of individual neurons
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 979.99 985.82 <NA> <unk> in the brain <unk> potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram of the entire human brain <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 985.42 991.19 <NA> third how does all of this very systematic structure get built <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 990.94 993.98 <NA> both over development in childhood
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 993.55 1002.5 <NA> and over the evolution of our species to address questions like that scientists are now scanning other species of animals <unk> 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 1002.19 1004.94 <NA> and they 're also scanning human infants
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 1008.56 1018.89 <NA> many people justify the high cost of neuroscience research by pointing out that it may help us someday to treat brain disorders like alzheimer 's and autism 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 1018.52 1023.51 <NA> that 's a hugely important goal and i 'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 1024.13 1028.98 <NA> but fixing things that are broken in the world is not the only thing that 's worth doing
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 1030.11 1037.95 <NA> <unk> the effort to understand the human mind and brain is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment of a single disease 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 1037.55 1044.77 <NA> what could be more thrilling than to understand the fundamental mechanisms that underlie human experience 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 1044.77 1048.36 <NA> to understand in essence who we are 
NancyKanwisher_2014 1 NancyKanwisher_2014 1047.99 1052.18 <NA> this is i think the greatest scientific quest of all time
