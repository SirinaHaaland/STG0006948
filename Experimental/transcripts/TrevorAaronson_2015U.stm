TrevorAaronson_2015U 1 TrevorAaronson_2015U 517.89 529.94 <NA> <unk> to go to syria after the introduction of the fbi informant and in fact the fbi informant had helped them with the travel documents that they needed in kind of a comical turn in that particular case one of the defendant 's mother had found out that he was interested

TrevorAaronson_2015U 1 TrevorAaronson_2015U 546.37 556.41 <NA> <unk> far come out it suggests the fbi made it possible for these guys to move along in a plan to go to syria when they were never close to that in the first place tr thanks a lot that 's amazing
