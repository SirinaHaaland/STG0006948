NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 14.08 17.41 <NA> <unk> the election for the first time in the united states a predominantly white
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 17.41 25.05 <NA> group of voters voted for an african american candidate for president and in fact barack obama did quite well he won three hundred and seventy five electoral
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 25.34 27.13 <NA> <unk> and he won about seventy million
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 27.13 37.29 <NA> popular votes more than any other presidential candidate of any race of any party in history if you compare how obama did against how john kerry had done four years earlier
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 37.31 50.14 <NA> democrats really like seeing this transition here where almost every state becomes bluer becomes more democratic even states obama lost like out west those states became more blue in the south in the northeast
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 50.13 52.33 <NA> <unk> almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 52.1 53.8 <NA> here and there 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 53.31 62.14 <NA> one exception is in massachusetts that was john kerry 's home state no big surprise obama couldn 't do better than kerry there or in arizona which is john mccain 's home 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 61.97 67.74 <NA> obama didn 't have much improvement but there is also this part of the country kind of in the middle region here this kind of arkansas
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 67.74 75.02 <NA> tennessee oklahoma west virginia region now if you look at ' ninety six bill clinton the last democrat to actually win how he did in
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 75.4 85.65 <NA> <unk> you see real big differences in this part of the country right here the kind of appalachians ozarks highlands region as i call it twenty or thirty point swings from how bill clinton did in ' ninety six
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 85.6 92.06 <NA> <unk> to how obama did in two thousand and eight yes bill clinton was from arkansas but these are very very profound differences 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 104.98 107.64 <NA> but yeah what 's the matter with arkansas 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 109.25 114.4 <NA> and when we think of arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations we think of a bunch of
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 114.19 119.04 <NA> rednecks quote unquote with guns and we think people like this probably don 't want to vote
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 119.04 124.99 <NA> for people who look like this and are named barack obama we think it 's a matter of race and is this fair are we
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 125 133.98 <NA> kind of stigmatizing people from arkansas and this part of the country and the answer is it is at least partially fair <unk> we know that race was a factor and the reason why we know that is because
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 133.82 138.45 <NA> we asked those people actually we didn 't ask them but when they conducted exit polls
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 138.29 145.36 <NA> in every state in thirty seven states out of the fifty they asked a question that was pretty direct about race they asked this question 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 145.35 154.61 <NA> in deciding your vote for president today was the race of the candidate a factor <unk> we 're looking for people that said yes race was a factor moreover it was an important factor
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 155.6 165.8 <NA> and people who voted for john mccain as a result of that factor maybe in combination with other factors and maybe alone we 're looking for this behavior among white voters or really
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 165.7 167.93 <NA> non black voters <unk> 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 167.53 179.28 <NA> so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question in louisiana about one in five white voters said yes one of the big reasons why i voted against barack obama is because he was an
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 180.04 190.2 <NA> if those people had voted for obama even half of them obama would have won louisiana safely same is true with i think all of these states you see on the top of the list meanwhile <unk> california <unk>
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 190.15 199.17 <NA> new york we can say oh we 're enlightened but you know certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted i suppose manifestation of racially based voting 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 204.9 208.79 <NA> <unk> said yes barack obama 's race was a problem for me you see 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 208.55 219.19 <NA> comparing the map to ' ninety six you see an overlap here this really seems to explain why barack obama did worse in this one part of the country so we have to ask why is racism <unk>
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 219.09 224.75 <NA> <unk> predictable in some way is there something driving this is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 226.9 231.26 <NA> <unk> or are there more systematic factors at work and so we can look at a bunch of different variables 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 231.26 239.67 <NA> these are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time things like income and religion education which of these seem to drive
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 239.28 244.31 <NA> this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on november 4th 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 244.3 249.74 <NA> and there are a couple of these that that have strong predictive relationships one of which is
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 250.58 251.82 <NA> <unk> where you see the states
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 251.65 264.15 <NA> with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red <unk> and you see this part of the country the kind of appalachians region is less educated it 's just a fact and you see the relationship there with the racially based voting patterns 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 264.29 269.67 <NA> the other variable that 's important is the type of neighborhood that you live in 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 269.75 274.81 <NA> states that are more rural even to some extent of the states like new hampshire and maine they
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 277.71 292.39 <NA> <unk> voting against barack obama so it 's the combination of these two things it 's education and the type of neighbors that you have which we 'll talk about more in a moment and the thing about states like arkansas and tennessee is that they 're both very rural and they are educationally impoverished <unk> 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 292.89 299.93 <NA> so yes racism is predictable these things among maybe other variables but these things seem to predict it we 're going to drill
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 300.13 313.32 <NA> <unk> bit more now into something called the general social survey this is conducted by the university of chicago every other year <unk> and they ask a series of really interesting questions in two thousand they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 313.08 318.91 <NA> one simple question they asked is does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 318.91 329.97 <NA> we can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different in cites about eighty percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race but in rural communities only about
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 329.96 340.32 <NA> <unk> thirty percent probably because if you live on a farm you might not have a lot of neighbors period but nevertheless you 're not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you so what we 're going to do now
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 339.83 349.95 <NA> is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors or really some neighbor of another race and people who have only white neighbors 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 350 354.52 <NA> and we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes not a lot of difference this was
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 355.08 368.51 <NA> <unk> eight years ago some people were more republican back then but you see democrats versus republican not a big difference based on who your neighbors are and even some questions about race for example affirmative action which is kind of a political question a policy question about race if you will
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 368.51 375.05 <NA> not much difference here affirmative action is not very popular frankly with white voters period but people with black neighbors and people
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 376.12 378.86 <NA> <unk> neighborhoods feel no differently about it really 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 378.63 382.7 <NA> but if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 382.5 392.75 <NA> do you favor a law banning interracial marriage there is a big difference people who don 't have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial <unk>
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 392.65 399.69 <NA> <unk> marriage as people who do just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you and likewise they asked not in two thousand but in the same survey
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 405.02 416.54 <NA> <unk> you see people without neighbors who are african american who were much more likely to say that would give me a problem so it 's really not even about urban versus rural it 's about who you live with racism is predictable and it 's predicted by
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 416.54 424.96 <NA> interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you people of other races so if you want to address it the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 425.61 429.99 <NA> <unk> have a couple of very obvious i suppose ideas for maybe how to do that 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 430 439.16 <NA> i 'm a big fan of cities especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups i think cities
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 438.83 449.11 <NA> facilitate more of the kind of networking the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis but also not everyone wants to live in a city certainly not a city like new york so we can think more about things like <unk>
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 449.06 454.85 <NA> street grids this is the neighborhood where i grew up in east lansing michigan it 's a traditional midwestern community which means you have real
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 454.78 463.01 <NA> <unk> grid you have real neighborhoods and real trees and real streets you can walk on and you interact a lot with your neighbors people you like people you might not know
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 462.76 472.22 <NA> <unk> and as a result it 's a very tolerant community which is different i think than something like this which is in schaumburg illinois where every little set of houses has their own <unk>
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 474.1 475.11 <NA> <unk> starbucks and stuff
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 475 480.36 <NA> i think that actually this type of urban design which became more prevalent in the <unk>
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 481.31 489.27 <NA> <unk> 1980s i think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under ronald reagan <unk> but also here is another idea we have
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 488.78 498.64 <NA> is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from new york abroad but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from nyu 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 498.64 499.84 <NA> have them go study for a
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 500.25 503.95 <NA> <unk> university of arkansas and vice versa do it at the high school level <unk> 
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 503.95 511.97 <NA> literally there are people who might be in school in arkansas or tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 511.75 520.79 <NA> another part of the country or of another racial group i think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do
NateSilver_2009A 1 NateSilver_2009A 520.55 523.49 <NA> get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise
