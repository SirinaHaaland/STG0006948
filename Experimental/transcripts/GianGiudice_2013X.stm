GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 29.72 39.33 <NA> <unk> day of the discovery of the higgs boson <unk> well at least here at cern <unk> but for me the biggest surprise of that day
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 38.84 41.66 <NA> was that there was no big surprise 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 41.66 50.04 <NA> in the eye of a theoretical physicist the higgs boson is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass <unk> 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 49.58 54.49 <NA> but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 54.84 57.94 <NA> <unk> too many questions are left unanswered 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 57.94 65.32 <NA> the higgs boson does not share the beauty <unk> the symmetry the elegance of the rest of the elementary particle world 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 64.83 74.32 <NA> for this reason the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the higgs boson could not be the full story <unk> 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 73.83 79.19 <NA> we were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the higgs boson
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 79.6 87.83 <NA> <unk> instead so far the measurements coming from the lhc show no signs of new particles or unexpected phenomena 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 87.61 91.25 <NA> of course <unk> the verdict is not definitive 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 91.12 104.46 <NA> in two thousand and fifteen the lhc will almost double the energy of the colliding protons <unk> and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 104.84 108.06 <NA> <unk> and we will certainly learn much more <unk> 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 107.66 119.2 <NA> but for the moment <unk> since we have found no evidence for new phenomena let us suppose that the particles that we know today <unk> including the higgs boson <unk> 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 119.2 122.89 <NA> are the only elementary particles in nature <unk>

GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 127.76 129.97 <NA> let 's see where this
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 129.96 132.79 <NA> <unk> hypothesis is going to lead us

GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 138.23 147.4 <NA> and to explain my point let me first tell you what the higgs is about and to do so we have to go back
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 146.97 154.88 <NA> to one tenth of a billionth of a second after the big bang <unk> and according to the higgs theory
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 154.9 159.89 <NA> <unk> at that instant a dramatic event took place in the universe
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 161.22 164.49 <NA> underwent a phase transition

GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 172.75 179.97 <NA> but in our case the phase transition is not a change in the way the molecules are arranged inside
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 179.96 184.65 <NA> <unk> the material <unk> but is about a change of the very fabric of <unk>
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 186.17 194.64 <NA> during this phase transition empty space became filled with a substance that we now call higgs field <unk> 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 194.64 204.73 <NA> and this substance may seem invisible to us <unk> but it has a physical reality it surrounds us all the time just like the air we breathe in this room
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 205.2 216.7 <NA> and some elementary particles interact with this substance gaining energy in the process <unk> and this intrinsic energy is what we call the mass of a particle <unk> 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 216.5 224.65 <NA> and by discovering the higgs boson <unk> the lhc has conclusively proved that this substance is real <unk> 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 224.65 228.61 <NA> because it is the stuff the higgs bosons are made of 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 228.36 229.97 <NA> and this in a nutshell
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 230.19 236.75 <NA> is the essence of the higgs story <unk> but this story is far more interesting than that 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 236.44 245.99 <NA> by studying the higgs theory <unk> theoretical physicists discovered not through an experiment but with the power of mathematics

GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 276.68 279.97 <NA> and the mere existence of another state
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 280.37 284.38 <NA> of the higgs field poses a potential problem 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 284.58 286.53 <NA> this is because 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 286.37 298.93 <NA> according to the laws of quantum mechanics it is possible to have transitions between two states <unk> even in the presence of an energy barrier separating the two states <unk>

GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 326.25 329.85 <NA> you would have to wait a really long time before it happens
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 329.86 337.44 <NA> but believe me quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon and it has been observed in many systems 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 337.44 346.68 <NA> for instance the tunnel diode a component used in electronics works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling <unk> 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 346.46 348.46 <NA> but let 's go back to the higgs field

GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 362.94 374.17 <NA> and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water <unk> bubbles of vapor form inside the water then they expand turning liquid into into gas 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 373.74 374.9 <NA> in the same
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 377.47 392.12 <NA> <unk> higgs state could come into existence because of quantum tunneling <unk> the bubble would then expand at the speed of light invading all space and turning the higgs field from the familiar state into a new state 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 391.81 393.86 <NA> is this a problem <unk> 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 393.61 404.57 <NA> yes it 's a big a problem <unk> we may not realize it in ordinary life <unk> but the intensity of the higgs field is critical for the structure of matter 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 404.93 415.59 <NA> <unk> the higgs field were only a few times more intense <unk> we would see atoms shrinking neutrons decaying inside atomic nuclei nuclei disintegrating <unk>

GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 441.48 450.11 <NA> so i wonder is it possible that in the future the higgs field will undergo a phase transition
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 450.64 458.18 <NA> <unk> through quantum tunneling will be transformed into this nasty ultra dense state 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 457.99 464.97 <NA> in other words <unk> i ask myself what is the fate of the higgs field in our universe <unk> 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 464.97 474.96 <NA> and the crucial ingredient necessary to answer this question is the higgs boson mass <unk> and experiments at the lhc found that
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 480.08 486.63 <NA> <unk> this is tiny when expressed in familiar units because it 's equal to something like ten to the minus twenty two grams <unk> 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 486.2 497.22 <NA> but it is large in particle physics units <unk> because it is equal to the weight of an entire molecule of a dna constituent 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 496.76 500.11 <NA> so armed with this information from the lhc
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 500.37 508.18 <NA> <unk> together with some colleagues here at cern <unk> we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into <unk>

GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 516.2 521.38 <NA> that the measured value of the higgs boson mass is very special 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 521.37 529.66 <NA> it has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 530.05 539 <NA> <unk> field is in a wobbly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse <unk> so

GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 558.95 570 <NA> our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the higgs field is not likely to occur in the next ten to the one hundred years <unk> 
GianGiudice_2013X 1 GianGiudice_2013X 569.99 578.38 <NA> and this is a very long time it 's even longer than than the time it takes for italy to form a stable government
