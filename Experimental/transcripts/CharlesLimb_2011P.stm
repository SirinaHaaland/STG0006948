CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 100.26 104.73 <NA> acoustic vibrations in the air little waves of energy in the air that tickle our
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 105.45 118.66 <NA> somehow in tickling our eardrum that transmits energy down our hearing bones which get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea and then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves that somehow wind up in our brains
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 118.49 124.99 <NA> as a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music that process is entirely abstract and very very unusual <unk>
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 125 134.15 <NA> we could discuss that topic alone for days to really try to figure out how is it that we hear something that 's emotional from something that starts out as a vibration in the air 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 134.15 138.77 <NA> turns out that if you have hearing loss most people that lose their hearing lose it
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 138.58 144.82 <NA> at what 's called the cochlea the inner ear <unk> and it 's at the hair cell level that they do this <unk> now

CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 164.83 170.54 <NA> as a musician <unk> i can tell you that if i had to have a cochlear implant <unk> i 'd be heartbroken <unk>

CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 240.13 246.29 <NA> <unk> two hundred years i mean literally they used to do things like stick <unk> ear shaped objects onto your ears
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 250.16 260.4 <NA> <unk> you couldn 't even look at the eardrum so it 's not too surprising that there were no good treatments for hearing loss and now today we have the modern <unk> multi channel cochlear implant <unk> which is an outpatient procedure it 's surgically placed <unk>
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 260.3 274.93 <NA> <unk> inside the inner ear it takes about an hour and a half to two hours depending on where it 's done <unk> under general anesthesia <unk> and in the end you achieve something like this where an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea <unk> now actually this is quite crude in comparison to our regular inner ear <unk> but
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 275.04 280.87 <NA> <unk> is that same girl who is implanted now this is her ten years later <unk> and this is a video that was
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 280.86 285.2 <NA> taken by my surgical mentor dr john niparko who implanted her if we could play this video please

CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 343.91 351.42 <NA> <unk> and so she 's phenomenal <unk> and there 's no way that you can 't look at that as an overwhelming success it is it 's a huge success story in modern medicine <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 351.42 354.85 <NA> however despite this incredible facility that some
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 354.84 365.02 <NA> <unk> cochlear implant users display with language <unk> you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can 't hear music almost at all in fact most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so <unk>
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 364.92 371.89 <NA> <unk> bad <unk> and so when it comes to this idea of restoring beauty to somebody 's life <unk> we have a long way to go when it comes to audition 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 379.9 383.34 <NA> <unk> fact the whole reason we use it is because it has <unk> semantic specificity 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 383.34 390.77 <NA> when you say a word what you care is that that word was perceived correctly <unk> you don 't care that the word sounded pretty when it was spoken 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 391.06 399.84 <NA> music is entirely different when you hear music <unk> if it doesn 't sound good what 's the point there 's really very little point in listening to music when it doesn 't sound good to you 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 399.84 404.19 <NA> the acoustics of music are much harder than those of language and you can see on this figure that the
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 404.81 406.65 <NA> <unk> frequency range and the
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 406.48 410.11 <NA> decibel range the dynamic range of music is far more heterogeneous <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 410.11 418.17 <NA> so if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant <unk> what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 417.86 423.57 <NA> because i always view music as the pinnacle of hearing if you can hear music you should be able to hear anything <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 423.83 429.97 <NA> now the problems begin first with pitch perception i mean most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 429.99 433.6 <NA> <unk> of music and without the ability to perceive pitch well 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 433.35 442.67 <NA> music and melody is a very difficult thing to do forget about a harmony and things like that now this is a midi arrangement of rachmaninoff 's prelude now if we could just play this
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 468.37 475.07 <NA> <unk> if we consider that in a cochlear implant patient pitch perception could be off as much as two octaves 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 474.76 479.97 <NA> let 's see what happens here when we randomize this to within one semitone we would be thrilled if we had one
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 479.99 482.47 <NA> <unk> semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 507 516.55 <NA> <unk> now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation <unk> you distort it a little bit especially in terms of pitch and you 've changed it <unk> and it it might be that you kind of like that 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 516.48 525.28 <NA> that 's kind of hypnotic but it certainly wasn 't the way the music was intended <unk> and you 're not hearing the same thing that most people who have normal hearing are hearing <unk> now
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 525.12 529.97 <NA> the other issue comes with not just the ability to tell pitches apart but the ability to tell sounds
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 529.93 537.41 <NA> <unk> apart <unk> most cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument if we could play these two sound clips in succession the trumpet 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 539.26 541.04 <NA> and the second one that 's
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 542.98 554.91 <NA> a violin these have similar wave forms they 're both sustained instruments cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between these instruments <unk> the sound quality or the sound of the sound is how i like to describe timbre <unk> tone color they
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 554.84 561.21 <NA> <unk> cannot tell these things whatsoever this implant is not transmitting the quality of music that usually provides things like warmth <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 561.62 574.9 <NA> now if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant and you have them listen to speech have them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody what you find is that the auditory cortex is the most active during speech <unk> you would think that because these
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 575.19 584.33 <NA> <unk> are optimized for speech they were designed for speech <unk> but actually if you look at melody what you find is that there 's very little cortical activity in implant users compared with normal hearing controls 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 584.33 591.91 <NA> so for whatever reason this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices during melody perception <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 592.5 599.87 <NA> now the next question is well how does it really sound <unk> now we 've been doing some studies to really get a sense of what sound
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 600.19 610.31 <NA> <unk> is like for these implant users i 'm going to play you two clips of usher one which is normal and one which has almost no high frequencies almost no low frequencies and not even that many mid frequencies go ahead and play that <unk>
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 620.95 623.84 <NA> i had patients tell me that those sound the same 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 624.64 629.94 <NA> they cannot differentiate sound quality differences between those two clips again
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 629.96 635.38 <NA> <unk> we are very very far away in just getting to where we want to get to now the question comes to mind is there any hope <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 635.38 641.76 <NA> and yes <unk> there is hope now i don 't know if anybody knows who this is this is does somebody know 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 641.93 643.83 <NA> this is beethoven
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 644.12 650.17 <NA> <unk> now why would we know what beethoven 's skull looks like because his grave was exhumed and
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 650.19 658.79 <NA> <unk> turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died to try to look at the cause of his deafness which is why he has molding clay and his skull is bulging out on the side there 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 658.79 662.62 <NA> but beethoven composed music long after he lost his hearing <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 662.16 667.85 <NA> what that suggests is that even in the case of hearing loss <unk> the capacity for music remains
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 667.49 670.9 <NA> the brains remain hardwired for music <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 671.01 679.97 <NA> i 've been very lucky to work with dr david ryugo where i 've been working on deaf cats that are white and trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants this is a cat
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 679.96 682.65 <NA> <unk> that 's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 736.11 742.22 <NA> <unk> i 'm not suggesting that the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we 're hearing it i 'm suggesting that with training
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 742.04 746.83 <NA> you can imbue a musical sound with significance even in a cat 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 747.06 754.94 <NA> if we were to direct efforts towards training cochlear implant users to hear music because right now there 's virtually no effort put towards that
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 754.92 763.13 <NA> no rehabilitative strategies very little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music we would come a long way <unk> now
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 762.76 766.82 <NA> i want to show you one last video and this is of a student of mine
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 766.87 775.26 <NA> named joseph who i had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab he 's deaf <unk> and he learned to play the piano after he received the cochlear implant
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 775.94 777.31 <NA> <unk> and here 's a video of joseph
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 833.8 837.75 <NA> <unk> although these hearing aids were the most powerful hearing aids on the market at
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 866.66 869.16 <NA> <unk> is now a medical student at yale university <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 868.93 876.42 <NA> and he 's contemplating a surgical career one of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery there are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 876.42 879.76 <NA> and this is really unheard of stuff and this is all because of this technology
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 880.11 893.95 <NA> <unk> and the fact that he can play the piano like that is a testament to his brain <unk> truth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant <unk> because all you have to do is press the keys at the right time you don 't actually have to hear it i know he doesn 't hear well because i 've heard him do karaoke 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 894.96 899.9 <NA> and it 's one of the most awful things heartwarming but awful
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 902.23 908.45 <NA> <unk> and so there is certainly a lot of hope but there 's a lot more that needs to be done so i just want to conclude with the following words 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 908.45 913.79 <NA> when it comes to restoration of hearing we have certainly come a long way a remarkably long way <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 913.63 927.99 <NA> and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing <unk> and let me tell you right now it 's fine that we would all be very happy with speech but i tell you if we lost our hearing if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing <unk> you would want perfect hearing back
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 930.07 931.8 <NA> <unk> you would want perfect hearing <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 932.12 938.58 <NA> restoration of basic sensory function is critical and i don 't mean to understate how important it is to restore basic function <unk> 
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 938.58 943.53 <NA> but it 's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty where we can get inspiring and
CharlesLimb_2011P 1 CharlesLimb_2011P 943.64 946.96 <NA> i don 't think that we should give up on beauty and i want to thank you for your time
