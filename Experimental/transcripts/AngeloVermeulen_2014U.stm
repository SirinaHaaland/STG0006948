AngeloVermeulen_2014U 1 AngeloVermeulen_2014U 122.87 129.97 <NA> doing this mission i really started thinking more deeply about our future in outer space we will venture into

AngeloVermeulen_2014U 1 AngeloVermeulen_2014U 217.49 223.63 <NA> that actually we can also inhabit the first version was done in
AngeloVermeulen_2014U 1 AngeloVermeulen_2014U 223.17 229.97 <NA> in belgium and holland it was built with a team of almost fifty people this is the second iteration of that

AngeloVermeulen_2014U 1 AngeloVermeulen_2014U 240.07 250.82 <NA> <unk> and they built an entirely new much more biomorphic architecture on top of that and that 's another crucial part of the project <unk> it 's an evolving artwork <unk> evolving architecture 
AngeloVermeulen_2014U 1 AngeloVermeulen_2014U 255.17 264.99 <NA> <unk> which was using caravans as modules to build a starship <unk> we bought some second hand caravans <unk> cut them open <unk> and reassembled them into a starship <unk>

AngeloVermeulen_2014U 1 AngeloVermeulen_2014U 275.82 281.28 <NA> <unk> and technology so there 's always a strong ecological component in the project here you can see
AngeloVermeulen_2014U 1 AngeloVermeulen_2014U 281.06 290.29 <NA> aquaponic systems that are actually surrounding the astronauts so they 're constantly in in contact with part of the food that they 're eating <unk> 
AngeloVermeulen_2014U 1 AngeloVermeulen_2014U 290.22 300.23 <NA> now a very typical thing for this project project is that we run our own isolation missions inside these art and design projects
AngeloVermeulen_2014U 1 AngeloVermeulen_2014U 300.58 311.99 <NA> <unk> we actually lock ourselves up for multiple days on end <unk> and test what we build and this is for example on the right hand side you can see an isolation mission in the museum of modern art in ljubljana in slovenia <unk>

AngeloVermeulen_2014U 1 AngeloVermeulen_2014U 362.82 371.92 <NA> and that makes it extremely interesting to build our project <unk> because suddenly sustainability is something we have to explore fully

AngeloVermeulen_2014U 1 AngeloVermeulen_2014U 398.35 404.61 <NA> so we 're trying to redefine how we look at our future in outer space by exploring
