LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 23.24 29.79 <NA> about how stars and planets interact to form their own ecosystem and make habitats that are amenable to life
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 30.08 39.06 <NA> in this image of the tokyo skyline i 've hidden data from the newest planet hunting space telescope on the block the kepler mission can you see it 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 39.95 41.52 <NA> there we go <unk> 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 41.54 50.26 <NA> this is just a tiny part of the sky the kepler stares at where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over one hundred and fifty thousand stars 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 50.26 54.18 <NA> all at once <unk> every half hour and very precisely 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 53.69 54.94 <NA> and what we 're looking
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 55.4 64.39 <NA> is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 64.14 72.8 <NA> in just over two years of operations we 've found over one thousand two hundred potential new planetary systems around other stars 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 72.8 74.84 <NA> to give you some perspective 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 75.01 80.69 <NA> <unk> the previous two decades of searching we had only known about four hundred prior to kepler 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 80.62 83.34 <NA> when we see these little dips in the light 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 83.34 93.12 <NA> we can determine a number of things for one thing we can determine that there 's a planet there but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 92.9 96.45 <NA> that distance is really important because it tells us
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 96.29 104.76 <NA> how much light the planet receives overall and that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it 's a little like you or i sitting around a campfire
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 105.05 110.97 <NA> <unk> you want to be close enough to the campfire so that you 're warm <unk> but not so close that you 're too toasty and you get burned <unk> 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 110.99 117.87 <NA> however there 's more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall and i 'll tell you why <unk> 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 118.1 124.9 <NA> this is our star this is our sun it 's shown here in visible light that 's the light that you can see with your own
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 126.03 131.69 <NA> <unk> 'll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball that sun that we all draw when we 're children <unk> 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 131.69 136.78 <NA> but you 'll notice something else and that 's that the face of the sun has freckles 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 136.83 146.33 <NA> these freckles are called sunspots and they are just one of the manifestations of the sun 's magnetic field they also cause the light from the star to vary <unk> 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 146.33 151.76 <NA> and we can measure this very very precisely with kepler and trace their effects 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 151.57 154.61 <NA> however <unk> these are just the tip of the iceberg
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 154.93 157.62 <NA> <unk> we had uv eyes or x ray eyes 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 157.62 166.47 <NA> we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our sun 's magnetic activity the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 166.24 172.73 <NA> just think even when it 's cloudy outside these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 173.53 179.25 <NA> so when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable whether it might be amenable to life
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 179.99 185.83 <NA> <unk> to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is but we want to know about its space weather
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 185.59 195.25 <NA> this <unk> high energy radiation the uv and the x rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high energy radiation <unk> 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 195.25 204.94 <NA> and so we can 't really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system i 'm showing here
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 205.01 212.9 <NA> venus earth and mars three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size but only one of which is really a good place to live <unk> 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 212.9 215.54 <NA> but what we can do in the meantime
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 215.36 218.14 <NA> is measure the light from our stars
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 217.8 227.98 <NA> and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 227.67 229.97 <NA> kepler won 't find a planet around
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 229.96 236.24 <NA> <unk> every single star it looks at <unk> but really every measurement it makes is precious 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 235.84 240.61 <NA> because it 's teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 240.62 246.39 <NA> and how it 's really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe <unk> 
LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 1 LucianneWalkowicz_2011G 246.2 252.2 <NA> while it 's kepler the telescope the instrument that stares it 's we life who are searching <unk>
