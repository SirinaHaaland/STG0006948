DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 17.31 24.81 <NA> the good news is there might be an easy solution to that and that 's using our eyes more <unk> so visualizing information so that we can see the patterns and connections that
DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 25.94 34.35 <NA> <unk> and then designing that information so it makes more sense or it tells a story or allows us to focus only on the information that 's important <unk> 
DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 34.46 40.62 <NA> failing that visualized information can just look really cool so let 's see 
DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 41.54 50.08 <NA> this is the $ billion dollar o gram and this image arose out of frustration i had with the reporting of billion dollar amounts in the press

DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 52.84 61.06 <NA> five hundred billion for this pipeline twenty billion for this war it doesn 't make any sense <unk> so the only way to understand it is visually and relatively <unk> 
DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 60.93 72.82 <NA> so i scraped a load of reported figures from various news outlets and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts and the colors here represent the motivation behind the money <unk> so purple is

DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 90.27 92.51 <NA> me point out some that i really like

DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 127.85 129.97 <NA> now it 's great because now we have this texture
DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 129.99 139.57 <NA> <unk> can add numbers to it as well so we could say well a new figure comes out let 's see african debt how much of this diagram do you think might be taken up by the debt that africa owes to the west let 's take a look <unk> 
DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 139.74 143.23 <NA> so there it is two hundred and twenty seven billion
DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 142.83 149.99 <NA> is what africa owes and the recent financial crisis how much of this diagram might that figure take up what has that cost the world let 's

DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 995.65 998.3 <NA> just to wrap up i wanted to say that
DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 998.23 1004.97 <NA> it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions <unk> and information design
DavidMcCandless_2010G 1 DavidMcCandless_2010G 1005.26 1015.83 <NA> is about solving information problems it feels like we have a lot of information problems in our society at the moment from the overload and the saturation to the breakdown of trust and reliability <unk>
