BreneBrown_2010X 1 BreneBrown_2010X 369.66 374.92 <NA> and this may be one of the most important things that i 've ever learned in the decade of doing this research

BreneBrown_2010X 1 BreneBrown_2010X 404.63 412.89 <NA> <unk> okay and what it was is that if i roughly took the people i interviewed and divided them into people

BreneBrown_2010X 1 BreneBrown_2010X 425 433.09 <NA> folks who are always wondering if they 're good enough <unk> there was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging
BreneBrown_2010X 1 BreneBrown_2010X 432.6 438.79 <NA> and the people who really struggle for it and that was the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging

BreneBrown_2010X 1 BreneBrown_2010X 454.69 463.1 <NA> <unk> connection was something that personally and professionally i felt like i needed to understand better so what i did
BreneBrown_2010X 1 BreneBrown_2010X 462.94 471.56 <NA> is i took all of the interviews where i saw worthiness where i saw people living that way and just looked at those
