GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 14.32 17.43 <NA> <unk> the brain is an amazing and complex organ 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 17.43 25.02 <NA> and while many people are fascinated by the brain they can 't really tell you that much about the properties about how the brain works because we don 't teach neuroscience in
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 26.33 35.17 <NA> <unk> and one of the reasons why is that the equipment is so complex and so expensive that it 's really only done at major universities and large institutions
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 35.17 38.97 <NA> and so in order to be able to access the brain you really need to
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 38.51 44.8 <NA> dedicate your life and spend six and a half years as a graduate student just to become a neuroscientist to get access to these tools 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 44.8 49.99 <NA> and that 's a shame because one out of five of us that 's twenty percent of the entire world will have a neurological
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 51.24 60.43 <NA> <unk> and there are zero cures for these diseases <unk> and so it seems that what we should be doing <unk> is reaching back earlier in the eduction process and
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 60 67.88 <NA> teaching students about neuroscience so that in the future they may be thinking about possibly becoming a brain scientist <unk> 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 67.88 79.88 <NA> when i was a graduate student my lab mate tim marzullo and myself decided that what if we took this complex equipment that we have for studying the brain and made it simple enough and affordable enough that anyone
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 79.89 82.52 <NA> that you know an amateur or a high school student <unk> 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 82.29 87.57 <NA> could learn and actually participate in the discovery of neuroscience and so we did just that 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 87.57 98.67 <NA> a few years ago we started a company called backyard brains and we make diy neuroscience equipment and i brought some here tonight and i want to do some demonstrations you guys want to see some so
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 98.48 99.54 <NA> i need a
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 106.73 109.99 <NA> <unk> i 'm going to record from your brain <unk> have you had this before sk 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 109.81 114.25 <NA> no gg i need you to stick out your arm for science <unk> roll up your sleeve a bit
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 114.25 121.77 <NA> <unk> so what i 'm going to do i 'm putting electrodes on your arm and you 're probably wondering i just said i 'm going to record from your brain what am i doing with your arm
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 121.37 124.99 <NA> well you have about eighty billion neurons
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 125 129.46 <NA> <unk> inside your brain right now they 're sending electrical messages back and forth and chemical messages
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 129.09 135.58 <NA> but some of your neurons right here in your motor cortex are going to send messages down when you move your arm like this they 're going to
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 135.58 144.56 <NA> go down across your corpus callosum down onto your spinal cord to your lower motor neuron out to your muscles here and that electrical discharge is going to be picked up by these
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 144.37 150.02 <NA> electrodes right here and we 're going to be able to listen to exactly what your brain is going to be doing so i 'm going to turn
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 158.32 167.54 <NA> <unk> so what you 're listening to so this is your motor units happening right here <unk> let 's take a look at it as well so i 'm going to stand over here 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 168.46 174.99 <NA> and i 'm going to open up our app here so now i want you to squeeze so right
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 175.22 186 <NA> <unk> these are the motor units that are happening from her spinal cord out to her muscle right here and as she 's doing it you 're seeing the electrical activity that 's happening here you can even click here and try to see one of them so keep doing it really really hard
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 186 192.99 <NA> so now we 've paused on one motor action potential that 's happening right now inside of your brain <unk> do you
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 192.86 194.56 <NA> guys want to see some more
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 206.85 212.53 <NA> <unk> to stand right here so <unk> when you 're moving your arm like this your brain is sending a signal down to your muscles right here <unk> 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 212.34 216.46 <NA> i want you to move your arm as well <unk> so your brain is going to send
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 215.97 224.32 <NA> a signal down to your muscles and so it turns out that there is a nerve that 's right here that runs up here that innervates these three fingers and
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 223.83 229.94 <NA> it 's close enough to the skin that we might be able to stimulate that so that what we can do is copy
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 229.93 232.32 <NA> <unk> your brain signals going out to your hand
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 232.14 238.33 <NA> and inject it into your hand so that your hand will move when your brain tells your hand to move so in a sense <unk> 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 238.34 245.12 <NA> she will take away your free will and you will no longer have any control over this hand <unk> you with me
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 244.81 247.01 <NA> <unk> so i just need to hook you up 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 249.16 252.75 <NA> laughter so i 'm going to find your ulnar nerve which is probably right around here
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 254.98 262.23 <NA> 're signing up for when you come up so now i 'm going to move away and we 're going to plug it in to our human to human interface over here <unk> 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 263.87 267.9 <NA> okay so sam i want you to squeeze your hand again
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 268.1 270.3 <NA> <unk> do it again
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 269.9 277.02 <NA> <unk> perfect so now i 'm going to hook you up over here so that you get the it 's going to feel a little bit weird at first this is going to feel like a 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 278.12 279.91 <NA> you know when you lose your
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 279.81 287.87 <NA> <unk> free will and someone else becomes your agent it does feel a bit strange now i want you to relax your hand <unk> <unk> sam you 're with me <unk> so you 're going to
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 314.68 322.67 <NA> <unk> so right now your brain is controlling your arm and it 's also controlling his arm so go ahead and just do it one more time all right so it 's perfect 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 322.48 329.97 <NA> so now what would happen if i took over my control of your your hand and so just relax your hand <unk> what happens
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 331.82 338.28 <NA> nothing why not because the brain has to do it so you do it again all right that 's perfect 
GregGage_2015U 1 GregGage_2015U 339.65 341.83 <NA> thank you guys for being such a good sport
