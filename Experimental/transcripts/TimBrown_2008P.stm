TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 467.08 470.3 <NA> we use it in a pretty pragmatic way to be honest
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 469.99 479.73 <NA> <unk> we think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions helps us do our jobs better and helps us feel better when when we do them now

TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 564.69 575.16 <NA> this behavior makes complete sense because you can do a lot more with boxes than you can do with a toy even one like say <unk> tickle me elmo which despite its ingenuity

TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1034.54 1044.97 <NA> another example is a group of of designers who were working on a surgical instrument with some surgeons <unk> they were meeting with them they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device <unk>
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1044.92 1054.97 <NA> <unk> and one of the designers ran out of the room and grabbed a white board marker and a film canister which is now becoming a very precious prototyping medium and a clothespin he taped them all together ran back
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1055.05 1064.83 <NA> <unk> into the room and said you mean something like this and the surgeons grabbed hold of it and said well i want to hold it like this or like that and all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1064.84 1066.62 <NA> around a tangible
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1066.41 1070.12 <NA> a tangible object <unk> and in the end it turned into
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1069.78 1078.83 <NA> a real device and so this behavior is all about quickly getting something into the real world and having your thinking advanced as a result
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1080.11 1087.85 <NA> <unk> at ideo theres a kind of a back to preschool feel sometimes about the environment <unk> the prototyping carts <unk> filled with
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1087.86 1101.4 <NA> colored paper and play doh and glue sticks and stuff i mean they do have a bit of a kindergarten feel to them but the important idea is that everythings at hand everythings around so when designers are working on ideas they can start building stuff
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1101.17 1104.85 <NA> whenever they want they dont necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1104.78 1107.95 <NA> <unk> workshop to do it and we think thats pretty important <unk> 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1107.74 1111.82 <NA> and then the sad thing is although preschools are full of this kind of stuff 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1111.82 1119.5 <NA> as kids go through the school system it all gets taken away they lose this stuff that facilitates this sort
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1119.26 1125.94 <NA> of playful and building mode of thinking <unk> and of course by the time you get to the average workplace <unk> 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1125.51 1128.14 <NA> maybe the best construction tool we have might be the
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1130.1 1132.88 <NA> but by giving project teams
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1132.54 1133.9 <NA> and
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1133.5 1141.1 <NA> <unk> and the clients who theyre working with permission to think with their hands <unk> quite complex ideas can can
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1140.67 1149.87 <NA> spring into life and go right through to execution much more easily <unk> this is a nurse using a very simple as you can see plasticine
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1150.58 1157.43 <NA> <unk> explaining what she wants out of a portable information system to a team of technologists and designers that are working with her
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1157.27 1164.69 <NA> in a hospital and just having this very simple prototype allows her to talk about what she wants in a much more powerful way 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1164.38 1173.55 <NA> and of course by building quick prototypes <unk> we can get out and test our ideas with consumers and users much more quickly than if were trying to describe them
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1173.36 1175.02 <NA> through through words
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1177.56 1187.28 <NA> <unk> but what about designing something that isnt physical something like a service or an experience something that exists as a series of interactions over time instead of <unk>
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1187.29 1195.76 <NA> of building play this can be approached with role play so if youre designing an interaction between two people such as i dont know ordering
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1195.58 1200.23 <NA> food at a fast food joint or something you need to be able to imagine how that experience
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1200.22 1208.63 <NA> <unk> might feel over a period of time <unk> and i think the best way to achieve that and get a feeling for any flaws in your design is to act it out
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1208.59 1216.34 <NA> <unk> so we do quite a lot of work at ideo trying to convince our clients of this they can be a little skeptical ill come back to that <unk> 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1216.27 1223.72 <NA> but a place <unk> i think where the effort is really worthwhile is where people are wrestling with quite serious problems
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1223.32 1229.97 <NA> things like education or security or finance or health <unk> and this is another example in a healthcare
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1229.93 1240.14 <NA> <unk> environment of some doctors and some nurses and designers acting out a service scenario around patient care but you know <unk> many adults are pretty reluctant to engage
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1239.68 1246.8 <NA> with role play some of its embarrassment and some of it is because they just dont believe that what emerges is necessarily valid
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1246.31 1254.94 <NA> they dismiss an interesting interaction by saying you know thats just happening because theyre acting it out research into kids ' behavior actually suggests that its worth
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1254.87 1256.56 <NA> <unk> taking role playing seriously <unk> 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1256.56 1270.91 <NA> because when children play a role <unk> they actually follow social scripts quite closely that theyve learnt from us as adults <unk> if one kid plays store and another ones playing house then the whole kind of play falls down so they get used to
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1270.67 1273 <NA> quite quickly to
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1272.54 1274.81 <NA> to understanding the rules for social
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1275.82 1278.56 <NA> <unk> actually quite quick to point out when theyre broken <unk> 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1278.82 1282.1 <NA> so when as adults we role play 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1281.94 1289.36 <NA> then we have a huge set of these scripts already internalized weve gone through lots of experiences in life 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1289.29 1298 <NA> and they provide a strong intuition intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work <unk> so were very good when acting out a solution <unk> 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1297.93 1300.17 <NA> at spotting whether something lacks
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1302.68 1311.45 <NA> <unk> quite valuable when it comes to thinking about experiences another way for us as designers to explore role play is to put ourselves
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1310.99 1313.95 <NA> through an experience which were designing for
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1313.95 1324.99 <NA> and project ourselves into an experience <unk> so here are some designers <unk> who are trying to understand what it might feel like to sleep in a confined space on an airplane <unk> and so they grabbed some very simple
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1329.57 1339.72 <NA> <unk> just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite <unk> quite small places on on airplanes this is one of our designers kristian simsarian and hes <unk>
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1339.62 1350.05 <NA> <unk> putting himself through the experience of being an er patient now this is a real hospital in a real emergency room one of the reasons he chose to take this rather large video camera with him was because he didnt want the doctors and nurses thinking
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1350.79 1358.78 <NA> <unk> he was actually sick and sticking something into him that he was going to regret later so anyhow <unk> he went there with his video camera
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1358.78 1367.09 <NA> <unk> and its kind of interesting to see what he brought back because when we when we looked at the video when he got back we saw twenty minutes of this 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1367.89 1374.99 <NA> and also the amazing thing about this about this video as soon as you see it you immediately project
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1377.29 1383.76 <NA> <unk> know what it feels like all of that uncertainty while youre left out in the hallway while the docs are dealing with some more urgent case
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1383.76 1388.4 <NA> in one of the emergency rooms wondering what the hecks going on <unk> and so this notion of using <unk>
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1389.67 1402.23 <NA> or in this case living through the experience as a way of creating empathy particularly when you use video is really powerful <unk> or another one of our designers altay sendil hes here having his chest waxed not because hes very vain although actually he is no
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1401.74 1403.14 <NA> im kidding
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1402.93 1404.97 <NA> but in order to empathize with
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1404.99 1409.59 <NA> <unk> pain that chronic care patients go through when theyre having dressings removed <unk> 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1409.13 1415.56 <NA> and so sometimes these analogous experiences analogous role play can also be quite valuable so
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1415.16 1427.09 <NA> when a kid dresses up as a firefighter <unk> you know hes beginning to try on that identity he wants to know what it feels like to be a firefighter were doing the same thing as designers were trying on these experiences <unk> 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1427.09 1428.74 <NA> and so the idea of
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1429.96 1437.47 <NA> <unk> as an empathy tool as well as a tool for prototyping experiences <unk> and you know <unk> we kind of admire
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1437.52 1439.28 <NA> people who do this
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1439.28 1450.88 <NA> at ideo anyway not just because they lead to insights about the experience but also because of their willingness to explore and their ability their ability to unselfconsciously surrender themselves
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1450.48 1454.43 <NA> to the experience in short we admire their willingness to play
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1456.67 1464.5 <NA> playful exploration playful building and role play those are some of the ways that designers
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1464.34 1468.74 <NA> use play in their work <unk> and so far i admit 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1468.61 1475.2 <NA> this might feel like its a message just to go out and play like a kid <unk> and to certain extent it is
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1475.88 1480.12 <NA> <unk> i want to stress a couple of points the first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1481.16 1485.03 <NA> play has rules especially when its group play <unk>
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1485.04 1491.34 <NA> when kids play tea party or they play cops and robbers theyre following a script that theyve agreed to 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1491.27 1494.43 <NA> and its this code negotiation
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1493.94 1500.05 <NA> that leads to productive play <unk> so remember the sketching task we did at the beginning the kind of little face
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1500.34 1502.49 <NA> <unk> portrait you did well imagine
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1502.49 1511.51 <NA> if you did the same task with friends while you were drinking in a pub but everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist <unk>
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1512.61 1521.24 <NA> <unk> bought the next round of drinks that framework of rules would have turned an embarrassing difficult situation into a fun game as a result
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1522.3 1524.72 <NA> <unk> all feel perfectly secure and and have a good
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1526.84 1532.73 <NA> <unk> but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together <unk> but there arent just
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1532.39 1539.99 <NA> rules about how to play <unk> there are rules about when to play <unk> kids dont play all the time <unk> obviously
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1539.5 1550.11 <NA> <unk> they transition in and out of it and good teachers spend a lot of time thinking about how to move kids through these experiences <unk> as designers
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1550 1559.48 <NA> we need to be able to transition in and out of play also and if were running design studios we need to be able to figure out how can we transition designers through
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1559.24 1567.1 <NA> through these different experiences <unk> i think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of i think whats very different about design
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1567.1 1573.6 <NA> is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation <unk> we go through
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1573.17 1579.22 <NA> a sort of generative mode where were exploring many ideas <unk> and then we come back together again
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1580.08 1585.89 <NA> come back looking for that solution and developing that solution <unk> i think theyre two quite different modes
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1585.71 1594 <NA> divergence and convergence <unk> and i think its probably in the divergent mode that we most need playfulness 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1594 1599.99 <NA> perhaps in convergent mode we need to be more serious and so being able to move between those modes is really really
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1602.53 1613.31 <NA> <unk> a more nuanced version view of play i think is required because its very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute youre either playful or youre serious and you cant be both
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1613.27 1614.61 <NA> <unk> but
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1614.42 1622.26 <NA> thats not really true you can be a serious professional adult and at times be playful <unk> its not an either or
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1630.02 1636.27 <NA> <unk> trust to play <unk> and we need trust to be creative <unk> so theres a connection <unk> 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1636.2 1645.04 <NA> and there are a series of behaviors that weve learnt as kids <unk> and that turn out to be quite useful to us as designers <unk> they include exploration 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1645.04 1647.55 <NA> which is about going for quantity 
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1647.66 1649.63 <NA> building and thinking with your
TimBrown_2008P 1 TimBrown_2008P 1653.61 1663.56 <NA> <unk> where acting it out helps us both to have more empathy for the situations in which were designing and to create services and experiences that are seamless and authentic
