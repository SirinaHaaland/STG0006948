TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 13.39 20.87 <NA> <unk> so my name is taylor wilson i am seventeen years old and i am a nuclear physicist which may be a little hard to believe but i am
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 20.77 25.1 <NA> <unk> and i would like to make the case that
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 25.22 35.26 <NA> <unk> nuclear fusion will be that point that the bridge that t boone pickens talked about will get us to so nuclear fusion is our energy future 
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 35.26 40.56 <NA> and the second point making the case that kids can really change the world so
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 40.37 42.51 <NA> you may ask 
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 45.62 52.77 <NA> you may ask me well how do you know what our energy future is well i built a fusion reactor when i was fourteen years old 
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 53.27 54.97 <NA> that is the inside of
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 54.96 66.44 <NA> <unk> my nuclear fusion reactor <unk> i started building this project when i was about twelve or thirteen years old i decided i wanted to make a star now most of you are probably saying <unk> <unk> well
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 66.44 79.84 <NA> there 's no such thing as nuclear fusion i don 't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy well it doesn 't break even it doesn 't produce more energy out than i put in but it still does some pretty cool stuff <unk> and i assembled this
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 79.93 89.64 <NA> <unk> my garage and it now lives in the physics department of the university of nevada reno <unk> and it slams together deuterium which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it 
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 89.64 103.89 <NA> so this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that 's going on inside the sun <unk> and i 'm slamming it together so hard that that that hydrogen fuses together and in the process it has some byproducts and i utilize those byproducts
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 105.22 110.92 <NA> this previous year i won the intel international science and engineering fair <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 110.92 123.03 <NA> i developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that homeland security has for hundreds of dollars i 've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 122.63 123.79 <NA> i built this
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 129.84 138.38 <NA> <unk> produce medical isotopes instead of requiring multi million dollar facilities i 've developed a device that on a very small scale can produce these isotopes so
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 138.38 141.73 <NA> that 's my fusion reactor in the background there 
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 142.98 150.14 <NA> that is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor oh by the way i make yellowcake in my garage
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 150 153.96 <NA> so my nuclear program is as advanced as the iranians so
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 153.75 157.04 <NA> maybe i don 't want to admit to that 
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 156.55 163.13 <NA> this is me at cern in geneva switzerland which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world <unk> 
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 163.13 169.67 <NA> and this is me with president obama showing him my homeland security research 
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 173.47 179.97 <NA> so in about seven years of doing nuclear research i started out with a dream to make a star in a jar
TaylorWilson_2012 1 TaylorWilson_2012 179.72 189.13 <NA> <unk> jar a star in my garage <unk> and i ended up meeting the president and developing things that i think can change the world and i think other kids can too <unk> so thank you very much
