PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 57.94 65.17 <NA> so the first thing that is prioritized is politics try and build a political settlement first 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 66 77.14 <NA> and then the second step is to say the situation is admittedly dangerous <unk> but only for a short time so get peacekeepers there but get them home as soon as possible 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 77.13 78.17 <NA> so
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 80.05 86.45 <NA> and thirdly what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers <unk> it 's an election 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 86.14 93.65 <NA> that will produce a legitimate and accountable government <unk> so that 's the conventional approach <unk> 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 93.82 97.76 <NA> i think that approach denies reality 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 97.48 104.52 <NA> we see that there is no quick fix there 's certainly no quick security fix

PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 119 124.78 <NA> innovations <unk> does an election produce an accountable and

PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 144.55 153.79 <NA> the politics become easier as the decade progresses if you 're building on a foundation of security and

PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 166.36 168.39 <NA> the mentality

PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 179.93 186.33 <NA> <unk> productive politics <unk> and so the mentality has to shift from zero sum to <unk>
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 187.33 190.59 <NA> before you can get a productive politics
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 190.52 199.93 <NA> you can only get positive that mental shift if the reality is that prosperity is being built <unk> and in order to build prosperity <unk> we need
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 202.23 208.09 <NA> <unk> so that is what you get when you face reality but the objective of facing reality is to change reality
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 208.05 211.54 <NA> and so now let me suggest two
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 211.17 216.46 <NA> complimentary approaches to changing the reality of the situations 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 216.54 223.9 <NA> the first is to recognize the interdependence of three key actors who
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 226.42 228.47 <NA> <unk> and at the moment are uncoordinated <unk> 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 228.67 238.49 <NA> the first actor is the security council <unk> the security council typically has the responsibility for providing the peacekeepers
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 238 240.41 <NA> who build the security 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 240.37 249.36 <NA> and that needs to be recognized <unk> first of all that peacekeeping works it is a cost effective approach <unk> it does
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 249.15 253.17 <NA> increase security <unk> but it needs to be done long term it needs to be a
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 255.02 256.53 <NA> <unk> than just a couple of years 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 256.79 266.56 <NA> that 's one actor the security council the second actor different cast of guys is the donors the donors provide
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 268.04 277.18 <NA> typically in the past the donors have been interested in the first couple of years <unk> and then they got bored they moved on to some other situation
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 280.02 286.67 <NA> <unk> recovery is a slow process there are no quick processes in economics except
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 286.67 290.53 <NA> except decline <unk> you can do that quite fast 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 291.69 298.3 <NA> laughter so the donors have to stick with this situation for at least a decade <unk> 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 299.31 302.39 <NA> and then the third key actor is the
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 304.96 312.6 <NA> <unk> there are two key things it 's got to do one is it 's got to do economic reform not fuss about
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 312.42 318.75 <NA> the political constitution it 's got to reform economic policy why because during conflict
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 318.75 325.44 <NA> economic policy typically deteriorates <unk> governments snatch short term opportunities
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 326.36 332.82 <NA> <unk> by the end of the conflict <unk> the chickens have come home to roost so this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 332.9 340.99 <NA> so there is a reform agenda <unk> and there is an inclusion agenda <unk> the inclusion agenda doesn 't come from elections elections
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 340.78 349.66 <NA> produce a loser who is then excluded <unk> so the the inclusion agenda means genuinely bringing people inside
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 355.8 359.06 <NA> <unk> over a long term <unk> if the
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 358.85 368.08 <NA> security council doesn 't commit to security over the course of a decade <unk> you don 't get the reassurance which produces private investment <unk> 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 367.92 370.85 <NA> if you don 't get the policy reform
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 370.67 379.55 <NA> and the aid <unk> you don 't get the economic recovery which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers <unk> so we should recognize that
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 379.51 381.14 <NA> <unk> interdependence 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 381.61 385.26 <NA> by formal mutual commitments <unk> 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 385.26 394.52 <NA> the united nations actually has a language for these mutual commitments the recognition of mutual commitments <unk> it 's called the language of compact <unk> 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 394.18 397.85 <NA> and so we need a post conflict compact the
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 397.54 403.35 <NA> united nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts it 's called the peace building commission
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 405.02 408.27 <NA> <unk> be ideal to have a
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 407.9 418.77 <NA> standard set of norms where when we got to a post conflict situation there was an expectation of these mutual commitments from the three parties <unk> 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 420.08 425.19 <NA> so that 's idea one recognize interdependence <unk> 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 425.48 429.97 <NA> and now let me turn to the second approach which is complimentary
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 430.1 437.11 <NA> <unk> and that is to focus on a few critical objectives 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 438.33 441.05 <NA> typical <unk> post conflict situation
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 441.05 449.92 <NA> is a zoo of different actors with different priorities <unk> and indeed unfortunately if you navigate by needs
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 450.15 454.94 <NA> you get a very unfocused agenda <unk> because in these situations needs are
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 455.04 464.72 <NA> everywhere <unk> but the capacity to implement change is very limited <unk> so we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical and
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 464.56 470.72 <NA> i want to suggest that in the typical post conflict situation three things are critical 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 470.32 477.95 <NA> one is jobs <unk> one is improvements in basic services especially health which is a disaster
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 477.46 479.94 <NA> during conflict so jobs
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 480.01 483.24 <NA> health <unk> and clean government 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 483.5 491.82 <NA> those are the three critical priorities so i 'm going to talk a little about each of them jobs 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 492.38 499.83 <NA> what is a distinctive approach to generating jobs in post conflict situations <unk> and why are jobs so important 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 499.37 503.77 <NA> jobs for whom especially jobs for young men
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 505.35 510.67 <NA> <unk> in post conflict situations <unk> the reason that they so often revert to conflict 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 510.6 516.58 <NA> is not because elderly women get upset <unk> it 's because young men get upset
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 516.27 520.72 <NA> <unk> and why are they upset <unk> because they have nothing to do <unk> 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 521.22 522.86 <NA> and so
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 522.62 525.08 <NA> we need a process of generating
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 534.13 541.37 <NA> <unk> often respond by puffing up the civil service that is not a good idea <unk> it 's not sustainable
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 541.09 544.74 <NA> <unk> in fact you 're building a long term liability
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 544.56 550.2 <NA> by inflating civil service but getting the private sector to expand
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 550.16 553.93 <NA> <unk> is also difficult because any activity which is
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 553.75 562.01 <NA> open to international trade is basically going to be uncompetitive in a post conflict situation these are not environments where you can
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 562.02 566.62 <NA> build export manufacturing there 's one sector
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 566.4 567.42 <NA> which
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 566.96 576.55 <NA> isn 't exposed to international trade <unk> and which can generate a lot of jobs <unk> and which is in any case a sensible sector to expand
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 580.62 582.89 <NA> the construction sector
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 582.68 587.2 <NA> has a vital role obviously in reconstruction 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 586.8 597.89 <NA> but typically that sector has withered away during conflict during conflict people are doing destruction there isn 't any construction going on <unk> and so the sector shrivels away <unk> 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 597.89 602.08 <NA> and then when you try and expand it because it 's shriveled away <unk> 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 601.86 604.49 <NA> you encounter a lot of bottlenecks
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 604.78 607.13 <NA> <unk> basically prices soar
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 606.9 618.95 <NA> and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector <unk> but it doesn 't generate any jobs and so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks in expanding the construction sector <unk> 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 619.24 624.9 <NA> what might the bottlenecks be just think what you have to do successfully to build a
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 625.46 627.06 <NA> <unk> using a lot of labor
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 626.63 633.1 <NA> <unk> first you need access to land often the legal system is broken down so you can 't even get access to land <unk> 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 633.1 638.28 <NA> secondly you need skills <unk> the mundane skills of the construction sector 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 638.48 647.43 <NA> in post conflict situations we don 't just need doctors without borders <unk> we need bricklayers without borders to rebuild the skill set 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 648.05 654.97 <NA> we need firms <unk> the firms have gone away so we need to encourage the growth of local firms <unk> if we do that
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 654.78 662.08 <NA> <unk> that we not only get the jobs <unk> we get the improvements in public infrastructure the restoration of public infrastructure 
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 662.7 665.11 <NA> let me turn from jobs

PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 700.75 704.97 <NA> in their hearts donors know that 's not a realistic agenda <unk> and so
PaulCollier_2009S 1 PaulCollier_2009S 704.78 709.92 <NA> <unk> so what they also do is the total bypass just fund ngos <unk>
