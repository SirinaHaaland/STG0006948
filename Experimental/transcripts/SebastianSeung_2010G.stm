SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 287.04 292.73 <NA> except you still may not really recognize them and that 's because we have to work in three dimensions <unk> 
SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 292.73 299.42 <NA> if we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up we get a three dimensional image <unk> 
SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 299.19 303.77 <NA> and still you may not see the branches so we start at the top <unk> and we color in the
SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 304.99 308.79 <NA> <unk> one branch in red <unk> and we do that for the next slice

SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 324.85 329.97 <NA> and you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations and these are what are called

SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 358.89 363.73 <NA> so you see how to find a synapse <unk> how can we find an entire connectome well
SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 363.93 367.76 <NA> we take this three dimensional stack of images

SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 771.1 774.96 <NA> neural activity is constantly changing it 's like the water of

SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 789.92 793.44 <NA> but the metaphor is richer than that because
SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 792.98 800.2 <NA> it 's true that the stream bed guides the flow of the water <unk> but over long timescales
SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 800.52 808.42 <NA> <unk> the water also reshapes the bed of the stream and as i told you just now neural activity can change the connectome <unk> 
SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 809.55 817.51 <NA> and if you 'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights i will remind you that neural activity
SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 817.2 826.66 <NA> is the physical basis or so neuroscientists think of thoughts feelings and perceptions <unk> and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness 
SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 826.83 829.01 <NA> neural activity is its water

SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 837.61 845.93 <NA> suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work how will we go about testing the hypothesis i am my connectome

SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 871.4 879.97 <NA> because if the first neurons in the chain are activated through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons which are activated <unk> and so on down the line
SebastianSeung_2010G 1 SebastianSeung_2010G 880.1 888.85 <NA> like a chain of falling dominoes <unk> and this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements <unk>
