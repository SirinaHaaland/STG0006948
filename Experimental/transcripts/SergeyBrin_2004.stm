SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 13.03 20.02 <NA> <unk> i want to discuss a question i know that 's been pressing on many of your minds <unk> we spoke to you last several years ago <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 20.02 24.05 <NA> and before i get started today <unk> since many of you
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 23.71 25.11 <NA> are wondering
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 50.21 54.94 <NA> <unk> i didn 't really realize what it was when i first saw it but this is what helped me see it
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 55.1 59.65 <NA> <unk> this is what we run at the office that actually runs real time here it 's
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 59.16 67.09 <NA> slightly logged but here you can see around the world how people are using google and every one of those rising dots
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 66.75 69.29 <NA> represents probably about
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 69.05 72.92 <NA> twenty thirty searches or something like that <unk> and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 72.92 79.73 <NA> they 're labeled by color right now by language so you can see here we are in the u s and they 're all coming up red
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 80.02 85.55 <NA> <unk> there we are in monterey hopefully i can get it right <unk> you can see that japan is busy at night 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 85.84 94.52 <NA> right there we have tokyo coming in in japanese there 's a lot of activity in china there 's a lot of activity in india 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 94.69 102.29 <NA> there 's some in the middle east the little pockets <unk> and europe which is right now in the middle of the day 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 102.28 104.76 <NA> is going really strong with a whole wide
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 105.05 106.53 <NA> <unk> of languages
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 112.97 116.04 <NA> now you can also see if i
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 116.21 118.17 <NA> turn this around here
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 120.86 123.54 <NA> hopefully i won 't shake the world too much
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 123.47 129.52 <NA> <unk> but you can also see there are places where there 's not so much australia because there just aren 't very many people there
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 130.14 131.47 <NA> <unk> and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 131.82 135.1 <NA> this is something that we should really work on which is africa <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 135.1 144.13 <NA> which is just a few trickles basically in south africa and a few other urban cities <unk> but basically what we 've noticed is these queries <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 143.73 146.3 <NA> which come in at thousands per second 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 146.3 154.94 <NA> are available everywhere there is power <unk> and pretty much everywhere there is power there is the internet and even in antarctica
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 155.53 164.25 <NA> least this time of year we from time to time will see a query rising up <unk> and if we had it plotted correctly i think the international space station would have
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 180.5 184.05 <NA> <unk> is you can see that it 's actually kind of hard to get the
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 188.63 190.23 <NA> there we go 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 190.28 195.96 <NA> this is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions you can see that
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 195.59 199.72 <NA> there 's a lot of data running around it has to go all over the world through
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 200.55 204.22 <NA> <unk> through satellites through all kinds of connections <unk> and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 203.82 207.25 <NA> it 's pretty tricky for us to maintain
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 206.85 211.27 <NA> the latencies as low as we try to hopefully your experience is good 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 211.5 219.34 <NA> but you can see also once again so some places are much more wired than others and you can see all the bandwidth across the u s going up
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 219.09 228.28 <NA> over to asia europe in the other direction and so forth now what i would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 228.22 229.22 <NA> would look like
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 230.2 233.81 <NA> <unk> and if we can switch to slides
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 236.17 241.55 <NA> all right here we go <unk> so this is slowed down <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 243.94 246.65 <NA> this is what one second looks like
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 246.4 252.96 <NA> and this is what we spend a lot of our time doing is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 256.67 258.27 <NA> now 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 257.78 266.22 <NA> each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own i mean it could be somebody 's health it could be somebody 's career something important to them
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 265.97 267.4 <NA> <unk> and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 267.21 269.29 <NA> it could potentially be
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 269.05 274.81 <NA> something as important as tomato sauce <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 277.8 286.5 <NA> <unk> so this is a query that we had i guess it 's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others <unk> you can see that it got started
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 286.34 293.74 <NA> right here in the u s and spain it was popular at the same time but it didn 't have quite the same pickup in the u s as it did in spain <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 293.74 298.66 <NA> and then from spain it went to italy <unk> and then germany got excited and maybe right now
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 298.29 300.05 <NA> the u k is enjoying it <unk> and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 313.96 319.52 <NA> <unk> you can all enjoy it for yourselves hopefully that search will work as a part of
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 319.99 325.05 <NA> you know part of what we want to do to to grow our company is to have
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 325.7 328.05 <NA> <unk> and what that means is we want to have
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 327.77 335.01 <NA> more people who are healthy and educated more animals if they start
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 334.58 338.49 <NA> doing searches as well <unk> but
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 338.45 346.74 <NA> partly we want to make the world a better place <unk> and so one thing that we 're embarking upon is the google foundation 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 346.4 354.79 <NA> and we 're in the process of setting that up <unk> we also have a program already called google grants that now serves over one hundred and fifty different charities around the world
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 354.98 358.75 <NA> and these are some of the charities that are on there <unk> and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 358.29 362.23 <NA> it 's something i 'm very excited to be a part of 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 362.04 369.61 <NA> in fact many of the organizations that are here the acumen fund i think approtec we have running i 'm not sure if that one 's up yet
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 369.33 378.86 <NA> and many of the people who have presented here are running through google grants they run google ads <unk> and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 379.99 381.92 <NA> <unk> earlier results that we got
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 381.7 388.61 <NA> we have a singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of twenty five vietnamese girls for their education and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 388.39 393.89 <NA> that was one of the earliest results <unk> and as i said now there have been many many stories that have come in 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 393.49 399.33 <NA> because we do have hundreds of charities in there and the google foundation will be an even broader endeavor <unk>
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 416.3 424.59 <NA> <unk> not very many people know about it i 'll explain it in a second this is one of our engineers <unk> we find that they work better when they 're submerged and covered with leaves that
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 426.2 429.01 <NA> 's how we churn those products out
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 430.53 436.77 <NA> <unk> orkut had a vision to create a social network i know all of you are thinking yet another social network but
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 436.61 444.4 <NA> it was a dream of his and we basically when people really want to do something well we generally let them <unk> so this is what he built 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 444.48 450.02 <NA> we just released it in a test phase last month <unk> and it
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 450 458.39 <NA> 's been taking off this is our vp of engineering you can see the red hair and i don 't know if you can see the nose ring there
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 458.02 462.23 <NA> and these are all of his friends <unk> so
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 463.42 464.96 <NA> this is
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 465.28 475.47 <NA> this is how we we just deployed it we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service <unk> and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 475.47 478.95 <NA> and now we 've grown to over one hundred thousand members
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 480.11 489.48 <NA> <unk> they spread <unk> actually very quickly even outside the u s you can see <unk> even though the u s is still the majority here though by the way search wise it 's only about thirty percent of our traffic
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 489.77 496.77 <NA> but it 's already going to japan and the u k and europe and all the rest of the countries so it 's a fun little project 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 496.64 504.04 <NA> there are a variety of demographics i won 't bore you with these but it 's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 508.08 515.41 <NA> <unk> in suspense larry you can explain this one larry page thank you sergey so one of the things
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 515.24 521.59 <NA> both sergey and i went to a montessori school <unk> and i think for some reason 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 521.28 528.64 <NA> this has been incorporated in google and sergey mentioned orkut <unk> which is something that you know orkut wanted to do
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 528.21 529.28 <NA> in his
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 530.04 531.41 <NA> <unk> and we call this at google we 've
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 531.41 541.13 <NA> embodied this as the twenty percent time and the idea is for twenty percent of your time if you 're working at google you can do what you think is the best thing to do and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 540.88 544.74 <NA> many many things at google have come out of that such as orkut
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 544.74 552.63 <NA> and also google news <unk> and i think many other things in the world also have come out of this mendel who was supposed to be teaching
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 555.02 556.68 <NA> <unk> the laws of genetics
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 557.03 565.11 <NA> as a hobby basically so many many useful things come out of this <unk> and news which i just mentioned 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 565.67 566.92 <NA> was
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 566.71 574.86 <NA> started by a researcher <unk> and he just he after nine eleven he got really interested in the news and he said why don 't i
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 574.76 579.94 <NA> look at the news better and so he started clustering it by category
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 579.9 588.56 <NA> <unk> and then he started using it and then his friends started using it <unk> and then <unk> besides just looking cute on a baby 's bottom <unk> we
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 588.56 590.89 <NA> made it a googlette <unk> which
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 590.43 596.47 <NA> is basically a small project at google so it 'd be like three people or something like that <unk> and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 596.1 600.02 <NA> they would try to make a product <unk> and we wouldn 't really be sure if it 's going to work or
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 602.71 613.04 <NA> <unk> they had a couple of people working on it for a while and then more and more people started using it and then we put it out on the internet and more and more people started using it and now it 's a real full blown project with more people on it 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 612.64 614.04 <NA> and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 613.62 622.28 <NA> this is how we keep our innovation running i think usually as companies get bigger they find it really hard to have small innovative projects <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 622.28 625.05 <NA> and we had this problem too for a while and we said oh
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 626.9 627.96 <NA> <unk> the googlettes
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 627.79 634.38 <NA> that 's a small project that we 're not quite sure if it 's going to work or not <unk> but we hope it will and if we do enough of them 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 633.95 642.09 <NA> some of them will really work and turn out such as news <unk> but then we had a problem because then we had over one hundred projects 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 641.75 650.52 <NA> and i don 't know about all of you but i have trouble keeping one hundred things in my head at once <unk> and we found that if we just wrote all of them down
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 650.39 654.97 <NA> and ordered them and these are kind of made up don 't really pay attention to
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 654.93 661.33 <NA> <unk> them for example the buy iceland was from a media article we would never do such a crazy thing but in
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 663.57 668.81 <NA> any case <unk> we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them that
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 668.57 671.78 <NA> most people would actually agree what the ordering should be <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 671.78 679.91 <NA> and this was kind of a surprise to me but we found that as long as you keep the one hundred things in your head which you did by writing them down that you could do a pretty
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 679.87 685.85 <NA> <unk> good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources <unk> and so that 's basically what we 've done
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 685.45 692.75 <NA> since we instituted that a few years ago and i think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well organized 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 692.5 699.9 <NA> the other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important and so naturally people sort of migrate to the things that
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 699.69 701.6 <NA> that are high priorities 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 703.03 704.91 <NA> i just wanted to highlight a couple of
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 704.84 706.38 <NA> <unk> things that that are
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 706.18 711.52 <NA> new or you might not know about <unk> and the top thing actually is the deskbar <unk>
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 711.52 716.85 <NA> so this is a new how many of you use the google toolbar <unk> raise your hands 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 716.39 718.71 <NA> how many of you use the deskbar <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 719.09 721.86 <NA> all right see you guys should try it out
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 721.52 729.79 <NA> but if you go to our site and search for deskbar you 'll get this <unk> and the idea is instead of a toolbar it 's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 729.83 736.3 <NA> and you can do searches really easily <unk> and it 's sort of like a better version of the toolbar <unk> thank you sergey 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 740.52 749.2 <NA> this is another example of a project that somebody at google was really passionate about and they just they got going and it 's really really a great product and really taking off 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 748.74 751.18 <NA> google answers is something
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 750.9 754.91 <NA> we started which is really cool which lets you for five to
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 754.96 756.35 <NA> <unk> hundred dollars you can
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 756.12 766.28 <NA> type a question in and then there 's a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you and it 's guaranteed and all that and you can get actually very good answers to things without <unk>
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 766.18 772.89 <NA> <unk> spending all that time yourself froogle lets you search shopping information <unk> and blogger lets you publish things but
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 780.1 783.72 <NA> <unk> we also like to innovate in our physical space and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 783.23 791 <NA> we we noticed in meetings you know you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off and they 're noisy so people shut them off <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 791 794.14 <NA> and we didn 't like that so we actually
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 793.9 797.58 <NA> in maybe a couple of weeks we built these little enclosures
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 797.12 804.91 <NA> that enclosed the projectors and so we can leave them on all the time and they 're completely silent <unk> and as a result <unk> we were able to build some software
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 804.99 807.68 <NA> <unk> also lets us manage a meeting so when you walk into a
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 807.68 816.29 <NA> meeting room now it lists all the meetings that are happening you can very easily take notes and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 815.9 823.36 <NA> and as we become more of a global company <unk> we find these things really affect us you know can we work effectively with people who aren 't in the room and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 823.35 827.08 <NA> things like that and simple things like this can really make a big difference
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 826.95 829.73 <NA> <unk> we also have a lot of engineers
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 831.7 836.87 <NA> in those meetings and they don 't always do their laundry as much as they should <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 839.56 845.96 <NA> and so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines for our younger employees especially 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 848.59 850.05 <NA> and we also allow
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 850 857.7 <NA> dogs and things like that <unk> and we 've had i think a really fun culture at our company which helps people work and enjoy what they 're doing 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 857.66 861.36 <NA> this is actually our cult picture i just wanted to show quickly 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 865.04 872.19 <NA> we had this on our website for a while but we found that after we put it on our website we didn 't get any job applications anymore <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 875.85 879.04 <NA> <unk> every year we 've taken the whole company on a ski trip a
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 878.7 888.76 <NA> lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other and informally <unk> and i think we 've done a good job encouraging that it makes it a really fun place to work
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 888.63 892.46 <NA> <unk> along with our logos too which i think really embody
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 892.24 899.26 <NA> our culture when we when we change things in the early days we were actually advised we should never change our logo because
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 898.78 899.78 <NA> we should
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 902.71 910.01 <NA> <unk> you 'd never want to change your logo you want it to be consistent and we said well that doesn 't sound so much fun why don 't we try changing it every day 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 912.22 918.47 <NA> one of the things that really excites me about what we 're doing now is we have this thing called adsense <unk> and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 918.07 920 <NA> this is a
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 919.66 924.93 <NA> little bit foreshadowing this is from before dean dropped out but the idea is
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 929.87 932.85 <NA> <unk> battle for new hampshire howard dean for president 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 932.39 940.92 <NA> articles on howard dean and these ads are generated automatically like in this case on the washington post from the content on the site 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 940.49 946.63 <NA> and so we use our over one hundred and fifty thousand advertisers and millions of advertisements so we pick the one
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 946.44 954.91 <NA> that 's most relevant to what you 're actually looking at much as we do on search so the idea is we can make advertising useful not just annoying
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 954.87 956.65 <NA> <unk> right <unk> and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 956.58 964.52 <NA> the nice thing about this we have a self serve program and many thousands of websites have signed up <unk> and this let 's them really make money and i you
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 964.52 967.88 <NA> know there 's a number of people i met i met this guy who runs a
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 967.64 975.14 <NA> conservation site at a party <unk> and he said you know i wasn 't making any money <unk> i just put this thing on my site and i 'm making ten thousand dollars a month
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 976.39 979.34 <NA> <unk> you know thank you i don 't have to do my other job now 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 978.91 989.9 <NA> and i think this is really important for us because it makes the internet work better it makes content get better it makes searching work better when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 992.41 1000.02 <NA> so this session is supposed to be about the future so i 'd thought i 'd talk at least briefly about it <unk> and the idea
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1000 1006.68 <NA> behind this is to do the perfect job doing search you really have to be smart <unk> because you can type you know any kind of thing into google 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1006.68 1013.65 <NA> and you expect an answer back right <unk> but finding things is tricky and so you really want intelligence <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1013.44 1014.67 <NA> and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1014.19 1020.47 <NA> in fact the ultimate search engine would be smart it would be artificial intelligence and so that 's something we work on 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1020.47 1024.99 <NA> and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1026.33 1032.16 <NA> <unk> so we always hope that google will be smart but we 're always surprised when other people think that it is and so i
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1031.73 1040.84 <NA> just wanted to give a funny example of this this is a blog from iraq and it 's not really what i 'm going to talk about but i just wanted to show you an example
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1057.12 1065.92 <NA> <unk> you can 't see it that well but we decided we should put in this feature into our adsense ads <unk> called related searches and so we 'd say you know did you mean ' search for ' what
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1066.06 1070.37 <NA> is this in this case saddam hussein because this blog is about iraq
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1070.2 1071.29 <NA> and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1070.86 1075.52 <NA> you know in addition to the ads and we thought this would be a great idea <unk> and so
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1075.36 1078.47 <NA> there is this blog of a young
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1080.08 1086.18 <NA> <unk> who was kind of depressed and he said you know i 'm sleeping a lot he was just kind of writing about his life and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1086.29 1090.74 <NA> our algorithms not a person of course but our algorithms our computers
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1090.57 1099.95 <NA> read his blog and decided that the related search was i am bored and he read this and he thought a person had decided that he was boring <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1100.09 1101.6 <NA> and
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1101.14 1104.85 <NA> it was very unfortunate and he said you know what are these you know bastards at
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1104.81 1107.91 <NA> <unk> google doing <unk> why don 't they like my blog 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1107.51 1117.24 <NA> and so then we read his blog which was getting you know <unk> sort of going from from bad to worse <unk> and we said the related search was retards 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1118.97 1124.9 <NA> and then you know he got even more mad and he wrote like started swearing and so on and then we
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1127.71 1129.64 <NA> <unk> it ended with kiss my ass 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1130.95 1137.14 <NA> and so basically he thought he was dealing with something smart and of course you know we just sort of wrote this program
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1137.14 1139.57 <NA> and we tried it out <unk> and it
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1139.11 1142.24 <NA> didn 't quite work and we don 't have this feature anymore 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1144.78 1147.76 <NA> so with that maybe i can switch back to the world <unk> 
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1147.36 1154.94 <NA> i wanted to end just by saying that there 's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with google and one of
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1154.9 1158.64 <NA> <unk> those is that we 're able to make money
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1158.64 1165.41 <NA> largely through advertising and one of the benefits that i didn 't expect from that was that we 're able to serve everyone in the world
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1165.01 1172.2 <NA> without worrying about you know places that don 't have as much money <unk> so we don 't have to worry about our products
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1172.2 1175.94 <NA> being sold for example for less money in places that are poor and then they get <unk>
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1177.12 1179.94 <NA> for example with the drug industry and i think
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1179.87 1182.44 <NA> <unk> really lucky to have that kind of business model
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1182.23 1191.34 <NA> because everyone in the world has access to our search and i think that 's a tremendous tremendous benefit the other thing i wanted to mention just briefly
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1191.34 1192.61 <NA> is that
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1192.38 1194.94 <NA> we have a tremendous
SergeyBrin_2004 1 SergeyBrin_2004 1194.57 1204.7 <NA> ability and and responsibility to provide people the right information <unk> and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine that we should provide very objective
