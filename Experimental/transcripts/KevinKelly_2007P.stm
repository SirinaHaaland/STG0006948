KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 13.78 17.03 <NA> <unk> we know it the kind of web the things we 're all talking about
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 16.87 24.99 <NA> is already less than five thousand days old <unk> so all of the things that we 've seen come about
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 26.42 28.71 <NA> <unk> satellite images of the whole earth which
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 28.4 37.83 <NA> we couldn 't even imagine happening before all these things rolling into our lives just this abundance of things
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 37.83 45.9 <NA> that are right before us <unk> sitting in front of our laptop or our desktop this kind of cornucopia of stuff just coming and
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 45.65 52.69 <NA> never ending is amazing <unk> and we 're not amazed <unk> it 's really amazing that all this stuff is here
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 55.11 64.99 <NA> <unk> it 's in five thousand days <unk> all this stuff has come <unk> and i know that ten years ago <unk> if i had told you that this was all coming <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 65.13 68.62 <NA> you would have said that that 's impossible <unk> there 's simply
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 68.28 74.81 <NA> no economic model that that would be possible <unk> and if i told you it was all coming for free you would say this is
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 80.14 81.83 <NA> <unk> and yet it 's here 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 81.91 88.94 <NA> the other thing that we know about it was that ten years ago as i looked at what even wired was talking about 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 88.51 91.73 <NA> we thought it was going to be tv but better <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 91.39 95.87 <NA> that was the model that was what everybody was suggesting
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 95.53 100.02 <NA> was going to be coming and it turns out that that 's not what it
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 101.33 103.98 <NA> <unk> it was impossible and it 's not what it was <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 103.52 109.44 <NA> and so one of the things that i think we 're learning if you think about like wikipedia <unk> it 's something that was simply impossible <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 108.95 112.93 <NA> it 's impossible in theory but possible in practice <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 112.93 122.16 <NA> and if you take all these things that are impossible i think one of the things that we 're learning from this era from this last decade is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 121.67 124.83 <NA> because we 're unprepared for it 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 125.67 132.55 <NA> <unk> i 'm curious about what 's going to happen in the next five thousand days but if that 's happened in the last five thousand days what 's going to happen in the next five thousand days <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 132.21 142.72 <NA> so i have a kind of a simple story <unk> and it suggests that that what we want to think about is this thing that we 're making this thing that has happened in five thousand days that 's all these computers <unk>
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 142.67 148.88 <NA> all these handhelds all these cell phones <unk> all these laptops all these servers basically
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 155.02 161.48 <NA> <unk> one machine <unk> and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines but that
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 161.29 165.95 <NA> we 're basically constructing a single global machine <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 165.67 171.39 <NA> and so i began to think about that and it turned out that this machine happens to be
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 171.22 175.05 <NA> the most reliable machine that we 've ever made it has not crashed 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 176.57 179.02 <NA> <unk> and there 's almost no other machine that we 've ever made
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 178.84 186.43 <NA> that runs the number the number of hours the number of days <unk> five thousand days without interruption that 's just unbelievable and of course 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 186.43 192.45 <NA> the internet is longer than just five thousand days <unk> the web is only five thousand days so i was trying to
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 192.05 194.19 <NA> basically make
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 194.69 199.48 <NA> measurements what are the dimensions of this machine <unk> and
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 199.48 204.85 <NA> i started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are all around the globe
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 204.87 211.54 <NA> <unk> on all the computers <unk> and there is a one hundred billion clicks per day <unk> and there 's fifty five trillion links
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 211.54 220.06 <NA> between all the web pages of the world <unk> and so i began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions and i made a quick list was it
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 220.38 224.9 <NA> chris jordan the photographer talking about numbers being so large that they 're
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 227.95 231.23 <NA> <unk> hard to tell but there 's one billion pc chips
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 230.83 240.34 <NA> on the internet if you count all the chips in all the computers on the internet there 's two million emails per second so it 's a very big number it 's just a huge machine and
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 240.34 244.23 <NA> it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 243.75 247.79 <NA> so here 's the specifications just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 247.79 254.13 <NA> one hundred and seventy quadrillion transistors fifty five trillion links emails running at two megahertz itself
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 255.16 264.54 <NA> text messaging two hundred and forty six exabyte storage that 's a big disk that 's a lot of storage <unk> memory nine exabyte ram and
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 264.2 278.55 <NA> the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second brewster was saying the library of congress is about twenty terabytes so every second half of the library of congress is swooshing around in this machine <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 278.3 279.76 <NA> it 's a big machine
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 279.93 282.22 <NA> <unk> so i did something else <unk> i figured out
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 282.05 289 <NA> one hundred billion clicks per day fifty five trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 288.8 298.37 <NA> a quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain so to a first approximation we have these things twenty petahertz synapse firings of
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 298.37 299.93 <NA> course the memory is is really
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 300.61 306.56 <NA> <unk> but to a first approximation <unk> the size of this machine is the size
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 306.37 310.5 <NA> and its complexity kind of to your brain <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 310.5 318.65 <NA> because in fact that 's how your brain works in kind of the same way that the web works however your brain isn 't doubling every two years <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 319.15 320.84 <NA> so
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 321.67 325.2 <NA> if we say this machine right now that we 've made is about one hb
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 325.19 326.64 <NA> <unk> one human brain 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 326.99 334.65 <NA> if we look at the rate that this is increasing thirty years from now there 'll be six billion hbs 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 334.7 341.56 <NA> so by the year two thousand and forty the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 341.4 349.59 <NA> of humanity in raw bits and stuff and this is i think where ray kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we 're going to cross 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 357.36 361.1 <NA> <unk> i have three kind of general things i would like to say <unk> three
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 360.92 367.54 <NA> consequences of this first that basically what this machine is doing is embodying we
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 368.04 375.08 <NA> 're giving it a body and that 's what we 're going to do in the next five thousand days we 're going to give this machine a body <unk> and the second thing is we 're going to restructure its
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 377.53 380.06 <NA> <unk> we 're going to become completely codependent upon it 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 379.69 384.98 <NA> so let me go through those three things first of all we have all these things in our hands 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 384.98 393.09 <NA> we think they 're all separate devices <unk> but in fact every screen in the world is looking into the one machine
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 392.88 399.95 <NA> <unk> these are all basically portals into that one machine the second thing is that that some people call this the cloud 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 400 405.96 <NA> <unk> and you 're kind of touching the cloud with this <unk> and so in some ways all you really need is a cloudbook <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 405.77 418.48 <NA> and the cloudbook doesn 't have any storage <unk> it 's wireless it 's always connected there 's many things about it it becomes very simple and basically what you 're doing is you 're just touching the machine <unk> you 're touching the cloud and you 're
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 418.31 425.02 <NA> going to compute that way so the machine is computing and in some ways it 's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 425.64 431.19 <NA> <unk> but everything all the cameras <unk> and the microphones and the
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 430.97 439.93 <NA> sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine <unk> and everything will go through the web and we 're seeing that already with say phones 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 439.56 443.89 <NA> right now phones don 't go through the web but they are beginning to and they will 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 443.85 449.81 <NA> and if you imagine what say just as an example what google labs has in terms of
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 452.53 453.87 <NA> <unk> all these things
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 453.66 457.61 <NA> are going to become web based they 're going through the machine <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 457.12 465.71 <NA> and i am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the web <unk> right now it 's not if you do spreadsheets and things at work a
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 465.25 471.12 <NA> word document they aren 't on the web but they are going to be they 're going to be part of this machine they 're going to speak
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 471.12 478.59 <NA> the web language they 're going to talk to the machine the web in some sense is kind of like a black hole that 's sucking up
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 478.37 479.73 <NA> everything into it
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 480.05 492.54 <NA> and so every thing will be part of the web so every item every artifact that we make will have embedded in it some little sliver of web ness and connection <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 492.2 499.09 <NA> and it will be part of this machine so that our environment kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense our environment becomes the
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 505.22 514.09 <NA> it is it doesn 't really matter the point is is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine <unk> and so we have basically an internet of things <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 513.75 518.78 <NA> so you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels and a
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 518.78 527.39 <NA> car as a chip with wheels <unk> because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars is the embedded intelligence
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 527.21 529.94 <NA> and electronics in it and not the materials
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 529.95 534.62 <NA> a lot of people think about the new economy as something that was going to be a disembodied <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 534.61 537.69 <NA> alternative virtual existence <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 537.45 541.44 <NA> and that we would have the old economy of atoms <unk> but in fact 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 541.44 551.1 <NA> what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two where we embed the information <unk> and the digital nature of things into the material world that 's what
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 550.91 553.67 <NA> we 're looking forward to that is where we 're going
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 555.02 557.28 <NA> <unk> convergence of
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 557.15 566.55 <NA> the atomic and the digital <unk> and so one of the consequences of that i believe is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 566.24 574.96 <NA> tv film video that basically becomes one media platform and while there 's many differences in some senses they will share more and more in common with each other so that the
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 575 584.5 <NA> <unk> the laws of media such as the fact that copies have no value the value 's in the uncopiable things the immediacy the authentication
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 584.07 586.42 <NA> <unk> the personalization 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 586.26 588.16 <NA> the media wants to be liquid <unk>
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 589.31 595.51 <NA> the reason why things are free is <unk> so that you can manipulate them not so that they are free as in beer but free as in freedom 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 595.38 604.4 <NA> and the network effects rule meaning that the more you have the more you get the first fax machine the person who bought the first fax machine was an idiot
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 605.08 606.92 <NA> <unk> there was nobody to fax to 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 607.72 611.21 <NA> but here she became an evangelist <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 611.01 619.2 <NA> recruiting others to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable those are the effects that we 're going to see attention is the currency <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 619.2 624 <NA> so those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 623.78 629.76 <NA> and the other thing about about this embodiment is that there 's kind of what i call the mcluhan reversal mcluhan was saying
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 629.87 633.97 <NA> <unk> machines are the extensions of the human senses and i 'm saying humans are now going to be the extended
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 633.79 646.17 <NA> senses of the machine in a certain sense <unk> so we have a trillion eyes and ears and touches through all our digital photographs and cameras and we see <unk> that in things like flickr
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 647.84 649.75 <NA> or photosynth 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 650.7 661.69 <NA> <unk> program from microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it in a certain sense the machine is seeing
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 661.49 669.28 <NA> through the pixels of individual cameras <unk> now the second thing that i want to talk about was this idea of restructuring 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 668.85 677.33 <NA> that what the web is doing is restructuring <unk> and i have to warn you that what we 'll talk about is i 'm going to give my explanation of a term you 're hearing which is a semantic web 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 677.33 679.94 <NA> so first of all the first stage that we 've seen
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 679.95 689.64 <NA> of the internet was that it was going to link computers <unk> and that 's what we called the net that was the internet of nets <unk> and we saw that where you have all the computers of the world and
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 689.4 697.92 <NA> if you remember it was a kind of green screen with cursors and there was really not much to do and if you wanted to connect it you connected it from one computer to another computer <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 697.92 703.82 <NA> and what you had to do was if you wanted to participate in this you had to share packets of of information <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 703.33 704.97 <NA> so you were forwarding
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 704.93 711.7 <NA> <unk> on you didn 't have control it wasn 't like a telephone system where you had control of a line you had to share packets the second stage
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 711.46 714.88 <NA> that we 're in now is the idea of linking pages 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 714.88 722.11 <NA> so in the old one if i wanted to go on to an airline web page i went from my computer to an ftp site to another
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 721.9 729.58 <NA> airline computer now we have pages the unit has been resolved into pages so one page links to another page and
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 729.9 738.58 <NA> <unk> if i want to go in to book a flight i go into the airline 's flight page <unk> the website of the airline <unk> and i 'm linking to that page <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 738.99 752.35 <NA> and what we 're sharing were links <unk> so you had to be kind of open with links <unk> you couldn 't deny if someone wanted to link to you you couldn 't stop them <unk> you had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 751.89 753.44 <NA> so that 's what we were doing
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 754.87 765.12 <NA> <unk> entering to the third stage which is what i 'm talking about and that is where we link the data <unk> so i don 't know what the name of this thing is i 'm calling it the one machine <unk> but we 're linking data so we 're going from
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 765.07 770.73 <NA> <unk> machine to machine from page to page and now data to data <unk> so the difference is is that
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 775.46 786.03 <NA> <unk> on a page to another idea rather than to the other page <unk> so every idea is basically being supported or every item <unk> or every noun is being supported by the entire web it 's being resolved
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 785.72 795.22 <NA> at the level of items or ideas <unk> or words if you want so besides physically coming out again into this idea that it 's not just
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 795.22 798.69 <NA> virtual it 's actually going out to things so
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 798.38 800.14 <NA> something will will resolve
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 800 812.77 <NA> down to the information about a particular person so every person will have a unique id every person every item will have a something that will be very specific and will link to a specific representation of that idea or item <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 812.77 815.8 <NA> so now in this new one when i
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 815.52 822.25 <NA> link to it i would link to my particular flight my particular seat <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 822.12 824.96 <NA> and so giving an example of this
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 825.31 834.53 <NA> <unk> i live in pacifica <unk> rather than right now pacifica is just sort of a name on the web somewhere the web doesn 't know that that is actually a town and that it 's a specific town that i live in 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 834.3 844.58 <NA> but that 's what we 're going to be talking about it 's going to link directly to it will know the web will be able to read itself and know that that actually is a place <unk>
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 844.53 850.26 <NA> <unk> and that whenever it sees that word pacifica it knows that it actually has a place latitude longitude a certain population
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 850.91 860.22 <NA> <unk> here are some of the technical terms all three letter things that you 'll see a lot more of all these things are about enabling this this idea of linking to the data
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 859.97 867.6 <NA> <unk> so i 'll give you one kind of an example there 's like a billion social sites on the web <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 867.47 874.14 <NA> each time you go into there you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are why should you be doing that you should just do that once 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 873.65 879.22 <NA> and it should know who all your friends are so that 's what you want is all your friends are identified and you should just carry
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 879.69 888.07 <NA> <unk> relationships around all this data about you should just be conveyed and you should do it once and that 's all that should happen and you should have all the networks
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 887.9 896.9 <NA> of all the relationships between those pieces of data that 's what we 're moving into where it sort of knows these things down to that level a semantic web web three point zero 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 896.9 899.99 <NA> giant global graph we 're kind of trying out what we want to
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 901.69 910.55 <NA> <unk> 's doing is sharing data so you have to be open to having your data shared <unk> which is a much bigger step than just sharing your web page or your computer <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 910.6 915.59 <NA> and all these things that are going to be on this are not just
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 915.82 924.81 <NA> pages <unk> they are things everything we 've described every artifact or place will be a specific representation will have a
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 926.09 930.9 <NA> <unk> character that can be linked to directly so we have this database of things <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 930.59 940.96 <NA> and so there 's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to that we won 't see in the next ten years or five thousand days <unk> but i think that 's where we 're going to <unk> and as the internet of things
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 940.91 954.97 <NA> <unk> where i 'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane that that physical thing becomes part of the web <unk> and so we are in the middle of this thing that 's completely linked down to every object in the little sliver of a connection that it has
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 955.19 959.23 <NA> so the last thing i want to talk about is this idea that we 're going to be codependent 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 960.39 962.59 <NA> it 's always going to be there <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 962.59 969.43 <NA> and the closer it is the better if you allow google to it will tell you your search history and i found out by looking at it
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 969.12 972.64 <NA> that i search most at eleven o 'clock in the morning <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 972.36 979.64 <NA> so i am open and being transparent to that and i think total personalization in this new world will require total
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 979.57 980.99 <NA> <unk> transparency <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 980.95 985.94 <NA> that is going to be the price if you want to have total personalization you have to be totally transparent 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 985.45 988.75 <NA> google i can 't remember my phone number i 'll just ask google 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 988.76 997.55 <NA> we 're so dependent on this that i have now gotten to the point where i don 't even try to remember things i 'll just google it it 's easier to do that and we kind of object at first saying oh 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 997.15 1003.7 <NA> that 's awful but if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology called the alphabet and writing <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1003.42 1004.73 <NA> we 're totally dependent
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1004.81 1010.16 <NA> <unk> transformed culture we cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1010.09 1014.86 <NA> and so in the same way we 're going to not imagine ourselves without this other machine being there <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1014.87 1026.21 <NA> and what is happening with this is some kind of ai but it 's not the ai in conscious ai as being an expert larry page told me that that 's what they 're trying to do and that 's what they 're trying to do 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1026.02 1029.85 <NA> but when six billion humans are googling who 's searching who
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1029.86 1039.3 <NA> goes both ways <unk> so we are the web <unk> that 's what this thing is we are going to be the machine <unk> so the next five thousand days 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1038.9 1041.91 <NA> it 's not going to be the web and only better
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1041.99 1045.67 <NA> <unk> just like it wasn 't tv and only better the next
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1045.51 1050.05 <NA> five thousand days it 's not just going to be the web but only better it 's going to be something different and i think
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1051.84 1055.69 <NA> <unk> 's going to be smarter it 'll have an intelligence in there that 's
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1055.46 1059.62 <NA> not again conscious but it 'll anticipate what we 're doing 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1059.67 1061.66 <NA> in a good sense <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1061.41 1069.7 <NA> secondly it 's become much more personalized it will know us <unk> and that 's good and again the price of that will be transparency <unk> 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1069.48 1076.96 <NA> and thirdly <unk> it 's going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment and we will be in the middle of it 
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1076.83 1079.73 <NA> and all these devices will be portals into that
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1080.11 1084.68 <NA> so the single idea that i wanted to leave with you is that
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1084.94 1095.15 <NA> we have to begin to think about this as not just the web only better but a new kind of stage in this development it looks more global if you take this whole thing <unk>
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1095.1 1100.23 <NA> it is a very big machine <unk> very reliable machine <unk> more reliable than its parts
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1100.43 1102.07 <NA> <unk> we can also think about it
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1101.83 1104.71 <NA> as kind of a large organism <unk> so we might
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1104.5 1113.22 <NA> respond to it more as if this was a whole system more as if this wasn 't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1112.85 1119.27 <NA> <unk> it 's a one and i don 't know what else to call it <unk> than the one we 'll have a better word for it but
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1119.27 1124.99 <NA> there 's a unity of some sort that 's starting to emerge <unk> and again i don 't want to talk about consciousness i want to talk about it just as if it
KevinKelly_2007P 1 KevinKelly_2007P 1126.42 1128.87 <NA> <unk> or a volvox which is what that organism is
