CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1026.96 1037.08 <NA> bc edl is this immense technically challenging problem it 's about getting a spacecraft that 's hurtling through deep space and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out how to get it down to the surface of mars at zero miles an hour
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1036.77 1040.77 <NA> it 's this immensely exciting and challenging problem 
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1048.95 1049.96 <NA> hopefully it
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1052.41 1058.36 <NA> <unk> in here so it will be a very a very tense moment you know as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet <unk> 
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1058.17 1069.32 <NA> so now let me talk about the next things that we are doing <unk> so we are in the process as we speak of actually designing the next rover that we are going to be sending to mars so i thought i would go a little bit and tell you kind of the steps
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1069.09 1079.97 <NA> we go through it 's very similar to what you do when you design your product <unk> as you saw a little bit earlier <unk> when we were doing the phoenix one we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing <unk> so we have to study all
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1079.96 1088.83 <NA> <unk> kinds of different materials the shape that we want to do in general we don 't try to please the customer here what we want to do is to make to make sure we have an effective <unk> you know an efficient
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1088.62 1094.16 <NA> kind of machine first we start by we want to have our employees to be as imaginative as they can <unk> 
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1094.16 1100.98 <NA> and we really love being close to the art center because we have as a matter of fact one of the alumni from the art center eric nyquist
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1104.87 1108.59 <NA> <unk> design or spacecraft design room just to get people to think wildly
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1108.6 1117.21 <NA> about things we have a bunch of legos so as i said <unk> this is a playground for adults where they sit down and try to play with different shapes and different
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1117.5 1129.7 <NA> designs <unk> then we get a little bit more serious so we have what we call our cad cams and all the engineers who are involved or scientists who are involved who know about thermal properties know about design know about atmospheric
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1129.66 1139.85 <NA> <unk> interaction <unk> parachutes all of these things which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent so to see does that meet the requirement
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1139.67 1147.67 <NA> that we need on the right also we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going if you are going to jupiter you have a very high radiation you know 
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1147.33 1154.61 <NA> environment it 's about the same radiation environment close by jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor so just imagine you take your
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1154.99 1161.57 <NA> <unk> and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still has to work so these are kind of some of the little challenges you know 
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1161.11 1168.71 <NA> that we have to face if we are doing entry we have to do tests of parachutes <unk> you saw in the video a parachute breaking that would be a bad day you know if
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1168.31 1174.72 <NA> that happened so we have to test because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds we are coming at
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1175.22 1180.97 <NA> <unk> high speeds and we are deploying them to slow us down so we have to do all kinds of tests to give you an idea of the size you know 
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1180.97 1187.51 <NA> of that parachute relative to the people standing there next step we go and actually build some kind of test models
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1187.15 1188.86 <NA> and actually test them
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1189.61 1199.99 <NA> you know in the lab at jpl in what we call our mars yard we kick them we hit them we drop them <unk> just to make sure we understand how where would they break <unk> and then we back
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1202.35 1203.95 <NA> <unk> you know from that point
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1203.97 1212.47 <NA> and then we actually do the actual building and and the flight <unk> and this next rover that we 're flying is about the size of a car 
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1212.47 1224.78 <NA> that big shield that you see outside that 's a heat shield which is going to protect it <unk> and that will be basically built over the next year and it will be launched june a year from now now in that case because it was a very big
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1226.66 1235.92 <NA> <unk> we couldn 't use airbags and i know many of you kind of last time afterwards said well that was a cool cool thing to have those airbags unfortunately this rover is like ten times the size of the you know
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1235.92 1244.59 <NA> mass wise of the other rover or three times the mass so we can 't use airbags so we have to come up with another ingenious idea of how do we land it <unk> and we didn 't want to
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1244.38 1254.31 <NA> take it propulsively all the way to the surface because we didn 't want to contaminate the surface we wanted the rover to immediately land on its legs <unk> so we came up with this ingenious idea which
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1254.93 1261.42 <NA> <unk> is used here on earth for helicopters actually the lander will come down to about one hundred feet and hover
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1261.22 1270.11 <NA> above that surface for one hundred feet and then we have a sky crane which will take that rover and land it down on the surface <unk> hopefully it all will work <unk> you know it will work that way <unk> 
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1270.11 1279.73 <NA> and that rover will be more kind of like a chemist what we are going to be doing with that rover as it drives around it 's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks so it will have
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1279.84 1290.17 <NA> <unk> arm which will take samples put them in an oven crush and analyze them <unk> but also if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff we have a little laser system <unk>

CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1312.96 1321.45 <NA> you know fun things we are doing on mars i thought i 'd go to the lord of the rings now and show you some of the things we have there now the lord of the rings 
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1321.45 1324.69 <NA> has two things played through it <unk> one it 's a very attractive
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1325.88 1336.75 <NA> <unk> just has the beauty of the rings and so on but for scientists also the rings have a special meaning because we believe they represent on a small scale <unk> how the solar system actually formed
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1337.63 1344.66 <NA> some of the scientists believe that the way the solar system formed that the sun when it collapsed and actually created the sun

CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1353.73 1364.02 <NA> <unk> the idea is by watching saturn we 're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale so it 's like a test bed for it so let me show you a little bit on
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1364.03 1374.93 <NA> what that saturnian system looks like first i 'm going to fly you over the over the rings by the way all of this is real stuff <unk> this is not animation or anything like this this is actually taken

CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1378.4 1392.06 <NA> and you see the amount of detail that is in those rings which are the particles some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles so that 's why you have these gaps is because a small satellite you know is being formed in that location <unk> 
CharlesElachi_2008P 1 CharlesElachi_2008P 1392.06 1399.36 <NA> now you think that those rings are very large objects yes they are very large in one dimension in the other dimension they are paper thin
