JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 14.86 20.9 <NA> <unk> something that we often do is use immense resources to achieve certain capabilities or achieve certain goals <unk> 
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 20.9 25.23 <NA> and this is essential to the progress of science or exploration of what is possible
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 26.06 36.39 <NA> <unk> it creates this unfortunate situation where a tiny tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or can benefit from that technology something that motivates me and gets me really excited <unk>
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 36.29 45.16 <NA> <unk> about my research is when i see simple opportunities to drastically change that distribution and and make the technology accessible to a much wider percentage of the population <unk>
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 50.31 56.63 <NA> <unk> and they actually use the nintendo wii remote for those of you who aren 't familiar with this device it 's a $ forty
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 56.63 64.21 <NA> video game controller and it 's mostly advertised for its motion sensing capabilities so you can swing a tennis racket or hit a baseball bat <unk> 
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 63.81 72.37 <NA> but what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high performing infrared camera <unk> and
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 72.18 74.99 <NA> i 'm going to show you two demos of why this is
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 76.15 82.89 <NA> <unk> so here i have my computer set up with the projector and i have a wii remote sitting on top of it and for example 
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 82.89 90.12 <NA> if you 're in a school that doesn 't have a lot money probably a lot of schools or if you 're in an office environment and you want an interactive whiteboard <unk> 
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 89.91 96.98 <NA> normally these cost about two to three thousand dollars so i 'm going to show you how to create one with a wii remote 
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 96.67 98.15 <NA> now 
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 98.5 100.02 <NA> this requires another piece
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 100.46 108.87 <NA> <unk> which is this infrared pen you can probably make this yourself for about five dollars with a quick trip to the radio shack it 's got a battery a button and an infrared <unk>
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 110.53 117.54 <NA> you guys can 't see it but it turns on whenever i push the button now what this means is that if i run this piece of software
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 119.26 124.71 <NA> the camera sees the infrared dot <unk> and i can register the location
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 124.58 129.73 <NA> of the camera pixels to the projector pixels and now this is like an interactive whiteboard surface
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 129.78 136.48 <NA> applause so for about $ fifty of hardware you can have your own whiteboard this is
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 136.48 138.1 <NA> adobe photoshop thank you 
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 145.83 154.94 <NA> the software for this i 've actually put on my website and have let people download it for free in the three months this project has been public it 's been downloaded over half a million
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 154.87 158.87 <NA> <unk> times <unk> so teachers and students all around the world are already using this applause
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 164.95 172.04 <NA> although it does do it for fifty dollars there are some limitations of this approach you get about eighty percent of the way there for one percent of the <unk>
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 171.94 178.23 <NA> <unk> cost <unk> another nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots so this is actually a multi touch interactive whiteboard system as well
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 181.19 187.47 <NA> <unk> for the second demo i have this wii remote that 's actually next to the tv so it 's pointing away from the display <unk> rather than
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 187.34 191.91 <NA> pointing at the display <unk> and why why this is interesting
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 191.99 204.97 <NA> is that if you put on say a pair of safety glasses that have two infrared dots in them they are going to give the computer an approximation of your head location and why this is interesting is i have this sort of application running on
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 205.1 210.82 <NA> the computer monitor which has a 3d room with some targets floating in it and you can see that it looks like a <unk>
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 212.91 221.38 <NA> <unk> like a video game it sort of looks 3d but for the most part the image looks pretty flat and bound to the surface of the screen but if we turn turn on head tracking
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 223.84 224.84 <NA> the
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 225.13 231.23 <NA> <unk> can change the image that 's on the screen and make it respond to the head movements so let 's switch back to that 
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 245.23 249.71 <NA> so this has actually been a little bit startling to the game development community laughter
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 250.99 254.91 <NA> because this is about ten dollars of additional hardware if you already have a
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 255.67 265.99 <NA> so i 'm looking forward to seeing some games and actually louis castle that 's him down there last week announced that electronic arts one of the largest game publishers is releasing a game in may
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 265.94 274.84 <NA> <unk> that has a little easter egg feature for supporting this type of head tracking and that 's from less than five months from a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 284.58 298 <NA> <unk> to me what 's almost more interesting than either of these two projects is projects is how people actually found out about them <unk> youtube has really changed the way or changed the speed in which a single individual can actually spread an idea around the world i
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 297.57 299.9 <NA> 'm doing some research in my lab with a
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 300.46 304.22 <NA> <unk> and within the first week a million people had seen this work and
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 303.73 311.15 <NA> literally within days <unk> engineers teachers and students from around the world were already posting their own youtube videos of
JohnnyLee_2008 1 JohnnyLee_2008 311.15 320.79 <NA> them using my system or derivatives of this work <unk> so i hope to see more of that in the future and hope online video distribution to be embraced by the research community <unk> so thank you very much
