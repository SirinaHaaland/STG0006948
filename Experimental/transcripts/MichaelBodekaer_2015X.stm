MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 30.59 42.45 <NA> but before i show you how all of this is possible let 's talk briefly about why improving the quality of science education is so vitally important 
MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 43.04 51.03 <NA> if you think about it the world is growing incredibly fast <unk> and with that growth comes a whole list of growing challenges

MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 66.21 74.96 <NA> well to a very last degree it is these young students this is the next generation of young bright scientists and in many
MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 75.52 83.87 <NA> <unk> we all rely on them for coming up with new great innovations to help us solve all these challenges ahead of us <unk> 
MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 84.25 96.24 <NA> and so a couple of years back my cofounder and i were teaching university students just like these only the students we were teaching looked a little bit more like this here 
MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 96.73 104.94 <NA> and yes this is really the reality out there in way too many universities around the world students that are bored

MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 111.29 122.91 <NA> so we started looking around for new <unk> innovative teaching methods <unk> but what we found was quite disappointing we saw that books were being turned into e books 
MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 122.96 129.97 <NA> blackboards were being turned into youtube videos and lecture hall monologues were being turned into moocs massive

MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 132.24 142.36 <NA> and if you think about it all we 're really doing here is taking the same content and the same format <unk> and bringing it out to more students
MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 142.11 149.78 <NA> which is great don 't get me wrong that is really great but the teaching method is still more or less the same no
MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 154.12 165.15 <NA> <unk> what we found was that flight simulators had been proven over and over again to be far more effective when used in combination with real in flight training to train the pilots <unk> 
MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 165.15 167.12 <NA> and so we thought to ourselves <unk> 
MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 167.05 174.86 <NA> why not just apply that to science why not build a virtual laboratory simulator <unk>

MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 233.86 241.79 <NA> and we of course quiz the students and then give the teachers a full dashboard <unk> so they fully understand where the students are at 
MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 241.63 254.55 <NA> but we didn 't stop there because we had seen just how important meaning is for the students <unk> ' engagement in the class <unk> so we brought in game designers to create fun and engaging stories for instance here in this case

MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 291.57 299.74 <NA> that 's how engaging and immersive this really is for the students and so to investigate whether this really worked a
MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 299.25 304.73 <NA> learning psychologist did a study with one hundred and sixty students that was from

MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 321.88 324.78 <NA> <unk> then interestingly they gave the students a
MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 327.8 334.48 <NA> <unk> they could clearly measure the learning impact of the students and what they found was a surprisingly high

MichaelBodekaer_2015X 1 MichaelBodekaer_2015X 343.85 354.97 <NA> but even more interestingly the second part of this study investigated what the teacher 's impact was on the learning and what they found was that when you combined the virtual
