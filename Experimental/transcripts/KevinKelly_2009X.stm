KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 14.14 21.05 <NA> <unk> my investigations into what technology means in our lives not just
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 20.98 24.84 <NA> our immediate life but in the cosmic sense in the kind of long history
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 27.74 34.56 <NA> <unk> our place in the world what is this stuff what is the significance and so <unk> i want to kind of go through
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 34.07 42.75 <NA> my little story of what i found out and one of the first things that i started to investigate was the history of the name of technology and
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 42.26 46.86 <NA> in the united states there is a state of the union address given by every president
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 46.7 54.97 <NA> since one thousand seven hundred and ninety and each one of those is really kind of summing up the most important things for the united states at that time
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 55.1 60.6 <NA> <unk> if you search for the word technology it was not used until one thousand nine hundred and fifty two 
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 60.61 73.94 <NA> so <unk> technology was sort of absent from everybody 's thinking until one thousand nine hundred and fifty two which happened to be the year of my birth and obviously technology had existed before then but we weren 't aware of it and so it was sort of an awakening of
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 73.75 74.96 <NA> this force
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 82.36 94.37 <NA> <unk> was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum a course bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts and industry and he called it technology and that 's the very first use of the word 
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 93.97 96.63 <NA> so what is this stuff
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 96.4 99.93 <NA> that we 're all consumed by <unk> and bothered
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 101.9 108.23 <NA> <unk> alan kay calls it technology is anything that was invented after you were born which is sort of the
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 108.23 116.25 <NA> idea that we normally have about what technology is it 's all that new stuff <unk> it 's not roads or penicillin or
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 115.79 125.02 <NA> factory tires it 's the new stuff my friend danny hillis says kind of a similar one he says technology is anything that doesn 't work yet which
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 125.64 131.8 <NA> <unk> sense that it 's all new but we know that it 's just not new it actually goes way back and what i want to suggest is it goes a

KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 134.28 147.85 <NA> so <unk> another way to think about technology what it means is to imagine a world without technology if we were to eliminate every single bit of technology in the world today and i mean everything from blades to scrapers to cloth
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 147.72 154.94 <NA> we as a species would not live very long <unk> we would die by the billions and very quickly the wolves would get us

KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 167.86 173.94 <NA> and if we study those hunter gatherer tribes and the neanderthal which are very similar to

KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 208.05 214.57 <NA> <unk> tribes and early man is is that you didn 't live beyond the age of thirty so it was a world without grandparents 
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 214.14 227.27 <NA> and grandparents are very important because they are the transmitter of cultural evolution and information imagine a world and basically everybody was twenty to thirty years old how much learning can you do you can 't do very much learning in your own life <unk> 
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 227.27 229.97 <NA> it 's so short and there 's nobody to pass on
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 229.93 239.24 <NA> <unk> what you do learn <unk> so <unk> that 's one aspect it was a very short life <unk> but at the same time anthropologists know that
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 239.02 250.17 <NA> most hunter gatherer tribes of the world with that very little technology actually did not spend a very long time gathering the food that they needed three to six hours a day some anthropologists call that the original
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 251.66 254.07 <NA> <unk> because they had banker hours basically 
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 253.67 262.65 <NA> so it was possible to to get enough food but when the scarcity came when the highs and lows and the droughts came then
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 262.49 272.76 <NA> people went into starvation and that 's why they didn 't live very long so what technology brought through the very simple tools like these stone tools here

KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 590.16 599.93 <NA> <unk> going to become more energy dense that 's where it 's going and so what i 've done is i 've taken the same kinds of things and looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say 
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 600 608.94 <NA> what are the general trends in evolutionary life and there are things moving towards greater complexity moving towards greater diversity moving towards greater specialization

KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 615.57 621.87 <NA> in technology <unk> that 's where technology is going <unk> in fact technology is accelerating all the
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 621.87 628.92 <NA> aspects of life and we can see that happening just as there 's diversity in life there 's more diversity in things we make
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 629.9 639.72 <NA> <unk> things in life start out being general cell and they become specialized you have tissue cells you have muscle brain cells and same things happens with say a hammer which is general at first and becomes more specific <unk> 
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 639.23 649.12 <NA> so <unk> i would like to say that while there is six kingdoms of life <unk> we can think of technology basically as a seventh kingdom of life <unk> it 's a branching off from the human form 
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 649.12 654.43 <NA> but technology has its own agenda like anything like life itself for instance right now
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 655.05 666.95 <NA> <unk> of the energy that we use is actually used to feed the technium itself in transportation it 's not to move us it 's to move the stuff that we make or buy i use the word want technology wants this is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power

KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 820.67 829.01 <NA> is a better idea ok so <unk> better ideas is really always the response to technology that we don 't like is basically
KevinKelly_2009X 1 KevinKelly_2009X 830.28 833.98 <NA> <unk> and actually in a certain sense <unk> technology is a kind of
