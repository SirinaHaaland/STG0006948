MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 13.57 15.41 <NA> <unk> a couple of quick examples 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 15.01 22.63 <NA> these are spinneret glands on the abdomen of a spider they produce six different types of silk <unk> which is spun together into a fiber <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 22.63 25.4 <NA> tougher than any fiber humans have ever made <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 25.21 29.88 <NA> the nearest we 've come is with aramid fiber <unk> and to make that it involves
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 29.81 33.15 <NA> <unk> extremes of temperature extremes of pressure and loads of pollution <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 32.66 40.96 <NA> and yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water it does suggest we 've still got a bit to learn 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 40.72 47.91 <NA> this beetle can detect a forest fire at eighty kilometers away that 's roughly ten thousand times the range of man made fire detectors <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 47.91 53.4 <NA> and what 's more this guy doesn 't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 53.39 54.88 <NA> so these two examples
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 54.9 60.5 <NA> <unk> give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver <unk> if we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 60.5 66.7 <NA> we could achieve factor ten factor one hundred maybe even factor one thousand savings in resource and energy use <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 67.05 76.88 <NA> and if we 're to make progress with the sustainability revolution i believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about <unk> firstly <unk> radical increases in resource efficiency <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 76.88 79.25 <NA> secondly <unk> shifting from a linear
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 79.87 82.89 <NA> <unk> polluting way of using resources to a closed loop model <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 82.65 91.37 <NA> and thirdly changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy <unk> and for all three of these i believe biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we 're going to need 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 91.36 99.14 <NA> you could look at nature as being like a catalog of products and all of those have benefited from a 3 8 billion year research and development period 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 98.74 104.97 <NA> and given that level of investment it makes sense to use it so i 'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 104.99 110.74 <NA> <unk> ideas <unk> and let 's start with radical increases in resource efficiency when we were working on the eden project 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 110.74 118.62 <NA> we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 118.34 124.96 <NA> it was a hell of a challenge <unk> and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues <unk> so for instance <unk>
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 125.49 130.93 <NA> <unk> it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form that would work regardless of the final ground levels 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 130.44 140.86 <NA> studying pollen grains and radiolaria and carbon molecules helped us devise the most efficient structural solution using hexagons and pentagons 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 141.12 150.49 <NA> the next move was that we wanted to try and maximize the size of those hexagons and to do that we had to find an alternative to glass which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 150.33 154.97 <NA> and in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 154.99 156.48 <NA> <unk> pressurized membranes <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 156.24 165.72 <NA> so we started exploring this material called etfe <unk> it 's a <unk> high strength polymer <unk> and what you do is you put it together in three layers you weld it around the edge and then you inflate it 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 165.72 174.99 <NA> and the great thing about this stuff is you can make it in units of roughly seven times the size of glass <unk> and it was only one percent of the weight of double glazing so that was a
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 176.9 184.23 <NA> <unk> and what we found is that we got into a positive cycle in which one breakthrough facilitated another <unk> so with such large lightweight pillows
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 183.83 188.4 <NA> we had much less steel with less steel we were getting more sunlight in 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 188.15 195.85 <NA> which meant we didn 't have to put as much extra heat in winter <unk> and with less overall weight in the superstructure there were big savings in the foundations <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 195.85 199.66 <NA> and at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 199.49 204.94 <NA> was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building <unk> so i think the eden project is a fairly good
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 204.9 210.19 <NA> <unk> example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 209.85 218.33 <NA> delivering the same function <unk> but with a fraction of the resource input <unk> and actually there are loads of examples in nature that you could turn to for similar
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 218.33 227.39 <NA> solutions <unk> so for instance <unk> you could develop super efficient roof structures based on giant amazon water lilies <unk> whole buildings inspired by abalone shells
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 230.13 237.81 <NA> there 's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here using nature as a design tool <unk> so now i want to go onto talking about the
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 239.01 251.99 <NA> idea the way we tend to use resources is we extract them we turn them into short life products and then dispose of them nature works very differently in ecosystems the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 251.59 254.67 <NA> and there are some examples of projects that have deliberately
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 254.96 260.46 <NA> <unk> to mimic ecosystems and one of my favorites is called the cardboard to caviar project
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 260.12 262.38 <NA> by graham wiles 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 262.22 269.91 <NA> and in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food cardboard and plastic waste it was ending up in landfills <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 269.57 274.9 <NA> now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste <unk> and i 'm just going to talk through this
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 275.43 276.92 <NA> <unk> so they were paid to collect it
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 276.74 282.61 <NA> from the restaurants <unk> they then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 282.18 284.82 <NA> when that was soiled they were paid again to collect it 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 284.83 292.51 <NA> they put it into worm recomposting systems which produced a lot of worms which they fed to siberian sturgeon <unk> which produced caviar <unk> which they sold back to the restaurants
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 292.14 299.02 <NA> <unk> so it transformed a linear process into a closed loop model <unk> and it created more value in the process 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 298.68 304.94 <NA> graham wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this turning waste streams into schemes that create value and
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 305.08 312.53 <NA> <unk> just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time there 's a real sense with this project that
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 312.43 315.92 <NA> the number of possibilities just continue increasing <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 315.67 324.81 <NA> and i know it 's a quirky example but i think the the implications of this are quite radical because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem waste into a massive
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 325.73 335.46 <NA> <unk> and particularly in cities we could look at the whole metabolism of cities <unk> and look at those as as opportunities <unk> and that 's what we 're doing on the next project i 'm going to talk about the mobius project <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 335.39 342.4 <NA> where we 're trying to bring together a number of activities all within one building so that the the waste from one can be the nutrient for another <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 342.4 349.83 <NA> and the kind of elements i 'm talking about are <unk> firstly <unk> we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse a bit like this one in amsterdam called de kas 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 349.34 354.67 <NA> then we would have an anaerobic digester which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area turn
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 354.99 358.48 <NA> <unk> heat for the greenhouse and electricity to feed back into the grid we
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 358.02 366.97 <NA> 'd have a water treatment system treating wastewater turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro organisms we
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 366.84 373.36 <NA> 'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen and worms from the compost and supplying fish back to the restaurant 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 373.35 379.97 <NA> and we 'd also have a coffee shop <unk> and the waste grains from that could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms <unk> so you can see that we 're bringing together
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 379.93 391.07 <NA> <unk> cycles of food energy and water and waste all within one building <unk> and just for fun <unk> we 've proposed this for a roundabout in central london which at the moment is a complete eyesore some of you may recognize this 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 391.06 396.51 <NA> and with just a little bit of planning <unk> we could transform a space dominated by traffic
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 396.33 401.04 <NA> into one that provides open space for people reconnects people with food
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 400.83 404.16 <NA> and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 404.87 416.19 <NA> <unk> so the final project i want to talk about is the sahara forest project which we 're working on at the moment it may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 415.7 423.54 <NA> so for instance when julius caesar arrived in north africa <unk> huge areas of north africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 423.53 424.9 <NA> and during the
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 427.8 434.23 <NA> <unk> the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy <unk> the converse is also true <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 434.23 440.68 <NA> the more vegetation we lose <unk> the more that more that 's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 440.88 449.96 <NA> and this animation <unk> this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years <unk> and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 449.79 453.56 <NA> shift quite a lot <unk> and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 455.56 459.32 <NA> to to halt or maybe even reverse desertification 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 459.7 472.1 <NA> and if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity this is the namibian fog basking beetle and it 's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 471.67 475.08 <NA> the way it does this is it comes out at night crawls to the top of a sand dune
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 475.13 478.65 <NA> <unk> because it 's got a matte black shell is able to radiate heat out to the night sky
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 478.48 481.05 <NA> and become slightly cooler than its surroundings <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 480.85 485.76 <NA> so when the moist breeze blows in off the sea you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle 's shell 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 485.76 491.34 <NA> just before sunrise he tips his shell up the water runs down into his mouth has a good drink <unk> goes off and hides for the rest of the day <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 490.88 502.12 <NA> and the ingenuity if you could call it that goes even further <unk> because if you look closely at the beetle 's shell there are lots of little bumps on that shell <unk> and those bumps are hydrophilic they attract water
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 502.12 504.82 <NA> between them there 's a waxy finish which repels water
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 504.84 506.42 <NA> and the effect of this
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 506.24 516.49 <NA> is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps they stay in tight spherical beads <unk> which means they 're much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle 's shell <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 516.49 524.87 <NA> so even when there 's only a small amount of moisture in the air it 's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth so amazing example of an adaptation to a very
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 526.57 532.37 <NA> <unk> and in that sense very relevant to the kind of challenges we 're going to be facing over the next few years next few decades we
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 531.88 541.17 <NA> 're working with the guy who invented the seawater greenhouse this is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions <unk> and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 541.17 551.54 <NA> and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process <unk> so inside it 's cool and humid which means the plants need less water to grow 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 551.2 554.82 <NA> and then at the back of the greenhouse it condenses a lot of that
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 554.75 558.99 <NA> <unk> humidity as freshwater in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 558.98 566.86 <NA> and what they found with the first seawater greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 566.86 569.88 <NA> so they just started spreading this on the land around 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 569.57 574.9 <NA> and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 574.9 579.85 <NA> this photograph was taken on completion day <unk> and just one year later <unk> it looked like that so it was like a
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 579.78 589.09 <NA> <unk> green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land and in that sense going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design <unk> 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 588.93 594.55 <NA> so we were keen to scale this up and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits 
MichaelPawlyn_2010S 1 MichaelPawlyn_2010S 594.75 600.32 <NA> and when you think about nature often you think about it as being all about competition <unk> but actually in mature ecosystems
