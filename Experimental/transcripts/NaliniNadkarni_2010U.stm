NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 20.68 29.85 <NA> but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs trees become very dynamic entities moving and growing <unk> and i decided to
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 29.78 33.13 <NA> <unk> explore this movement by turning trees into artists <unk> 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 32.95 43.29 <NA> i simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig <unk> i waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas and that produced art the piece of art you see on your left is <unk>
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 43.24 50.08 <NA> painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a douglas fir <unk> and what i learned was that different species have different signatures
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 50.04 57.85 <NA> <unk> like a picasso versus a monet <unk> but i was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it <unk> 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 57.72 67.67 <NA> so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree which produced this painting moved in a single year <unk> i simply measured and summed each of those lines <unk> 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 67.67 75.17 <NA> i multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 76.21 80.9 <NA> <unk> and so i was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 80.56 90.53 <NA> you might have a guess the answer is actually one hundred and eighty six thousand five hundred and forty miles or seven times around the globe <unk> and so simply by shifting <unk>
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 90.43 99.75 <NA> <unk> our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities <unk> but rather extremely dynamic <unk> 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 100 110.31 <NA> began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees to consider other entities that are also static and stuck <unk> but which cry for change and dynamicism <unk> 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 110 120.96 <NA> and one of those entities is our prisons prisons of course are where people who break our laws are stuck <unk> confined behind bars <unk> and our prison system itself is stuck <unk> 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 120.96 124.96 <NA> the united states has over two point three million incarcerated men and women 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 125 126.82 <NA> <unk> that number is rising 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 126.57 140.11 <NA> of the one hundred incarcerated people that are released sixty will return to prison <unk> funds for education for training and for rehabilitation are declining so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 139.74 147.76 <NA> i decided to ask whether the lesson i had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons <unk> 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 147.45 150.29 <NA> and i think the answer is yes
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 150.67 159.57 <NA> <unk> the year two thousand and seven i started a partnership with the washington state department of corrections working with four prisons we began bringing science

NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 172.3 179.94 <NA> that i think is movement <unk> we partnered with the nature conservancy for inmates at stafford creek correctional center to
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 179.9 185.2 <NA> <unk> grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in washington state

NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 197.93 204.94 <NA> and just recently we 've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call supermax facilities they 've incurred
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 204.87 206.53 <NA> <unk> violent infractions
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 206.33 220.48 <NA> by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners they 're kept in bare cells like this for twenty three hours a day when they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals they 're placed in immobile booths like this 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 220.17 225.05 <NA> for one hour a day they 're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 225.31 237.6 <NA> <unk> although we can 't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards <unk> putting them on the walls so at least they get contact with visual images of nature 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 237.6 249.78 <NA> this is mr lopez who has been in solitary confinement for eighteen months and he 's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene more calm <unk> less apt to
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 252.2 259.35 <NA> <unk> and so what we see i think is that small <unk> collective movements of change can perhaps move
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 259.15 264.63 <NA> an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope <unk> 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 264.38 268.95 <NA> we know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks 
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 268.95 279.97 <NA> but if trees can create art if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year <unk> if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs then perhaps there are other static entities
NaliniNadkarni_2010U 1 NaliniNadkarni_2010U 280.34 290.27 <NA> that we hold inside ourselves like grief like addictions <unk> like racism that can also change thank you very much
