DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 20.89 29.4 <NA> <unk> so this video was taken at aquarius undersea laboratory four miles off the coast of key largo about sixty feet below the surface
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 29.99 36.75 <NA> <unk> uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts <unk> and last year they invited us along for the ride 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 36.68 42.99 <NA> all the footage was taken from our open rov which is a robot that we built in our garage 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 44.03 49.78 <NA> so rov stands for remote operated vehicle <unk> which in our case means our little robot
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 53.85 55.99 <NA> <unk> back to the computer topside <unk> 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 55.77 66.07 <NA> it 's open source meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design it
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 65.7 68.51 <NA> 's built with mostly off the shelf parts
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 68.34 74.08 <NA> and costs about one thousand times cheaper than the rovs james cameron used to explore the titanic 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 78.04 85.49 <NA> <unk> they 've been around for decades <unk> scientists use rovs to explore the oceans <unk> oil and gas companies use them for exploration
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 85.49 94.04 <NA> and construction what we 've built isn 't unique <unk> it 's how we 've built it that 's really unique <unk> so
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 93.58 99.93 <NA> i want to give you a quick story of how it got started so a few years ago <unk> my friend eric and i decided we wanted to explore this underwater
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 100 101.82 <NA> cave in the foothills of the sierras <unk> 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 101.59 109.75 <NA> we had heard this story about lost gold from a gold rush era robbery and we wanted to go up there unfortunately we didn 't have any money and we didn 't have any tools to do it 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 109.57 112.94 <NA> so eric had an initial design idea for a robot
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 112.95 119.97 <NA> <unk> but we didn 't have all the parts figured out <unk> so we did what anybody would do in our situation <unk> we asked the internet for help 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 119.72 126.3 <NA> more specifically <unk> we created this website openrov com and shared our intentions and our plans
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 126.02 129.97 <NA> for the first few months it was just eric and i talking back to each other on the forums
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 130.16 139.48 <NA> <unk> but pretty soon we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists <unk> and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do <unk> 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 139.56 146.17 <NA> we kept working on it we learned a lot we kept prototyping and eventually we decided we wanted to go to the cave we were ready
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 145.83 154.82 <NA> <unk> so about that time our little expedition became quite a story and it got picked up in the new york times and we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 154.96 159.14 <NA> <unk> a kit that they could build this open rov themselves <unk> so
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 158.74 167.66 <NA> we decided to put the project on kickstarter <unk> and when we did we raised our funding goal in about two hours and all of a sudden had this money to make these kits <unk> 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 167.32 169.44 <NA> but then we had to learn how to
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 169.23 173.3 <NA> make them i mean we had to learn small batch manufacturing so
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 172.81 180 <NA> we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation <unk> but we were able to do it we got all the kits
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 179.96 189.39 <NA> <unk> made thanks a lot to techshop which was a big help to us and we shipped these kits all over the world just before christmas of last year so it was just a few months ago <unk> 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 189.26 195.87 <NA> but we 're already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world including this shot from under the ice in antarctica <unk> 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 195.62 199.54 <NA> we 've also learned the penguins love robots
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 202.44 216.1 <NA> <unk> we 're still publishing all the designs online encouraging anyone to build these themselves that 's the only way that we could have done this by being open source we 've created this distributed r & d network and we 're moving faster than any venture backed counterpart 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 216.6 219.79 <NA> but the actual robot is really only half the story 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 219.66 227.5 <NA> the real potential the long term potential is with this community of diy ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 227.16 229.97 <NA> <unk> what can we discover when there 's thousands
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 229.93 232.7 <NA> <unk> of these devices roaming the seas <unk> 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 232.96 236.81 <NA> so you 're probably all wondering the cave did you find the gold well
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 236.86 246.09 <NA> we didn 't find any gold <unk> but we decided that what we found was much more valuable it was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration 
DavidLang_2013U 1 DavidLang_2013U 246.09 254.81 <NA> it 's something that 's not limited to the james camerons of the world but something that we 're all participating in it 's an underwater world we 're all exploring together <unk>
