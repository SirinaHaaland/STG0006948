OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 14.35 25.2 <NA> <unk> i 'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust <unk> i think these are so commonplace they 've become clichs of our society <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 25.49 35.25 <NA> <unk> i think there are three one 's a claim <unk> there has been a great decline in trust <unk> very widely believed <unk> the second is
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 35.02 40.05 <NA> an aim <unk> we should have more trust <unk> and the third is
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 39.88 43.56 <NA> a task <unk> we should rebuild trust <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 43.91 50.17 <NA> i think that the claim <unk> the aim and the task are all misconceived 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 50.17 53.85 <NA> so what i 'm going to try to tell you today is a different story
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 53.54 54.97 <NA> about a claim
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 55.16 58.46 <NA> an aim and a task which i think give one
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 58.28 66.1 <NA> quite a lot better purchase on the matter first the claim <unk> why do people think trust has declined <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 65.91 79.97 <NA> and if i really think about it on the basis of my own evidence <unk> i don 't know the answer <unk> i 'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 79.96 82.67 <NA> <unk> in others <unk> i don 't have an overview 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 82.67 92.99 <NA> but of course <unk> i can look at the opinion polls and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 93.16 97.19 <NA> when you actually look at opinion polls across time there
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 97.19 104.97 <NA> 's not much evidence for that that 's to say the people who were mistrusted twenty years ago principally journalists and
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 104.9 107.7 <NA> <unk> politicians are still mistrusted 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 107.42 116.79 <NA> and the people who were highly trusted twenty years ago are still rather highly trusted judges nurses <unk> the rest of us are in between
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 116.39 125.2 <NA> and by the way <unk> the average person in the street is almost exactly midway <unk> but is that good evidence what opinion polls
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 127.98 140.68 <NA> <unk> what else can they record so they 're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions <unk> do you trust politicians do you trust teachers <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 140.28 150.17 <NA> now if somebody said to you do you trust greengrocers do you trust fishmongers do you trust elementary school teachers you would probably begin
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 152.5 156.5 <NA> <unk> and that would be a perfectly sensible response and
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 156.19 159.08 <NA> you might say <unk> when you understood
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 158.65 161.48 <NA> the answer to that well 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 161.25 166.11 <NA> i trust some of them but not others that 's a perfectly rational thing 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 166.11 179.97 <NA> in short in our real lives we seek to place trust in a differentiated way <unk> we don 't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 179.93 182.76 <NA> <unk> of official or office holder or
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 182.56 185.97 <NA> type of person is going to be uniform <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 185.51 194.4 <NA> i might for example say that i certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher i know to teach the reception class to read 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 194.4 197.91 <NA> but in no way to drive the school minibus
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 197.9 199.87 <NA> <unk> i might after all know that she
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 212.1 219.43 <NA> <unk> keep a conversation going but not but perhaps not to keep a secret simple so if we 've got those
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 219.96 229.79 <NA> evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated <unk> why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 229.93 231.39 <NA> <unk> more abstractly <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 231.39 243.71 <NA> i think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 243.85 252.08 <NA> secondly <unk> what about the aim <unk> the aim is to have more trust <unk> well frankly i think that 's a stupid aim it
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 252.19 254.97 <NA> 's not what i would aim at i would aim
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 254.81 263.53 <NA> <unk> aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy in fact i aim positively
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 263.35 267.18 <NA> to try not to trust the untrustworthy
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 267.05 275.08 <NA> <unk> and i think of those people who for example <unk> placed their savings with the very aptly named
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 275.85 277.72 <NA> <unk> who then made off with them <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 277.89 286.4 <NA> and i think of them and i think well <unk> yes too much trust more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 286.4 292.18 <NA> intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 292.35 299.9 <NA> well once one says that one says yeah <unk> okay that means that what matters in the first place is
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 302.83 312.53 <NA> <unk> judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects and i think that judgment requires us to look at three things are they competent 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 312.64 315.74 <NA> are they honest are they reliable 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 315.74 325.91 <NA> and if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters and reliable and honest we 'll have a pretty good reason to trust them because they 'll be trustworthy 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 325.93 329.85 <NA> but if on the other hand they 're unreliable we might not
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 329.87 335.73 <NA> <unk> i have friends who are competent and honest but i would not trust them to post a letter because they 're forgetful
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 335.75 341.19 <NA> <unk> i have friends who are very confident they can do certain things
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 340.76 351.82 <NA> <unk> but i realize that they overestimate their own competence and i 'm very glad to say i don 't think i have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 355.89 366.7 <NA> but that 's what we 're looking for trustworthiness before trust trust is the response trustworthiness is what we have to judge and of course it 's difficult 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 366.33 375.71 <NA> across the last few decades we 've tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 375.52 379.79 <NA> that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 380.02 386.78 <NA> <unk> a lot of these systems have the converse effect they don 't work as they 're supposed to i remember i was
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 386.86 394.7 <NA> talking with a midwife who said well you see the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 394.3 400.02 <NA> and all over our public life our institutional life we find that
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 400.85 406.35 <NA> <unk> that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 405.89 415.94 <NA> and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite it is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks <unk> like midwives 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 415.95 422.67 <NA> from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes as we say you can all give your own examples there
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 422.48 424.96 <NA> so so much for the aim <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 425.52 434.87 <NA> <unk> i think is more trustworthiness and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 434.87 438.71 <NA> and if we are trying to judge whether other people or <unk>
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 438.47 447.41 <NA> <unk> office holders or politicians are trustworthy it 's not easy <unk> it is judgment and simple reaction attitudes don 't do
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 455.07 463.76 <NA> rebuilding trust <unk> i think also gets things backwards it suggests that you and i should rebuild trust <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 463.42 472.16 <NA> well <unk> we can do that for ourselves we can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness we can do it two people together trying to improve trust 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 472.16 474.44 <NA> but trust in the end 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 474.13 479.97 <NA> is distinctive because it 's given by other people you can 't rebuild what
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 480.07 485.17 <NA> other people give you you have to give them the basis for giving
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 484.96 487.47 <NA> you their trust <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 487.04 495.33 <NA> so you have to i think be trustworthy and that of course is because you can 't fool all of the people all of the time <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 495.02 496.56 <NA> usually <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 496.46 499.6 <NA> but you also have to provide
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 499.37 504.97 <NA> usable evidence that you are trustworthy how to do it well every
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 505.05 512.23 <NA> <unk> day all over the place it 's being done by ordinary people by officials by institutions quite effectively <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 511.77 515.14 <NA> let me give you a simple commercial example <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 515.7 519.83 <NA> the shop where i buy my socks says i may take them back 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 519.83 529.7 <NA> and they don 't ask any questions they take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color i wanted that 's super <unk> i trust them because they have made
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 530.14 531.77 <NA> <unk> vulnerable to me 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 531.85 536.99 <NA> i think there 's a big lesson in that if you make yourself vulnerable to the other party <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 536.99 544.11 <NA> then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying <unk> 
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 543.9 547.16 <NA> so in the end i think what we are aiming for is not
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 547.27 554.94 <NA> very difficult to discern <unk> it is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 555.23 560.43 <NA> when and how the other person is trustworthy <unk> so
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 560.33 567.96 <NA> the moral of all this is we need to think much less about trust <unk> let alone about
OnoraONeill_2013X 1 OnoraONeill_2013X 567.56 579.9 <NA> attitudes of trust detected or mis detected by opinion polls much more about being trustworthy and how you give people adequate <unk> useful
