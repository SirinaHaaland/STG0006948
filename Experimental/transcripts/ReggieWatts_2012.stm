ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 49.85 54.97 <NA> <unk> that 's one of the things that i enjoy most about this convention
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 55.5 62.86 <NA> it 's not so much as so little has to do with what everything is 
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 66.21 67.51 <NA> but it is within <unk>
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 68.75 72.95 <NA> to understand the topography of our lives unto ourselves
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 80.11 88.19 <NA> <unk> there is no time other than the collapsation of that sensation of the mirror of the memories in which we are living 
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 90.91 95.15 <NA> common knowledge <unk> but important nonetheless 
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 97.66 103.44 <NA> as we face fear in these times and fear is all around us we also have
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 105.08 114.54 <NA> <unk> it 's hard to imagine or measure the background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis 
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 114.44 116.82 <NA> but we feel as though
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 116.45 120.04 <NA> there are times when a lot of us you know what i 'm saying
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 129.9 136.27 <NA> <unk> and i hope you guys dig it it 's a song about people and sasquatches and
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 139.11 144.89 <NA> other french science stuff that 's french science okay here we go
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 274.61 276.55 <NA> <unk> you could use as many of those things
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 282.09 287.38 <NA> and the computer models no matter how many that you have and how many people that you use 
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 287.38 290.71 <NA> are never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions 
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 290.64 292.84 <NA> four years ago i worked
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 292.5 296.36 <NA> with a few people at the brookings institute and i arrived at a conclusion
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 308.68 318.3 <NA> <unk> not just any day <unk> but it is a day <unk> it will get here there 's no question <unk> and the important thing to remember
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 318.12 322.07 <NA> is that this simulation is a good one 
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 321.7 328.86 <NA> it 's believable it 's tactile you can reach out things are solid you can move objects from one area to another
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 329.99 336.45 <NA> <unk> can feel your body you can say i 'd like to go over to this location and you can move this mass of molecules through the air
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 336.62 339.6 <NA> over to another location at will 
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 342.2 345.18 <NA> that 's something you live inside of every day <unk> 
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 346.52 354.97 <NA> now with the allocation and the understanding of the lack of understanding we enter into a new era of science in which we feel
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 355.16 362.32 <NA> nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves <unk> comporary or <unk>
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 363.71 367.25 <NA> will figuratively figure into the folding of our <unk>
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 368.6 374.99 <NA> and our partial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source and conclusions from
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 378.46 386.33 <NA> <unk> as i say before the last piece feel not as though it is a sphere we live on rather
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 386.47 392.51 <NA> an infinite plane which has the illusion of leading yourself back to the point of origin 
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 392.95 399.3 <NA> laughter once we understand that all the spheres in the sky are just large infinite planes it will be plain to see
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 404.93 410.58 <NA> <unk> remember everything you are it 's more important to realize
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 410.12 412.53 <NA> the negative space 
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 412.16 422.17 <NA> as music is only the division of space it is the space we are listening to divided as such which gives us the information in comparison to something other
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 421.96 425.02 <NA> that gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 436.83 438.74 <NA> <unk> this is a fun one it goes like this
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 465.64 468.66 <NA> <unk> for the last piece i 'd like to do this one goes
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 468.66 472.37 <NA> very similar to this i hope you guys recognize it here we go 
ReggieWatts_2012 1 ReggieWatts_2012 557.45 558.7 <NA> <unk> thank you enjoy the rest
