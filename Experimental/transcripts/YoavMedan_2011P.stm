YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 19.53 28.11 <NA> and partners around the world for taking this idea this concept noninvasive surgery from the research lab
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 28.11 29.82 <NA> to routine clinical use
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 29.87 32.8 <NA> <unk> and this is what i 'll tell you about thirteen years
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 32.8 40.68 <NA> for some of you you can empathize with that number for me today on this date it 's like a second bar mitzvah experience 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 43.43 52.22 <NA> laughter so this this dream is really enabled by the convergence of two known technologies 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 52.22 54.91 <NA> one is the focused ultrasound and the
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 54.87 56.08 <NA> <unk> other one is the <unk>
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 57.87 60.49 <NA> <unk> magnetic resonance imaging <unk> 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 60.36 64.45 <NA> so let 's first talk about focused ultrasound <unk> 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 64.26 71.68 <NA> and i hold in my hand a tissue mimicking phantom it is made out of silicon it is transparent
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 72.18 75.17 <NA> <unk> made just for you so you see it 's all
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 79.12 89.81 <NA> <unk> take you now to the acoustic lab you see the phantom within the aquarium this is a setup i put in a physics lab on the right hand side you see an ultrasonic transducer <unk> 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 89.32 96.12 <NA> so the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 95.94 98.13 <NA> inside the phantom
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 97.94 104.82 <NA> okay <unk> when you hear the click <unk> this is when the energy starts to emit and you see
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 104.93 111.91 <NA> <unk> lesion form inside the phantom <unk> okay <unk> so everything around it
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 111.7 123.3 <NA> is whole and intact <unk> it 's just a lesion formed inside so think about this is in your brain <unk> we need to reach a target inside the brain <unk> we can do it without harming any tissue <unk> 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 122.87 125.08 <NA> so this is i think
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 130.77 139.59 <NA> <unk> let 's talk a little bit about ultrasound the force of ultrasound you know all about imaging <unk> right ultrasound imaging and you know also about lithotripsy
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 139.6 141.07 <NA> breaking
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 141.36 150.11 <NA> breaking kidney stones <unk> but ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between because
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 150.19 152 <NA> <unk> it 's a mechanical
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 151.51 165.5 <NA> force basically it 's a force acting on a tissue that it transverses <unk> so you can change the intensity the frequency <unk> the duration <unk> the pulse shape of the ultrasound to create anything from an airbrush
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 165.07 175.17 <NA> to a hammer <unk> <unk> and i am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 179.3 188.84 <NA> <unk> this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain is not new at all when i was born this idea was already conceived
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 188.84 191.76 <NA> by pioneers such as the fry brothers
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 191.51 197.65 <NA> and lars leksell who is know actually as the inventor of the gammaknife <unk> but
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 197.65 204.97 <NA> you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain noninvasively with focused
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 205.02 210.07 <NA> <unk> ultrasound in the ' 50s he failed <unk> so he then invented the gammaknife <unk> 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 210.42 219.65 <NA> and it makes you ponder why why those pioneers failed <unk> and there was something fundamental
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 219.42 228.29 <NA> that they were missing they were missing the vision it wasn 't until the invention of the mr and really the integration of
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 229.84 233.39 <NA> <unk> ultrasound that we could get the feedback
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 233.16 236.88 <NA> both the anatomical and the physiological

YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 250.49 260.49 <NA> <unk> focused ultrasound system <unk> and i will give you several examples so the first one is in the brain <unk> one of the neurological conditions that can be treated with focused ultrasound
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 260.12 268.65 <NA> are movement disorders like parkinson 's or essential tremor what is typical to those conditions
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 268.55 272.34 <NA> to essential tremor for example is

YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 286.86 292.3 <NA> without the the help of others <unk> so i 'd like you to meet john 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 292.14 299.83 <NA> john is a retired professor of history from virginia <unk> so he suffered from essential tremor for many years 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 301.06 311.51 <NA> <unk> medication didn 't help him anymore and many of those patients refused to undergo surgery to have people cut into their brain <unk> and about four or five months ago <unk> 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 311.08 312.65 <NA> he
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 313.24 318.41 <NA> underwent an experimental procedure <unk> it is approved under
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 319.83 325.11 <NA> the university of virginia in charlottesville using focused ultrasound
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 340.31 350.08 <NA> <unk> this is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the mr so now i 'll take you through [ what ] a typical procedure like that looks like [ what ]
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 351.9 353.05 <NA> <unk> looks like 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 353.91 363.44 <NA> so we put the patient on the mr table we attach a transducer in this case to the brain but if it will be a different organ it will be a different transducer attached to the
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 362.96 367.45 <NA> patient and the physician will then take
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 367.45 375.02 <NA> a regular mr scan <unk> <unk> and the objective of that i don 't have a pointer here but you see the

YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 377.88 388.76 <NA> this is the sort of general area of the treatment <unk> it 's a safety boundary around the target <unk> it 's a target in the thalamus <unk> <unk> so once those pictures are acquired <unk>
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 388.66 394.28 <NA> <unk> and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 405.07 414.72 <NA> injecting the energy we call it sonication the only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse <unk> this is the only device he needs in this treatment <unk> 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 414.71 423.81 <NA> so he presses sonicate and this is what happens you see the transducer the light blue there 's water in between the skull and the transducer <unk> 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 423.41 429.88 <NA> and it does this burst of energy it elevates the temperature we first need to verify that
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 429.87 440.05 <NA> <unk> that we are on target <unk> so the first sonication is at lower energy it doesn 't do any damage <unk> but it elevates the temperature
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 439.68 445.64 <NA> by a few degrees and one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the mr
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 445.64 449.9 <NA> is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively <unk> this is really a unique

YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 456.18 464.25 <NA> but here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time and you can see the points there on the graph 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 464.25 472.38 <NA> the temperature was raised to forty three degrees c temporarily <unk> this doesn 't cause any damage <unk> but the point is we are right on target <unk> 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 472.15 475.35 <NA> so once the physician verifies
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 475.19 479.97 <NA> that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen then we move
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 480.13 481.48 <NA> to perform
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 483.55 490.35 <NA> ablation like you see here <unk> and you see the temperature rises to like fifty five to sixty degrees c 
YoavMedan_2011P 1 YoavMedan_2011P 490.16 494.37 <NA> if you do it for more than a second it 's enough to basically
