SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 13.48 16.29 <NA> <unk> good morning let 's look for a minute
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 16.29 25.05 <NA> at the greatest icon of all leonardo da vinci we 're all familiar with his fantastic work his drawings his paintings his inventions his writings
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 25.94 30.75 <NA> <unk> but we do not know his face thousands of books have been written about him
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 30.38 35.19 <NA> but there 's controversy <unk> and it remains about his looks 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 34.94 40.86 <NA> even this <unk> well known portrait is not accepted by many art historians so what do you think 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 40.37 44.82 <NA> is this the face of leonardo da vinci or isn 't it 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 44.81 46.47 <NA> let 's find out 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 47.36 50.05 <NA> leonardo was a man that drew everything
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 58.77 65.95 <NA> <unk> but no faces <unk> i find that hard to believe his contemporaries made faces like the ones you see here en face <unk>
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 67.23 74.5 <NA> so surely a passionate drawer like leonardo must have made self portraits from time to time <unk> 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 74.58 79.27 <NA> so let 's try to find them i think that if we were to scan all of his work
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 78.9 79.94 <NA> and look for
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 79.95 83.63 <NA> self portraits we would find his face looking at us 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 83.56 87.6 <NA> so i looked at all of his drawings more than seven hundred 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 87.6 92.78 <NA> and looked for male portraits there are about one hundred and twenty you see them here 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 93.22 99.87 <NA> which ones of these could be self portraits well for that they have to be done as we just saw en face or
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 100.31 103.05 <NA> <unk> so we can eliminate all the profiles 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 102.95 111.54 <NA> it also has to be sufficiently detailed <unk> so we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized <unk> 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 111.26 118.81 <NA> and we know from his contemporaries that leonardo was a very handsome even beautiful man so we can also eliminate the ugly ones
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 118.62 124.96 <NA> or the caricatures and look what happens only three candidates remain that fit
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 125.82 127.18 <NA> <unk> and here they are 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 127.05 129.88 <NA> yes indeed the old man is there 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 129.45 138.88 <NA> as is this famous pen drawing of the homo <unk> vitruvianus and lastly the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted the musician <unk> 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 138.39 143.69 <NA> before we go into these faces <unk> i should explain why i have some right to talk about them <unk> 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 143.69 149.96 <NA> i 've made more than one thousand one hundred portraits myself for newspapers over the course of three hundred thirty years sorry thirty
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 153.04 160.13 <NA> <unk> but there are one thousand one hundred and very few artists have drawn so many faces so i know a little about drawing and analyzing faces <unk> 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 160.13 166.5 <NA> ok <unk> now let 's look at these three portraits and hold onto your seats because if we zoom in on those faces <unk> 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 166.27 173.66 <NA> remark how they have the same broad forehead the horizontal eyebrows the long nose the curved lips and the small well developed chin <unk> 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 173.23 179.97 <NA> i couldn 't believe my eyes when i first saw that there is no reason why these portraits should look alike all we did was look for portraits
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 179.99 185.7 <NA> <unk> that had the characteristics of a self portrait and look they are very similar <unk> now 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 185.45 197.76 <NA> are they made in the right order the young man should be made first and as you see here from the years that they were created it is indeed the case they are made in the right order <unk> what was the age of leonardo at the time does that fit yes it does he was <unk>
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 199.79 204.97 <NA> <unk> when these were made so we have three pictures <unk> potentially of the same person of the same age
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 205.05 206.98 <NA> <unk> as leonardo at the time <unk> 
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 206.67 215.68 <NA> but how do we know it 's him <unk> and not someone else <unk> well we need a reference <unk> and here 's the only the only picture of leonardo that 's widely accepted it 's
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 215.34 225.29 <NA> a statue made by verrocchio of david for which leonardo posed as a boy of fifteen and if we now compare the face of the statue with the face of the musician
SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 1 SiegfriedWoldhek_2008 225.85 232.32 <NA> <unk> you see the very same features again the statue is the reference and it connects the identity of leonardo to those three faces
