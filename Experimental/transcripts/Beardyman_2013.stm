Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 104.86 109.08 <NA> well imagine i was a strange child laughter
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 115.61 119.73 <NA> because the thing is i was i was constantly trying to
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 119.42 125.05 <NA> extend my repertoire of noises to be the very maximum that it could be i was
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 125 133.09 <NA> constantly experimenting with these noises and i 'm still on that mission i 'm still trying to find every noise that i can possibly make
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 132.9 140.2 <NA> and the thing is i 'm a bit older and wiser now and i know that there 's some noises i 'll never be able to make because i 'm hemmed in by
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 140.2 150.08 <NA> my physical body and there 's things it can 't do and there 's things that no one 's voice can do for example no one can do two notes at the same time you can do two tone
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 164.59 165.64 <NA> <unk> 's cheating
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 166.09 175.11 <NA> and it hurts your throat so there 's things you can 't do and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 175.94 189.54 <NA> <unk> beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world but they 're sketches at best which is which is what 's annoyed me if only if only there was a way for these ideas to come out
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 189.17 195.24 <NA> unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 194.78 204.82 <NA> so i 've been working with these guys and we 've made a machine we 've made a system which is basically a live
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 205.02 214.9 <NA> <unk> production machine a real time music production machine and it enables me to using nothing but my voice
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 214.41 218.95 <NA> create music in real time as i hear it in my head
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 218.73 224.41 <NA> unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me and
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 224.49 229.82 <NA> i 'm going to show you what it can do and before i start making
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 229.75 231.23 <NA> <unk> noises with it
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 231.07 239.33 <NA> and using it to manipulate my voice i want to reiterate that everything that you 're about to hear is being made by
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 239.33 241.29 <NA> my voice this
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 241.08 245.06 <NA> this system has thank you beautiful assistant
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 245.38 255 <NA> this this system has no sounds in it itself until i start putting sounds in it so there 's no prerecorded samples of any
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 254.99 256.04 <NA> <unk> kind
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 256.1 262.56 <NA> so once this thing really gets going and it really starts to mangle the audio i 'm putting into it it becomes
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 262.22 269.07 <NA> not obvious that it is the human voice but it is so i 'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 268.58 278.71 <NA> so the polyphony problem i 've only got one voice how do i get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time the simplest way to do it is something like this
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 284.88 286.34 <NA> by dancing it
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 324.73 329.91 <NA> <unk> 's probably the easiest way but if you want to do something a little bit more immediate something
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 329.96 335.08 <NA> <unk> you can 't achieve with live looping there 's other ways to layer your voice up there 's things like pitch shifting
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 335.08 341.76 <NA> which are awesome and i 'm going to show you now what that sounds like so i 'm going to start another beat for you like this beatboxing
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 348.65 353.32 <NA> there 's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start because it 's just fun so you can clap along if you
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 355.32 359.83 <NA> <unk> 's fine check it out i 'm going to lay down a bass sound now music
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 387.25 395.72 <NA> <unk> which is nice but what if i want to make say a applause thanks what if i want to make say a rock organ is that possible yes
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 395.62 403.04 <NA> it is by recording myself like this organ sound and now i have that
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 403.21 405 <NA> i have that recorded
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 406.61 408.45 <NA> assign it to a keyboard music
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 411.26 412.86 <NA> so that 's cool applause but
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 416.9 423.93 <NA> what if i wanted to sound like the whole of pink floyd impossible you say no
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 423.71 425.17 <NA> it is possible
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 425.16 429.53 <NA> <unk> and you can do it very simply using this machine it 's really fantastic check it out
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 464.53 470.9 <NA> <unk> every noise you can hear there is my voice i didn 't just trigger something which
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 470.83 474.93 <NA> sounds like that there 's no samples there 's no synthesizers that is literally all my
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 475 480.63 <NA> <unk> voice being manipulated and when you get to that point you have to ask don 't you
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 481.16 484.02 <NA> what 's the point why
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 484.13 491.73 <NA> why do this laughter because it 's cheaper than hiring the whole of pink floyd i suppose is the easy answer but
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 491.66 497.97 <NA> in actual fact i haven 't made this machine so that i can emulate things that already exist
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 497.96 504.48 <NA> i 've made this so that i can make any noise that i can imagine so with your permission i 'm going to do
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 505.1 508.46 <NA> things that are in my mind and i hope you enjoy them
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 508.25 510.55 <NA> because they 're rather unusual
Beardyman_2013 1 Beardyman_2013 510.55 519.05 <NA> especially when you 're doing things which are as unusual as this it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice you see
