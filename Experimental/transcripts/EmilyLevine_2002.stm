EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1250.66 1254.49 <NA> the trickster has to walk this fine line he has to
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1255.1 1261.15 <NA> poise <unk> and you know the biggest hurdle for me in doing what i do is
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1260.92 1266.31 <NA> constructing my performance so that it 's prepared and unprepared

EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1280.26 1282.61 <NA> i was thinking about what

EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1289.74 1298.18 <NA> sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty <unk> but to do that you have to
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1297.9 1304.88 <NA> lose all the other qualities because once you 're into beauty you 're into a finished thing you 're into

EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1315.54 1324.09 <NA> but if you don 't do that if you allow for the accident to keep on happening you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength
EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1329.84 1336.57 <NA> <unk> wave when you go into beauty the probability wave collapses into one possibility <unk> and i like

EmilyLevine_2002 1 EmilyLevine_2002 1343.67 1349.93 <NA> and the one final quality i want to say about trickster is that he doesn 't have a home he 's always
