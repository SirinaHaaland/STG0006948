ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 19.24 21.98 <NA> and i 've noticed an interesting shift 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 21.67 29.97 <NA> for a long period of time <unk> we believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us also known as the great chain
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 29.93 33.03 <NA> <unk> of being or scala naturae in latin 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 32.6 43.2 <NA> a top down structure that normally starts with god at the very top followed by angels <unk> noblemen common people animals and so on 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 43.49 54.4 <NA> this idea was actually based on aristotle 's ontology <unk> which classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories like the ones you see behind me
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 56.25 63.37 <NA> but over time <unk> interestingly enough <unk> this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 63.06 70.57 <NA> in what became known as the porphyrian tree also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 70.74 79.97 <NA> the branching scheme of the tree was in fact such a powerful metaphor for conveying information that it became over time an important communication tool to map
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 79.99 82.4 <NA> <unk> a variety of systems of knowledge <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 82.09 92.48 <NA> we can see trees being used to map morality with the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices as you can see here with these beautiful illustrations from medieval europe <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 92.32 98.48 <NA> we can see trees being used to map consanguinity the various blood ties between people <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 98.62 104.97 <NA> we can also see trees being used to map genealogy perhaps the most famous archetype of the tree diagram
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 105.1 112.44 <NA> i think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees many of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 112.67 120.51 <NA> we can see trees even mapping systems of law <unk> the various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 121.31 129.07 <NA> and finally of course also a very popular scientific metaphor we can see trees being used to map all species known to man
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 130.68 141.34 <NA> and trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor because in many ways they really embody this human desire for order for balance for unity for symmetry 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 141.48 149.99 <NA> however nowadays we are really facing new complex intricate challenges that cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 152.05 160.04 <NA> <unk> and a new metaphor is currently emerging <unk> and it 's currently replacing the tree in visualizing various systems of knowledge 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 159.55 164.84 <NA> it 's really providing us with a new lens to understand the world around us <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 165.04 168.95 <NA> and this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 169.03 176.25 <NA> and we can see this shift from trees into networks in many domains of knowledge <unk> we can see this shift
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 176.07 178.44 <NA> in the way we try to understand the brain
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 180.44 188.37 <NA> <unk> while before we used to think of the brain as a modular centralized organ where a given area was responsible for a set of actions and behaviors <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 188.14 196.12 <NA> the more we know about the brain <unk> the more we think of it as a large music symphony played by hundreds and thousands of instruments <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 196.12 199.9 <NA> this is a beautiful snapshot created by the blue brain project where
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 200.04 209.14 <NA> <unk> you can see ten thousand neurons and thirty million connections <unk> and this is only mapping ten percent of a mammalian neocortex <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 210.3 215.41 <NA> we can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 215.61 221.83 <NA> these are some remarkable trees of knowledge or trees of science by spanish scholar ramon llull 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 221.46 229.97 <NA> and llull was actually the precursor the very first one who created the metaphor of science as a tree a metaphor we use every single day <unk> when we
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 229.93 235.79 <NA> <unk> say biology is a branch of science when we say genetics is a branch of science 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 235.81 241.85 <NA> but perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge at least for me was created for the french encyclopedia by <unk>
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 242.83 252.35 <NA> <unk> in one thousand seven hundred and fifty one this was really the bastion of the french enlightenment <unk> and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents for the encyclopedia <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 251.98 253.23 <NA> and it actually
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 255.07 259.2 <NA> all domains of knowledge as separate branches of a tree 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 259.37 262.47 <NA> but knowledge is much more intricate than this 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 262.34 271.53 <NA> these are two maps of wikipedia showing the inter linkage of articles related to history on the left and mathematics on the right <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 271.52 279.97 <NA> and i think by looking at these maps and other ones that have been created of wikipedia arguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man we can
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 279.9 289.4 <NA> <unk> really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate and interdependent just like a network <unk> we can also see this interesting shift
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 289.19 292.78 <NA> in the way we map social ties between people <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 293.07 299.96 <NA> this is the typical organization chart i 'm assuming many of you have seen a similar chart as well in your own corporations or others <unk>
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 301.84 309.14 <NA> <unk> that normally starts with the ceo at the very top and where you can drill down all the way to the individual workmen on the bottom <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 309.13 316.37 <NA> but humans sometimes are well actually all humans are unique in their own way and sometimes you really don 't
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 315.91 319.61 <NA> play well under this really rigid structure i
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 320.29 329.94 <NA> think the internet is really changing this paradigm quite a lot <unk> this is a fantastic map of online social collaboration between perl developers perl is a famous

ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 337.41 345.39 <NA> and here you can notice that this is a completely decentralized process there 's no leader in this organization <unk> it 's a network
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 345.86 349.96 <NA> we can also see this interesting shift when we
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 350 359.82 <NA> <unk> look at terrorism one of the main challenges of understanding terrorism nowadays is that we are dealing with decentralized independent cells where there 's no leader
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 359.66 361.9 <NA> leading the whole process 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 362.07 371.83 <NA> and here you can actually see how visualization is being used the diagram that you see behind me shows all the terrorists involved in the madrid attack in two thousand and four 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 371.46 379.97 <NA> and what they did here is they actually segmented the network into three different years <unk> represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me and the blue
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 379.9 384.92 <NA> <unk> lines tie together the people that were present in that network year after year 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 384.58 395.93 <NA> so even though there 's no leader per se these people are probably the most influential ones in that organization the ones that know more about the past and the future plans and goals of this particular cell <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 396.7 403.2 <NA> we can also see this shift from trees into networks in the way we classify and organize species
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 405.23 413.91 <NA> <unk> the image on the right is the only illustration that darwin included in the origin of species which darwin called the tree of life 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 413.6 422.49 <NA> there 's actually a letter from darwin to the publisher expanding on the importance of this particular diagram <unk> it was critical for darwin 's theory of evolution <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 422.93 429.58 <NA> but recently scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life is a dense network of bacteria and
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 430.16 435.7 <NA> are actually tying together species that were completely separated before to what scientists are now calling
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 435.39 440.35 <NA> not the tree of life <unk> but the web of life the network of life 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 441.03 449.93 <NA> and finally we can really see this shift <unk> again when we look at ecosystems around our planet no more do we have these simplified predator versus prey
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 450 452.6 <NA> diagrams we have all learned at school 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 452.71 456.05 <NA> this is a much more accurate depiction of an ecosystem <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 455.82 458.94 <NA> this is a diagram created by professor david lavigne <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 458.94 465.98 <NA> mapping close to one hundred species that interact with the codfish off the coast of newfoundland in canada and
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 465.76 472.97 <NA> i think here we can really understand the intricate and interdependent nature of most ecosystems that abound on our planet <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 473.98 474.99 <NA> but even though
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 476.99 489.42 <NA> <unk> metaphor of the network is really already adopting various shapes and forms <unk> and it 's almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy it 's almost becoming the syntax of a new language <unk> and this is one aspect that truly fascinates me <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 489.17 498.69 <NA> and these are actually fifteen different typologies i 've been collecting over time <unk> and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 498.5 500.14 <NA> and here is an example
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 501.3 509.17 <NA> <unk> on the very top band <unk> you have radial convergence a visualization model that has become really popular over the last five years <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 508.68 513.34 <NA> at the top left the very first project is a gene network 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 513.12 521.05 <NA> followed by a network of ip addresses machines servers followed by a network of facebook friends 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 520.77 528.53 <NA> you probably couldn 't find more disparate topics yet they are using the same metaphor the same visual model to map the
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 530.02 538.94 <NA> <unk> own subject <unk> and here are a few more examples of the many i 've been collecting of this growing visual taxonomy of networks <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 539.77 543.56 <NA> but networks are not just a scientific metaphor 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 543.73 550.02 <NA> as designers researchers and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems they are in
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 550.04 556.26 <NA> <unk> many ways influencing traditional art fields like painting and sculpture and influencing many different artists 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 556.25 562.81 <NA> and perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them they 're immensely gorgeous
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 562.42 569.37 <NA> they are really becoming a cultural meme and driving a new art movement <unk> which i 've called networkism 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 570.05 574.66 <NA> and we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways this is just one of many
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 575.46 578.14 <NA> <unk> where you can see this influence from science into art <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 577.94 585.08 <NA> the example on your left side is ip mapping a computer generated map of ip addresses again servers machines <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 585.08 589.94 <NA> and on your right side <unk> you have transient structures and unstable networks 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 589.75 593.62 <NA> by sharon molloy using oil and enamel on canvas <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 593.4 599.29 <NA> and here are a few more paintings by sharon molloy <unk> some gorgeous intricate paintings <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 599.91 602.69 <NA> and here 's another example of that interesting
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 605.1 614.84 <NA> on your left side you have operation smile it is a computer generated map of a social network <unk> and on your right side <unk> you have field four by emma mcnally <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 614.35 617.09 <NA> using only graphite on paper 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 616.93 620.74 <NA> emma mcnally is one of the main leaders of this movement <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 620.74 627.9 <NA> and she creates these striking imaginary landscapes where you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 630.32 639.48 <NA> <unk> but networkism doesn 't happen only in two dimensions <unk> this is perhaps one of my favorite projects of this new movement <unk> and i think the title really says it all
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 639.08 645.6 <NA> it 's called galaxies forming along filaments like droplets along the strands of a spider 's web 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 646.19 650.2 <NA> and i just find this particular project to be immensely powerful it was created
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 651.66 663.73 <NA> <unk> and he occupies these large spaces creates these massive installations using only elastic ropes as you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes the entire network kind of shifts 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 663.73 666.64 <NA> almost like a real organic network would <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 666.93 674.66 <NA> and here 's yet another example of networkism taken to a whole different level <unk> this was created by japanese artist
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 681.19 693.29 <NA> <unk> with this dense network this dense web of elastic ropes and black wool and thread <unk> sometimes including objects as you can see here <unk> sometimes even including people in many of her installations 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 694.9 700.26 <NA> but networks are also not just a new trend <unk> and it 's too easy for us to dismiss it as such
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 700.97 708.07 <NA> <unk> networks really embody notions of decentralization of interconnectedness of interdependence <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 707.83 714.36 <NA> and this new way of thinking is critical for us to solve many of the complex problems we are facing nowadays 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 714.36 718.86 <NA> from decoding the human brain to understanding the vast universe out there 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 719.27 727.08 <NA> on your left side <unk> you have a snapshot of a neural network of a mouse very similar to our own at this particular scale <unk> 
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 727.04 729.97 <NA> and on your right side you have the millennium simulation
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 730.07 737.08 <NA> it was the largest and most realistic simulation of the growth of cosmic structure it was able to recreate

ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 743.58 754.97 <NA> and coincidentally or not i just find this particular comparison between the smallest scale of knowledge the brain and the largest scale of knowledge the universe itself to be really really quite striking and fascinating
ManuelLima_2015 1 ManuelLima_2015 755.26 764.07 <NA> because as bruce mau once said when everything is connected to everything else for better or for worse everything matters thank you so much
