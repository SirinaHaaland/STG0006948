JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 167.95 172.89 <NA> it is that social thing that that i guess attracted

JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 380.71 390.72 <NA> <unk> we tried and tried and we couldn 't really get anything else out of it so a few years went by and then we started the hell creek project and the hell creek project was this massive undertaking to get
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 390.72 394.47 <NA> as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 394.26 400.07 <NA> find some dinosaurs that had more material in them and out in eastern montana
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 400 404.94 <NA> there 's a lot of space a lot of badlands and not very many people and so
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 405.26 409.73 <NA> you can go out there and find a lot of stuff and we did find a lot of stuff we found a lot of
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 409.51 417.09 <NA> tyrannosaurs <unk> but we found one special tyrannosaur <unk> and we called it b rex and b rex was found

JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 446.22 452.6 <NA> we gave samples to mary schweitzer and she was actually able to determine that b rex was a female
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 452.42 454.97 <NA> based on medullary tissue found on the
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 454.99 459.45 <NA> <unk> inside of the bone <unk> medullary tissue is the calcium build up

JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 465.13 475.05 <NA> so here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs <unk> but mary went further she took the bone and she dumped it into acid <unk> now
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 475 481.26 <NA> we all know that bones are fossilized <unk> and so if you dump it into acid there shouldn 't be anything left <unk> 
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 481.1 489.42 <NA> but there was something left <unk> there were blood vessels left <unk> there were flexible clear blood vessels <unk> 
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 489.47 495.57 <NA> and so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosaur it was extraordinary <unk> 
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 495.44 504.49 <NA> but she also found osteocytes which are the cells that laid down the bones and try and try we could not find dna
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 505.35 512.76 <NA> <unk> but she did find evidence of proteins <unk> but we thought maybe well we thought maybe that
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 512.54 518.65 <NA> the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast <unk> 
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 518.65 526.46 <NA> and so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18 wheeler trailer and actually took the laboratory to the field
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 526.24 529.94 <NA> where we could get better samples and we did we got
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 530.11 531.59 <NA> <unk> better material 
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 531.16 535.64 <NA> the cells looked better the vessels looked better 
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 535.18 543.62 <NA> found the protein collagen i mean it was wonderful stuff <unk> but it 's not dinosaur dna <unk> 
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 543.46 545.04 <NA> so
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 544.84 549.84 <NA> we have discovered that dinosaur dna and all dna just breaks down too
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 551.45 559.62 <NA> <unk> going to be able to do what they did in jurassic park we 're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on

JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 581.58 588.23 <NA> avian dinosaurs are our modern birds so we don 't have to make a dinosaur because we already have them
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 607.42 615.8 <NA> <unk> you can call it a dinosaur <unk> but look at the velociraptor the velociraptor is cool the chicken is not 
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 617.47 625.02 <NA> so this is our problem as you can imagine <unk> the chicken is a dinosaur i mean it really
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 626.36 631.5 <NA> <unk> you can 't argue with it because we 're the classifiers and we 've classified it that way

JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 642.68 648.36 <NA> laughter so that 's what i 'm here to tell you about how we are going to fix a chicken
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 648.56 653.98 <NA> <unk> so we have a number of of ways that we actually can
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 655.14 662.17 <NA> <unk> fix the chicken <unk> because evolution works <unk> we actually have some evolutionary tools we

JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 726.3 733.9 <NA> <unk> but there 's another thing there 's what we call atavism activation and atavism activation is basically

JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 764.52 768.83 <NA> actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene

JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 916.75 921.05 <NA> take our chicken <unk> modify it
JackHorner_2011 1 JackHorner_2011 920.95 922.92 <NA> and make the chickenosaurus
