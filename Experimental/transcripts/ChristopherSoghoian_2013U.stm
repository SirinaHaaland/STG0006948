ChristopherSoghoian_2013U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2013U 440.94 448.63 <NA> there 's sort of a big problem with governments going into hacking and that 's that terrorists pedophiles drug dealers

ChristopherSoghoian_2013U 1 ChristopherSoghoian_2013U 468.55 475.14 <NA> so governments around the world have been embracing this technology they 've been embracing hacking as a law enforcement technique
