MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 13.57 16.62 <NA> <unk> years ago i read a newspaper article which said that
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 16.38 17.81 <NA> one day
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 17.64 26.93 <NA> syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of aids the transmission of aids i thought this was unacceptable so i decided to do something about it 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 26.68 29.88 <NA> sadly it 's come true <unk> malaria as we all know
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 29.81 36.64 <NA> <unk> kills approximately one million people a year the reuse of syringes now exceeds that and kills
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 36.43 44.38 <NA> one point three million people a year this young girl and her friend that i met in an orphanage in
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 44.38 52.92 <NA> delhi were hiv positive from a syringe and what was so sad about this particular story was that
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 52.91 54.94 <NA> that once their parents had found
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 54.9 58.57 <NA> <unk> out and don 't forget their parents took them to the doctor
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 58.86 66.4 <NA> the parents threw them out on the street <unk> and hence they ended up in an orphanage and it comes from situations like this where
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 66.17 75.88 <NA> you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners <unk> blindly giving an injection to someone and the injection is so valuable that the people
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 75.87 79.97 <NA> basically trust the doctor being second to god which i 've heard many times
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 79.75 86.15 <NA> <unk> times to do the right thing but in fact they 're not <unk> and you can understand obviously the transmission problem between
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 85.98 89.3 <NA> people in <unk> high virus areas 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 88.84 96.71 <NA> this video we took undercover <unk> which shows you over a half an hour period a tray of medicines of forty two vials <unk> 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 96.71 101.72 <NA> which are being delivered with only two syringes in a public hospital in india 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 101.44 104.82 <NA> and over the course of half an hour not one syringe was
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 104.75 108.84 <NA> <unk> filmed being unwrapped they started with two and they ended with two 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 108.62 116.19 <NA> and you 'll see just now a nurse coming back to the tray which is their sort of modular station and dropping
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 116.06 124.93 <NA> the syringe she 's just used back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again so you can imagine the scale of this problem and in fact in india
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 126.81 129.37 <NA> <unk> of all injections given are unsafe 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 129.36 139.07 <NA> these kids in pakistan don 't go to school they are lucky they already have a job and that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals wash them 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 139.02 151.22 <NA> <unk> and in the course of this obviously picking them up they injure themselves <unk> and then they repackage them and sell them out on markets for literally more money than a sterile syringe in the first place which is quite bizarre 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 154.99 159.11 <NA> <unk> a syringe and pricked his finger i don 't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 158.62 160.19 <NA> and
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 159.7 170.54 <NA> immediately whipped out a box of matches <unk> lit one and burned the blood off the end of his finger giving me full assurance that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of hiv 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 170.95 179.97 <NA> in china recycling is a major issue <unk> and they are collected en mass you can see the scale of it here and sorted out by hand
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 180.14 184.45 <NA> <unk> back into the right sizes <unk> and then put back out on the street <unk> 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 184.21 192.06 <NA> so recycling and reuse are the major issues here but there was one interesting anecdote that i found in indonesia 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 192.06 200.14 <NA> in all schools in indonesia there is usually a toy seller in the playground the toy seller in this case had syringes which they usually
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 200.31 203.53 <NA> <unk> next door to the diggers which is obviously what you would expect 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 203.53 212.9 <NA> and they use them in the breaks for water pistols they squirt them at each other which is lovely and innocent and they are having great fun but they also drink from them while they 're
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 212.45 221.14 <NA> in their breaks because it 's hot <unk> and they squirt the water into their mouths and these are used with traces of blood visible 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 221.46 227.56 <NA> so we need a better product and we need better information and i think if i can just borrow this camera 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 228.18 229.97 <NA> i was going to show you my invention
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 229.66 239.45 <NA> <unk> invention which i came up with <unk> so it 's a normal looking syringe you load it up in the normal way this is made on existing
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 239.02 242.2 <NA> equipment in fourteen factories that we license 
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 242.2 249.93 <NA> you give the injection and then put it down <unk> if someone then tries to reuse it it locks and breaks afterwards it 's very very simple
MarcKoska_2009G 1 MarcKoska_2009G 259.85 262.78 <NA> <unk> and that will stop reusing a syringe twenty or thirty times
