MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 463.09 466.11 <NA> you show subjects the fish is degraded

MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 470.56 479.91 <NA> a similar experiment was done by another [ swiss ] psychologist named peter brugger <unk> who found significantly more meaningful patterns were perceived on the right
MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 479.84 483.07 <NA> <unk> hemisphere via the left visual field than the left hemisphere 
MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 482.89 488.22 <NA> so if you present subjects the images such that it 's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left 
MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 488.22 500.01 <NA> then they 're more likely to see patterns than if you put it on the the left hemisphere our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this patternicity occurs so what we 're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens 
MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 500.09 503.95 <NA> brugger and his colleague christine mohr gave subjects

MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 516.88 521.68 <NA> than those that did not receive the dopamine so dopamine appears to be the drug
MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 521.19 529.61 <NA> associated with patternicity in fact neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior things like paranoia delusions and

MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 538.62 546.59 <NA> are dopamine antagonists <unk> they go away that is you decrease the amount of dopamine and their tendency to see to see
MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 546.19 554.85 <NA> patterns like that decreases on the other hand amphetamines like cocaine are dopamine agonists they increase the amount of dopamine so
MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 554.9 563.09 <NA> <unk> more likely to feel in a euphoric state creativity find more patterns in fact <unk> i saw robin williams recently talk about how he
MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 562.87 573.09 <NA> he thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine when he had that issue than now so perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity dopamine i think changes

MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 591.4 599.99 <NA> too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere every time somebody looks at you you think people are staring at you you think people are talking about you and if you go too far
MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 600.25 610 <NA> <unk> that 's just simply labeled as madness <unk> it 's a distinction perhaps we might make between two nobel laureates richard feynman and john nash one sees
MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 609.78 617.58 <NA> maybe just the right number of patterns to win a nobel prize the other one also but maybe too many patterns and we then call that schizophrenia 
MichaelShermer_2010 1 MichaelShermer_2010 617.58 623.67 <NA> so the signal to noise ratio then presents us with a pattern detection problem and of course you all know exactly
