NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 407.24 415.68 <NA> because i knew something about them i 'd designed a lot of chairs over the years for tractors and trucks
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 415.49 423.9 <NA> and submarines all kinds of things but not office chairs so i started doing that
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 423.89 430 <NA> and i found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 429.69 435.28 <NA> <unk> approach that i used to use on the airplane only this time
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 435.09 441.79 <NA> instead of the product being shaped by the wind it was shaped by the human body
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 442.08 448.99 <NA> so the discipline was as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 449.34 454.88 <NA> for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body

NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 459.79 465.47 <NA> and that 's the way ultimately after some ups and downs
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 465.67 472.46 <NA> i ended up designing the chair i 'm going to show you i should say one more thing when i was doing those

NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 475.42 479.7 <NA> i did everything i conceived the kind of airplane

NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 486.95 489.84 <NA> and that 's the way i work now
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 494.42 499.93 <NA> when i started this chair it was not a preconceived notion design
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 499.93 502.53 <NA> nowadays if you mean it
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 502.16 505 <NA> you don 't start with styling sketches
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 504.66 505.9 <NA> <unk> sketches
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 506.25 511.72 <NA> i started with a lot of loose ideas roughly eight or nine years ago

NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 512.9 519.55 <NA> the loose ideas had something to with what i knew happened with people in the office at
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 519.3 524.17 <NA> work place people who worked and used task seating a
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 523.77 529.21 <NA> great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 528.91 529.91 <NA> and
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 529.93 538.76 <NA> <unk> felt the one thing they don 't need is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 538.57 546.12 <NA> so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 546.12 554.13 <NA> or as mechanistically possible so that they didn 't have to fuss with it so my idea was that
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 554.9 560.37 <NA> <unk> instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls that you would sit on the chair
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 560.12 567.66 <NA> and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 567.56 568.9 <NA> now that
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 568.69 570.36 <NA> may not mean a lot
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 570.36 579.97 <NA> to some of you but you know most good chairs do recline because it 's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better

NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 583.23 586.3 <NA> so that if you sit down

NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 593.25 595.72 <NA> deals with your weight

NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 607.48 611.21 <NA> i 'll tell you right up front this is a trade off
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 611.35 613.85 <NA> there are drawbacks to this
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 613.99 618.47 <NA> one is you can 't accommodate everybody

NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 629.12 634.74 <NA> but the compromise i felt was in my favor because most people
NielsDiffrient_2002a 1 NielsDiffrient_2002a 634.28 639.59 <NA> don 't adjust their chairs they will sit in them forever i had somebody
