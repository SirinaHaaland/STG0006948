PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 306.81 312.47 <NA> i was hearing them using words that i hadn 't actually heard before and i 'd worked with iraqis i 'd worked with
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 312.3 322.49 <NA> jordanians egyptians and suddenly they were using these words and i just thought this is strange and what really gave rise to it was this word observer we were discussing
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 322.49 324.56 <NA> election observers <unk> and
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 331.07 339.78 <NA> <unk> in a passive sort of sense as in i noticed he was wearing a light blue shirt did i go and check whether the shirt was light blue or not 
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 339.78 342.66 <NA> that is the role of an election observer

PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 365.06 371.18 <NA> 's got that notion of control so i thought three words for one concept this is not good <unk> 
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 371.18 376.12 <NA> and with our colleagues we thought perhaps it 's our role to actually help
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 376.02 379.28 <NA> make sure that the words are understood and actually
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 379.69 384.2 <NA> <unk> create a work of reference that could be used across the arab region <unk> 
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 384.2 391.34 <NA> and that 's what we did so together with these colleagues we launched the arabic lexicon of electoral terminology 
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 390.85 394.22 <NA> and we worked in eight different countries
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 394.15 395.69 <NA> it meant
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 395.26 404.22 <NA> actually defining four hundred and eighty one terms which formed the basis of everything you need to know if you 're going to organize a democratic election
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 405.02 409.5 <NA> <unk> we defined these terms and we worked with the arab colleagues and came to
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 409.01 413.55 <NA> an agreement about what would be the appropriate word to use in arabic <unk> 
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 413.15 421.92 <NA> because the arabic language is very rich <unk> and that 's part of the problem but there are twenty two countries that speak arabic <unk> and
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 422.18 425.08 <NA> they use modern standard
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 425.64 430.99 <NA> <unk> which is the arabic that is used across the whole region in newspapers and broadcasts 
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 430.53 442.58 <NA> but of course then from one country to the next in day to day language and use it varies dialect colloquialisms etc <unk> so that was another added layer of complication so
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 442.22 446.63 <NA> in one sense you had the problem that language wasn 't fully
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 446.63 454.97 <NA> ripe if you like neologisms were coming up new expressions and so we defined all these terms and then we had eight correspondents in
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 454.96 458.13 <NA> <unk> in the in the region <unk> we submitted the draft to them 
PhilippaNeave_2016S 1 PhilippaNeave_2016S 457.89 468.41 <NA> they responded back to us yes we understand the definition we agree with it but this is what we say in our country because we were not <unk>
