DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 12.97 21.38 <NA> <unk> i collaborate with bacteria and i 'm about to show you some stop motion footage that i made recently where you 'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 21.38 29.7 <NA> over the period of an hour <unk> so what you 're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing and as they do so they create an electrical charge
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 30.11 39.24 <NA> <unk> and this attracts metals from their local environment <unk> and these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria 
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 39.26 46.14 <NA> one of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water 
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 45.68 52.11 <NA> and the desalination process is one where we take out salts we can use it for drinking and agriculture
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 52.07 54.49 <NA> <unk> removing the salts from water
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 54.84 62.71 <NA> <unk> seawater through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe <unk> 
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 62.4 70.96 <NA> so seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane filtration technology <unk> we take the water from the sea and we apply pressure
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 70.59 75.05 <NA> and this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane this
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 78.49 86.6 <NA> <unk> but we 're also left with a concentrated salt solution or brine <unk> but the process is very expensive and it 's cost prohibitive for many countries around the globe <unk> 
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 86.6 88.83 <NA> and also the brine that 's produced
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 88.38 96.11 <NA> is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea and this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it 's pumped back out into 
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 96.01 101.49 <NA> so i work in singapore at the moment and this is a place that 's really a leading place for
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 101.28 104.97 <NA> desalination technology <unk> and singapore proposes by two thousand and
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 104.93 110.34 <NA> <unk> sixty to produce [ nine hundred ] million liters per day of desalinated water <unk> 
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 109.85 115.38 <NA> but this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine <unk> 
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 115.38 127.8 <NA> and this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play <unk> so what we 're doing at the moment is we 're accumulating metals like calcium potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine <unk> 
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 127.55 129.94 <NA> and this in terms of magnesium
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 130.01 135.34 <NA> and the amount of water that i just mentioned <unk> equates to a $ four point five billion
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 135.21 145.24 <NA> mining industry for singapore a place that doesn 't have any natural resources <unk> so i 'd like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn 't existed before <unk> 
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 145.24 149.5 <NA> imagine a mining industry that doesn 't mean defiling the earth
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 149.22 154.97 <NA> imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 155.31 163.52 <NA> and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine <unk> and what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube 
DamianPalin_2012U 1 DamianPalin_2012U 163.15 167.13 <NA> a mining industry that is in harmony with nature <unk> thank you
