LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 877.49 879.94 <NA> so we need to find smarter
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 881.96 888.64 <NA> innovative solutions to these problems if we 're going to start to live sustainably within this world <unk> 
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 888.51 899.17 <NA> so imagine if when you bought your mobile phone your new one because you replaced your old one after fifteen to eighteen months is the average time that people replace their phones by the way
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 898.71 904.97 <NA> so if we 're going to keep this kind of expedient mobile phone replacing then we should be looking at closing
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 905.02 910.04 <NA> <unk> the loop on these systems <unk> the people who produce these phones <unk> and some of which i 'm sure are in the room right now <unk> 
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 909.81 920.09 <NA> could potentially look at doing what we call closed loop systems or product system services <unk> so identifying that there is a market demand and that market demand 's not going to go anywhere <unk> so you design the product <unk>
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 920.04 928.82 <NA> to solve the problem design for disassembly design for light weighting we heard some some of those kinds of strategies being used in the tesla motors car today 
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 930.08 935.05 <NA> <unk> are not hard <unk> but understanding the system and then looking for viable
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 936.25 941.23 <NA> consumer demand alternatives is how we can start radically altering
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 940.99 947.37 <NA> the sustainability agenda because i hate to break it to you all consumption is the biggest problem
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 947.18 951.42 <NA> <unk> but design is one of the best solutions 
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 952.37 954.55 <NA> these kinds of products are everywhere
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 955.11 963.16 <NA> <unk> by identifying alternative ways of doing things we can actually start to innovate <unk> and i say actually start to innovate i 'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 962.67 969.94 <NA> <unk> but in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter as a criteria for fueling
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 969.96 975.29 <NA> systems based solutions <unk> because as i 've just demonstrated with these simple products
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 975.43 982.46 <NA> <unk> they 're participating in these major problems <unk> so we need to look across the entire life of the things that we do 
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 982.09 987.15 <NA> if you just had paper or plastic obviously reusable is far more beneficial
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 986.91 988.43 <NA> then
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 988 999.56 <NA> the paper is worse and the paper is worse because it weighs four to ten times more than the plastic and when we actually compare from a life cycle perspective a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper 
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 999.56 1004.94 <NA> the paper is far better <unk> but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag to carry your groceries home
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1004.9 1005.91 <NA> <unk> is not
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1005.52 1010.89 <NA> done with a kilo of each material it 's done with a very small amount of plastic and quite a lot more paper 
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1010.89 1017.82 <NA> because functionality defines environmental impact and i said earlier that the designers always ask me for the eco materials i say
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1017.58 1025.11 <NA> <unk> there 's only a few materials that you should completely avoid the rest of them it 's all about application <unk> and at the end of the day <unk> everything we design and produce in the economy or buy
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1025.04 1032.07 <NA> <unk> as consumers is done so for function we want something therefore we buy it so breaking things back down and delivering
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1031.94 1036.46 <NA> smartly <unk> elegantly <unk> sophisticated solutions
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1036.28 1045.21 <NA> that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing everything all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life 
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1044.78 1054.76 <NA> we can start to actually find really innovative solutions <unk> and i 'll just leave you with one very quick thing that a designer said to me recently who i work with a senior designer i said how come you 're not doing
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1054.69 1055.99 <NA> <unk> sustainability
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1055.71 1062.92 <NA> i know you know this and he said well <unk> recently i pitched a sustainability project to a client and turned and he said to me '
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1062.55 1070.09 <NA> i know it 's going to cost less <unk> i know it 's going to sell more but we 're not pioneers because pioneers have arrows in their backs ' 
LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1 LeylaAcaroglu_2013 1071.07 1076.73 <NA> i think we 've got a roomful of pioneers and i hope there are far more pioneers out there because we need to solve these problems thank you
