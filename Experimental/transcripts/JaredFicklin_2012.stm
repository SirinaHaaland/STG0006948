JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 12.67 14.13 <NA> <unk> my passions
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 13.92 16.2 <NA> are music technology
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 15.99 18.05 <NA> and making things 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 17.98 26.45 <NA> and it 's the combination of these things that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization <unk> and on occasion has led me to play with fire 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 26.62 29.97 <NA> this is a rubens ' tube it 's one of many i 've made over the years and i have
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 29.93 39 <NA> <unk> one here tonight it 's about an 8 foot long tube of metal it 's got a hundred or so holes on top on that side is the speaker and here is some lab tubing and it 's connected to this tank
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 38.66 42.3 <NA> of propane <unk> so 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 42.59 45.3 <NA> let 's fire it up and see what it does <unk> 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 64.92 68.68 <NA> <unk> it 's okay to applaud the laws of physics but essentially what 's happening here
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 70.32 78.65 <NA> is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules is influencing the combustion properties of propane creating a visible waveform <unk> 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 78.65 79.88 <NA> and we can see the alternating
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 79.81 88.52 <NA> <unk> regions of compression and rarefaction that we call frequency and the height is showing us amplitude so let 's change the frequency of the sound and watch what happens to the fire <unk>
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 97.45 101.42 <NA> so every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 100.99 104.97 <NA> and that emergent sine curve of fire so let 's turn that off we 're indoors
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 105.16 107.22 <NA> 're indoors thank you i
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 109.7 112.23 <NA> also have with me a flame table it
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 112.23 119.44 <NA> 's very similar to a rubens ' tube and it 's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sound such as eigenmodes so let 's fire it up
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 119.25 120.61 <NA> and see what it does
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 130.83 143.72 <NA> <unk> while the table comes up to pressure let me note here that the sound is not traveling in perfect lines <unk> it 's actually traveling in all directions and the rubens ' tube 's a little like bisecting those waves with a line and the flame table 's a little like bisecting those waves with a plane <unk> 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 143.72 149.9 <NA> and it can show a little more subtle complexity <unk> which is why i like to use it to watch geoff farina play guitar
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 154.99 156.54 <NA> <unk> one
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 197.45 200.38 <NA> <unk> you watch closely you may have seen some of the eigenmodes
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 200.37 204.01 <NA> <unk> but also you may have seen that jazz music is better with fire 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 205.14 210.1 <NA> actually a lot of things are better with fire in my world but the fire 's just a foundation it
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 209.9 220.18 <NA> shows very well that eyes can hear and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound <unk>
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 220.13 229.97 <NA> such as the removal of time so here i 'm using a rendering algorithm to paint the frequencies of the song smells like teen spirit in a way that the eyes can take them in as a single
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 229.9 238.77 <NA> <unk> visual impression <unk> and the technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition so if i show you another song off this album and another 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 238.77 246.98 <NA> your eyes will easily pick out the use of repetition by the band nirvana and in the frequency distribution the colors you can see the <unk>
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 248.05 249.72 <NA> <unk> sound that they are famous for
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 250.88 261.27 <NA> <unk> here is the entire album as a single visual impression and i think this impression is pretty powerful at least it 's powerful enough that if i show you these four songs <unk> and i remind you that this is smells like teen spirit <unk>
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 261.22 267.58 <NA> you can probably correctly guess without listening to any music at all that the song a die hard nirvana fan would enjoy is this song i
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 279.75 287.98 <NA> <unk> looks all right now for some more sound data this is data from a skate park <unk> and this is mabel davis skate park
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 287.55 294.79 <NA> in austin <unk> texas and the sounds you 're hearing came from eight microphones attached to obstacles around the park and
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 294.63 298.78 <NA> it sounds like chaos but actually all the tricks start with a very distinct
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 298.78 304.73 <NA> slap but successful tricks end with a pop <unk> whereas unsuccessful tricks more of a scratch and a tumble
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 304.84 308.3 <NA> and tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 308.3 315.66 <NA> and voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park so if we were to render these sounds visually we might end up with something like this 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 315.44 324.72 <NA> this is all forty minutes of the recording <unk> and right away the algorithm tells us a lot more tricks are missed than are made and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely to produce a
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 325.67 332.19 <NA> <unk> and if you look really closely we can tease out traffic patterns you see the skaters often trick in this direction 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 332 339.64 <NA> the obstacles are easier <unk> and in the middle of the recording the mics pick this up but later in the recording <unk> this kid shows up 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 339.4 352.51 <NA> and he starts using a line at the top of the park to do some very advanced tricks on something called the tall rail <unk> and it 's fascinating at this moment in time <unk> all the rest of the skaters turn their lines ninety degrees to stay out of his way 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 352.51 354.79 <NA> you see there 's a subtle etiquette in the skate park
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 354.93 358 <NA> <unk> led by key influencers and they tend to be the kids
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 357.96 362.68 <NA> who can do the best tricks or wear red pants and on this day the mics picked that up 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 362.37 372.82 <NA> all right from skate physics to theoretical physics i 'm a big fan of stephen hawking <unk> and i wanted to use all eight hours of his cambridge lecture series to create an homage now in this series <unk>
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 372.72 378.83 <NA> <unk> he 's speaking with the aid of a computer which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences fairly easy
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 380.02 386.28 <NA> <unk> a steering algorithm it listens to the lecture and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x axis 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 386.1 390.81 <NA> and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y axis
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 390.81 400.5 <NA> and these trend lines you can see there 's more questions than answers in the laws of physics and when we reach the end of a sentence we place a star at that location <unk> so
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 400.28 404.76 <NA> there 's a lot of sentences so a lot of stars and after rendering all of the audio this is what we get
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 405.56 408.24 <NA> this is stephen hawking 's universe 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 413.6 414.64 <NA> it 's
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 414.46 419.67 <NA> all eight hours of the cambridge lecture series taken in as a single visual impression <unk> 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 419.21 426.61 <NA> and i really like this image but a lot of people think it 's fake <unk> so i made a more interactive version <unk> and the way i did that
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 426.45 428.43 <NA> is i used
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 428.33 429.91 <NA> their position in
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 429.84 435.79 <NA> <unk> time in the lecture to place these stars into 3d space and with some custom software and a kinect 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 435.39 441.88 <NA> i can walk right into the lecture i 'm going to wave through the kinect here and take control and now i 'm going to reach out
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 442.53 449.96 <NA> and i 'm going to touch a star and when i do it will play the sentence that generated that star stephen hawking there is one and
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 461.8 469.73 <NA> <unk> 's a really fun way to explore the lecture and i hope a fitting homage <unk> all right <unk> let me close with a work in progress 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 469.72 475.17 <NA> i think after thirty years the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 475.58 481.32 <NA> <unk> all seen a lot of tedtalks online so let 's watch one now with the sound turned off
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 480.86 483.36 <NA> and the closed captioning turned on 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 483.83 491.97 <NA> there 's no closed captioning for the ted theme song and we 're missing it but if you 've watched enough of these you hear it in your mind 's ear <unk> and then applause starts it
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 492.11 499.93 <NA> usually begins here and it grows and then it falls <unk> sometimes you get a little star applause and then i think even bill gates takes a nervous breath and
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 504.03 512.41 <NA> <unk> let 's watch this clip again this time i 'm not going to talk at all there 's still going to be no audio but what i am going to do is i 'm going to render the sound
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 512.01 518.18 <NA> visually in real time at the bottom of the screen <unk> so watch closely and see what your eyes can hear
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 540.13 550.11 <NA> <unk> this is fairly amazing to me even on the first view your eyes will successfully pick out patterns <unk> but on repeated views your brain actually gets better
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 550.04 557.25 <NA> <unk> at turning these patterns into information you can get the tone and the timbre and the pace of the speech things that you can 't get out of closed captioning 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 556.82 560.86 <NA> that famous scene in horror movies where someone is walking up
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 560.7 562.2 <NA> from behind
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 561.77 563.97 <NA> is something you can see and
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 563.97 574.96 <NA> i believe this information would be something that is useful at times when the audio is turned off or not heard at all and i speculate that deaf audiences might actually even be better at seeing sound than hearing audiences 
JaredFicklin_2012 1 JaredFicklin_2012 575 578.09 <NA> i don 't know it 's a theory right now actually it 's all just an idea
