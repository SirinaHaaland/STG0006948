SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 22.24 28.38 <NA> <unk> don 't agree with this i think we have a situation here <unk> because if you think about it one thousand ted talks <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 29.99 31.68 <NA> <unk> ideas worth spreading <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 31.48 35.25 <NA> how on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 35.05 44.41 <NA> even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand ted videos it would actually currently take you over two hundred and fifty hours to do so 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 44.41 49.81 <NA> and i did a little calculation of this the damage to the economy for each one who does this is around
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 52.86 63.16 <NA> <unk> having seen this danger to the economy i thought we need to find a solution to this problem <unk> here 's my approach to it all if you look at the current situation you have a thousand ted talks <unk>
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 63.11 75.05 <NA> <unk> each of those ted talks has an average length of about two thousand three hundred words <unk> now take this together and you end up with two point three million words of ted talks which is about three bibles worth of
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 76.45 86.84 <NA> <unk> obvious question here is does a ted talk really need two thousand three hundred words <unk> isn 't there something shorter i mean if you have an idea worth spreading <unk> surely you can put it into something shorter <unk>
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 86.79 94.85 <NA> than two thousand three hundred words the only question is <unk> how short can you get what 's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a ted talk <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 104.87 108.6 <NA> <unk> worn were the best novel he had ever written <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 108.11 118.39 <NA> and i also encountered a project called six word memoirs where people were asked take your whole life and please sum this up into six words such as these here found true love married someone else or 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 118.15 122.01 <NA> living in existential vacuum it sucks i actually like that one
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 122.01 128.65 <NA> <unk> so if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 128.41 129.97 <NA> <unk> you don 't need more
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 129.96 135.13 <NA> <unk> than six words for a ted talk we could have been done by lunch here laughter
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 136.02 148.36 <NA> and if you did this for all thousand ted talks you would get from two point three million words down to six thousand so i thought this was quite worthwhile so i started asking all my friends please take your favorite ted talk and put that into six words <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 148.36 154.82 <NA> so here are some of the results that i received i think they 're quite nice for example dan pink 's talk on motivation which was pretty good if you haven 't seen it
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 154.99 168.05 <NA> <unk> drop carrot drop stick bring meaning it 's what he 's basically talking about in those one hundred and eighty five minutes <unk> or some even included references to the speakers such as nathan myhrvold 's speaking style or the one of tim ferriss which might be considered a bit strenuous at times 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 167.8 179.97 <NA> the challenge here is if i try to systematically do this i would probably end up with a lot of summaries but not with many friends in the end so i had to find a different method <unk> preferably involving total strangers and
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 180.07 189.99 <NA> luckily there 's a website for that called mechanical turk which is a website where you can post tasks that you don 't want to do yourself <unk> such as please summarize this text for me in six words 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 189.99 193.93 <NA> and i didn 't allow any low cost countries to work on this but
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 193.7 199.9 <NA> i found out i could get a six word summary for just ten cents which i think is a pretty good price even then <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 200.49 210.64 <NA> <unk> 's not possible to summarize each ted talk individually because if you do the math you have a thousand ted talks you pay ten cents each you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks because some of <unk>
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 210.54 220.87 <NA> <unk> them will probably be or are really bad <unk> so i would end up paying hundreds of dollars <unk> so i thought of a different way by thinking well the talks revolve around certain <unk>
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 220.77 229.97 <NA> <unk> themes so what if i don 't let people summarize individual ted talks to six words <unk> but give them ten ted talks at the same time and say please do a six word summary for that one
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 230.29 234.38 <NA> i would cut my costs by ninety percent so for $
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 233.92 248.48 <NA> sixty i could summarize a thousand ted talks into just six hundred summaries <unk> which would actually be quite nice some of you might actually right now be thinking it 's downright crazy to have ten ted talks summarized into just six words <unk> but it 's actually not 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 248.48 249.93 <NA> because there 's an example by
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 250.1 260.25 <NA> <unk> statistics professor hans rosling i guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks he 's got eight talks online and those can basically be summed up into just four words because that 's all he 's basically <unk>
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 260.15 274.2 <NA> <unk> showing us our intuition is really bad he always proves us wrong <unk> so people on the internet some didn 't do so well <unk> and when i asked them to summarize the ten ted talks at the same time some took the easy route out they just had some general comment
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 276.03 282.43 <NA> <unk> there were others and i found this quite cheeky they used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if i 'd been too much on google lately 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 282.96 293.38 <NA> and finally also i never understood this <unk> some people really came up with their own version of the truth <unk> i don 't know any ted talk that contains this but 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 293.01 304.97 <NA> oh well in the end however and this is really amazing for each of of those ten ted talk clusters that i submitted i actually received meaningful summaries here are some of my favorites for example for the ted talks about food someone summed this
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 304.93 313.77 <NA> <unk> up into food shaping body brains and environment which i think is pretty good <unk> or happiness striving toward happiness <unk> = moving toward unhappiness so
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 313.59 319.73 <NA> here i was i had started out with a thousand ted talks and i had six hundred six word summaries for those 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 319.54 325.58 <NA> actually it sounded nice in the beginning but when you look at six hundred summaries it 's quite a lot it 's a huge list so
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 325.54 329.94 <NA> i thought i probably have to take this one step further here and
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 329.93 335.08 <NA> <unk> create summaries of the summaries and this is exactly what i did so i took the six hundred summaries that i had 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 335.08 343.74 <NA> put them into nine groups according to the ratings that the talks had originally received on ted com and asked people to do summaries of those 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 343.25 349.96 <NA> again there were some misunderstandings for example when i had a cluster of all the beautiful talks someone thought i was just trying to find the ultimate
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 354.57 367.16 <NA> <unk> people were able to do it for example all the courageous ted talks people dying or people suffering was also one with easy solutions around or the recipe for the ultimate <unk> jaw dropping ted talk flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer i mean that 's
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 367.16 370.75 <NA> the essence of it all now
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 370.35 379.88 <NA> i had my nine groups but i mean <unk> it 's already quite a reduction but of course once you are that far you 're not really satisfied <unk> i wanted to go all the way all the way
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 379.99 390.5 <NA> <unk> the distillery starting out with a thousand ted talks <unk> i wanted to have a thousand ted talks summarized into just six words which would be a ninety nine point nine nine nine seven percent reduction in content <unk> and
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 390.5 391.83 <NA> i would only pay
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 393.31 400.05 <NA> <unk> so stay even below $ one hundred for it <unk> so i had fifty overall summaries done this time i paid twenty five cents because
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 400.04 402.96 <NA> <unk> i thought the task was a bit harder and
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 402.83 409.53 <NA> unfortunately <unk> when i first received the answers and here you 'll see six of the answers i was a bit disappointed because i think you 'll agree 
SebastianWernicke_2011X 1 SebastianWernicke_2011X 409.53 415.15 <NA> they all summarize some aspect of ted but to me they felt felt a bit bland or they just had a
