BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 50.48 54.97 <NA> when they fly into our bedroom at night they prefer to bite my wife
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 55.13 59.03 <NA> but that 's fascinating right <unk> why
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 58.82 66.7 <NA> does she receive more bites than i do <unk> and the answer is smell the smell of her body <unk> 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 66.63 71.03 <NA> and since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 70.79 79.37 <NA> that either attract or repel mosquitos some of us are just more attractive than others so my wife smells nicer than i do
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 80.11 83.12 <NA> <unk> i just stink more than she does
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 83.05 89.78 <NA> <unk> either way mosquitos find us in the dark by sniffing us out they smell us 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 89.32 93.12 <NA> and during my ph d i wanted to know exactly
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 92.79 98.87 <NA> what chemicals from our skin mosquitos used african malarial mosquitos use to track us down at night and there
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 99.22 104.79 <NA> 's a whole range of compounds that they do use and this was not going to be an easy task
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 105.11 109.14 <NA> and therefore we set up various experiments <unk> 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 109.13 116.29 <NA> why did we set up these experiments <unk> because half the world 's population runs the risk of contracting
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 115.93 118.3 <NA> a killer disease like malaria
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 118.12 120.39 <NA> through a simple mosquito bite

BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 147.84 149.96 <NA> now solving this puzzle was not an easy
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 150.22 156.26 <NA> <unk> because we produce hundreds of different chemicals on the skin but we undertook some remarkable experiments
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 155.77 161.02 <NA> that managed us to resolve this puzzle very quickly indeed first we observed
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 161.03 168.48 <NA> that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body <unk> strange so we set up an experiment
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 168.09 170.45 <NA> whereby we put a naked volunteer
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 170.45 179.97 <NA> in a large cage and in that cage we released mosquitos to see where they were biting on the body of that person <unk> and we found some remarkable
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 179.93 183.85 <NA> <unk> differences on the left here you see the bites
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 183.67 192.2 <NA> by the dutch malarial mosquito on this person <unk> they had a very strong preference for biting on the face in contrast the african malarial mosquito
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 192.2 195.37 <NA> had a very strong preference for biting the ankles
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 195.15 200.08 <NA> and feet of this person <unk> and that of course we should have known all along
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 209.37 218.62 <NA> <unk> and so we started focusing on the smell of feet on the smell of human feet until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 218.34 222.55 <NA> that said that cheese smells after feet
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 222.15 229.55 <NA> rather than the reverse think of it and this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment we tried
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 229.99 232.1 <NA> <unk> with a tiny little piece
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 231.61 240.74 <NA> of limburger cheese <unk> which smells badly after feet to attract african malaria mosquitos and you know what it worked 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 240.94 244.41 <NA> in fact <unk> it worked so well
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 243.93 248.85 <NA> that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of limburger cheese
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 248.85 254.73 <NA> that we 're using in tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 255.17 256.59 <NA> <unk> than humans <unk> 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 256.31 260.31 <NA> limburg <unk> be proud of your cheese 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 259.85 263.76 <NA> as it is now used in the fight against malaria 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 269.75 272.73 <NA> that 's the cheese just to show you 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 272.87 274.86 <NA> my second story
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 274.58 279.13 <NA> is remarkable as well <unk> it 's about man 's best friend it 's about dogs
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 279.93 283.9 <NA> <unk> and i will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 284.37 291.08 <NA> one of the best ways of killing mosquitos is not to wait until they fly around like adults
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 290.91 296.33 <NA> and bite people and transmit disease <unk> it 's to kill them when they 're still in the water
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 296.09 304.97 <NA> as larvae <unk> why because they are just like the cia in that pool of water these larvae
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 304.96 311.99 <NA> <unk> are concentrated they 're all together there they are immobile they can 't escape from that water they can 't fly
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 311.98 319.76 <NA> and they 're accessible you can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there right <unk> 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 319.63 321.44 <NA> so
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 321.85 329.22 <NA> the problem that we face with this is that throughout the landscape all these pools of water with the larvae they are scattered all over the place
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 330.08 336.9 <NA> <unk> it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides <unk> 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 336.56 341.97 <NA> and last year we thought very very hard how can we resolve this problem <unk> 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 341.48 350.25 <NA> until we realized that just like us we have a unique smell <unk> that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell <unk> 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 349.97 354.64 <NA> and so we set up another crazy experiment because we collected the smell of these larvae
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 355.02 358.75 <NA> <unk> put it on pieces of cloth <unk> and then did something very remarkable 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 358.47 365.18 <NA> here we have a bar with four holes <unk> and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole ooh that was very quick <unk> 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 364.97 370.56 <NA> and then you see the dog it 's called tweed it 's a border collie he 's examining these holes and now he 's got it already <unk> 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 370.56 379.58 <NA> he 's going back to check the control holes again <unk> but he 's coming back to the first one <unk> and now he 's locking into that smell <unk> which means that now we can use dogs
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 379.87 387.29 <NA> <unk> with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 386.83 394.01 <NA> this lady is ellen van der zweep she 's one of the best dog trainers in the world and she believes that we can do a lot more 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 393.67 397.65 <NA> since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 397.49 404.94 <NA> smell different compared to people that are uninfected she 's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 406.31 418.35 <NA> that means that in a population where malaria has gone down all the way <unk> and there 's few people remaining with parasites that the dogs can find these people we can treat them with anti malarial drugs and give the final blow to malaria <unk> 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 417.89 421.08 <NA> man 's best friend in the fight against malaria 
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 421.55 428.77 <NA> my third story is perhaps even more remarkable <unk> and i should say <unk> has never been shown to the public until today
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 429.75 435.68 <NA> <unk> yeah <unk> it 's a crazy story <unk> but i believe it 's perhaps the best
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 435.5 443.95 <NA> and ultimate revenge against mosquitos ever in fact people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitos
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 443.76 451.13 <NA> <unk> and the question of course is what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitos <unk> and the answer
BartKnols_2012X 1 BartKnols_2012X 450.9 452.53 <NA> i have right here
