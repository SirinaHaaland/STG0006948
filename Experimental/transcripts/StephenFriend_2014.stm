StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 28.31 29.94 <NA> that the father and the

StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 54.99 65.32 <NA> <unk> a seismic shift in our understanding of what goes on what genetic variations are sitting behind various diseases in fact for thousands of <unk>

StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 79.66 87.58 <NA> <unk> time if you ask has that impacted the efficiency how we 've been able to develop drugs the answer is not really 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 87.59 93.8 <NA> if you look at the cost of developing drugs how that 's done it basically hasn 't budged that 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 93.82 95.52 <NA> and so
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 95.28 104.55 <NA> it 's as if we have the power to diagnose yet not the power to fully treat and there are two commonly given reasons for why that happens
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 104.87 106.38 <NA> <unk> one of them is
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 106.07 110.19 <NA> it 's early days we 're just learning the
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 109.99 117.9 <NA> words the fragments the letters in the genetic code we don 't know how to read the sentences we don 't know how to follow the narrative 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 117.86 125.26 <NA> the other reason given is that most of those changes are a loss of function and it 's actually really hard to develop
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 125 127.48 <NA> develop drugs that restore function <unk> 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 127.59 136.72 <NA> but today i want us to step back and ask a more fundamental question and ask what happens if we 're thinking about this maybe in the wrong context 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 136.23 140.33 <NA> we do a lot of studying of those who are sick
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 139.97 145.3 <NA> and building up long lists of altered components 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 145.35 153.2 <NA> but maybe if what we 're trying to do is to develop therapies for prevention maybe what we should be doing
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 153.04 154.7 <NA> is studying those who don 't get sick
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 155.11 159.14 <NA> maybe we should be studying those that are well 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 159.34 167.93 <NA> a vast majority of those people are not necessarily carrying a particular genetic load or risk factor they 're not going to help us 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 167.47 174.99 <NA> there are going to be those individuals who are carrying a potential future risk they 're going to go on to get some symptom that 's not what we 're
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 176.18 184.8 <NA> <unk> asking and looking for is are there a very few set of individuals who are actually walking around with the
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 184.43 195.09 <NA> risk that normally would cause a disease but something in them <unk> something hidden in them is actually protective and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms <unk> 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 194.87 200.02 <NA> if you 're going to do a study like that you can imagine you 'd like to look at lots and lots of people
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 200.16 211.28 <NA> <unk> have to go and have a pretty wide study <unk> and we realized that actually one way to think of this is let us look at adults who are over forty years of age <unk> 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 211.04 221.39 <NA> and let 's make sure that we look at those who were healthy as kids they might have had individuals in their families who had had a childhood disease <unk> but not necessarily <unk> 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 221.34 227.95 <NA> <unk> and let 's go and then screen those to find those who are carrying genes for childhood diseases <unk> 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 229.9 232.7 <NA> <unk> up going uh a little odd <unk> 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 232.39 237.53 <NA> what 's your evidence that this could be feasible i want to give you two examples 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 237.22 249.99 <NA> the first comes from san francisco <unk> it comes from the 1980s and the 1990s and you may know the story where there were individuals who had very high levels of the virus hiv <unk> they went
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 252.05 257.23 <NA> <unk> but there was a very small set of individuals who also had very high levels of hiv <unk> 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 256.99 258.7 <NA> they didn 't get aids <unk> 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 258.46 265.76 <NA> and astute clinicians tracked that down and what they found was they were carrying mutations notice 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 265.76 278.01 <NA> they were carrying mutations from birth that were protective that were protecting them from going on to get aids you may also know that actually a line of therapy has been coming along based on that fact <unk> 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 277.58 279.79 <NA> second example more recent
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 280.05 282.86 <NA> <unk> is elegant work done by helen hobbs 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 282.86 292.1 <NA> who said i 'm going to look at individuals who have very high lipid levels and i 'm going to try to find those people with high lipid levels
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 291.87 300.11 <NA> who don 't go on to get heart disease and again what she found was some of those individuals had mutations that were protective
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 300 305.4 <NA> from birth that kept them even though they had high lipid levels and you can see this is an
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 305.4 310.46 <NA> interesting way of thinking about how you could develop preventive therapies 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 310.6 324.51 <NA> the project that we 're working on is called the resilience project a search for unexpected heroes because what we are interested in doing is saying can we find those rare individuals who might have these hidden protective
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 326.39 333.69 <NA> <unk> in some ways think of it as a decoder ring a sort of resilience decoder ring that we 're going to try to to build <unk> 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 333.23 343.65 <NA> we 've realized that we should do this in a systematic way so we 've said <unk> let 's take every single childhood inherited disease let 's take them all <unk> and let 's pull them back a little bit by those <unk>
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 343.6 350.43 <NA> that are known to have severe symptoms where the parents the child those around them would know that they 'd gotten sick

StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 364.17 376.81 <NA> where are we going to look well we could look locally that makes sense but we began to think maybe we should look all over the world <unk> maybe we should look not just here but in remote places where their might be a distinct
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 376.35 379.76 <NA> genetic context there might be environmental

StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 382.08 385.97 <NA> let 's look at a million individuals 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 385.69 388.55 <NA> now the reason why we think it 's a
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 388.06 403.26 <NA> good time to do that now is in the last couple of years <unk> there 's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost to do this type of analysis this type of data generation to where it actually costs less to do the data generation and analysis
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 403.08 404.88 <NA> than it does to do the sample
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 404.81 414.99 <NA> <unk> processing and the collection the other reason is that in the last five years there have been awesome tools things about network biology systems <unk>
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 414.89 421.68 <NA> <unk> biology that have come up that allow us to think that maybe we could decipher those positive outliers <unk> 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 430.01 434.67 <NA> this is interesting i would be glad to join your effort i would
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 434.67 444.05 <NA> be willing to participate and they didn 't say where 's the mta they didn 't say where is my authorship they didn 't say 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 444.24 450.2 <NA> is this data going to be mine am i going to own it they basically said let 's work on this in an open
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 465.61 474.96 <NA> <unk> at the icahn mount sinai school of medicine in new york and his team locked in that decoder key ring <unk> and we began looking for
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 475.73 477.28 <NA> <unk> because what we realized is 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 477.07 487.41 <NA> maybe we could just go and look at some existing samples to get some sense of feasibility maybe we could take two three percent of the project on and see if it was there and so we started asking <unk>
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 487.31 496.53 <NA> <unk> people such as hakon at the children 's hospital in philadelphia <unk> we asked leif up in finland we talked to anne wojcicki at <unk>
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 497.53 499.9 <NA> and wang jun at bgi <unk> and again
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 505.92 515.94 <NA> <unk> often we 've analyzed them and we would be glad to go into our anonymized samples and see if we could find those that you 're looking for and instead of being twenty thousand or thirty thousand 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 515.95 521.08 <NA> last month we passed one half million samples that we 've already analyzed 
StephenFriend_2014 1 StephenFriend_2014 520.77 522.23 <NA> so you must be going
