LauraRobinson_2014X 1 LauraRobinson_2014X 589.23 594.5 <NA> so here we are i 'm going to illustrate what i think we 've found about climate from those corals in the southern ocean we
LauraRobinson_2014X 1 LauraRobinson_2014X 594.5 600.26 <NA> went up and down sea mountains <unk> we collected little fossil corals <unk> this is my illustration of that 
LauraRobinson_2014X 1 LauraRobinson_2014X 600.02 604.94 <NA> we think back in the glacial from the analysis we 've made in the corals that the deep part of the southern

LauraRobinson_2014X 1 LauraRobinson_2014X 620.76 623.87 <NA> that allows carbon to come out of the deep ocean 
LauraRobinson_2014X 1 LauraRobinson_2014X 623.62 629.97 <NA> and then if we analyze corals closer to the modern day <unk> or indeed if we go down there today anyway and measure
LauraRobinson_2014X 1 LauraRobinson_2014X 630.16 640.17 <NA> the chemistry of the corals we see that we move to a position where carbon can exchange in and out so this is the way we can use fossil corals to help us learn about the environment
LauraRobinson_2014X 1 LauraRobinson_2014X 641.33 647.7 <NA> so i want to leave you with this last slide it 's just a still taken out of that first piece of footage that i showed you <unk>
