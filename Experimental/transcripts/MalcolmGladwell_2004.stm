MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 930.13 937.69 <NA> right what is the great revolution in science of the last ten fifteen years <unk> it is the movement from the search for universals
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 937.51 940.2 <NA> to the understanding of variability <unk> 
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 939.89 949.96 <NA> now in medical science <unk> we don 't want to know necessarily just how cancer works <unk> we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer i guess my cancer different
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 952.74 962.68 <NA> <unk> genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability <unk> what howard moskowitz was doing was saying this same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce 
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 962.55 966.1 <NA> and for that we owe him a great vote of thanks i 'll
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 966.87 969.79 <NA> give you one last illustration of variability <unk> 
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 969.72 976.67 <NA> and that is oh i 'm sorry howard not only believed that but he took it a second step which was to say that
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 976.43 979.97 <NA> when we pursue universal principles in food
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 980.1 989.87 <NA> we aren 't just making an error we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice and the example he used was coffee <unk> and coffee is
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 989.41 997.53 <NA> something he did a lot of work with with nescaf if i were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee a type of coffee a brew
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 997.53 999.99 <NA> that made all of you happy <unk> and then i asked you
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 1000 1005.75 <NA> <unk> rate that coffee <unk> the average score in this room for coffee would be about sixty on a scale of zero to one hundred <unk> 
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 1005.35 1015.91 <NA> if however you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters maybe three or four coffee clusters and i could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters 
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 1015.91 1017.96 <NA> your scores would go from sixty to <unk>
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 1019.51 1022.37 <NA> the difference between coffee
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 1022.37 1029.97 <NA> at sixty and coffee at seventy eight is a difference between coffee that makes you wince and coffee that makes you deliriously
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 1030.07 1038.62 <NA> happy that is the final and i think most beautiful lesson of howard moskowitz that in embracing the diversity
MalcolmGladwell_2004 1 MalcolmGladwell_2004 1038.62 1042.31 <NA> of human beings <unk> we will find a surer way to true happiness
