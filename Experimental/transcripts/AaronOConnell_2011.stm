AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 13.48 18.08 <NA> <unk> this is a representation of your brain <unk> and your brain can be broken into two parts 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 18.08 23.96 <NA> there 's the left half which is the logical side and then the right half <unk> which is the intuitive <unk> 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 23.65 29.76 <NA> and so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere then we can plot our brain <unk> and for
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 29.69 35.64 <NA> <unk> example this would be somebody who 's completely logical this would be someone who 's entirely intuitive <unk> 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 35.66 39 <NA> so where would you put your brain on this scale 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 38.6 50.08 <NA> some of us may have opted for one of these extremes <unk> but i think for most people in the audience your brain is something like this with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time <unk> it 's not like they 're mutually
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 50 53.68 <NA> <unk> exclusive or anything you can be logical and intuitive <unk> 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 53.22 59.64 <NA> and so i consider myself one of these people along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists who
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 59.65 63.5 <NA> need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas <unk> 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 63.32 65.03 <NA> but at the same time we
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 64.64 68.71 <NA> need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 68.25 74.99 <NA> how do we develop this intuition well we like to play with stuff <unk> so we go out and play with it and then we see how it acts <unk> and then we develop
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 75.97 79.14 <NA> <unk> from there and really you do the same thing 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 79.14 87.5 <NA> so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 87.13 90.15 <NA> i mean it can sound weird to think about
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 89.82 97.37 <NA> one thing being in two different places at the same time <unk> but you weren 't born with this notion you developed it 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 96.88 100.02 <NA> and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 100.22 110.35 <NA> <unk> just a toddler and he wasn 't very good at it and he kept falling over <unk> but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson and that 's that large things don 't let you get right past them <unk> 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 110.35 112.74 <NA> and that they stay in one place <unk> 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 112.52 125.11 <NA> and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world <unk> unless you 're a particle physicist it 'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don 't play with car stops they play with these little little weird particles
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 125.43 135.85 <NA> <unk> and when they play with their particles they find they do all sorts of really weird weird things like they can fly right through walls or they can be in two different places at the same time <unk> 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 135.69 142.66 <NA> and so they wrote down all these observations <unk> and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics <unk> 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 142.2 149.78 <NA> and so that 's where physics was at a few years ago you needed quantum mechanics to describe little tiny
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 150.67 156.03 <NA> <unk> but you didn 't need it to describe the the large everyday objects around us 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 156.03 162.63 <NA> this didn 't really sit well with my intuition <unk> and maybe it 's just because i don 't play with particles very often
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 162.39 170.66 <NA> <unk> well i play with them sometimes but not very often <unk> and i 've never seen them <unk> i mean <unk> nobody 's ever seen a particle 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 170.86 179.97 <NA> but it didn 't sit well with my logical side either because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 180.43 184.71 <NA> <unk> then shouldn 't everything just follow quantum mechanics 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 186.23 188.82 <NA> i don 't see any reason why it shouldn 't 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 188.66 200.19 <NA> and so i 'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics <unk> so a few years ago i set off to do just that 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 200.42 201.82 <NA> so
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 201.65 204.64 <NA> i made one this is the first object
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 205.17 207.19 <NA> that you can see
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 206.7 210.46 <NA> that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 210.36 219.89 <NA> so what we 're looking at here is a tiny computer chip <unk> and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle <unk> and that 's this piece of metal i 'm going to be talking about in a minute 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 219.89 224.93 <NA> this is a photograph of of the object and here i 'll zoom in a little bit we 're looking right there in the center <unk>
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 228.82 238.97 <NA> <unk> 're looking at is a little chunk of metal and it 's shaped like a diving board and it 's sticking out over a ledge <unk> and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip i went into a clean room with <unk>
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 238.87 250.04 <NA> <unk> a fresh silicon wafer <unk> and then i just cranked away at all the big machines for about one hundred hours for the last stuff i had to build my own machine to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 254.84 258.31 <NA> <unk> needs a little help to do it here let me give you an analogy you
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 258.31 266.02 <NA> know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator <unk> i mean when i 'm in an elevator all alone i do all sorts of weird things but then other people
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 265.84 268.92 <NA> get on board and i stop doing those things because
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 269.09 272.55 <NA> i don 't want to bother them or frankly <unk> scare them <unk> 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 272.63 279.97 <NA> so quantum mechanics quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way the fellow passengers for
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 279.96 287.86 <NA> <unk> inanimate objects are not just people <unk> but it 's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room <unk> 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 287.46 295.93 <NA> and so we knew if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically we 're going to have to kick out all the other passengers <unk> and so that 's what we did 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 295.47 303.95 <NA> we turned off the lights and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air <unk> and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 304.84 314.99 <NA> <unk> alone in the elevator the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted <unk> and so we measured its motion we found it was moving in really weird ways <unk> instead of just sitting perfectly still <unk>
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 314.94 327.98 <NA> it was vibrating and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this like expanding and contracting bellows and by giving it a gentle nudge we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 329.93 334.26 <NA> <unk> mechanics <unk> so what i 'm telling you here is something truly fantastic 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 333.95 340.76 <NA> what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time <unk> 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 340.77 348.78 <NA> so let 's think about the atoms so in one case all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 348.53 354.91 <NA> at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down now it 's only at precise times
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 354.96 358.2 <NA> <unk> they align the rest of the time they 're delocalized 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 358.21 369.05 <NA> that means that every atom is in two different places at the same time <unk> which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places i think this is really cool 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 371.25 372.52 <NA> really it
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 375.63 379.79 <NA> was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 381.31 390.6 <NA> because check this out the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 390.6 397.52 <NA> so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time <unk> that chunk of metal can be in two different places
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 397.06 399.29 <NA> then why not you i mean
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 399.37 402.32 <NA> this is just my logical side talking <unk> 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 402.82 404.79 <NA> so imagine if you 're in
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 404.75 409.23 <NA> <unk> multiple places at the same time <unk> what would that be like
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 409.46 416.13 <NA> how would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 416.66 420.64 <NA> there 's one more part to the story it 's when we warmed it up and
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 420.41 429.85 <NA> we turned on the lights and looked inside the box we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece <unk> and so i had to develop this new intuition
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 430.05 437.66 <NA> <unk> that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 437.66 442.78 <NA> you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 442.35 445.91 <NA> well that 's not quite right it 's more than that 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 445.91 455.35 <NA> it 's deeper it 's that those connections your connections to all the things around you <unk> literally define who you are 
AaronOConnell_2011 1 AaronOConnell_2011 455.16 459.05 <NA> and that 's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics <unk> thank you
