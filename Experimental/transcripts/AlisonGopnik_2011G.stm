AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 13.75 15.83 <NA> <unk> going on in this baby 's mind <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 15.83 29.43 <NA> if you 'd asked people this thirty years ago <unk> most people including psychologists would have said that this baby was irrational <unk> illogical egocentric that he couldn 't take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 29.9 35.07 <NA> <unk> in the last twenty years developmental science has completely overturned that picture <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 34.64 44.58 <NA> so in some ways we think that this baby 's thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists <unk> let me give you just one example of this 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 44.58 53.76 <NA> one thing that this baby could be thinking about that could be going on in his mind is trying to figure out what 's going on in the mind of that other baby 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 53.3 54.97 <NA> after all one of the things
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 54.96 60.64 <NA> <unk> that 's hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 60.64 72.25 <NA> and maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn 't actually exactly like what we think and feel anyone who 's followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 71.97 79.97 <NA> we wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people now the question
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 80.08 81.98 <NA> <unk> is how could we ask them 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 81.49 92.93 <NA> babies after all can 't talk <unk> and if you ask a three year old to tell you what he thinks what you 'll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 92.47 99.63 <NA> so how do we actually ask them the question well it turns out that the secret was broccoli <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 99.63 104.97 <NA> what we did betty rapacholi who was one of my students and i was actually to give the babies two
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 105.05 118.02 <NA> <unk> bowls of food one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers <unk> now all of the babies even in berkley like the crackers and don 't like the raw broccoli 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 119.27 124.49 <NA> but then what betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 124.49 129.97 <NA> and she would act as if she liked it or she didn 't so half the time she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn 't like
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 129.99 138.7 <NA> <unk> the broccoli just like a baby and any other sane person <unk> but half the time what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go mmmmm 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 138.6 142.81 <NA> broccoli i tasted the broccoli mmmmm 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 142.74 146.32 <NA> and then she would take a little bit of the crackers and she 'd go eww yuck 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 147.69 150.29 <NA> crackers <unk> i tasted
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 153.67 159.45 <NA> <unk> as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted we did this with fifteen and eighteen month old babies 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 159.45 164.04 <NA> and then she would simply put her hand out and say can you give me some 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 163.56 168.32 <NA> so the question is what would the baby give her what they liked or what she liked 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 168.31 179.34 <NA> and the remarkable thing was that eighteen month old babies just barely walking and talking would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers <unk> but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 179.9 187.92 <NA> <unk> on the other hand fifteen month olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli like they couldn 't figure this out 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 187.91 194.31 <NA> but then after they stared for a long time they would just give her the crackers <unk> what they thought everybody must like 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 194.15 204.97 <NA> so there are two really remarkable things about this the first one is that these little eighteen month old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature that we don 't always
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 204.93 211.33 <NA> <unk> want the same thing <unk> and what 's more they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 211.05 225.13 <NA> even more remarkably though the fact that fifteen <unk> month olds didn 't do this suggests that these eighteen month olds had learned this deep profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were fifteen months old 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 224.64 229.94 <NA> so children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought <unk> and this
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 229.9 235.64 <NA> <unk> is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last twenty years that 's actually demonstrated it 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 235.39 244.16 <NA> the question you might ask though is why do children learn so much and how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time i mean 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 243.82 254.85 <NA> after all if you look at babies superficially they seem pretty useless and actually in many ways they 're worse than useless because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 255.11 263.49 <NA> but if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 264.02 275.35 <NA> it turns out that there 's actually an answer if we look across many many different species of animals not just us primates but also including other mammals birds <unk> even
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 275.17 279.97 <NA> marsupials like kangaroos and wombats it turns out that there 's a relationship
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 280.28 290.06 <NA> between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 290.06 300.02 <NA> and sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there on one side is a new caledonian crow and crows and other corvidae <unk> ravens rooks and so
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 300.49 310.49 <NA> <unk> are incredibly smart birds they 're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects and this is a bird on the cover of science who 's learned how to use a tool to get food 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 310.18 320.48 <NA> on the other hand we have our friend the domestic chicken <unk> and chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps <unk> so they 're very <unk>
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 320.43 325.28 <NA> very good at pecking for grain and they 're not much good at doing anything else <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 330.16 334.12 <NA> <unk> they depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 333.91 342.3 <NA> for as long as two years which is a really long time in the life of a bird <unk> whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 341.84 349.6 <NA> so childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of science and the chickens end up in the soup pot 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 349.6 354.88 <NA> there 's something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 354.87 357.65 <NA> <unk> knowledge and learning <unk> well what kind of
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 357.44 359.78 <NA> explanation could we have for this <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 359.78 371.41 <NA> well some animals like the chicken seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well <unk> so they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 371.13 379.94 <NA> other creatures like the crows aren 't very good at doing anything in particular <unk> but they 're extremely good at learning about laws of different environments <unk> and of course
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 379.96 390.2 <NA> <unk> we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows <unk> we have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal we 're smarter we 're more <unk>
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 390.1 397.59 <NA> <unk> flexible we can learn more we survive in more different environments we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 404.95 406.68 <NA> and
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 407.12 413.91 <NA> at least until they 're twenty three we 're still popping those worms into those little open mouths all
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 414.38 426.58 <NA> right why would we see this correlation <unk> well an idea is that that strategy that learning strategy is an extremely powerful great strategy for getting on in the world <unk> but it has one big disadvantage 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 426.58 429.97 <NA> and that one big disadvantage is that until you
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 429.99 440.17 <NA> <unk> actually do all that learning you 're going to be helpless <unk> so you don 't want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself a slingshot or maybe a <unk>
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 440.07 446.08 <NA> <unk> spear might work which would actually be better you want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 454.93 457.68 <NA> <unk> we don 't have to do anything all we have to do is learn 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 457.68 465.38 <NA> and then as adults we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 464.95 472.34 <NA> so one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 472.34 479.88 <NA> so they 're the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas <unk> and we 're production and marketing we
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 479.99 483.48 <NA> <unk> to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 483.31 485.08 <NA> actually put them to use 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 484.87 495.6 <NA> another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups <unk> we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species <unk>
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 495.55 500.11 <NA> kind of like caterpillars and butterflies except that they 're actually the brilliant

AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 507.99 516.56 <NA> if this is true if these babies are designed to learn and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning that 's what they 're for
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 516.08 520.63 <NA> we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 520.26 529.88 <NA> and in fact the baby 's brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet <unk> but real computers are actually getting to be a lot
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 529.84 542.36 <NA> <unk> better <unk> and there 's been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently and it all depends on the ideas of this guy <unk> the reverend thomas bayes who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 542.2 550.41 <NA> and essentially what bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 551.21 553.48 <NA> <unk> the way that scientists find out about the world <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 553.27 560.78 <NA> so what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with they go out and test it against the evidence 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 560.79 566.23 <NA> the evidence makes them change that hypothesis then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 565.81 573.79 <NA> and what bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that and that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 573.79 579.94 <NA> and some ten years ago <unk> i suggested that babies might be doing the same thing <unk> so if
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 579.9 590.06 <NA> <unk> you want to know what 's going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes <unk> i think it actually looks something like this this is reverend bayes 's notebook so i think those babies are actually making complicated
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 590.01 595.3 <NA> <unk> calculations with conditional probabilities that they 're revising to figure out how the world works all
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 600.34 606.8 <NA> <unk> if you ask even grownups about statistics they look extremely stupid how could it be that children are doing statistics 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 606.34 617.12 <NA> so to test this we used a machine that we have called the blicket detector this is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others and using this very simple machine <unk>
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 617.07 624.99 <NA> <unk> my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world <unk> let me mention just one that we
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 625 627.44 <NA> did with tumar kushner my student 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 627.44 636.15 <NA> if i showed you this detector you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 635.69 645.74 <NA> but actually this detector works in a bit of a strange way <unk> because if you wave a block over the top of the detector something you wouldn 't ever think of to begin with 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 645.74 650.08 <NA> the detector will actually activate two out of three times <unk> whereas <unk> if you do
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 650 655.78 <NA> <unk> the likely thing put the block on the detector it will only activate two out of six times
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 655.56 665.56 <NA> <unk> so the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence it looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy <unk> so we did just this <unk>
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 665.51 671.36 <NA> we gave four year olds this pattern of evidence and we just asked them to make it go and sure enough <unk> the four <unk>
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 679.87 683.04 <NA> <unk> these are four year olds they 're just learning how to count <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 683.04 690.23 <NA> but unconsciously they 're doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 689.92 699.89 <NA> and the other interesting thing is that they 're using that evidence to get to an idea get to a hypothesis about the world that seems very unlikely to begin with 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 699.88 704.97 <NA> and in studies we 've just been doing in my lab similar studies we 've show that four <unk> year olds are actually
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 705.07 711.72 <NA> better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 711.44 725.02 <NA> so in these circumstances the children are using statistics to find out about the world <unk> but after all scientists also do experiments <unk> and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments when children do experiments we call it getting into
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 727.53 729.71 <NA> <unk> there 's been a bunch of interesting
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 729.71 741.38 <NA> studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program here 's one from cristine legare 's lab what cristine did was use our blicket detectors <unk> 
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 741.15 745.67 <NA> and what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn

AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 750 754.71 <NA> see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 827.19 829.49 <NA> <unk> now this is his next idea he told the experimenter

AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 887.91 899.87 <NA> well what 's it like to be this kind of creature what 's it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes <unk> well if you go back to those psychologists and
AlisonGopnik_2011G 1 AlisonGopnik_2011G 900.46 911.36 <NA> <unk> a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all <unk> and i think just the opposite is true <unk> i think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults <unk>
