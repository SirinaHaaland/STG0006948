BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 12.76 17.16 <NA> <unk> i 'm really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 17.16 25.05 <NA> about what makes companies succeed the most what factors actually matter the most for startup success <unk> i
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 25 31.21 <NA> i believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 31.21 43.2 <NA> if you take a group of people with the right equity incentives and organize them in a startup you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible you get them to achieve unbelievable things <unk> 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 43.04 47.25 <NA> but if the startup organization is so great why do so many fail 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 46.94 54.58 <NA> that 's what i wanted to find out i wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success and i wanted to try to be systematic about it
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 54.78 60.28 <NA> <unk> avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions i have from so many companies i 've seen over the years 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 59.91 66.8 <NA> i wanted to know this because i 've been starting businesses since i was twelve years old when i sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 66.8 74.87 <NA> to high school <unk> when i made solar energy devices to college when i made loudspeakers and when i graduated from college i started software companies <unk> and twenty years ago <unk> i started
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 76.06 83.57 <NA> <unk> last twenty years we started more than one hundred companies many successes <unk> and many big failures <unk> we learned a lot from those failures <unk> 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 83.26 86.58 <NA> so i tried to look across what factors
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 86.42 94.41 <NA> accounted the most for company success and failure so i looked at these five first the idea <unk> i used to think that the idea was everything
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 94.2 100.08 <NA> i named my company idealab for how much i worship the aha moment when you first come up with the idea <unk> but then over time
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 100.16 110.28 <NA> <unk> i came to think that maybe the team the execution adaptability that mattered even more than the idea <unk> i never thought i 'd be quoting boxer mike tyson on the ted stage
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 109.88 115.5 <NA> <unk> but he once said everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 116 124.99 <NA> laughter and i think that 's so true about business as well <unk> so much about a team 's execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 125.55 131.95 <NA> <unk> the customer is the true reality <unk> and that 's why i came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 131.55 141.97 <NA> then i started looking at the business model <unk> does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues that started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 141.48 148.43 <NA> then i looked at the funding sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding <unk> maybe that 's the most important thing <unk> and then of course the timing 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 148.43 154.97 <NA> is the idea way too early and the world 's not ready for it is it early as in you 're in advance and you have to educate the world is it just right
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 155.13 169.07 <NA> or is it too late and there 's already too many competitors <unk> so i tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies <unk> and i looked across all one hundred idealab companies <unk> and one hundred non idealab companies to try and come up with something scientific about it 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 168.94 173.52 <NA> so first on these idealab companies the top five companies
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 173.21 174.21 <NA> citysearch
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 179.93 186.52 <NA> <unk> bottom z com insider pages mylife desktop factory peoplelink we all had high hopes for <unk> but didn 't succeed 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 186.28 199.62 <NA> so i tried to rank across all of those attributes how i felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions <unk> and then for non idealab companies i looked at wild successes <unk> like airbnb and instagram and uber and youtube and linkedin 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 199.62 200.74 <NA> and some failures
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 204.9 216.73 <NA> <unk> bottom companies had intense funding they even had business models in some cases but they didn 't succeed i tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success and failure across all of these companies <unk> and the results really surprised me 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 216.42 222.17 <NA> the number one thing was timing timing accounted for forty two percent
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 221.98 224.99 <NA> of the difference between success and failure team
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 225 231.26 <NA> <unk> execution came in second <unk> and the idea the differentiability of the idea the uniqueness of the idea that actually came in third 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 230.86 234.85 <NA> now this isn 't absolutely definitive it 's not to say that the idea isn 't important <unk> 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 234.86 241.37 <NA> but it very much surprised me that the idea wasn 't the most important thing sometimes it mattered more when it was actually timed <unk> 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 240.97 249.84 <NA> the last two business model and funding made sense to me actually i think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 250 251.13 <NA> what you 're creating 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 251.13 260.19 <NA> and funding <unk> i think as well <unk> if you 're underfunded at first but you 're gaining traction especially in today 's age it 's very very easy to get intense funding <unk> 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 260.15 263.18 <NA> so now let me give you some specific examples about each of these 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 263.19 275.08 <NA> so take a wild success like airbnb that everybody knows about well that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought no one 's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger of course people proved
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 276 279.58 <NA> <unk> but one of the reasons it succeeded aside from a good business model a good idea 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 279.58 291.23 <NA> great execution is the timing that company came out right during the height of the recession when people really needed extra money <unk> and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger <unk> 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 291.05 303.88 <NA> same thing with uber uber came out incredible company incredible business model great execution too but the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system drivers were looking for extra money it was very very important 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 303.54 304.7 <NA> some of our early
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 305.17 308.19 <NA> <unk> citysearch came out when people needed web pages <unk> goto com 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 308.19 317.3 <NA> which we announced actually at ted in one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight was when companies were looking for cost effective ways to get traffic we thought the idea was so great but actually the timing was probably maybe more important <unk> 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 317.05 325.08 <NA> and then some of our failures <unk> we started a company called z com it was an online entertainment company we were so excited about it we raised enough money we had a great business model
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 325.49 331.42 <NA> <unk> even signed incredibly great hollywood talent to join the company <unk> but broadband penetration was too low in
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 332.59 344.13 <NA> it was too hard to watch video content online you had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff <unk> and the company eventually went out of business in two thousand and three just two years later when the codec problem was solved by adobe flash
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 344 354.46 <NA> and when broadband penetration crossed fifty percent in america <unk> youtube was perfectly timed <unk> great idea <unk> but unbelievable timing in fact youtube didn 't even have a business model when it first started it wasn 't even
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 355.04 358.36 <NA> that that would work out but that was beautifully beautifully timed <unk> 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 358.17 368.41 <NA> so what i would say in summary is execution definitely matters a lot the idea matters a lot but timing might matter even more and the best way to really assess timing <unk>
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 368.31 375.05 <NA> <unk> is to really look at whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them and to be really really honest about it not be in denial
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 375 382.13 <NA> <unk> about any results that you see because if you have something you love you want to push it forward but you have to be very very honest about that factor on timing 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 382.09 386.77 <NA> as i said earlier <unk> i think startups can change the world and make the world a better place <unk> 
BillGross_2015U 1 BillGross_2015U 386.78 396.3 <NA> i hope some of these insights can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio <unk> and thus make something great come to the world that wouldn 't have happened otherwise thank you very much
