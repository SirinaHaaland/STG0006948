GaryLauder_2010 1 GaryLauder_2010 105.74 116.04 <NA> and so the question is what does that cost us that intersection i looked at had about three thousand cars per day in each direction and so that 's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of that 's five cents each <unk> and times three <unk>
GaryLauder_2010 1 GaryLauder_2010 115.94 124.56 <NA> <unk> thousand cars per day that 's $ fifty one thousand per year that 's just the gasoline cost there is also pollution wear on the car and time what 's that time worth well

GaryLauder_2010 1 GaryLauder_2010 140.7 147.58 <NA> over two million dollars for a stop sign in each direction <unk> now 
GaryLauder_2010 1 GaryLauder_2010 147.54 150.05 <NA> if you look at what that adjacent property is
