YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 594.27 599.99 <NA> <unk> did try in the clouds <unk> but you lose orientation completely so i did try
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 617.8 624.99 <NA> <unk> you have not the right altitude <unk> so the next thing i saw was just blue it was the sea <unk> 
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 625 632.7 <NA> i have also an audible altimeter so i i was at my minimum altitude in that vector
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 632.39 634.39 <NA> fast so i
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 634.39 647.17 <NA> pulled that <unk> and then i did open my chute bg so the wings have their own parachute and you have your two parachutes yr exactly there is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons so i can repair it afterward and especially
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 655.19 665.05 <NA> risky stuff indeed people have died trying to do this kind of of thing and you don 't look like a crazy guy you 're a swiss airline pilot so you 're rather a checklist kind of guy <unk> 
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 665.22 666.68 <NA> i assume you have
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 666.52 670.1 <NA> standards yr yeah <unk> i have no checklist for that
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 679.9 682.49 <NA> <unk> know very well <unk> we have a hundred years of
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 682.03 685.61 <NA> experience <unk> and you can
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 685.12 686.88 <NA> adapt really
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 686.67 691.68 <NA> precisely with that i have to adapt to something new that means
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 691.47 692.84 <NA> improvise <unk> 
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 692.84 702.71 <NA> so it 's really a play between these two approaches something that i know very well these principles for example <unk> we have two engines on an airbus 
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 702.31 704.94 <NA> with only one engine you can fly
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 704.84 714.57 <NA> <unk> so plan b <unk> always a plan b in a fighter you have an ejection seat <unk> that 's my ejection seat <unk> so i have the approach of a professional pilot
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 714.57 715.92 <NA> with
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 716.87 723.82 <NA> the respect of a pioneer in front of mother nature bg it 's well said
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 730.62 733.3 <NA> <unk> a roll <unk> and
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 733.62 741.73 <NA> then i stabilize and according to my altitude <unk> i continue on two or three engines it 's sometimes possible it
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 741.87 745.84 <NA> 's quite complicated to explain but according to which
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 745.41 754.76 <NA> regime i was i can continue on two and try to get a nice place to land and then i open my parachute bg so the beginning of the flight is actually you jump off
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 754.96 764.39 <NA> <unk> plane or a helicopter <unk> and you go on a dive and accelerate the engines and then you basically take off <unk> mid air somewhere <unk> and then the landing as we have seen arriving on this
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 764.68 773.72 <NA> side of the channel is through a parachute <unk> so just as a curiosity where did you land when you flew over the grand canyon did
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 773.47 775.08 <NA> you land on the rim
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 775 779.89 <NA> down at the bottom yr it was down on the bottom <unk> and i came back afterward
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 779.89 787.47 <NA> on the sled of the helicopter back <unk> but it was too stony and full of cactus on top bg that 's exactly why i asked the question yr
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 788.93 792.54 <NA> and also the currents are are quite
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 792.59 799.9 <NA> funny there there is big thermal activity big difference in altitude also <unk> so it was it was much
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 800.19 802.25 <NA> <unk> for me to land at the bottom
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 830.02 834.23 <NA> <unk> what 's next for you what 's next for jetman yr first to
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 834.22 839.64 <NA> instruct a younger guy <unk> i want to share it to do formation flights and
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 839.4 844.14 <NA> i plan to start from a cliff like catapulted from a cliff bg so instead of
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 844.14 849.81 <NA> jumping off a plane yes yr yes with the final goal to take off <unk> but with initial speed
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 850.88 859.23 <NA> <unk> i go step by step it seems a little bit crazy <unk> but it 's not it 's possible to start already now it 's just too dangerous <unk>
YvesRossy_2011G 1 YvesRossy_2011G 862.79 869.86 <NA> the increasing technology <unk> better technology it will be safe <unk> and i hope it will be for everybody
