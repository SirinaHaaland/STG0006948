JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 12.76 17.24 <NA> <unk> i want you guys to imagine that you 're a soldier running through the battlefield <unk> 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 16.78 26.51 <NA> now you 're shot in the leg with a bullet <unk> which severs your femoral artery now this bleed is extremely traumatic and can kill you in less than three minutes <unk> 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 26.51 29.97 <NA> unfortunately by the time that a medic actually gets to you
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 30.01 37.83 <NA> what the medic has on his or her belt can take five minutes or more with the application of pressure to stop that type of bleed 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 37.6 47.94 <NA> now this problem is not only a huge problem for the military <unk> but it 's also a huge problem that 's epidemic throughout the entire medical field which is how do we actually look <unk>
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 47.84 52.32 <NA> <unk> at wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body <unk> 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 54.9 57.07 <NA> <unk> years is to develop
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 56.58 66.4 <NA> smart biomaterials <unk> which are actually materials that will work with the body helping it to heal and helping it to allow the wounds to heal normally <unk> 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 66.6 72.98 <NA> so now <unk> before we do this we have to take a much closer look at actually how does the body work
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 72.77 74.99 <NA> so now everybody here knows that the body is
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 75 81.54 <NA> <unk> made up of cells so the cell is the most basic unit of life but not many people know what else 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 81.54 92.13 <NA> but it actually turns out that your cells sit in this mesh of complicated fibers <unk> proteins and sugars known as the extracellular matrix <unk> so now the ecm
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 91.9 104.94 <NA> is actually this mesh that holds the cells in place provides structure for your tissues but it also gives the cells a home it allows them to feel what they 're doing where they are and tells them how to act and how to behave
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 105.38 115.08 <NA> and it actually turns out that the extracellular matrix is different from every single part of the body <unk> so the ecm in my skin is different than the ecm in my liver <unk> 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 115.08 126.15 <NA> and the ecm in different parts of the same organ actually vary <unk> so it 's very difficult to be able to have a product that will react to the local extracellular matrix <unk> which is exactly what we 're trying to do
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 125.99 129.97 <NA> so now <unk> for example think of the rainforest you have the canopy
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 130.13 136.78 <NA> you have the understory <unk> and you have the forest floor now <unk> all of these parts of the forest are made up of different plants <unk> 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 136.58 144.4 <NA> and different animals call them home <unk> so just like that the extracellular matrix is incredibly diverse in three dimensions 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 144.4 154.34 <NA> on top of that the extracellular matrix is responsible for all wound healing <unk> so if you imagine cutting the body <unk> you actually have to rebuild this very complex
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 155.13 161.81 <NA> in order to get it to form again <unk> and a scar in fact is actually poorly formed extracellular matrix <unk> 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 161.74 169.02 <NA> so now behind me is an animation of the extracellular matrix <unk> so as you see your cells sit in this complicated mesh
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 168.69 173.24 <NA> and as you move throughout the tissue the extracellular matrix changes <unk> 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 173.24 179.73 <NA> so now every other piece of technology on the market can only manage a two dimensional approximation of
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 179.75 184.31 <NA> <unk> extracellular matrix <unk> which means that it doesn 't fit in with the tissue itself <unk> 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 184.15 194.43 <NA> so when i was a freshman at nyu what i discovered was you could actually take small pieces of <unk> plant derived polymers and reassemble them onto the wound so if you have <unk>
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 194.33 200.05 <NA> <unk> a bleeding wound like the one behind me you can actually put our material onto this and just like lego
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 200.61 210.32 <NA> <unk> it 'll reassemble into the local tissue so that means if you put it onto liver <unk> it turns into something that looks like liver <unk> and if you put it onto skin it turns into something that looks just like skin
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 210.32 218.74 <NA> so when you put the gel on it actually reassembles into this local tissue <unk> so now this has a whole bunch of applications
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 218.55 227.83 <NA> but basically the idea is wherever you put this product you 're able to reassemble into it immediately now this is a simulated arterial bleed blood warning
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 227.46 229.52 <NA> at twice human artery pressure
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 230.14 237.74 <NA> <unk> so now this type of bleed is incredibly traumatic and like i said before would actually take five minutes or more with pressure to be able to stop 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 237.25 249.33 <NA> now in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself our material is able to stop that bleed and it 's because it actually goes on and works with the body to heal so it reassembles into this piece of meat 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 249.33 254.94 <NA> and then the blood actually recognizes that that that 's happening and produces fibrin
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 255.01 260.7 <NA> producing a very fast clot in less than ten seconds <unk> so now this technology thank you applause
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 268.31 275.02 <NA> so now this technology <unk> by january will be in the hands of veterinarians and we 're working very diligently to try to get it into the hands of
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 275.25 277.06 <NA> <unk> hopefully within the next year
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 277.08 284.26 <NA> but really <unk> once again i want you guys to imagine that you are a soldier running through a battlefield now you get hit in the leg with a bullet <unk> 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 284.22 293.83 <NA> and instead of bleeding out in three minutes you pull a small pack of gel out of your belt and with the press of a button you 're able to stop your own bleed and you 're on your way to recovery 
JoeLandolina_2014U 1 JoeLandolina_2014U 293.4 294.74 <NA> thank you very much
