MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 13.3 20.24 <NA> <unk> i 'm here to show you how something you can 't see can be so much fun to look at you 're about to experience
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 19.87 29.61 <NA> a new <unk> available and exciting technology that 's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives what i have here is a cinder block
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 29.93 38.55 <NA> <unk> that we 've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material <unk> it 's called ultra ever dry <unk> and
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 38.38 42.84 <NA> when you apply it to any material it turns into a superhydrophobic shield <unk> 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 42.5 49.74 <NA> so this is a cinder block <unk> uncoated <unk> and you can see that it 's porous it absorbs water 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 57.33 59.29 <NA> <unk> so what 's superhydrophobic 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 59.58 66.97 <NA> superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface the rounder it is the more hydrophobic it is 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 66.97 70.07 <NA> and if it 's really round it 's superhydrophobic 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 69.84 74.81 <NA> a freshly waxed car the water molecules slump to about ninety degrees
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 75.58 85.22 <NA> <unk> a windshield coating is going to give you about one hundred and ten degrees <unk> but what you 're seeing here is one hundred and sixty to one hundred and seventy five degrees and anything over one hundred and fifty is superhydrophobic <unk> 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 85.18 91.49 <NA> so as part of the demonstration what i have is a pair of gloves <unk> and we 've coated one of the gloves
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 91.87 96.9 <NA> with the nanotechnology coating <unk> and let 's see if you can tell which one and i 'll give you a hint
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 104.06 105.66 <NA> <unk> you guess the one that was dry <unk> 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 107.36 111.72 <NA> when you have nanotechnology and and
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 111.35 120.33 <NA> nanoscience what 's occurred is that we 're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits and we
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 119.84 129.85 <NA> 're talking really small here the way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers <unk> and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter <unk> and to put some scale to that
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 130.02 138.67 <NA> <unk> you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick <unk> and you put it side by side and you had fifty thousand of them you 'd be the width of a human hair <unk> 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 138.54 141.97 <NA> so very small <unk> but very useful 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 142.11 145.28 <NA> and it 's not just water that this works with it 's a lot of
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 159.43 161.75 <NA> you can see the difference <unk> 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 163.27 170.9 <NA> moving onto the next demonstration we 've taken a pane of glass and we 've coated the outside of it we 've framed it with the nanotechnology coating 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 170.86 179.55 <NA> and we 're going to pour this <unk> green tinted water inside the middle <unk> and you 're going to see it 's going to spread out on glass like you 'd normally think it would except when it hits the coating
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 179.9 184.35 <NA> <unk> it stops <unk> and i can 't even coax it to leave <unk> 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 185.69 187.65 <NA> it 's that afraid of the water 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 190.16 197.46 <NA> so what 's going on here what 's happening well <unk> the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles <unk>
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 197.36 202.69 <NA> <unk> that form a very rough and craggly surface you 'd think it 'd be smooth but it 's actually not and it has
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 205.05 206.68 <NA> <unk> and those spaces
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 206.22 214.93 <NA> along with the nanoparticles <unk> reach up and grab the air molecules and cover the surface with air it 's an umbrella of air all across it <unk> 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 214.74 220.57 <NA> and that layer of air is what the water hits the mud hits the concrete hits <unk> and it glides right off <unk> 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 220.57 225.2 <NA> so if i put this inside this water here you can see a silver reflective
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 225.13 233 <NA> <unk> coating around it and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that 's protecting the water from touching the paddle <unk> and it 's dry
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 236.86 239.51 <NA> so what are the applications i
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 239.89 245.63 <NA> mean many of you right now are probably going through your head everyone that sees this gets excited and says oh i could use it for this and this and this 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 245.23 252.47 <NA> the applications in a general sense could be anything that 's <unk> anti wetting we 've certainly seen that today <unk> 
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 252.19 253.62 <NA> it could be anything that 's
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 255.02 259.51 <NA> because if you don 't have water you don 't have ice <unk> it could be <unk>
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 260.75 263.7 <NA> no water <unk> no corrosion <unk> it could be <unk>
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 265.16 270.04 <NA> without water the bacteria won 't survive <unk> and it could be things that need to be
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 280.08 287.81 <NA> <unk> field of work <unk> and i 'm going to leave you with one last demonstration <unk> but before i do that i would like to say thank you and think small
MarkShaw_2013 1 MarkShaw_2013 309.61 311.46 <NA> <unk> about us cutting out the design from ted
