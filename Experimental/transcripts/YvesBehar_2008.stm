YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 233.16 241.35 <NA> so the first projects were sort of humble but they took technology and maybe made it into into things that people

YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 279.96 288.28 <NA> <unk> light fixture for swarovski and what it does is it changes shape so it goes from a circle to a round to a square to a figure eight

YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 296.02 304.97 <NA> and then finally the leaf lamp for herman miller <unk> this is a pretty involved process it took us about four and a half years but i really was looking for creating
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 305.04 311.33 <NA> a unique experience of light a new experience of light <unk> so we had to design both
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 310.87 312.62 <NA> the light
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 312.13 322.34 <NA> and the light bulb and that that 's a unique opportunity i would say in design and the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 322.34 329.97 <NA> a warm sort of glowing kind of mood light all the way to a bright work light so the light

YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 340.12 345.34 <NA> of the light and on one side you can mix the brightness <unk> and on the other the
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 351.18 355.12 <NA> <unk> and i think as designers we need to really think about how
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 354.84 360.34 <NA> we can create a different relationship between our work and the world
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 360.3 371.86 <NA> whether it 's for business or as i 'm going to show on some civic type projects because i think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value

YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 376.72 382.85 <NA> <unk> but i think it 's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 382.45 386.51 <NA> the greater value and the values we bring can be
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 387.25 393.41 <NA> about environmental issues about sustainability about lower power consumption you
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 393.49 399.96 <NA> know they can be about function and beauty <unk> they can be about business strategy but designers are really the glue
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 405.44 409.11 <NA> <unk> is a project that you 're familiar with <unk> and
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 408.65 416.34 <NA> it has a humanistic technology <unk> it feels your skin <unk> it rests on your skin and it knows when it is you 're talking <unk> and
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 416.17 423.6 <NA> by knowing when it is you 're talking it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about which is the the environmental noises 
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 423.14 428.76 <NA> but the other thing that is humanistic about jawbone is that we really decided to
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 428.39 429.91 <NA> take out all the
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 429.87 438.11 <NA> <unk> techie stuff <unk> and all the nerdy stuff out of it and try to make it as beautiful as as we can i mean think about it the care we take in

YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 446.58 452.23 <NA> important so if it isn 't beautiful it really doesn 't belong on your face <unk> and
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 452.52 454.97 <NA> this is what we 're pursuing here <unk> but how
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 454.99 456.14 <NA> <unk> we work
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 455.77 458.45 <NA> on jawbone is really unique 
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 458.17 461.42 <NA> i want to point at something here on the left 
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 461.08 471.53 <NA> this is the board this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work <unk> but this is the design process there 's somebody changing the board <unk> putting tracers on the board <unk>
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 471.48 479.97 <NA> changing the location of the ics as the designers on the other side are doing the work so it 's not about slapping skins <unk> anymore on a technology
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 480.34 489.57 <NA> it 's really about designing from the inside out and then on the other side of the room <unk> the designers are making small adjustments sketching drawing by hand
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 489.32 492.45 <NA> <unk> putting it in the computer <unk> and
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 492.23 498.48 <NA> it 's what i call being design driven you know there is some push and pull but design is really
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 498.17 504.97 <NA> helping define the whole experience from the inside out and then of course <unk> design is never done
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 504.78 517.52 <NA> <unk> done <unk> and this is the other new way that is unique in how we work is because it 's never done you have to do <unk> all this other stuff the packaging and the website and you need to continue to really touch
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 517.52 525.05 <NA> the user in many ways <unk> but how do you retain somebody when it 's never done
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 531.43 533.39 <NA> <unk> really understands that
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 533.32 539.57 <NA> you need a different structure so in a way <unk> the different structure is that we 're partners it 's a partnership
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 540.55 549.84 <NA> we can continue to work and and dedicate ourselves to this project <unk> and then we also share in the rewards <unk> and here 's another
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 553.76 557.04 <NA> <unk> this is called y water <unk> and it 's this guy from

YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 575.58 584.95 <NA> <unk> we worked on this bottle and it 's completely symmetrical in every dimension <unk> and this allows the bottle to turn into
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 584.82 590.56 <NA> a game the bottles connect together and you can create different shapes 
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 590.28 592.36 <NA> different forms thank you 
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 596.25 598.87 <NA> and then while we were doing this 
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 598.71 604.39 <NA> the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a y <unk> and then we thought well
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 604.78 612.15 <NA> <unk> words why and why not are probably the most important words that kids ask so we called it y water <unk> 
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 612.15 618.89 <NA> and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room the three dimensional design
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 618.85 627.9 <NA> <unk> the ideas <unk> the branding it all becomes deeply connected <unk> and then the other thing about this project is
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 630.05 640.83 <NA> <unk> intellectual property <unk> we bring a marketing approach we bring all this stuff but i think at the end of the day what we bring is these values and these values create a soul for the companies we work with <unk> 
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 640.83 647.56 <NA> and it 's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor when others can be creative and do more with it 
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 647.33 650.14 <NA> here 's another project which i think really
YvesBehar_2008 1 YvesBehar_2008 658.8 668.33 <NA> <unk> is incredible in nigeria people carry their most precious belongings on their heads this girl is going to school with a laptop on her head i mean to me
