DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 13.57 21.68 <NA> <unk> so i work in marketing which i love but my first passion was physics a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher <unk> when i had a
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 21.68 25.14 <NA> little less gray hair <unk> so
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 24.9 29.97 <NA> he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 29.96 39.84 <NA> <unk> us and i 'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing <unk> so quick show of hands who studied some marketing in university <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 39.98 49.54 <NA> who studied some physics in university <unk> pretty good and at school okay <unk> lots of you so hopefully this will bring back some happy or possibly some slightly disturbing memories
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 54.99 63.91 <NA> <unk> something very simple newton 's law the force equals mass times acceleration this is something that perhaps turkish airlines should have studied a bit more carefully
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 64.77 67.12 <NA> before they ran this campaign 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 70.05 76.72 <NA> but if we rearrange this formula quickly <unk> we can get to acceleration equals force over mass 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 76.29 79.97 <NA> which means that for a larger particle
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 80.16 84.44 <NA> a larger mass it requires more force to change its direction <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 84.37 86.66 <NA> it 's the same with brands <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 86.35 93.41 <NA> the more massive a brand the more baggage it has <unk> the more force is needed to change its positioning <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 92.98 103.37 <NA> and that 's one of the reasons why arthur andersen chose to launch accenture rather than try to persuade the world that andersen 's could stand for something other than accountancy <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 103.33 104.94 <NA> it explains why
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 104.95 109.5 <NA> hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 109.76 118.09 <NA> and why companies like unilever and p & g keep brands separate like ariel and pringles and dove
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 117.76 121.53 <NA> rather than having one giant parent brand <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 121.43 129.91 <NA> so the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction <unk> the marketing is the bigger a
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 129.87 137.11 <NA> <unk> brand <unk> the more difficult it is to reposition it so think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 137.13 141.25 <NA> now who remembers heisenberg 's uncertainty principle 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 140.79 153.88 <NA> getting a little more technical now so this says that it 's impossible by definition to measure exactly the state i e the position and the momentum of a particle because the act of measuring it <unk> by definition changes it <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 153.87 154.97 <NA> so to explain that
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 155.19 162.02 <NA> if you 've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it <unk> then the photon of light has momentum which
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 161.71 166.19 <NA> knocks the particle <unk> so you don 't know where it was before you looked at it <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 166.75 171.05 <NA> by measuring it <unk> the act of measurement changes it <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 170.65 177.86 <NA> the act of observation changes it <unk> it 's the same in marketing <unk> so with the act of observing consumers changes their behavior <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 177.88 179.94 <NA> think about the group
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 179.9 189.72 <NA> <unk> of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group <unk> and almost none of them buy lots of junk food <unk> and yet mcdonald 's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 189.92 195.69 <NA> think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets who stuff their trolleys full of fresh
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 195.23 204.97 <NA> green vegetables and fruit <unk> but don 't shop like that any other day <unk> and if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 205.16 212.53 <NA> look for porn on the web <unk> it 's very few yet at google we know it 's the number one searched for category <unk> so
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 212.3 221.02 <NA> luckily <unk> the science no sorry the marketing is getting easier <unk> luckily with now better point of sale tracking more digital
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 221.01 224.99 <NA> media consumption you can measure more what consumers actually do 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 225 226.76 <NA> <unk> rather than what they say they do <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 226.59 235.15 <NA> so the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle because the observation changes it <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 235.16 238.85 <NA> the marketing is the message for marketing is that
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 238.42 245 <NA> try to measure what consumers actually do <unk> rather than what they say they 'll do or anticipate they 'll do <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 245.83 248.79 <NA> so next the scientific method
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 248.6 254.94 <NA> an axiom of physics of all science says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation you can only disprove it
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 254.98 267.93 <NA> what this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning <unk> and it will strengthen it <unk> but it will not conclusively prove it and only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 267.92 270.1 <NA> so if we take an example
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 269.92 279.85 <NA> ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the earth it only took one robust observation from copernicus to blow that
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 279.81 283.98 <NA> <unk> idea out of the water <unk> and there are parallels for marketing
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 283.98 293.65 <NA> you can invest for a long time in a brand <unk> but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers ' belief take bp
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 293.34 300.55 <NA> they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand <unk> but then
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 300.12 304.94 <NA> one little accident <unk> think about toyota it was for a
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 304.87 310.79 <NA> <unk> long time revered as the most reliable of cars <unk> and then they had the big recall incident <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 311.08 317.12 <NA> and tiger woods for a long time <unk> the perfect brand ambassador <unk> well you know the story <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 322.66 329.97 <NA> so the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis <unk> but it 's easy to disprove it any hypothesis
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 330.05 343.05 <NA> <unk> is shaky and the marketing is that not matter how much you 've invested in your brand one bad week can undermine decades of good work so be really careful to try and avoid the screw ups that can undermine your brand <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 343.46 349.03 <NA> and lastly to the slightly obscure world of entropy the second law of thermodynamics 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 349.03 354.37 <NA> this says that entropy which is a measure of the disorder of a system will always increase
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 355.44 364.93 <NA> <unk> the same is true of marketing if we go back twenty years the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 364.86 370.49 <NA> but where we are today <unk> things have changed you can get a strong brand image
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 370.3 375.05 <NA> or a message and put it out there like the conservative party did earlier this year with their
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 376.96 381.62 <NA> <unk> but then you lose control of it <unk> with the kind of digital
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 381.13 388.88 <NA> comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer <unk> it 's impossible to control where it goes 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 388.57 391.88 <NA> your brand starts being dispersed 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 392.95 395.15 <NA> it gets more chaotic 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 396.61 398.1 <NA> it 's out of your control
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 405.02 406.26 <NA> <unk> he did a good job <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 405.8 415.44 <NA> but while this may be unsettling for marketers <unk> it 's actually a good thing this distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people more in with the people <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 415.4 418.48 <NA> it makes this distribution of energy a
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 418.31 424.99 <NA> democratizing force which is ultimately good for your brand <unk> so the lesson from physics is that entropy will
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 425 434.5 <NA> <unk> always increase it 's a fundamental law the message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed you can 't fight it <unk> so embrace it and find a way to work with it <unk> 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 434.28 440.8 <NA> so to close <unk> my teacher mr vutter told me that physics is cool 
DanCobley_2010G 1 DanCobley_2010G 440.4 446.48 <NA> and hopefully i 've convinced you that physics can teach all of us <unk> even in the world of marketing something special <unk> thank you
