NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 15.37 18.74 <NA> <unk> i work with really amazing little itty bitty creatures
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 18.57 20.33 <NA> called cells 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 19.84 29.85 <NA> and let me tell you what it 's like to grow these cells in the lab i work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment we plate them into dishes that we
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 29.78 37.56 <NA> <unk> sometimes call petri dishes <unk> and we feed them sterilely of course with what we call cell culture media which is like their food
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 37.19 44.94 <NA> and we grow them in incubators <unk> why do i do this we observe the cells in a plate and they 're
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 44.48 49.04 <NA> just on the surface <unk> but what we 're really trying to do in my lab
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 49.04 54.97 <NA> is to engineer tissues out of them what does that even mean well
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 55.13 58.4 <NA> <unk> it means growing an actual heart <unk> let 's say
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 58.4 65.68 <NA> or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body not only that but they can also be used for disease models
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 65.22 76.94 <NA> and for this purpose traditional cell culture techniques just really aren 't enough the cells are kind of homesick the dish doesn 't feel like their home <unk> and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 76.94 79.04 <NA> we call this the biomimetic paradigm
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 79.87 88.13 <NA> <unk> copying nature in the lab <unk> let 's take the example of the heart the topic of a lot of my research what makes the heart unique <unk> 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 87.94 93.6 <NA> well the heart beats <unk> rhythmically tirelessly <unk> faithfully 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 93.6 103.13 <NA> we copy this in the lab by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes these electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab <unk> 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 102.85 104.76 <NA> what else do we know about the heart
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 104.78 111.43 <NA> well heart cells are pretty greedy nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very very dense blood supply 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 111.43 123.06 <NA> in the lab we micro pattern channels in the biomaterials on which we grow the cells and this allows us to flow the cell culture media the cells ' food through the scaffolds where we 're growing the cells
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 122.57 129.16 <NA> a lot like what you might expect from a capillary capillary bed in the heart so this brings me to lesson number one
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 130.05 139.09 <NA> <unk> life can do a lot with very little <unk> let 's take the example of electrical stimulation <unk> let 's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 139.32 146.62 <NA> on the left <unk> we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue that i engineered from rat cells in the lab it 's about the size of a mini marshmallow <unk> 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 146.62 149.9 <NA> and after one week it 's beating you can see it in the upper <unk>
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 150.97 154.82 <NA> <unk> but don 't worry if you can 't see it so well it 's amazing that these cells beat
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 154.62 163.49 <NA> at all <unk> but what 's really amazing is that the cells <unk> when we electrically stimulate them like with a pacemaker that they beat so much more <unk> 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 163.09 165.62 <NA> but that brings me to lesson number two 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 165.25 172.95 <NA> cells do all the work in a sense tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here because structural engineers
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 172.79 175.02 <NA> build bridges and big things 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 176.93 184.14 <NA> <unk> but what we are doing is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves <unk> what does this mean for us <unk> 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 184.34 190.83 <NA> let 's do something really simple <unk> let 's remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept <unk> 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 190.49 196.23 <NA> let 's remember that our cells sustain our lives in a very real way 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 196.22 199.93 <NA> we are what we eat could easily be described as we are what
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 201.27 205.93 <NA> <unk> and in the case of the flora in our gut these cells may not even be human <unk> 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 206.67 211.7 <NA> but it 's also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 211.7 220.81 <NA> behind every sound sight touch <unk> taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us 
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 220.98 229.97 <NA> it begs the question <unk> shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship to include the ecosystem of our own bodies <unk> i invite you to talk
NinaTandon_2011U 1 NinaTandon_2011U 229.93 239.04 <NA> <unk> about this with me further <unk> and in the meantime i wish you luck may none of your non cancer cells become endangered species thank you
