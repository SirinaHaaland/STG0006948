FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 13.15 22.62 <NA> <unk> an image is worth more than a thousand words <unk> so i 'm going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that i recently captured
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 43.61 49.05 <NA> <unk> by now my talk is already six thousand words long and i feel like i should stop here at
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 50.93 54.91 <NA> the same time i probably owe you some explanation about the
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 54.87 56.95 <NA> <unk> images that you just saw 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 56.94 65.74 <NA> what i am trying to do as a photographer as an artist is to bring the world of art and science together <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 65.49 72.88 <NA> whether it is an image of a soap bubble captured at the very moment where it 's bursting as you can see in this image <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 72.78 77.74 <NA> whether it 's a universe made of tiny little beads of oil paint 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 78.18 79.91 <NA> strange liquids that
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 79.87 87.08 <NA> <unk> behave in very peculiar ways <unk> or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 86.62 93.96 <NA> i 'm always trying to link those two fields together <unk> what i find very intriguing about those two
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 93.79 99.84 <NA> is that they both look at the same thing <unk> they are a response to their surroundings <unk> and
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 100.82 103.23 <NA> <unk> do it in a very different way <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 103.13 105.65 <NA> if you look at science on one hand 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 105.43 116.66 <NA> science is a very rational approach to its surroundings <unk> whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings <unk>
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 116.66 121.63 <NA> what i am trying to do is i 'm trying to bring those two views into one
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 121.42 129.97 <NA> so that my images both speak to the viewer 's heart but also to the viewer 's brain <unk> let me demonstrate
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 129.93 133.42 <NA> <unk> this based on three projects 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 133.23 143.95 <NA> the first one has to do with making sound visible <unk> now as you may know sound travels in waves <unk> so if you have a speaker a
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 143.7 149.78 <NA> speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal transform it into
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 151.93 159.62 <NA> <unk> which is then transported through the air is captured by our ear <unk> and transformed into an audio signal again
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 159.76 165.68 <NA> now i was thinking how can i make those sound waves visible
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 165.58 169.62 <NA> <unk> so i came up with the following setup i took a speaker <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 169.62 176.94 <NA> i placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker <unk> and then i added tiny little crystals
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 176.78 179.94 <NA> on top of that speaker <unk> and now if i would play a
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 179.84 189.6 <NA> <unk> sound through that speaker <unk> it would cause the crystals to move up and down <unk> now this happens very fast in the blink of an eye 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 189.2 198.54 <NA> so together with lg we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than three thousand frames per second <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 198.53 199.99 <NA> let me show you
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 200 201.11 <NA> what this looks like
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 250 253.08 <NA> i agree it looks pretty amazing <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 252.8 255.4 <NA> but i have to tell you a funny story 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 255.22 260.13 <NA> i got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in los angeles <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 260.13 266.25 <NA> now in los angeles you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches <unk> but i got mine indoors <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 265.94 274.78 <NA> and what happened is that if you 're shooting at three thousand frames per second you need to have a silly amount of light lots of lights
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 275.88 286 <NA> <unk> we had this speaker set up and we had the camera facing it and lots of lights pointing at the speaker <unk> and i would set up the speaker put the tiny little crystals <unk>
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 285.9 298.24 <NA> <unk> on top of that speaker <unk> and we we would do this over and over again <unk> and it was until midday that i realized that i had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker what
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 305.02 309.69 <NA> <unk> of my face was completely red and i looked like the phantom of the opera for the rest of the
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 309.48 311 <NA> week <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 310.96 317.42 <NA> let me now turn to another project which involves less harmful substances 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 319.57 327.6 <NA> has anyone of you heard of ferrofluid ah some of you have excellent <unk> should i skip that part
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 329.69 337.23 <NA> <unk> ferrofluid has a very strange behavior it 's a liquid that is completely black it 's got an oily consistency <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 337.23 343.26 <NA> and it 's got tiny little particles of metal in it which makes it magnetic <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 342.83 349.36 <NA> so if i now put this liquid into a magnetic field it would change its appearance
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 349.36 352.53 <NA> <unk> now i 've got a live demonstration over here
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 352.91 354.46 <NA> to show this to you
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 359.31 365.62 <NA> so i 've got a camera pointing down at this plate and underneath that plate <unk> there is a magnet <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 365.88 369.04 <NA> now i 'm going to add some of that ferrofluid
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 368.88 370.81 <NA> to that magnet let
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 378.28 381.5 <NA> <unk> slightly move it to the right
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 384.94 387.86 <NA> and maybe focus it a little bit more
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 388.33 389.84 <NA> excellent <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 389.71 399.9 <NA> so what you can see now is that the ferrofluid has formed spikes this is due to the attraction and the repulsion of the individual particles
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 401.87 407.5 <NA> <unk> now this looks already quite interesting but let me now add some watercolors to it 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 407.5 414.03 <NA> those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with you wouldn 't paint with syringes but
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 414.38 416.5 <NA> it works just the same
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 431.01 433.09 <NA> <unk> so what happened now is 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 432.69 442.19 <NA> when the watercolor was flowing into the structure the watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid that 's because the ferrofluid itself
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 442.02 449.84 <NA> is hydrophobic that means it doesn 't mix with the water <unk> and at the same time it tries to maintain its position above the
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 453.94 465.53 <NA> <unk> structures of channels and tiny little ponds of colorful water paint <unk> so that was the second project <unk> let me now turn to the last project which involves
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 468.52 471.26 <NA> the national beverage of scotland 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 472.93 479.76 <NA> this image <unk> and also this one were made using whiskey
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 479.99 485.76 <NA> now you might ask yourself <unk> how did he do that did he drink half a bottle of whiskey and then
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 485.36 488.1 <NA> draw the hallucination he got from
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 487.9 490.44 <NA> being drunk onto paper 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 490.79 496.08 <NA> i can assure you i was fully conscious while i was taking those pictures 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 495.95 504.37 <NA> now whiskey contains forty percent of alcohol <unk> and alcohol has got some very interesting properties
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 504.9 511.83 <NA> <unk> maybe you have experienced some of those properties before <unk> but i am talking about the physical properties not
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 511.67 515.5 <NA> the other ones <unk> so when i open the bottle 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 515.37 523.06 <NA> the alcohol molecules would spread in the air and that 's because alcohol is a very volatile substance <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 522.75 527.56 <NA> and at the same time alcohol is highly flammable <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 527.28 529.91 <NA> and it was with those two properties
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 530.07 531.89 <NA> that i was able to create
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 531.72 534.35 <NA> the images that you 're seeing right now 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 534.19 537.62 <NA> let me demonstrate this over here
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 543.25 549.93 <NA> <unk> and what i have here is an an empty glass vessel it 's got nothing in it <unk> and now i 'm
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 578.04 585.68 <NA> <unk> now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle <unk> and now let 's set that on fire
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 605.47 607.7 <NA> <unk> goes really fast and it 's not that
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 607.5 616.95 <NA> impressive i could do it again to show it one more time <unk> but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey and that i should rather drink it
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 617.35 622.97 <NA> but let me show you a slow motion in a completely darkened room of what
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 622.6 624.6 <NA> i just showed you in this live
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 633.83 635.55 <NA> <unk> so what happened is that the
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 635.55 645.21 <NA> flame traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom <unk> burning the mix of the air molecules and the alcohol <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 644.72 651.31 <NA> so the images that you saw at the beginning <unk> they are actually a flame
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 651.15 654.67 <NA> stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 655.05 660.95 <NA> <unk> and you have to imagine it was flipped around one hundred and eighty degrees <unk> so that 's how those images
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 660.95 662.29 <NA> were made thank you 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 668.73 670.18 <NA> so 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 669.72 679.58 <NA> i have now showed you three projects <unk> and you might ask yourself <unk> what is it good for what 's the idea behind it is it just a waste of whiskey is it just some strange
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 679.6 680.9 <NA> <unk> materials 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 681.76 689.25 <NA> those three projects <unk> they 're based on very simple scientific phenomena such as magnetism the sound waves <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 689.25 693.35 <NA> or over here the physical properties of a substance
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 693.16 701.33 <NA> and what i 'm trying to do is i 'm trying to use these phenomena and show them in a poetic and unseen way <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 701.33 704.85 <NA> and therefore invite the viewer to pause for a
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 704.78 711 <NA> <unk> moment and think about all the beauty that is constantly surrounding us <unk> 
FabianOefner_2013G 1 FabianOefner_2013G 712.19 713.56 <NA> thank you very much
