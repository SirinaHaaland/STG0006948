EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 13.15 20.9 <NA> <unk> journalist was asking him a question about the news feed <unk> and the journalist was asking him why is this so important 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 21.19 25.97 <NA> and zuckerberg said a squirrel dying in your front yard
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 25.54 29.97 <NA> may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 30.07 39.26 <NA> in africa and i want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like so when i was growing up
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 39.04 44.92 <NA> in a really rural area in maine the internet meant something very different to me <unk> it meant
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 44.92 54.1 <NA> a connection to the world it meant something that would connect us all together <unk> and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 55.08 61.54 <NA> <unk> but there 's this shift in how information is flowing online and it 's invisible <unk> 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 61.68 66.46 <NA> and if we don 't pay attention to it it could be a real problem <unk> 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 67.02 69.02 <NA> so i first noticed this
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 68.83 76.3 <NA> in a place i spend a lot of time my facebook page i 'm progressive politically big surprise but i 've always
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 76.14 79.79 <NA> gone out of my way to meet conservatives i like hearing what they 're thinking about
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 79.84 89.78 <NA> <unk> like seeing what they link to i like learning a thing or two <unk> and so i was surprised when i noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my facebook feed <unk> 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 89.95 91.41 <NA> and
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 91.22 100.05 <NA> what it turned out was going on was that facebook was looking at which links i clicked on and it was noticing that actually i was clicking more on my liberal friends
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 100.73 109.53 <NA> <unk> than on my conservative friends ' links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 110.3 117.57 <NA> <unk> so facebook isn 't the only place that 's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 117.62 119.7 <NA> google 's doing it too 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 120.38 125.2 <NA> if i search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 125.46 134.17 <NA> <unk> we may get very different search results <unk> even if you 're logged out one engineer told me there are fifty seven signals
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 133.71 135.76 <NA> that google looks at
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 135.63 141.22 <NA> everything from what kind of computer you 're on to what kind of browser you 're using
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 141.22 150.26 <NA> to where you 're located that it uses to personally tailor your query results think about it for a second <unk> there is no standard
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 152.08 159.29 <NA> <unk> and you know the funny thing about this is that it 's hard to see you can 't see how different your search results are from anyone else 's 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 158.83 163.97 <NA> but a couple of weeks ago i asked a bunch of friends to google egypt 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 163.57 166.88 <NA> and to send me screen shots of what they got <unk> 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 166.84 169.02 <NA> so here 's my friend
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 168.81 174.41 <NA> scott 's screen shot <unk> and here 's my friend daniel 's screen shot 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 176.42 184.32 <NA> <unk> you don 't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are but when you do read the links it 's really quite remarkable <unk> 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 185.51 198.24 <NA> daniel didn 't get anything about the protests in egypt at all in his first page of google results <unk> scott 's results were full of them <unk> and this was the big story of the day at that time that 's how different these results are becoming <unk> 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 197.84 200.17 <NA> so it 's not just google and facebook
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 201.51 213.1 <NA> <unk> this is something that 's sweeping the web there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization yahoo news the biggest news site on the internet is now personalized different people get different things <unk> 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 213.09 222.65 <NA> huffington post the washington post the new york times all flirting with personalization in various ways and this this moves us very quickly
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 222.44 229.97 <NA> toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see <unk> but not necessarily what we need to
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 231.37 233.87 <NA> as eric schmidt said 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 233.5 241.13 <NA> it will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 241.66 245.58 <NA> so i do think this is a problem <unk> and
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 245.39 254.55 <NA> i think if you take all of these filters together you take all these algorithms you get what i call a filter bubble and your filter bubble is
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 254.98 263.04 <NA> your own personal <unk> unique universe of information that you live in online <unk> and what 's in your filter bubble
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 262.85 272.31 <NA> depends on who you are <unk> and it depends on what you do but the thing is that you don 't decide what gets in and more importantly 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 272.09 274.33 <NA> you don 't actually see
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 274.17 279.94 <NA> what gets edited out <unk> so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at netflix
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 280.17 284.99 <NA> and they were looking at the netflix queues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 284.99 292.9 <NA> which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses they enter the queue they just zip right out 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 292.56 299.08 <NA> so iron man zips right out and waiting for superman can wait for a really long time 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 299.34 304.94 <NA> what they discovered was that in our netflix queues there 's this epic struggle going on
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 305.65 309.66 <NA> between our future aspirational selves
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 309.66 318.93 <NA> and our more impulsive present selves you know we all want to be someone who has watched rashomon but right now
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 318.7 322.19 <NA> we want to watch ace ventura for the fourth time 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 323.47 329.94 <NA> so the best editing gives us a bit of both it gives us a little bit of justin bieber and a little bit of afghanistan
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 329.93 335.01 <NA> <unk> it gives us some information vegetables it gives us some information dessert <unk> 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 335.45 343.92 <NA> and the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because they 're mainly looking at what you click on first
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 345.29 349.93 <NA> it can throw off that balance <unk> and instead of a
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 352.05 355.75 <NA> <unk> you can end up surrounded by information junk food
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 356.76 367.09 <NA> what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong in a broadcast society this is how the founding mythology goes in a broadcast society <unk> 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 366.9 372.37 <NA> there were these gatekeepers the editors <unk> and they controlled the flows of information 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 372.24 379.97 <NA> and along came the internet and it swept them out of the way and it allowed all of us to connect together <unk> and it was awesome <unk> but that 's not
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 379.99 386.36 <NA> <unk> actually what 's happening right now what we 're seeing is more of a passing of the torch
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 386.44 388.76 <NA> from human gatekeepers
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 388.76 397.71 <NA> to algorithmic ones <unk> and the thing is that the algorithms don 't yet have the kind of embedded ethics
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 397.5 404.91 <NA> that the editors did so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if they 're going to decide what we get to
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 404.84 411.06 <NA> <unk> see and what we don 't get to see then we need to make sure that they 're not just keyed to relevance 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 410.72 415.27 <NA> we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 414.82 420.27 <NA> or challenging or important this is what ted does other points of view <unk> 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 419.81 424.2 <NA> and the thing is we 've actually been here before as a society <unk> 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 426.15 428.51 <NA> <unk> and fifteen it 's not like newspapers
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 428.3 435.73 <NA> were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities <unk> then people noticed that they were doing something really important 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 435.87 439.69 <NA> that in fact you couldn 't have a functioning democracy
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 440.01 444.19 <NA> if citizens didn 't get a good flow of information 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 444.84 454.07 <NA> that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter and then journalistic ethics developed <unk> it wasn 't perfect <unk> but it got us through the last century
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 455.44 464 <NA> <unk> and so now we 're kind of back in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen on the web <unk> and we need the new gatekeepers
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 463.72 472.25 <NA> to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they 're writing i know that there are a lot of people here from facebook and from google larry and <unk>
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 473.46 475.05 <NA> people who have helped build the web as
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 475.28 479.79 <NA> <unk> and i 'm grateful for that but we really need you to make sure
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 479.54 481.42 <NA> that these algorithms
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 481.21 483.14 <NA> have encoded in them
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 482.98 486.6 <NA> a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 486.68 494.19 <NA> we need you to make sure that they 're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters <unk> 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 493.79 498.49 <NA> and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 498.25 502.77 <NA> what gets through and what doesn 't because i think
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 502.43 504.97 <NA> we really need the internet to be
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 504.9 506.23 <NA> <unk> that thing
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 505.95 516.16 <NA> that we all dreamed of it being we need it to connect us all together <unk> we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives 
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 516.6 518.77 <NA> and it 's not going to do that
EliPariser_2011 1 EliPariser_2011 518.49 521.96 <NA> if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one
