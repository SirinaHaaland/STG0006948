SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 96.43 100.23 <NA> and so the question that i was asked to specifically help answer
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 100.61 106.47 <NA> <unk> which is one that aid workers ask themselves in war zones the world over is

SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 121.04 129.25 <NA> and i remember very distinctly a couple of days after my arrival i went up to a feeding clinic
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 129.98 135.55 <NA> there were dozens of women who were standing in line and they were clutching their infants very close

SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 162.52 164.57 <NA> hours before

SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 188.94 198.03 <NA> in war zones the world over places where kids <unk> some as young as eight they are this big
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 197.84 199.78 <NA> and those kids they have never been to

SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 239.74 245.06 <NA> and yet i still believe a different outcome is possible do you want
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 245.08 247.01 <NA> to know why 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 247.06 254.76 <NA> because over twenty years of doing this work going in and out of war zones around the world <unk> i have come to understand
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 255.02 261.36 <NA> <unk> are aspects of this problem that we all of us as people occupying this shared space 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 260.9 267.39 <NA> that we can change not through force or coercion or invasion <unk> 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 267.39 271.77 <NA> but by simply looking at all of the options available to us
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 271.49 279.97 <NA> and choosing the ones that favor peace at the expense of war <unk> instead of war at the expense
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 280.38 289.91 <NA> of peace how so well i want you to consider this there are at least eight hundred million
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 289.67 294.67 <NA> small arms and light weapons in circulation in the world today 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 294.27 298.1 <NA> the vast majority of civilians like that young baby 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 298.1 304.7 <NA> who are dying in war zones around the world are dying at the hands of various armed groups who rely on a
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 305.13 316.55 <NA> near infinite supply of cheap <unk> easy and efficient weapons to rape <unk> threaten <unk> intimidate and brutalize those civilians at every turn <unk> 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 316.45 320.39 <NA> how cheap <unk> well in some parts of the world you can buy an <unk>
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 321.48 329.76 <NA> for as little as ten dollars in many places in which i have worked <unk> it is easier to get
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 329.69 331.98 <NA> <unk> access to an automatic rifle
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 331.78 339.03 <NA> than it is to get access to clean drinking water <unk> and so now the important part 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 339.17 343.32 <NA> can anything be done about this 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 343.37 348.03 <NA> to answer that question let 's take a look at this map of the world <unk> 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 347.72 352.92 <NA> and now let 's add in all of the countries that are currently at war 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 352.76 354.91 <NA> and the number of people who have
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 354.87 362.62 <NA> <unk> either died or have been displaced as a result of that violence it is a staggering number more than forty million people but you
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 362.31 368.98 <NA> will also notice something else about this map you will notice that most of those countries are in the global south 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 368.97 377.08 <NA> now let 's look at the countries that are the world 's top twenty exporters of small arms in the world 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 377.1 379.91 <NA> and what do we notice well you see them
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 379.93 391.25 <NA> <unk> green <unk> you will notice that those are mostly countries in the global north <unk> primarily western countries what does this tell us this tells us that most of the people who are dying in war
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 390.76 396.44 <NA> are living in poor countries <unk> and yet most of the people who are profiting from war
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 396.16 404.58 <NA> are living in rich countries people like you and me <unk> and then what if we go beyond small arms for a second
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 405.01 409.47 <NA> if we look at all weapons in circulation in the world who does the biggest business well
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 409.47 419.37 <NA> roughly eighty percent of those weapons come from none other than the five permanent members of the united nations security council plus germany it 's
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 419.33 423.37 <NA> shocking isn 't it now some of you might be saying at this moment in time
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 437.43 447.91 <NA> <unk> but you might be saying to yourselves you know all of these weapons in war zones they 're not a cause <unk> but an effect of the violence that plagues them each and every single day you know places like iraq <unk>
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 447.81 454.97 <NA> <unk> and afghanistan where they need these weapons to be able to maintain law and order promote peace and security to combat terror
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 455.08 458.66 <NA> <unk> groups surely this is a good thing <unk>
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 458.26 472.47 <NA> let 's take a look at that assumption for just one moment because you see there has been a boom in the small arms trade since the start of the war on terror in fact it is a business that has grown threefold over the past fifteen years <unk> 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 472.47 479.91 <NA> and now let 's compare that to the number of people who have directly died in armed conflict around the
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 479.84 481.44 <NA> <unk> world in that same period
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 481.44 491.22 <NA> what do you notice well you notice that in fact that also goes up roughly three to fourfold they basically go up and end at the same point 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 490.79 500.08 <NA> now we can have a circular argument here about whether this increase in fatalities is a response to the increase of small arms
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 500.31 509.54 <NA> <unk> or the other way around but here 's what we should really take away from this what we should take away from this is that this is a relationship worth
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 509.54 516.29 <NA> scrutinizing <unk> especially when you consider that small arms that were shipped to iraq
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 516.08 525.05 <NA> for use by the iraqi army or to syria for so called moderate opposition fighters that those arms many of them are now in the hands of
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 526 531.42 <NA> <unk> or when you consider that arms that were shipped to libya are now actively drifting across the sahel <unk> 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 531.42 539.66 <NA> and ending up with groups like boko haram and al qaeda and other militant groups 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 539.53 546.11 <NA> and therein lies the problem because you see small arms anywhere
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 545.8 548 <NA> are a menace
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 547.84 554.1 <NA> everywhere <unk> because their first stop is rarely their last
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 554.81 559.47 <NA> <unk> spending on war per person per year now amounts to about two hundred and <unk>
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 560.59 563.7 <NA> dollars two hundred and forty nine dollars per person 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 563.7 574.99 <NA> which is roughly twelve times what we spend on foreign aid money that is used to educate and vaccinate children and combat malnutrition in the global south
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 575.76 577.28 <NA> <unk> but we can shift
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 577.1 578.27 <NA> that
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 578.09 585.97 <NA> balance how do we do this well it is essentially a problem of both supply and demand so we can tackle it from both sides 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 585.51 595.6 <NA> on the supply side we can push our governments to adopt international arms transparency mechanisms like the arms trade treaty <unk>
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 595.55 603.71 <NA> <unk> which makes it so that rich countries have to be more accountable for where their arms are going and what their arms might be used for 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 604.9 609.56 <NA> <unk> the largest arms exporting country in the world by far 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 609.16 620.06 <NA> president obama has rightly signed the arms trade treaty <unk> but none of it takes effect it isn 't binding <unk> until it is approved and ratified by the senate 
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 620.41 625.05 <NA> this is where we need to make our voices heard

SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 633.54 641.35 <NA> but it 's an important step in the right direction and it 's up to all of us who live in those rich countries to make change here
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 642.97 649.99 <NA> what about on the demand side <unk> you know <unk> there are generations around the world who are being lost to war
SamanthaNutt_2015P 1 SamanthaNutt_2015P 651.12 661.63 <NA> <unk> it is possible to disrupt that cycle of violence with investments in education in strengthening the rule of law and in economic development especially for women i have personally <unk>
