SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 29.68 40.14 <NA> this is sort of a new concept and it 's really important because while the last decade was the decade of social the decade where the framework in which we connect with other people was built <unk> this next <unk>
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 40.04 49.06 <NA> <unk> decade will be the decade where the game framework is built where the motivations we use to actually influence behavior and the framework in which that is constructed 
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 51.21 55.84 <NA> <unk> i say i want to build a game layer on top of the world but that 's not quite true because
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 55.53 58.26 <NA> it 's already under construction it 's already happening
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 58.1 68.81 <NA> and it looks like this right now <unk> it looks like the web did back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven right it 's not very good <unk> it 's cluttered <unk> it 's filled with lots of different things that in short aren 't that fun <unk> 
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 68.81 78.71 <NA> there are credit card schemes and airline mile programs coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game dynamics and are building the game layer
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 78.49 79.73 <NA> they just suck
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 83.01 85.62 <NA> so that 's unfortunate <unk> but luckily
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 85.38 88.93 <NA> as my favorite action hero bob the builder says 
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 88.77 99.14 <NA> we can do better we can build this better and the tools the resources that we use to build a game layer are game dynamics themselves <unk> and so the crux of this presentation is going to go <unk>
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 99.04 104.88 <NA> <unk> through four really important game dynamics really interesting things that if you use consciously you can
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 104.9 117.51 <NA> <unk> use to influence behavior <unk> both for good for bad for in between hopefully for good <unk> but this is the the important stage in which that framework will get built and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 117.32 125.02 <NA> before we jump into that there 's a question of why is this important i 'm making this claim that there 's a game layer on top of the world <unk> and it 's very important
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 125.01 126.49 <NA> <unk> that we build it properly <unk> 
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 126.49 137.84 <NA> the reason it 's so important is that in the last decade what we 've seen has been building the social layer has been this framework for connections <unk> and construction on that layer is over
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 137.36 146.62 <NA> it 's finished <unk> there 's still a lot to explore still a lot of people trying to figure out social and how we leverage this and how we use this but the framework itself is done <unk> 
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 146.13 148.24 <NA> and it 's called facebook
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 148.08 149.78 <NA> <unk> and that 's
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 150.46 153.83 <NA> <unk> a lot of people are very happy with facebook i like it quite a lot 
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 153.4 163.79 <NA> they 've created this thing called the open graph and they own all of our connections they own half a billion people so when you want to build on the social layer the framework has been decided it is <unk>
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 163.69 169.77 <NA> <unk> the open graph api <unk> and if you 're happy with that fantastic if you 're not too bad <unk> there 's nothing you can do <unk>
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 172 179.61 <NA> <unk> and that 's a real thing i mean we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it productive down the road
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 180.02 190.26 <NA> <unk> so the social layer is all about these connections <unk> the game layer is all about influence it 's not about adding a social fabric to the web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere <unk>
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 190.16 204.97 <NA> <unk> you go it 's actually about using dynamics using forces to influence the behavior of where you are what you do there how you do it that 's really really powerful and it 's going to be more important than the social layer and affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 205.07 215.14 <NA> so it 's incredibly critical that at this moment while it 's just getting constructed <unk> while the frameworks like facebook or open graph are being created for the game layer equivalent that we think about it <unk>
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 215.04 229.24 <NA> <unk> very consciously <unk> and that we do it in a way that is open available and can be leveraged for good <unk> so that 's what i want to talk about for game dynamics because construction has just begun and the more consciously we can think about this the better we 'll be able to use it for anything we want 
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 229.98 234.42 <NA> like i said the way you go through and build on the game layer is not with
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 234.18 245.18 <NA> glass and steel and cement and the resources we use are not this two dimensional swath of land that we have the resources are mindshare <unk> and the tools the raw materials are these game dynamics with that
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 245.17 252.3 <NA> a couple game dynamics to talk about back at scvngr we like to joke that with seven game dynamics you can get anyone to do anything
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 252.09 254.67 <NA> today i 'm going to show you four because i hope to have a
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 254.99 257.16 <NA> <unk> advantage at the end of this still 
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 259.28 270.03 <NA> laughter so the first one it 's a very simple game dynamic it 's called the appointment dynamic it 's a dynamic in which to succeed players have to do something at a predefined time generally at a predefined place
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 270.02 278.77 <NA> and these dynamics are a little scary sometimes because you think other people can be using forces that will manipulate how i interact what i do where i do it when i do it
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 279.9 285.1 <NA> <unk> of free will that occurs in games can be frightening <unk> so with each dynamic i 'm going to give three examples 
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 284.9 294.61 <NA> one that shows how it 's already being used in the real world so you can rationalize it a bit one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game i think everything is a game but this is more
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 294.61 299.99 <NA> what you 'd think of as a game played on a board or on a computer screen and one of how it can be used for good <unk> so you can see that
SethPriebatsch_2010X 1 SethPriebatsch_2010X 300 307.28 <NA> <unk> these forces can be very powerful <unk> so the first one the most famous appointment dynamic in the world is something called happy hour
