GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 21.39 29.88 <NA> in a world in which cost is everything <unk> how do you do that and the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you i want to
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 29.81 30.97 <NA> <unk> suggest to you is
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 30.76 39.06 <NA> one in which you say that in order to treat disease <unk> you have to first know what you 're treating <unk> that 's diagnostics and then you have to do something <unk>
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 39.06 53.04 <NA> the program we 're involved in is something we call diagnostics for all or zero cost diagnostics how do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost <unk> how do you do it <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 52.76 54.88 <NA> let me just give you two examples
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 55.14 64.06 <NA> the rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world poor resources a rigorous environment
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 63.81 64.84 <NA> a
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 64.44 73.72 <NA> series of problems light weight and things of this kind and also they 're not so different from the home health care and diagnostic system world <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 73.26 79.85 <NA> so the technology i want to talk about is for the third world for the developing world
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 79.96 86.24 <NA> <unk> but it has i think much broader application <unk> because information is so important in the health care system <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 86.44 94.34 <NA> so you see two examples here one is a lab that is actually a fairly <unk> high end laboratory in africa <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 94.09 97.76 <NA> the second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing <unk>

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 109.49 111.15 <NA> approach <unk>
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 110.87 121.89 <NA> the way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost starting from the perspective of the united states is to take our solution <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 121.46 124.35 <NA> and then try to cut cost out of it <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 125.04 131.11 <NA> <unk> how you do that you 're not going to start with a $ one hundred thousand instrument and bring it down to no cost it isn 't going to work 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 130.8 142 <NA> so the approach we took was the other way around to ask what is the cheapest possible stuff that you could make a diagnostic system out of and get useful information and add function <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 142 144.22 <NA> and what we 've chosen is paper
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 143.76 149.78 <NA> what you see here is a prototypic device it 's about a centimeter on the side it 's about the size of a
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 151.06 157.28 <NA> <unk> the lines around the edges are a polymer it 's made of paper and
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 157.11 165.65 <NA> paper of course wicks fluid as you know paper cloth drop wine on the tablecloth <unk> and the wine wicks all over everything
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 165.65 168.63 <NA> <unk> put it on your shirt it ruins the shirt that 's what
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 168.45 174.87 <NA> a hydrophilic surface does so in this device the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it in a
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 175 176.91 <NA> drop of in this case urine <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 176.74 184.91 <NA> the fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top <unk> the brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 184.92 194.64 <NA> the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine <unk> and the combination of those two is a first order shot at a number of useful things that you want 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 194.39 200.23 <NA> so this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper now how simple can you make the production
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 201.06 203.02 <NA> <unk> why do we choose paper 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 202.86 212.59 <NA> there 's an example of the same thing on a finger showing you basically what it looks like one reason for using paper is that it 's everywhere we have made these kinds of <unk>
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 212.49 218.48 <NA> <unk> devices using napkins and toilet paper and wraps and all kinds of stuff

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 226.2 232.43 <NA> that the stack of paper there would probably hold something like one hundred thousand tests something of that kind <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 232.15 237.92 <NA> and then finally a point you don 't think of so much in developed world medicine 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 237.61 245.55 <NA> it eliminates sharps <unk> and what sharps means is needles things that stick if you 've taken a sample of someone 's blood
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 245.38 249.84 <NA> and the someone might have hepatitis c <unk> you don 't want to make a mistake and stick it in
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 250.46 259.83 <NA> <unk> you don 't want to do that so how do you dispose of that it 's a problem everywhere and here you simply burn it <unk> so it 's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 260.84 264.66 <NA> now you say if paper is a good idea 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 264.68 268.56 <NA> other people have surely thought of it and the answer is of course yes <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 268.4 277.06 <NA> those half of you roughly who are women at some point may have had a pregnancy test <unk> and the
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 276.88 279.85 <NA> most common of these is in a device that looks like
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 279.9 283.46 <NA> <unk> thing on the left it 's something called a lateral flow immunoassay <unk>
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 283.28 291.88 <NA> in that particular test urine <unk> either containing a hormone called hcg does or does not flow across a piece of paper 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 291.88 298.96 <NA> and there are two bars one bar indicates that the test is working <unk> and if the second bar shows up you 're pregnant 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 298.71 300.08 <NA> this is a terrific
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 300 310.28 <NA> kind of test in a binary world and the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant or you 're not pregnant you 're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant or something of that sort <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 309.97 314.96 <NA> so it works very well there but it doesn 't work very well when you need more quantitative information 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 314.96 327.23 <NA> there are also dipsticks <unk> but if you look at the dipsticks they 're for another kind of urine analysis <unk> there are an awful lot of colors and things like that what do you actually do about that in a difficult circumstance <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 327.76 329.76 <NA> so the approach
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 330.04 335.92 <NA> we started with is to ask is it really practical to make things of this sort <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 335.71 340.24 <NA> and that problem is now in a purely engineering way solved <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 340.24 347.55 <NA> and the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper <unk> you run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 347.06 350.08 <NA> the wax printer does what looks like printing
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 351.15 358.51 <NA> <unk> you put that on you warm it a little bit the wax prints through so it absorbs into the paper and you end up with the device you want 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 358.51 361.57 <NA> the printers cost eight hundred bucks now
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 361.26 371.08 <NA> we estimate that if you were to run them twenty four hours a day they 'd make about ten million tests a year <unk> so it 's a solved problem <unk> that particular problem is solved 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 370.59 375.02 <NA> and there is an example of the kind of thing that you see that 's on a piece of eight by twelve
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 375.64 380.49 <NA> <unk> that takes about two seconds to make and so i regard that as done 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 380.25 384.45 <NA> there 's a very important issue here <unk> which is that because it 's a printer 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 384.45 391.13 <NA> a color printer it prints colors that 's what color printers do i 'll show you in a moment that 's actually quite useful 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 392.08 398.21 <NA> now the next question that you would like to ask is what would you like to measure <unk> what would you like to analyze <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 397.81 404.97 <NA> and the thing you 'd most like to analyze we 're a fair distance from it 's what 's called fever of
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 405.07 415.11 <NA> undiagnosed origin someone comes into the clinic they have a fever they feel bad <unk> what do they have do they have tb do they have aids do they have a common cold 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 414.74 422.4 <NA> the triage problem <unk> that 's a hard problem for reasons i won 't go through there are an awful lot of things that you 'd like to distinguish among <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 422.3 424.78 <NA> but then there are a series of things aids
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 430.41 437.05 <NA> <unk> such as guidance of treatment <unk> now even that 's more complicated than you think a friend of mine works in <unk>

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 443.7 450.17 <NA> so dapsone or something like that you have to take for a while he has a wonderful story of talking to a villager
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 458.29 464.15 <NA> <unk> what the guy actually meant was that he 'd fed a 30 day dose of dapsone to his dog that morning and he
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 464.56 468.54 <NA> was telling the truth <unk> because in a different culture
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 468.54 474.99 <NA> the dog is a surrogate for you today this month since the rainy season there are lots of
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 477.59 486.06 <NA> <unk> and so an issue here is to in some cases figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting like compliance 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 486.56 490.74 <NA> now <unk> take a look at what a typical test looks like 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 490.82 498.72 <NA> prick a finger <unk> you get some blood about fifty microliters that 's about all you 're going to get because you can 't use

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 501.45 509.66 <NA> <unk> you can 't manipulate it very well i 'll show something about that in a moment <unk> so you take the drop of blood no further manipulations you put it on a little device 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 509.66 518.29 <NA> the device filters out the blood cells lets the serum go through and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 517.95 520.34 <NA> and the colors
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 520.09 521.09 <NA> indicate
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 529.93 537.35 <NA> <unk> suffering from probably an excess of education what do you do about something which requires quantitative analysis <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 537.01 541.63 <NA> and so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 541.63 550.64 <NA> and at this point there is a dramatic flourish and out comes the universal solution to everything these days which is a cell phone in this particular case a camera phone 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 550.36 552.26 <NA> they 're everywhere

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 555.05 559.32 <NA> <unk> and the idea is that what one does is to
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 558.95 570.67 <NA> take the device you dip it <unk> you develop the color you take a picture the picture goes to a central laboratory you don 't have to send out a doctor <unk> you send out somebody who can just take the sample 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 570.67 574.87 <NA> and in the clinic either a doctor or ideally a computer in this case does the
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 575.55 582.41 <NA> <unk> turns out to work actually quite well <unk> particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 582.41 595.39 <NA> so my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor <unk> but an 18 year old otherwise unemployed who has two things a backpack full of these tests and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample <unk> and <unk>

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 601.53 604.94 <NA> there 's another very interesting connection here <unk> and that is
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 604.9 608.4 <NA> <unk> that what one wants to do is pass through
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 608.16 613.34 <NA> useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 627.05 636.31 <NA> and the answer is not complicated but it 's one which i don 't want to go through here <unk> other than to say that the communication systems for doing this are really pretty well understood <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 636.1 639.12 <NA> also a fact which you may not know
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 638.72 649.35 <NA> is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer this is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped <unk>

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 660.3 666 <NA> all right let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices and we 'll start by posing a little problem 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 666 669.55 <NA> what you see here is another centimeter sized device <unk>

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 680.28 686.48 <NA> get through the blue and then get through the red how does that happen how do you make something flow through something 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 686.23 694.94 <NA> and of course the answer is you don 't you make it flow under and over but now the question is how do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 694.99 701.07 <NA> the answer is that what you do and the details are not terribly important here
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 700.86 704.91 <NA> is to make something more elaborate you take several different layers of paper
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 704.87 707.98 <NA> <unk> each one containing its own little fluid system <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 707.74 715.51 <NA> and you separate them by pieces of literally double sided carpet tape <unk> the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 715.51 725.23 <NA> and the fluid will flow from one layer into the next <unk> it distributes itself flows through further holes distributes itself <unk> and what you see at the lower
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 725.82 732.1 <NA> <unk> side there is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 731.82 742.69 <NA> and it has gone through and distributed itself into these sixteen holes on the bottom in a piece of paper basically it looks like a chip two pieces of paper thick <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 742.2 749.81 <NA> and in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that but that is in principle the way you solve the fever of
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 751.45 757.59 <NA> <unk> because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 757.38 760.04 <NA> and this will work in due course <unk>
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 759.84 763.36 <NA> here is an example of a slightly more complicated device 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 763.37 772.65 <NA> there 's the chip <unk> you dip in a corner <unk> the fluid goes into the center <unk> it distributes itself out into these various wells or holes and turns color

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 780.83 787.14 <NA> now i have two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 786.77 793.8 <NA> this is one one of the things you occasionally need to do is separate blood cells from serum <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 794.3 800.02 <NA> and the question was here we do it by taking a sample we put it in a
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 803.25 809.32 <NA> <unk> you get blood cells out terrific what happens if you don 't have electricity a centrifuge and whatever <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 809.16 816.61 <NA> and we thought for a while of how you might do this and the way in fact you do it is what 's shown here you get an eggbeater 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 816.15 829.31 <NA> which is everywhere <unk> and you saw off a blade <unk> and then you take tubing and you stick it on that you put the blood in somebody sits there and spins it it works really really well <unk> and we sat down we did the physics of eggbeaters and
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 829.99 838.1 <NA> <unk> tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing and sent it off to a journal we were very proud of this particularly the title which was eggbeater as centrifuge 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 837.94 847.29 <NA> and we sent it off and by return mail it came back i called up the editor and i said what 's going on how is this possible the editor said 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 847.29 854.43 <NA> with enormous disdain i read this <unk> and we 're not going to publish it because we only publish science
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 855.29 858.64 <NA> laughter and it 's an important issue because it means that
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 858.46 867.21 <NA> we have to as a society think about what we value and if it 's just papers and phys rev letters we 've got a problem

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 870.47 874.99 <NA> this is a little spectrophotometer <unk> it measures the absorption
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 875 881.41 <NA> <unk> light in a sample <unk> the neat thing about this is you have a light source that flickers on and off at about one thousand hertz 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 881.41 888.08 <NA> another light source that detects that light at one thousand hertz <unk> and so you can run this system in broad daylight 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 887.87 893.33 <NA> it performs about equivalently to a system that 's on the order of

GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 915.94 926.06 <NA> and we 've asked what is the scientific unifying idea here <unk> and we 've decided we should think about this not so much in terms of cost but in terms of simplicity 
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 925.78 929.91 <NA> simplicity is a neat word you 've got to think about what simplicity means
GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2009X 930.17 937.77 <NA> i know what it is but i don 't actually know what it means so i actually was interested enough in this to put together
