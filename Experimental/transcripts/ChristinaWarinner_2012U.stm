ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 13.09 17.24 <NA> <unk> have you ever wondered what is inside your dental plaque <unk> 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 17.5 25.02 <NA> probably not but people like me do i 'm an archeological geneticist at the center for evolutionary medicine at the university of zurich
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 25.31 33.84 <NA> <unk> and i study the origins and evolution of human health and disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans <unk> 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 33.84 41.55 <NA> and through this work i hope to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies so that we can improve
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 41.15 49.96 <NA> and better manage our health in the future there are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine and one way is to extract human dna from ancient
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 50.73 61.78 <NA> <unk> and from these extracts we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time and look for changes that might be related to adaptations <unk> risk factors and inherited diseases <unk> 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 61.68 64.67 <NA> but this is only one half of the story 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 64.67 75.32 <NA> the most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mutations in our genome but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay between genetic variation
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 76.18 79.37 <NA> <unk> microbes and parasites and our immune response
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 78.97 90.44 <NA> <unk> all of these diseases have a strong evolutionary component that directly relates to the fact that we live today in a very different environment than the ones in which our bodies evolved <unk> 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 90.28 100.01 <NA> and in order to understand these diseases we need to move past studies of the human genome alone and towards a more holistic approach to human health in the past <unk> 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 99.76 104.7 <NA> but there are a lot of challenges for this and first of all what do we even study
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 104.99 114.27 <NA> <unk> skeletons are ubiquitous they 're found all over the place <unk> but of course all of the soft tissue has decomposed and the skeleton itself has limited health information 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 113.87 121.12 <NA> mummies are a great source of information except that they 're really geographically limited and limited in time as well <unk> 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 121.12 124.9 <NA> coprolites are fossilized human feces <unk> and they 're actually
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 125 130.64 <NA> <unk> extremely interesting you can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease but they are very rare <unk>
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 134.42 140.65 <NA> to address this problem i put together a team of international researchers in switzerland denmark and the u k 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 140.65 145.33 <NA> to study a very poorly studied little known
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 144.99 154.97 <NA> material that 's found on people everywhere <unk> it 's a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called officially dental calculus many of you
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 154.95 161.21 <NA> may know it by the term tartar it 's what the dentist cleans off your teeth every time that you go in for a visit <unk> and
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 161.21 167.24 <NA> in a typical dentistry visit you may have about fifteen to thirty milligrams removed but in ancient times
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 166.87 173.52 <NA> before tooth brushing up to six hundred milligrams might have built up on the teeth over a lifetime <unk> 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 173.52 179.22 <NA> and what 's really important about dental calculus is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 179.96 190.2 <NA> <unk> abundant in quantity before the present day and it 's ubiquitous worldwide we find it in every population around the world at all time periods going back tens of thousands of years <unk> and <unk>
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 190.1 201.4 <NA> <unk> we even find it in neanderthals and animals <unk> and so previous studies had only focused on microscopy they 'd looked at dental calculus under a microscope <unk> and what they had found was things like pollen
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 204.96 207.27 <NA> <unk> animal meats and bacteria <unk> 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 207.05 221.35 <NA> and so what my team of researchers what we wanted to do is say can we apply genetic and proteomic technology to go after dna and proteins and from this can we get better taxonomic resolution to really understand what 's going on <unk> 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 221.35 229.03 <NA> and what we found is that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria that inhabited the nasal passages and mouth 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 228.69 229.91 <NA> we also have
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 229.78 238.1 <NA> <unk> found immune proteins related to infection and inflammation and proteins and dna related to diet <unk> 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 237.79 249.29 <NA> but what was surprising to us and also quite exciting is we also found bacteria that normally inhabit upper respiratory systems so it gives us virtual access to the lungs which is where many important diseases
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 249.04 250.17 <NA> reside
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 250.76 263.31 <NA> <unk> and we also found bacteria that normally inhabit the gut <unk> and so we can also now virtually gain access to this even more distant organ system that from the skeleton alone has long decomposed <unk> 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 263.03 273.6 <NA> and so by applying ancient dna sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies to ancient dental calculus we can generate immense quantities of data that then we can use <unk>
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 273.5 279.97 <NA> <unk> to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture of the dynamic interplay between diet infection and immunity thousands
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 279.93 281.2 <NA> <unk> of years ago <unk> 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 280.98 283.69 <NA> so what started out as an idea 
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 283.29 293.56 <NA> is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long term evolutionary history of human health and disease right down to the genetic <unk>
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 293.46 299.66 <NA> <unk> code of individual pathogens <unk> and from this information we can learn about how pathogens evolve
ChristinaWarinner_2012U 1 ChristinaWarinner_2012U 304.81 316.2 <NA> <unk> value of dental calculus <unk> and as a final parting thought on behalf of future archeologists i would like to ask you to please think twice before you go home and brush your teeth
