JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 43.28 55 <NA> the second reason is that when people do get interested in it as i think they should they tend to say the most appalling things and then even when they 're not saying appalling things and they 're really trying to do serious research

JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 77.78 88.46 <NA> the thing that struck me is one guy said in exasperation a very famous neurobiologist he said look in my discipline it 's okay to be interested in consciousness but get tenure first

JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 98.19 104.67 <NA> okay now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness well i think it 's a combination

JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 221.36 229.97 <NA> it 's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was but i 'll get back to that and four maybe consciousness exists but it can 't make any

JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 363.04 370.31 <NA> let 's specify the exact features of consciousness so that we can then answer those four objections that i made to it
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 370.07 379.91 <NA> well the first feature is it 's real and irreducible you can 't get rid of it you see the distinction between reality
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 380.02 381.14 <NA> <unk> illusion
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 380.68 394.61 <NA> is the distinction between how things consciously seem to us and how they really are it consciously seems like there 's i like the french arc en ciel it seems like there 's an arch in the sky or it seems like the sun
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 394.61 400.14 <NA> is setting over the mountains it consciously seems to us but that 's not really happening
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 400.1 410.67 <NA> <unk> but for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are you can 't make that distinction for the very existence of consciousness because where the very existence <unk>
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 410.57 417.15 <NA> <unk> of consciousness is concerned if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious you are conscious
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 429.87 434.08 <NA> <unk> these guys are right you know i don 't think that for a moment because i mean
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 433.62 445.11 <NA> descartes may have made a lot of mistakes but he was right about this you cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness okay that 's the first feature of consciousness it 's real and irreducible you cannot get rid of it
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 445.11 453.71 <NA> by showing that it 's an illusion in a way that you can with other standard illusions okay the second feature is this one that has been
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 453.5 454.97 <NA> such a source of trouble to
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 454.93 465.35 <NA> <unk> us and that is all of our conscious states have this qualitative character to them there 's something that it feels like to drink beer which is not what it feels like to do your income <unk>
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 465.25 480 <NA> <unk> tax or listen to music and this qualitative feel automatically generates a third feature namely conscious states are by definition subjective in the sense that they only exist as experienced by some human or animal subject
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 480.02 490.77 <NA> <unk> some self that experiences them maybe we 'll be able to build a conscious machine since we don 't know how our brains do it we 're not in a position so far to build a conscious machine
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 490.57 495.36 <NA> okay another feature of consciousness is that it comes
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 495.36 504.97 <NA> in unified conscious fields so i don 't just have the sight of the people in front of me and the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes against the floor but they occur to me
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 504.96 514.9 <NA> <unk> as part of one single great conscious field that stretches forward and backward that is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 514.9 517.97 <NA> and we have not been able to do that in a robot
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 517.52 525.61 <NA> the disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we don 't know how to make a conscious robot so we don 't have a machine that can do this kind of thing
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 525.61 530 <NA> okay the next feature of consciousness after this marvelous unified
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 530.22 544.97 <NA> conscious field is that it functions causally in our behavior i gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand but how is that possible how can it be that this thought in my brain can move material objects
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 544.96 550.02 <NA> well i 'll tell you the answer i mean we don 't know the detailed answer but we know the basic part of
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 551.27 553.42 <NA> <unk> a sequence of neuron firings
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 553.42 562.38 <NA> and they terminate where the acetylcholine is secreted at the axon end plates of the motor neurons sorry to use philosophical terminology here but
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 562.16 572.67 <NA> but when it 's secreted at the axon end plates of the motor neurons a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels and the damned arm goes up now think of what i told you one <unk>
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 572.57 579.88 <NA> <unk> and the same event my conscious decision to raise my arm has a level of description where it has all of these

JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 591.38 595.31 <NA> through the nerve fibers in the arm now what that tells us is
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 595.31 605 <NA> that our traditional vocabularies for discussing these issues are totally obsolete one and the same event has a level of description where it 's neurobiological
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 605.4 614.42 <NA> and another level of description where it 's mental and that 's a single event and that 's how nature works that 's how it 's possible for consciousness to function causally
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 613.99 617.66 <NA> okay now with that in mind with
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 617.2 624.53 <NA> going through these various features of consciousness let 's go back and answer some of those early objections well the first one
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 624.53 629.91 <NA> i said was consciousness doesn 't exist it 's an illusion well i 've already answered that i don 't think we need to worry about that
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 629.92 633.12 <NA> but the second one had an incredible
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 633.02 636.11 <NA> influence and may still be around and that is
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 635.95 646.47 <NA> well if consciousness exists it 's really something else it 's really a digital computer program running in your brain and that 's what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right <unk>
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 646.42 652.33 <NA> program yeah forget about the hardware any hardware will do provided it 's rich enough and stable enough to carry the program
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 655.04 667.09 <NA> i mean anybody who 's thought about computers at all can see that that 's wrong because computation is defined as symbol manipulation usually thought of as zeros as ones but any symbols will do you get an algorithm
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 667.09 672.65 <NA> that you can program in a binary code and that 's the defining trait
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 672.44 675.08 <NA> of the computer program but we know
JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 675.25 686.66 <NA> <unk> that 's purely syntactical that 's symbolic we know that actual human consciousness has something more than that it 's got a content in addition to the syntax it 's got a semantics

JohnSearle_2013 1 JohnSearle_2013 766.59 779.94 <NA> doesn 't mean computation is arbitrary i spent a lot of money on this hardware hardware but we have this persistent confusion between objectivity and subjectivity as features of reality and objectivity and subjectivity
