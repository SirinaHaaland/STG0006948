SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 120.33 124.96 <NA> because as these products age <unk> they get concentrated

SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 169.9 175.11 <NA> so then i got really curious myself as a toxicologist and i
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 174.93 179.85 <NA> donated some blood to my lab and said okay let 's do it well we detected one hundred and

SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 189.98 198.99 <NA> but i was the recipient of a lot of flame retardant material for some reason and just to point out the levels

SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 225.42 229.94 <NA> so anyway here 's the problem and it is a problem that we 're looking at in the gulf today
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 230.41 237.08 <NA> we 're not regulating chemicals in this country properly we 're hardly regulating them at all

SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 267.05 269.52 <NA> so it 's a case of

SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 355.74 362.17 <NA> and as you know there 's been a very weak response up until recently to actually collect the oil 
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 361.97 368.86 <NA> it 's gotten much more aggressive this is an exxon slide showing what happens the scenario and the trade off 
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 368.86 373.66 <NA> so this shows oil on the surface you can see it getting up into the mangrove <unk> 
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 373.23 375.5 <NA> but it is not harming

SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 392.68 397.53 <NA> or two the problem is that we have
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 397.53 403.28 <NA> released so darn much of this stuff we 're climbing up to two million gallons
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 403.3 404.79 <NA> very quickly

SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 459.37 466.67 <NA> heck they 're still using it <unk> and they used the most toxic one the nine thousand five hundred and twenty seven until they ran out of supplies

SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 485.99 500.23 <NA> so this is the way it works <unk> and i want to show you this cute little thing that happens here it 's a micelle micelles form around the oil and what happens first is the solvents break into the oil
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 502.26 507.76 <NA> <unk> they let the surfactants in there the surfactants which are like things we use on fast food wrappers
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 507.76 513.04 <NA> they grab around the droplets of oil and they make little tiny droplets with

SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 536.03 540.65 <NA> from a toxicology perspective this is really awful because
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 540.25 550.23 <NA> corexit and the dispersed oil are much more toxic together than either alone <unk> and usually the exposure is a combined exposure
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 552.71 564.24 <NA> <unk> as i was saying their job is to break down the lipid membrane the solvents in them do that very efficiently <unk> so they break down lipid membranes
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 564.24 575.05 <NA> in our body <unk> starting with cells of the skin the cells of organs <unk> so it actually hastens oil getting into the body easily and readily
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 575.61 580.15 <NA> <unk> oil contains hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds and other compounds
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 579.66 589.15 <NA> that are toxic to every organ in the body and so with the dispersants combined you have this very synergistic combined toxicity 
SusanShaw_2010X 1 SusanShaw_2010X 589.5 598.43 <NA> corexit also contains petroleum solvents and many other toxic compounds and i 'm part of a chat group <unk> which is a national
