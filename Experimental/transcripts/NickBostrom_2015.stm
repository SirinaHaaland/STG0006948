NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 895.71 903.59 <NA> esoteric issues that would need to be solved <unk> sorted out the exact details of its decision theory how to deal with logical uncertainty and so forth
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 905.08 910.76 <NA> <unk> so the technical problems that need to be solved to make this work look quite difficult not as difficult as making a <unk>
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 912.25 914.45 <NA> but fairly difficult 
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 915.13 922.34 <NA> here is the worry making superintelligent a i is a really hard challenge <unk> making <unk>
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 923.55 929.88 <NA> that is safe involves some additional challenge on top of that the risk is that if somebody figures out
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 929.96 938.55 <NA> <unk> to crack the first challenge without also having cracked the additional challenge of ensuring perfect safety <unk> so i think that
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 938.39 946.14 <NA> we should work out a solution to the control problem in advance so that we have it available by the time it is needed <unk> 
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 946.28 952.15 <NA> now it might be that we cannot solve the entire control problem in advance because maybe some elements
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 951.96 954.55 <NA> can only be put in place once you know the details of
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 954.87 959.74 <NA> <unk> the architecture where it will be implemented <unk> but the more of the control problem
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 959.25 965.8 <NA> that we solve in advance <unk> the better the odds that the transition to the machine intelligence era will go well
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 965.88 970.73 <NA> <unk> this to me looks like a thing that is well worth doing
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 970.55 973 <NA> and i can imagine that if
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 972.54 975.1 <NA> things turn out okay <unk> that
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 974.88 979.85 <NA> people a million years from now look back at this century and it might well be that
NickBostrom_2015 1 NickBostrom_2015 979.93 984.36 <NA> they say that the one thing we did that really mattered was to get this thing right thank
