AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 45.74 54.73 <NA> this happened the economy ran out of jobs <unk> and a couple of things struck me about this one don 't listen to career advisers
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 55.68 60.88 <NA> and two actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 60.42 68.38 <NA> which is that as a society we 've never needed design thinking more and yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 68.4 76.9 <NA> it strikes me that we talk very deeply about design but actually there 's an economics behind architecture that we don 't talk about and i think we need to 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 76.68 79.97 <NA> and a good place to start is your own paycheck
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 80.28 89.18 <NA> <unk> so as a bottom of the rung architecture graduate i might expect to earn about twenty four thousand pounds that 's about thirty six thousand thirty seven thousand dollars

AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 99.85 104.97 <NA> the uncomfortable fact is that actually almost everything that we call architecture
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 105.01 106.01 <NA> today
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 105.76 112.68 <NA> is actually the business of designing for about the richest one percent of the world 's population <unk> and it always has been 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 112.61 120.9 <NA> the reason why we forgot that is because the times in history when architecture did the most to transform society were those times when 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 120.9 127.03 <NA> actually the one percent would build on behalf of the ninety nine percent for various different reasons whether that was through philanthropy in the
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 130.13 136.66 <NA> the welfare state <unk> and most recently of course <unk> through this inflated real estate bubble

AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 152.89 160.25 <NA> now it 's not just that that 's bad for democracy though i think it probably is it 's actually not a very clever business strategy actually 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 159.97 166.88 <NA> i think the challenge facing the next generation of architects is how are we going to turn our client from the one percent

AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 168.88 174.23 <NA> and i want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas for how it might be done <unk> 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 174.07 179.67 <NA> the first is i think we need to question this idea that architecture is about making buildings
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 180.14 185.76 <NA> <unk> actually a building is about the most expensive solution you can think of to almost any given problem <unk> 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 185.48 196.38 <NA> and fundamentally design should be much much more interested in solving problems and creating new conditions so here 's a story <unk> the office was working with a school and they had an old victorian school building <unk> 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 196.38 197.41 <NA> and
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 197.19 204.4 <NA> they said to the architects look our corridors are an absolute nightmare they 're far too small they get congested between classes there 's bullying
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 205.02 212.65 <NA> <unk> 't control them <unk> so what we want you to do is re plan our entire building and we know it 's going to cost several million pounds but we 're reconciled to the fact 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 212.37 220.09 <NA> and the team thought about this and they went away and they said actually <unk> don 't do that instead get rid of the school bell 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 220.09 229.46 <NA> and instead of having one school bell that goes off once have several smaller school bells that go off in different places and different times distribute the traffic through the corridors
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 230.02 236.03 <NA> <unk> solves the same problem <unk> but instead of spending several million pounds <unk> you spend several hundred pounds <unk> 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 235.93 245.48 <NA> now it looks like you 're doing yourself out of a job but you 're not you 're actually making yourself more useful architects are actually really really good at this kind of resourceful strategic thinking
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 245.11 253.41 <NA> <unk> and the problem is that like a lot of design professions we got fixated on the idea of providing a particular kind of consumer product <unk> and i don 't think that needs to be the case anymore
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 255.41 258.7 <NA> <unk> the second idea worth questioning is this 20th century thing
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 258.52 264.36 <NA> that mass architecture is about big big buildings and big finance 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 263.87 269.56 <NA> actually we 've got ourselves locked into this industrial era mindset which says that
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 269.33 279.94 <NA> the only people who can make cities are large organizations or corporations who build on our behalf procuring whole neighborhoods in single <unk> monolithic projects and of course
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 280.01 286.27 <NA> <unk> form follows finance <unk> so what you end up with are single monolithic neighborhoods based on this kind of <unk>
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 288.15 291.28 <NA> <unk> model <unk> and a lot of people can 't even afford them <unk> 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 291.66 299.98 <NA> but what if actually it 's possible now for cities to be made not just by the few with a lot but also by the many with a bit <unk> 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 300.27 304.94 <NA> and when they do they bring with them a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 305.01 317.15 <NA> <unk> and it raises really interesting questions about how will we plan cities how will finance development how will we sell design services what would it mean for democratic societies to offer their citizens a right to build 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 316.78 319.98 <NA> and in a way it should be kind of obvious right that
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 319.81 323.57 <NA> in the 21st century maybe cities can be developed by citizens 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 324.76 329.97 <NA> and thirdly we need to remember that from a strictly economic point of view
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 330.32 334.71 <NA> design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 334.34 336.96 <NA> mostly it 's done by amateurs <unk> 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 337.61 339.37 <NA> and that 's a good thing 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 339.37 347.34 <NA> most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy in what 's called the social economy or the core economy which is people doing it for themselves <unk> 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 347.39 348.76 <NA> and
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 348.57 354.25 <NA> the problem is that up until now it was the monetary economy which had all the infrastructure and all the tools
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 354.93 364.41 <NA> <unk> so the challenge we face is how are we going to build the tools the infrastructure and the institutions for architecture 's social economy <unk> and that began with open source software <unk> 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 364.42 374.26 <NA> and over the last few years it 's been moving into the physical world with open source hardware which are freely shared blueprints that anyone can download and make for themselves <unk> 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 374.46 379.97 <NA> and that 's where 3d printing gets really really interesting right when suddenly you had
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 380.28 385.31 <NA> a 3d printer that was open source the parts for which could be made on another 3d printer 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 384.88 392.48 <NA> or the same idea here which is for a cnc machine which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 392.74 402 <NA> what these technologies are doing is radically lowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill <unk> they 're challenging the idea that if you want something to be affordable it 's got to be

AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 409.01 417.6 <NA> we 're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere <unk> and increasingly that means that the design team is everyone 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 417.56 425.05 <NA> that really is an industrial revolution and when we think that the major ideological conflicts that we inherited were all
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 425 434.23 <NA> based around this question of who should control the means of production and these technologies are coming back with a solution <unk> actually <unk> maybe no one all of us <unk> 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 434.46 438.85 <NA> and we were fascinated by what that might mean for architecture 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 438.84 446.8 <NA> so about a year and a half ago <unk> we started working on a project called wikihouse and wikihouse is an open source construction system 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 446.46 449.87 <NA> and the idea is to make it possible for anyone to go
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 450.28 453.5 <NA> <unk> access a freely shared library of 3d models
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 453.5 462.56 <NA> which they can download and adapt in at the moment sketchup because it 's free and it 's easy to use <unk> and almost at the click of a switch
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 462.43 464.85 <NA> they can generate a set of cutting files
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 464.61 473.96 <NA> which allow them in effect to print out the parts from a house using a cnc machine and a standard sheet material like plywood <unk> and
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 473.96 479.7 <NA> the parts are all numbered <unk> and basically what you end up with is a really big ikea kit
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 482.3 492.24 <NA> and it goes together without any bolts <unk> it uses wedge and peg connections <unk> and even the mallets to make it can be provided on the cutting sheets as well <unk> 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 491.87 498.99 <NA> and a team of about two or three people working together can build this they don 't need any traditional construction skills 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 498.99 504.97 <NA> they don 't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that and they can build a small house of about this size

AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 530.17 541.46 <NA> <unk> our heads here so the house is not a finished product with the cnc machine you can make new parts for it over its life or even use it to make the house next door so we can begin to see the seed of a completely <unk>

AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 550.82 558.27 <NA> <unk> some really interesting lessons here <unk> one of them is that it 's always incredibly sociable people get confused between construction work and having fun
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 559.1 564.91 <NA> but the principles of openness go right down into the really mundane physical details 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 564.91 574.29 <NA> like never designing a piece that can 't be lifted up or when you 're designing a piece make sure you either can 't put it in the wrong way round or if you do it doesn 't matter because it 's symmetrical 
AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 574.61 577.42 <NA> probably the principal which

AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 593.07 599.14 <NA> contrary to almost everything that you might get taught at an architecture school copying is good

AlastairParvin_2013 1 AlastairParvin_2013 601.16 615.36 <NA> because actually this approach is not innovative it 's actually how we built buildings for hundreds of years before the industrial revolution in these sorts of community barn raisings the only difference between traditional vernacular architecture and open source architecture
