AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 30.28 36.81 <NA> traditional definition is an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 36.81 50.37 <NA> that came from a one thousand nine hundred and sixty paper on space travel because if you think about it space is pretty awkward people aren 't supposed to be there <unk> but humans are curious and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next <unk> 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 49.94 54.97 <NA> so let 's look at the concept of traditional anthropology <unk> somebody goes to another country
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 55.14 65.08 <NA> <unk> says how fascinating these people are how interesting their tools are how curious their culture is and then they write a paper and maybe a few other anthropologists read it and we think it 's very exotic <unk> 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 65.08 67.09 <NA> well <unk> what 's happening is that

AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 85.33 100.23 <NA> now there 's a reason why i study this versus traditional anthropology and the reason is that tool use <unk> in the beginning for thousands and thousands of years everything has been a physical modification of self it has helped us to extend our physical selves go faster
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 100.04 108.39 <NA> <unk> hit things harder <unk> and there 's been a limit on that but now what we 're looking at is not an extension of the physical self but an extension of the mental self <unk> 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 108.22 118.59 <NA> and because of that we 're able to travel faster <unk> communicate differently <unk> and the other thing that happens is that we 're all carrying around little mary poppins technology we can put anything we want <unk>
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 118.49 129.85 <NA> <unk> into it and it doesn 't get heavier <unk> and then we can take anything out what does the inside of your computer actually look like well if you print it out it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you 're carrying around all the time and if you
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 129.81 141.79 <NA> <unk> actually lose that information <unk> it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind that you suddenly feel like something 's missing except you aren 't able to see it so it feels like a very strange emotion 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 141.36 149.75 <NA> the other thing that happens is that you have a second self <unk> whether you like it or not you 're starting to show up online and people are interacting with your second self when you 're not
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 150.46 163.16 <NA> <unk> and so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open which is basically your facebook wall so that people don 't write on it in the middle of the night because it 's very much the equivalent and suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 162.99 173.54 <NA> you have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life so in the same way that you wake up take a shower and get dressed you have to learn to do that for your digital self <unk>
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 173.49 179.94 <NA> and the problem is that a lot of people now especially adolescents have to go through two adolescences they have
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 179.96 188.4 <NA> <unk> go through their primary one that 's already awkward and then they go through their second self 's adolescence <unk> and that 's even more awkward because there 's an actual
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 188.24 199.71 <NA> history of what they 've gone through online <unk> and anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now <unk> and so it 's very awkward and it 's very difficult for them to do those things

AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 213.99 227.06 <NA> he said no no <unk> no here 's a better way he took a piece of paper drew a and b on one side and the other and folded them together so where a and b touched <unk> and he said that is the shortest distance between two points and i said
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 229.93 240.41 <NA> <unk> time and space it takes an awful lot of energy <unk> and that 's just how you do it and i said i want to do that and he said well okay and so when i went to sleep for the next <unk>
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 240.36 251.43 <NA> ten or twenty years <unk> i was thinking at night i want to be the first person to create a wormhole to make things accelerate faster and i want to make a time machine i was always sending messages to my future self
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 256.04 261.82 <NA> <unk> but then what i realized when i went to college is that technology doesn 't just get adopted because
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 261.82 273.66 <NA> it works it gets adopted because people use it and it 's made for humans so i started studying anthropology <unk> and when i was writing my thesis on cell phones i realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets <unk> 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 273.2 275.08 <NA> they weren 't physically transporting
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 275.58 284.62 <NA> <unk> they were mentally transporting themselves they would click on a button <unk> and they would be connected as a to b immediately <unk> and i thought oh wow i found it this is great 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 284.22 287.93 <NA> so over time time and space have have compressed
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 287.51 292.36 <NA> because of this you can stand on one side of the world whisper something and be heard on the other 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 292.47 299.78 <NA> one of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use every single browser tab gives you a different type of
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 300.49 311.09 <NA> <unk> and because of that you start to dig around for your external memories where did you leave them so now we 're all these paleontologists that are that are digging for things that we 've lost on our external brains that we 're carrying around in our pockets <unk> 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 310.96 314.66 <NA> and that incites a sort of panic architecture oh no where 's this thing <unk>

AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 321.19 329.91 <NA> and so what happens is when we bring all that into the social space we end up checking our phones all the time so we have this thing called ambient intimacy it 's not that we 're always
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 329.87 333.7 <NA> <unk> connected to everybody but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want <unk> 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 333.7 344.29 <NA> and if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone the room would be very crowded these are the people that you have access to right now in general all of these people all of your friends and family that you can connect to

AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 352.23 354.61 <NA> and that they aren 't slowing down and stopping
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 355.05 362.2 <NA> <unk> all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces paleontology and panic architecture <unk> 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 361.86 367.24 <NA> they 're not just sitting there <unk> and really when you have no external input 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 367.24 379.97 <NA> that is a time when there is a creation of self when you can do <unk> long term planning when you can try and figure out who you really are and then once you do that you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way <unk> instead of just dealing with everything
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 380.02 389.06 <NA> <unk> as it comes in and oh i have to do this and i have to do this and i have to do this <unk> and so this is very important i 'm really worried that especially kids today they 're not going to be

AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 406.44 413.41 <NA> but when you actually visualize it all the connections that we 're doing right now this is an image of the mapping of the internet
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 413.17 423 <NA> it doesn 't look technological it actually looks very organic this is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we 've connected in this way and <unk>
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 424.36 429.97 <NA> it 's not that machines are taking over it 's that they 're helping us to be more human helping us to connect with each other
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 430.07 435.04 <NA> the most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives <unk> 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 435.33 442.42 <NA> and really <unk> it ends up being more human than technology because we 're co creating each other all the time 
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 441.99 448.7 <NA> and so this is this is the important point that i like to study that things are beautiful that it 's still a human connection
AmberCase_2010W 1 AmberCase_2010W 448.54 458.45 <NA> it 's just done in a different way we 're just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other regardless of geography <unk> so that 's why i study cyborg anthropology <unk> thank you
