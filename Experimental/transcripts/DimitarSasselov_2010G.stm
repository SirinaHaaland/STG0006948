DimitarSasselov_2010G 1 DimitarSasselov_2010G 393.1 399.93 <NA> the small planets dominated and there was a certain harmony to that which actually copernicus was very happy to note and

DimitarSasselov_2010G 1 DimitarSasselov_2010G 432.96 438.1 <NA> unfortunately as you can see there was a very different picture <unk>
