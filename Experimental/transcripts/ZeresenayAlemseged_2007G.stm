ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 769.93 779.31 <NA> report would be that 's what somehow we were doing so far in the absence of the fossil children <unk> so i think the new fossil fixes this problem
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 780.65 785.55 <NA> so i think the most important question at the end is 
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 785.81 791.04 <NA> what do we actually learn from specimens like this and from our past in general 
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 791.9 800.86 <NA> of course in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human you know the many human ancestors
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 800.7 804.76 <NA> that have existed over the past six million years and there are more than ten
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 804.87 811.03 <NA> <unk> did not have the knowledge the technology and sophistications that we homo sapiens have today <unk> but
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 811.03 818.9 <NA> if this species ancient species would travel in time and see us today <unk> they would very much be very proud of
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 818.69 820.21 <NA> their legacy <unk> 
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 821.37 825.08 <NA> because they became the ancestors of the most successful species
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 825.04 832.73 <NA> <unk> in the universe and they were probably not aware of this future legacy but they did great now the question is we homo sapiens today
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 832.73 836.91 <NA> are in a position to decide about the future of
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 836.46 841.73 <NA> our planet <unk> possibly more so the question is are we up to the challenge <unk> 
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 841.57 846.77 <NA> and can we really do better than these primitive small brained ancestors 
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 847.48 849.77 <NA> among the most pressing
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 849.58 854.82 <NA> challenges that our species is faced with today are the chronic
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 854.83 861.51 <NA> problems of africa <unk> needless to list them here and there are more competent people to talk about this 
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 862.46 870.79 <NA> still in my opinion we have two choices one is
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 870.6 875.14 <NA> to continue to see a poor ill crying africa
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 875.16 880.69 <NA> <unk> carrying guns that depends on other people forever or
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 881.31 883.27 <NA> to promote
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 882.87 890.35 <NA> an africa which is confident peaceful independent but cognizant of its huge problems and
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 890.49 899.65 <NA> great values at the same time i am for the second option <unk> and i 'm sure many of you are and the key
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 899.64 904.97 <NA> is to promote a positive african attitude towards africa
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 907.51 909.44 <NA> that 's because
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 909.67 916.91 <NA> we africans concentrate i am from ethiopia by the way we concentrate too much on how we are seen from
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 916.99 925.23 <NA> elsewhere or from outside <unk> i think it 's important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 926.36 935.04 <NA> <unk> that 's what i call positive african attitude so finally i would like to say so let 's help africa
ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 1 ZeresenayAlemseged_2007G 934.85 943.81 <NA> walk upright and forward then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species <unk> thank you
