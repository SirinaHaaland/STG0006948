GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 512.04 520.94 <NA> the question is <unk> why is binary simpler than arabic <unk> and the answer is simply that if i hold up three fingers <unk> you can count that easily <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 520.94 525.22 <NA> but if i hold up this it 's sort of hard to say that i just did seven <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 524.73 529.85 <NA> the virtue of binary is that it 's the simplest possible way of representing numbers
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 529.87 532.13 <NA> anything else is more complicated
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 531.9 537.77 <NA> <unk> you can catch errors with it it 's unambiguous in its reading there are lots of good things about binary <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 537.77 541.64 <NA> so it is very very simple once you learn how to read it
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 541.93 549.12 <NA> <unk> now <unk> if you like to represent this zero and one of binary <unk> you need a device <unk> and

GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 559.55 565.45 <NA> but our friends who are condensed matter physicists managed to come up some fifty years ago 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 565.45 569.94 <NA> with a very nice device shown under that bell jar <unk> which is a transistor 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 569.48 579.01 <NA> a transistor is nothing more than a wall switch <unk> it turns things on and off <unk> but it does so without moving parts and it doesn 't fail basically for a very long period of time
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 579.99 584.44 <NA> <unk> second layer of simplicity was the transistor in the internet <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 584.52 589.94 <NA> so <unk> since the transistor is so simple <unk> you can put lots of them together 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 589.7 594.47 <NA> and you put lots of them together and you come with something called integrated circuits

GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 602.82 604.82 <NA> so that 's the next layer of
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 604.72 612.08 <NA> <unk> simplicity and in fact integrated circuits are really simple in the sense that they in general work really well 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 612.01 615.74 <NA> with integrated circuits <unk> you can build cellphones 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 615.31 624.2 <NA> you all are accustomed to having your cellphones work the large majority of the time in boston boston is a little bit like namibia in its cell phone coverage

GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 647.42 654.79 <NA> <unk> and from that comes the internet and this is a map of bitflows across the continent the two blobs that are
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 655.08 661.06 <NA> <unk> in the middle there are the united states and europe and then back to simplicity again 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 661.08 668.71 <NA> so here we have what i think is one of the great ideas which is google which in this simple portal
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 668.34 673.93 <NA> makes the claim that it makes accessible all of the world 's information <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 673.62 679.82 <NA> but the point is that that extraordinary simple idea rests on layers
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 680.28 688.67 <NA> simplicity each compounded into a complexity that is itself simple in the sense that it is completely reliable 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 689.41 694.26 <NA> all right <unk> let me then finish off with four
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 694.09 700.22 <NA> general statements an example and two aphorisms <unk> the
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 699.82 703.86 <NA> characteristics which i think are useful to think about for simple things

GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 720.74 724.99 <NA> the second is and this is a real world statement <unk> they 're cheap
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 725.85 732.46 <NA> <unk> if you have things that are cheap enough people will find uses for them even if they seem very primitive

GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 755.62 762.35 <NA> for cost and then i would propose as this last component
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 762.15 768.71 <NA> that they serve or have the potential to serve as building blocks that is <unk> you can stack them

GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 939.47 946.93 <NA> and i think that 's a very good way of thinking about the problem <unk> if you take too much out of something that 's simple you lose function <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 946.93 950.2 <NA> you have to have low cost but you also have to have a function
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 951.24 953.02 <NA> <unk> you can 't make it too simple 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 952.83 960.73 <NA> and the second is a design issue and it 's not directly relevant but it 's a nice statement this is by de saint exupery 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 960.54 964.1 <NA> and he says you know you 've achieved perfection in design 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 964.1 972.01 <NA> not when you have nothing more to add <unk> but when you have nothing more to take away and that certainly is going in the right direction <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 972.12 977.08 <NA> so what i think one can begin to do with
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 976.65 978.73 <NA> this kind of
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 978.6 979.97 <NA> cut at the
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 979.93 990.18 <NA> <unk> word simplicity which doesn 't cover brancusi it doesn 't answer the question of why mondrian is better or worse or simpler or less simpler than van gogh 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 990.18 994.61 <NA> and certainly doesn 't address the question of whether mozart is simpler than bach <unk> 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 994.21 1004.94 <NA> but it does make a point which is one which in a sense differentiates the real world of people who make things <unk> and the world of people who think about things
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1004.95 1017.7 <NA> which is <unk> there is an intellectual merit to asking <unk> how do we make things as simple as we can as cheap as we can as functional as we can and as freely interconnectable as we can 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1017.7 1024.9 <NA> if we make that kind of simplicity in our technology and then give it to you guys <unk> you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1043.4 1050.05 <NA> <unk> of simplicity might get to the point where you could look out at various systems say a financial system or a legal system health
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1051.63 1057.26 <NA> <unk> that has got to the point of danger or dysfunctionality for the following reasons and this is how we might simplify it george whitesides yes 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1057.05 1067.33 <NA> i think you could because if you look at the components from which the system is made and examine their fragility or their stability <unk> you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that <unk>
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1067.23 1074.98 <NA> <unk> basis ca have you started to do that i mean with the health system you got a sort of radical solution on the cost side but in terms of the system itself 
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1083.65 1085.05 <NA> <unk> that diagnostic
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1084.87 1095.12 <NA> technology that you 've got where is that and when do you see that maybe getting rolled out to scale gw that 's coming out soon i mean the systems work and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things <unk>
GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1 GeorgeWhitesides_2010 1095.07 1101.46 <NA> of this kind but the basic technology works ca you 've got a company set up to gw a foundation a foundation
