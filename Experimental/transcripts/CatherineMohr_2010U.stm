CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 19.78 27.03 <NA> <unk> robotic surgery geek <unk> and i really want to build green <unk> but i 'm very suspicious of all of these
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 29.99 36.42 <NA> <unk> moral authority and short on data telling me how to do these kinds of things <unk> and so i have to figure this out for myself 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 35.93 45.81 <NA> for example is this evil <unk> i have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self actualized local cows on my counter top 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 45.35 48.78 <NA> and i grab a paper towel and i want to wipe it up <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 48.38 49.78 <NA> but can i use a paper
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 51.9 59.16 <NA> <unk> the answer to this can be found in embodied energy <unk> this is the amount of energy that goes into any paper towel or embodied water <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 59.16 66.46 <NA> and every time i use a paper towel i am using this much virtual energy and water <unk> wipe it up <unk> throw it away <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 66.09 72.13 <NA> now if i compare that to a cotton towel that i can use a thousand times 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 71.94 74.95 <NA> i don 't have a whole lot of embodied energy
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 74.7 79.55 <NA> until i wash that yogurty towel this is now operating energy
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 79.99 86.75 <NA> <unk> if i throw my towel in the washing machine <unk> i 've now put energy and water back into that towel <unk> unless i use a <unk>
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 87.76 90.35 <NA> <unk> washing machine and then it looks a little bit better <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 90.37 97.43 <NA> but what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets well now a paper towel looks better <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 97 104.97 <NA> screw the paper towels let 's go to a sponge i wipe it up with a sponge and i put it under the running water <unk> and i have a lot less energy and a lot more water <unk> unless you 're like
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 104.9 114.21 <NA> <unk> me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on and then you start to use more energy or worse you let it run until it 's warm to rinse out your towel 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 113.78 117.15 <NA> and now all bets are off so
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 117.29 124.93 <NA> what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect the position in which you put the handle
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 125.25 132.88 <NA> <unk> have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house <unk>
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 136.71 149.99 <NA> <unk> what my husband and i are doing right now <unk> and so <unk> we wanted to know how green could we be and there 's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade offs and they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 150 154.17 <NA> <unk> missing the elephant in the living room now the average house
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 154.17 161.27 <NA> has about three hundred megawatt hours of embodied energy in it this is the energy it takes to make it
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 160.99 165.98 <NA> millions and millions of paper towels <unk> we wanted to know how much better we could do <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 165.58 174.93 <NA> and so like many people we start with a house on a lot and i 'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we 're doing on the bottom <unk> so first we
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 176.3 183.15 <NA> <unk> takes some energy but if you deconstruct it you take it all apart you use the bits you can get some of that energy back <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 183.17 193.39 <NA> we then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent <unk> and then we poured a big foundation for passive solar <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 193.39 199.65 <NA> now you can reduce the embodied energy by about twenty five percent by using high fly ash concrete <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 199.37 204.01 <NA> we then put in framing <unk> and so this is framing lumber
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 205.17 206.22 <NA> <unk> materials
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 205.88 213.43 <NA> and it 's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that but it can be a sustainable resource if you use fsc certified lumber <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 213.99 221.36 <NA> we then go on to the first thing that was very surprising if we put aluminum windows in this house 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 221.36 225.05 <NA> we would double the energy use right there now
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 225.04 233.15 <NA> <unk> pvc is a little bit better <unk> but still not as good as the wood that we chose <unk> we then put in plumbing electrical and hvac <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 232.78 240.92 <NA> and insulate now <unk> spray foam is an excellent insulator it fills in all the cracks but it is pretty high embodied energy 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 240.52 248.49 <NA> and sprayed in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that we also used straw bale
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 248.31 249.93 <NA> infill for our library 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 250 259.35 <NA> which has zero embodied energy when it comes time to sheetrock <unk> if you use ecorock it 's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 259.37 264 <NA> and then you get to the finishes the subject of all of those go green articles 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 264 270.72 <NA> and on the scale of a house they almost make no difference at all and yet all the press is focused on that 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 270.47 274.99 <NA> except for flooring <unk> if you put carpeting in your house it 's about a tenth of
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 275.04 280.69 <NA> <unk> embodied energy of the entire house unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 280.69 289.63 <NA> so now we add in the final construction energy we add it all up <unk> and we 've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 289.23 293.05 <NA> but before we pat ourselves too much on the back <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 292.62 300.14 <NA> we have poured one hundred and fifty one megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 300.64 308.37 <NA> <unk> and so the question is how could we make that back <unk> and so if i run my new energy efficient house forward compared with the old
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 309.37 312.47 <NA> <unk> house we make it back in about six years 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 312.37 318.98 <NA> now <unk> i probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy efficient and in that case 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 318.61 322.79 <NA> it would take me more about twenty years to break even 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 322.54 324.93 <NA> now if i hadn 't paid attention to embodied
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 325.58 329.13 <NA> <unk> it would have taken us over fifty years to break even
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 328.64 331.44 <NA> compared to the upgraded house 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 331.07 340.35 <NA> so what does this mean on the scale of my portion of the house this is equivalent to about as much as i drive in a year 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 339.92 347.37 <NA> it 's about five times as much as if i went entirely vegetarian <unk> but my elephant in the living room flies <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 347.06 350.34 <NA> clearly i need to walk home from ted <unk> 
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 350.18 351.54 <NA> but
CatherineMohr_2010U 1 CatherineMohr_2010U 351.38 360.73 <NA> all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog and remember it 's sometimes the things that you are not expecting to be the biggest changes that are
