AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 16.42 24.84 <NA> in october i spent some time in the democratic republic of congo <unk> which is the [ second ] largest country in africa in fact it 's as large as western europe <unk>
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 25.25 28.5 <NA> <unk> but it only has three hundred miles of paved roads 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 28.79 36.12 <NA> the drc is a dangerous place in the past ten years five million people have died due to a war in the east 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 36.12 40.08 <NA> but war isn 't the only reason that life is difficult in the drc 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 39.62 42.33 <NA> there are many health issues as well 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 42.26 49.9 <NA> in fact the hiv prevalence rate is one point three percent among adults this might not sound like a large number <unk> but in a
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 51.06 56.41 <NA> <unk> million people it means there are nine hundred and thirty thousand that are infected <unk> 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 55.98 63.19 <NA> and due to the poor infrastructure only twenty five percent of those are receiving the life saving drugs that they need <unk> 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 62.85 69.11 <NA> which is why in part donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost <unk> 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 69.11 73.69 <NA> and so while i was in the drc i spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms <unk> 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 73.29 75.25 <NA> including damien 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 74.94 79.88 <NA> damien runs a hotel outside of kinshasa it 's a hotel that 's only open
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 79.84 86.21 <NA> <unk> until midnight so it 's not a place that you stay <unk> but it is a place where sex workers and their clients come 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 85.75 92.33 <NA> now damien knows all about condoms <unk> but he doesn 't sell them he said there 's just not in demand <unk> 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 92.14 98 <NA> it 's not surprising <unk> because only three percent of people in the drc use condoms <unk> 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 97.69 103.26 <NA> joseph and christine who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms said
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 103.05 104.94 <NA> despite the fact that donor agencies
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 104.87 109.59 <NA> <unk> provide them at low or no cost <unk> and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 109.22 114.59 <NA> their customers don 't buy the branded versions they like the generics <unk> 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 114.59 120.84 <NA> and as a marketer i found that curious <unk> and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 120.41 124.48 <NA> and it turns out that there are three main messages used
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 131.79 137.05 <NA> <unk> they name the condoms things like vive to live or trust 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 137.01 145 <NA> they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv <unk> put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them <unk> 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 144.9 150.02 <NA> show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 150 158.18 <NA> <unk> to act prudently now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 160.9 164.87 <NA> what is it that you think about just before you get a condom 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 165.46 168.11 <NA> sex <unk> 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 168.22 175.67 <NA> and the private companies that sell condoms in these places <unk> they understand this their marketing is slightly different 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 175.57 179.55 <NA> the name might not be much different <unk> but the imagery sure is
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 180.14 182.97 <NA> <unk> some brands are aspirational
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 183.23 187.71 <NA> <unk> and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative <unk> 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 187.7 195.82 <NA> and this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing understanding
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 195.61 204.49 <NA> who 's the audience and for donor agencies unfortunately the audience tends to be people that aren 't even in the country they 're working
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 204.99 210.34 <NA> <unk> 's people back home people that support their work people like these 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 211.05 218.48 <NA> but if what we 're really trying to do is stop the spread of hiv we need to think about the customer 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 218.48 221.29 <NA> the people whose behavior needs to change
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 221.07 229.85 <NA> the couples the young women the young men whose lives depend on it and so the lesson is
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 229.81 233.45 <NA> <unk> this it doesn 't really matter what you 're selling 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 232.99 242.27 <NA> you just have to think about who is your customer <unk> and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior it might just save their lives <unk> 
AmyLockwood_2011G 1 AmyLockwood_2011G 242.2 243.21 <NA> thank you
