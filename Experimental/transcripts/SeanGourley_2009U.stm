SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 12.28 20.57 <NA> <unk> we look around the media as we see on the news from iraq afghanistan sierra leone <unk> and the conflict seems
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 20.56 29.97 <NA> incomprehensible to us <unk> and that 's certainly how it seemed to me when i started this project <unk> but as a physicist i thought <unk> well if you give me some
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 29.99 37.25 <NA> <unk> data i could maybe understand this you know give us a go <unk> so as a naive new zealander i thought well i 'll go to the pentagon 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 37.26 39.33 <NA> can you get me some information 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 43.4 45.72 <NA> so i had to think a little harder <unk> 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 45.59 54.09 <NA> and i was watching the news one night in oxford <unk> and i looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice <unk> and i saw that there was information there 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 54.78 60.88 <NA> <unk> data within the streams of news that we consume all this noise around us actually has information
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 61.17 69.13 <NA> so what i started thinking was perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here if we can get enough of these streams of information together <unk> 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 69.13 72.04 <NA> we can perhaps start to understand the war
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 71.73 78.41 <NA> so this is exactly what i did we started bringing a team together an interdisciplinary team of scientists of economists
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 80.13 83.37 <NA> we brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this <unk>
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 83.13 92.48 <NA> we did it in three steps the first step we did was to collect <unk> we did one hundred and thirty different sources of information from ngo reports to newspapers and cable news
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 92.28 98.54 <NA> we brought this raw data in and we filtered it <unk> we extracted the key bits on information to build the database <unk>
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 98.54 104.94 <NA> that database contained the timing of attacks the location the size and the weapons used it 's all
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 104.9 116.22 <NA> <unk> in the streams of information we consume daily <unk> we just have to know how to pull it out and once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff what if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks <unk> what would that tell us
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 116.12 125.08 <NA> so we started doing this and you can see here on the horizontal axis you 've got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack <unk> and on the vertical
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 125.04 127.11 <NA> <unk> axis you 've got the number of attacks 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 127.11 136.87 <NA> so we plot data for sample on this you see some sort of random distribution perhaps sixty seven attacks one person was killed or forty seven attacks where seven people were killed <unk>
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 136.86 145.45 <NA> we did this exact same thing for iraq and we didn 't know for iraq what we were going to find it turns out what we found was pretty surprising 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 145.5 151.88 <NA> you take all of the conflict all of the chaos all of the noise <unk> and out of that
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 151.72 154.94 <NA> comes this precise mathematical distribution of the
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 154.87 162.74 <NA> <unk> way attacks are ordered in this conflict this blew our mind why should a conflict like iraq have this
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 162.74 170.46 <NA> as its fundamental signature <unk> why should there be order in war <unk> we didn 't really understand that we thought
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 170.25 180 <NA> maybe there is something special about iraq so we looked at a few more conflicts <unk> we looked at colombia we looked at afghanistan <unk> and we looked at senegal and the same pattern
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 180.19 187.89 <NA> emerged in each conflict this wasn 't supposed to happen these are different wars with different religious factions different political factions <unk> 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 187.52 192.72 <NA> and different socioeconomic problems and yet the fundamental patterns underlying them
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 192.32 193.32 <NA> are
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 193.03 194.58 <NA> the same
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 195.35 197.46 <NA> so we went a little wider
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 197.9 204.97 <NA> <unk> we looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on from peru to indonesia we
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 204.9 207.76 <NA> <unk> studied this same pattern again <unk> and we found
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 207.56 216.49 <NA> that not only were the distributions these straight lines <unk> but the slope of these lines they clustered around this value of alpha equals two point five <unk> 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 216.21 223.06 <NA> and we could generate an equation that could predict the likelihood of an attack what we 're saying here
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 222.93 229.97 <NA> is the probability of an attack killing x number of people in a country like iraq is equal to a constant
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 230.28 238.73 <NA> <unk> times the size of that attack <unk> raised to the power of negative alpha <unk> and negative alpha is the slope of that line i showed you before
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 241 242.84 <NA> so what 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 242.71 250.14 <NA> this is data statistics what does it tell us about these conflicts that was a challenge we had to face as physicists how do we explain
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 252.02 258.66 <NA> <unk> and what we really found was that alpha if we think about it is the organizational structure of the insurgency 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 258.35 263.98 <NA> alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks <unk> which is really the distribution
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 263.59 270.64 <NA> of the group strength carrying out the attacks so we look at a process of group dynamics coalescence and fragmentation 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 270.64 279.07 <NA> groups coming together <unk> groups breaking apart <unk> and we start running the numbers on this can we simulate it can we create the kind of patterns that we 're seeing
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 278.9 279.97 <NA> in places like iraq
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 279.81 289.24 <NA> <unk> iraq turns out we kind of do a reasonable job <unk> we can run these simulations we can recreate this using a process of group dynamics
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 288.75 294.52 <NA> to explain the patterns that we see all around the conflicts around the world <unk> 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 295.92 304.97 <NA> so what 's going on <unk> why should these different seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns now what i believe is going on is
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 304.93 306.05 <NA> <unk> that
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 305.56 309.92 <NA> the insurgent forces they evolve over time they adapt <unk> 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 309.67 316.94 <NA> and it turns out there is only one solution to fight a much stronger enemy <unk> and if you don 't find that solution as an insurgent force 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 317.05 325.07 <NA> you don 't exist <unk> so every insurgent force that is ongoing <unk> every conflict that is ongoing it 's going to look something like this <unk> 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 325.43 327 <NA> <unk> we think is happening <unk> 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 327.68 334.2 <NA> taking it forward <unk> how do we change it <unk> how do we end a war like iraq what does it look like 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 333.89 339.52 <NA> alpha is the structure it 's got a stable state at two point five this is what wars look like
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 339.07 342.93 <NA> when they continue we 've got to change that 
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 343.22 350.19 <NA> we can push it up the forces become more fragmented there is more of them <unk> but they are weaker or
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 350.87 354.97 <NA> we push it down they 're more robust there is less groups
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 355.19 357.2 <NA> but perhaps you can sit and talk to them
SeanGourley_2009U 1 SeanGourley_2009U 427.58 429.01 <NA> <unk> structure of the insurgency
