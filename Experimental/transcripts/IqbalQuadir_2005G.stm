IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 55.35 62.65 <NA> <unk> we should ask ourselves the question why does poverty exist <unk> i mean there is plenty of knowledge and
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 62.85 71.53 <NA> scientific breakthroughs we all live in the same planet but there 's still a great deal of poverty in the world <unk> and i think
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 71.31 79.94 <NA> so i want to throw a perspective that i have so that we can assess this project or any other project for that matter to see
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 79.69 82.73 <NA> <unk> see whether it 's contributing or
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 82.36 85.59 <NA> contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 85.59 93.84 <NA> rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last sixty years <unk> and by and large this has failed and
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 93.61 99.56 <NA> you can see this book written by someone who worked in the world bank for twenty years <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 100.43 108.45 <NA> <unk> economic growth in this country to be elusive by and large it did not work so the question is why is that 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 109.91 116.43 <NA> in my mind <unk> there is something to learn from the history of europe <unk> i mean <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 116.15 120.57 <NA> even here <unk> yesterday i was walking across the street and they showed
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 120.11 124.93 <NA> three bishops were executed five hundred years ago right across the street
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 125.79 133.07 <NA> <unk> so my point is there 's a lot of struggle has gone in europe where citizens were empowered by technologies <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 132.89 138.26 <NA> and they demanded authorities from to come down from their high horses <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 138.26 143.45 <NA> and in the end there 's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 143.25 147.46 <NA> and democracies capitalism everything else flourished <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 147.06 150.68 <NA> and so you can see the real process of and
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 150.49 151.82 <NA> this is backed up by this
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 154.87 156.03 <NA> <unk> came down
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 155.85 158.45 <NA> and citizens got up <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 158.08 167.54 <NA> but if you look if you have that perspective then you can see what happened in the last sixty years aid actually did the opposite 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 167.17 174.9 <NA> it empowered authorities and as a result <unk> marginalized citizens the authorities did not have
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 174.71 179.97 <NA> the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 180.28 186.75 <NA> and make make more money for to run their business because they were getting it from abroad <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 186.29 193.96 <NA> and in fact if you see oil rich countries where citizens are not yet empowered the same thing goes
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 193.78 200.88 <NA> nigeria saudi arabia all sorts of countries because the aid and oil or mineral money
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 200.39 204.94 <NA> acts the same way it empowers authorities without activating the
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 204.9 210 <NA> <unk> citizens their hands legs <unk> brains what have you and if you
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 209.84 217.41 <NA> if you agree with that then i think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 217.25 221.32 <NA> that economic development is of the people by the people for the people 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 221.32 229.67 <NA> and that is the real network effect if citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive so that their voices are heard
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 230.05 232.62 <NA> <unk> then things would improve and
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 232.38 242.7 <NA> to contrast that you can see the most important institution in the world the world bank is an organization of the government by the government for the governments 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 242.65 247.43 <NA> <unk> just see the contrast and that is the perspective i have and
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 254.93 264.21 <NA> <unk> and one is cell phones recently the economist recognized this but i stumbled stumbled upon the idea twelve years ago <unk> and
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 264.2 268.02 <NA> that 's what i 've been working on <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 268.58 274.53 <NA> so twelve years ago i was trying to be an investment banker in new york we had
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 276.24 280.81 <NA> <unk> our colleagues were connected by a computer network and
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 281.31 285.1 <NA> we got more productive because
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 285.24 295.12 <NA> we didn 't have to exchange floppy disks we could update each other more more often but one time it broke down and it reminded me of a day <unk>
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 296.21 304.91 <NA> there was a war going on in my country <unk> and my family moved out of an urban place where we used to live to a remote rural
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 304.84 305.89 <NA> <unk> area
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 305.53 308.26 <NA> where it was safer <unk> and
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 308.04 313.51 <NA> one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling <unk> and i walked
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 313.29 321.47 <NA> ten miles or so all morning to get there to the medicine man <unk> and he wasn 't there so i walked all afternoon back 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 321.1 329.7 <NA> so i had another unproductive day <unk> so while i was sitting in a tall building in new york <unk> i put those two experiences together side by side
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 329.9 339.57 <NA> <unk> and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity whether it 's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village <unk> so naturally <unk> i
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 339.5 344.37 <NA> the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 343.88 348.24 <NA> against poverty <unk> and if that 's the case then
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 348.24 354.88 <NA> the question is how many telephones did we have at that time <unk> and it turns out that there was one telephone in
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 354.84 358.03 <NA> <unk> bangladesh for every five hundred people 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 357.72 367.48 <NA> and all those phones were in the few urban places <unk> the vast rural areas where one hundred million people lived there were no telephones <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 367.02 369.17 <NA> so just imagine how many
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 370.59 374.99 <NA> <unk> are wasted just like i wasted a day <unk> if you just multiply by one hundred million
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 375.64 378.55 <NA> <unk> 's say losing one day a month <unk> whatever <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 378.56 390.24 <NA> and you see a vast amount of resource wasted and after all poor countries like rich countries one thing we 've got equal is their days are the same length twenty four hours <unk> so if you lose
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 389.85 395.93 <NA> that precious resource where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries that 's a huge waste <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 396.58 402.47 <NA> so i started looking for any evidence that does connectivity really
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 402.1 403.74 <NA> increase productivity
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 404.93 408.17 <NA> <unk> i couldn 't find much really but i found this
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 408.01 409.31 <NA> graph
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 409.15 414.03 <NA> produced by the itu which is the international telecommunication union
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 413.9 426.3 <NA> <unk> based in geneva they show an interesting thing that you see the horizontal axis is where you place your country <unk> so the united states or the uk would be here <unk> outside <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 425.81 429.55 <NA> and so the impact of one new telephone which is on the
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 429.99 434.26 <NA> <unk> on the vertical axis is very little very little <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 434.16 437.08 <NA> but if you come back to a poorer country <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 437.08 445.45 <NA> where the gnp per capita is let 's say five hundred dollars or three hundred dollars then the impact is huge six thousand dollars 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 445.44 450.05 <NA> or five thousand dollars the question was how much did it cost
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 450.67 457.49 <NA> <unk> to install a new telephone in bangladesh <unk> it turns out two thousand dollars <unk> so if you spend two thousand dollars 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 457.48 462.6 <NA> and let 's say the telephone lasts ten years <unk> and if five thousand dollars every year
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 462.12 467.12 <NA> so that 's fifty thousand dollars <unk> so obviously this was a gadget to have <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 467.17 475.05 <NA> and of course if the cost of installing a telephone is going down because there 's a digital revolution going on then it would be even
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 476.93 479.49 <NA> <unk> and i knew a little economics by then
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 479.42 480.55 <NA> it says
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 480.55 489.75 <NA> adam smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity <unk> but how would you specialize <unk> let 's say i 'm a fisherman and a farmer <unk> and
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 489.32 493.53 <NA> chris is a fisherman farmer both are generalists <unk> so
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 495.47 500.02 <NA> the point is that we could only the only way we could
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 502.11 504.1 <NA> <unk> if we can connect with each other <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 503.73 509.29 <NA> and if we are neighbors i could just walk over to his house <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 508.86 513.52 <NA> but then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 513.06 519.38 <NA> but in order to expand that you need a river or you need a highway or you need telephone lines <unk> but
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 519.05 525.79 <NA> in any event it 's connectivity that leads to dependability and that leads to specialization that leads to productivity <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 525.99 529.91 <NA> so the question was i started looking at this issue
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 529.95 534.78 <NA> and going back and forth between bangladesh and new york there were a lot of
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 534.6 538.58 <NA> reasons people told me why we don 't have enough telephones <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 538.09 543.95 <NA> and one of them is the lacking buying power poor people apparently don 't have the power to buy <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 543.94 550.02 <NA> but the point is if it 's a production tool <unk> why do we have to worry about that i mean in america people buy
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 551.24 565.8 <NA> <unk> and they put very little money down they get a car <unk> and they go to work the work pays them a salary the salary allows them to pay for the car over time the car pays for itself <unk> so if the telephone is a production tool <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 565.8 569.7 <NA> then we don 't quite have to worry about the purchasing power <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 569.72 573.6 <NA> and of course even if that 's true <unk> then
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 573.23 574.96 <NA> what about initial buying
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 577.32 582.31 <NA> <unk> question is why can 't we have some kind of shared access in the united states we have
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 582 587.21 <NA> everybody needs a banking service but very few of us are trying to buy a bank <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 587.21 597.62 <NA> so it 's a bank tends to serve a whole community <unk> so we could do that for telephones <unk> and also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 604.87 610.13 <NA> <unk> be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 610.81 614.76 <NA> <unk> but the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 614.58 621.84 <NA> see you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing for instance the internet was booming in the u s 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 621.84 625.11 <NA> because there were there were people who had computers
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 625.28 626.82 <NA> <unk> they had modems <unk> they had
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 626.65 630.97 <NA> telephone lines <unk> so it 's very easy to bring in a new idea like the internet <unk> 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 630.97 637.47 <NA> but that 's what 's lacking in a poor country <unk> so for example we didn 't have ways to have credit checks 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 637.22 646.32 <NA> few banks to collect bills etc <unk> but that 's why i noticed grameen bank which is a bank for poor people and had one thousand 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 646.07 653.05 <NA> one hundred branches twelve thousand employees two point three million borrowers <unk> and
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 652.88 654.91 <NA> they had these branches i thought i could
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 654.87 661.12 <NA> <unk> put cell towers and create a network and anyway to cut the time short
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 661.02 665.23 <NA> so i started i first went to them and said you
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 664.83 674.93 <NA> know perhaps i could connect all your branches and make you more efficient but you know they have after all evolved in a country without telephones so they are decentralized i
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 676.11 679.76 <NA> there might be other good reasons but this was one of the reasons they had to be 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 679.33 686.78 <NA> and so they were not that interested to connect all their branches and then to be and rock the boat <unk> so i
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 686.32 689.75 <NA> started focusing what is it that they really do 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 689.75 699.99 <NA> so what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank she typically buys a cow the cow gives milk and she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 701.03 710.55 <NA> <unk> this is a business for her <unk> but it 's milk for everybody else and suddenly i realized that a cell phone could be a cow because some way she could borrow
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 710.24 712.67 <NA> two hundred dollars from the bank 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 712.68 719.85 <NA> get a phone and have the phone for everybody and it 's a business for her <unk> so i wrote to the bank <unk> and
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 719.96 722.46 <NA> they thought for a while and they said it 's a
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 722.3 729.97 <NA> little crazy but logical if you think it can be done come and make it happen so i quit my job i went back to
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 729.93 735.88 <NA> <unk> bangladesh <unk> i created a company in america called gonofone which in bengali means people 's phone 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 735.88 741.04 <NA> and angel investors in america put in money into that i flew around the world 
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 740.64 749.99 <NA> after about a million i mean i got rejected from lots of places <unk> because i was not only trying to go to a poor country i was trying to go to the poor of the poor country <unk> after about a million miles

IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 775.24 779.97 <NA> even in bangladesh there are some empty places <unk> but we are also
IqbalQuadir_2005G 1 IqbalQuadir_2005G 780.1 783.18 <NA> investing around another three hundred million dollars this year
