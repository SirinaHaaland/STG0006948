FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 21.73 29.97 <NA> well congratulations <unk> because if you look at this particular slide of u s life expectancy you are now in excess

FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 37.16 46.62 <NA> if you follow that curve you 'll see that it starts way down there there 's that dip there for the one thousand nine hundred and eighteen flu <unk> and here we are at two thousand and ten

FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 54.96 65.02 <NA> <unk> so for instance if you ask how many diseases do we now know the exact molecular basis <unk> turns out it 's about four thousand which is pretty amazing <unk> 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 64.65 69.4 <NA> because most of those molecular discoveries have just happened in the last little while 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 69.45 77.5 <NA> it 's exciting to see that in terms of what we 've learned but how many of those four thousand diseases now have treatments available 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 77.1 79.97 <NA> only about two hundred and fifty <unk> so we have

FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 82.12 94.35 <NA> you would think this wouldn 't be too hard that we would simply have the ability to take this fundamental information that we 're learning about how it is that basic biology teaches us about the causes of disease
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 94.14 104.13 <NA> and build a bridge across this yawning gap between what we 've learned about basic science and its application a bridge that would look maybe something like this

FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 113.33 122.7 <NA> unfortunately it 's not in reality <unk> trying to go from fundamental knowledge to its application is more like this there are no shiny bridges <unk> 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 122.69 129.7 <NA> you sort of place your bets maybe you 've got a swimmer and a rowboat and a sailboat and a tugboat and you set them off on their way

FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 198.68 204.97 <NA> and it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars for that one success so we have to look at this

FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 270.29 278.68 <NA> how do we go faster well one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology and a very important technology that we depend on for all of this
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 278.47 279.7 <NA> is the human genome

FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 309.25 316.7 <NA> well that 's exciting <unk> how does that play out in terms of application to a disease i want to tell you about another disorder 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 316.54 320.22 <NA> this one is a disorder which is quite rare it 's called
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 321.27 324.93 <NA> progeria and it is the most dramatic form of premature
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 325.97 329.88 <NA> <unk> only about one in every four million kids has this disease 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 329.42 335.56 <NA> and in a simple way <unk> what happens is because of a mutation in a particular gene 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 335.56 342.84 <NA> a protein is made that 's toxic to the cell and it causes these individuals to age at about seven times the normal rate

FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 346.11 354.88 <NA> the normal cell <unk> if you looked at it under the microscope would have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell which is nice and round and smooth

FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 356.04 365.14 <NA> and it looks kind of like that a progeria cell on the other hand because of this toxic protein called progerin has these lumps and bumps in it 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 364.8 373.33 <NA> so what we would like to do after discovering this back in two thousand and three is to come up with a way to try to correct that 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 372.93 379.97 <NA> well again by knowing something about the molecular pathways <unk> it was possible to pick one of those many many compounds
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 379.93 389.72 <NA> <unk> that might have been useful and try it out in an experiment done in cell culture and and shown here in a cartoon if you take that particular compound
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 389.38 397.13 <NA> and you add it to that cell that has progeria and you watch to see what happened in just seventy two hours 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 396.64 400.2 <NA> that cell becomes for all purposes that we can determine
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 400.13 406.32 <NA> <unk> almost like a normal cell well that was exciting <unk> but would it actually work in a real human being 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 406.25 415.38 <NA> this has led in the space of only four years from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial to a test of that very compound 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 415.38 417.58 <NA> and the kids that you see here
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 417.41 423.27 <NA> all volunteered to be part of this twenty eight of them and you can see
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 422.87 429.82 <NA> as soon as the picture comes up that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people all afflicted by this disease all

FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 477.12 479.97 <NA> progeria luckily does not limit but
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 479.96 492.66 <NA> <unk> when there is something that i really do want to do that progeria gets in the way of like marching band or umpiring we always find a way to do it and that just shows that progeria isn 't in control of my life francis collins so what would you like
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 494.21 503.14 <NA> to say to researchers here in the auditorium and others listening to this what would you say to them both about research on progeria and maybe about other conditions as well
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 505.08 509.65 <NA> <unk> has come so far in less than fifteen years <unk> and
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 509.22 513.61 <NA> that just shows the drive that researchers can have
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 513.18 514.35 <NA> to get
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 514.36 527.83 <NA> this far and it really means a lot to myself and other kids with progeria and it shows that if that drive exists <unk> anybody can cure any disease and hopefully progeria can be cured
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 527.61 529.97 <NA> in the near future and so
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 530.01 536.76 <NA> we can eliminate those four thousand diseases that francis was talking about fc excellent <unk> 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 536.76 540.95 <NA> so sam took the day off from school today to be here and he is he is
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 545.23 549.9 <NA> by the way a <unk> <unk> straight a + student in the ninth grade in his school in
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 569.06 576.84 <NA> <unk> so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story and then try to generalize how could we have stories of success
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 576.84 579.88 <NA> all over the place for these diseases as sam says
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 580.02 582.19 <NA> <unk> four thousand that are waiting for answers <unk> 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 581.96 592.33 <NA> you might have noticed that the drug that is now in clinical trial for progeria is not a drug that was designed for that it 's such a rare disease it would be hard for a company to justify <unk>
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 592.23 597.62 <NA> <unk> spending hundreds of millions of dollars to generate a drug this is a drug that was developed for cancer <unk>

FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 607.83 617.96 <NA> could we in fact encourage all the companies that are out there that have drugs in their freezers that are known to be safe in humans but have never actually succeeded <unk>
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 617.91 628.11 <NA> in terms of being effective for the treatments they were tried for now we 're learning about all these new molecular pathways some of those could be repositioned or repurposed or whatever word you want to use 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 630.16 631.84 <NA> old drugs new tricks 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 631.6 639.87 <NA> that could be a phenomenal valuable activity we have many discussions now between nih and companies about doing this that are looking very promising

FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 642.48 650.05 <NA> there are quite a number of success stories one can point to about how this has led to major advances the first drug for hiv aids
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 650.07 661.24 <NA> <unk> was not developed for hiv aids <unk> it was developed for cancer <unk> it was azt it didn 't work very well for cancer <unk> but became the first successful antiretroviral and you can see from the table there are others as well <unk> 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 660.87 671.96 <NA> so how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort well we have to come up with a partnership between academia government the private sector and patient organizations to make that so 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 671.96 679.97 <NA> at nih we have started this new national center for advancing translational sciences it just started last december and this is one of its goals
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 680.04 687.14 <NA> <unk> let me tell you another thing we could do wouldn 't it be nice to be able to a test a drug to see if it 's effective and safe
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 686.97 691.95 <NA> without having to put patients at risk because that first time you 're never quite sure <unk> 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 691.95 697.49 <NA> how do we know for instance whether drugs are safe before we give them to people we test them on animals <unk> 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 697.03 700.02 <NA> and it 's not all that reliable and it 's costly
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 701.72 704.73 <NA> <unk> suppose we could do this instead on human cells 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 704.72 716.13 <NA> you probably know if you 've been paying attention to some of the science literature that you can now take a skin cell and encourage it to become a liver cell or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us <unk> 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 715.67 724.02 <NA> so what if you used those cells as your test for whether a drug is going to work and whether it 's going to be safe here you see a picture
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 723.59 729.55 <NA> of a lung on a chip this is something created by the wyss institute in boston
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 729.9 738.14 <NA> <unk> and what they have done here if we can run the little video is to take cells from an individual turn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung <unk> 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 738.14 747.46 <NA> and determine what would happen if you added to this various drug compounds to see if they are toxic or safe you can see this chip even breathes <unk> 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 747.06 750.05 <NA> it has an air channel <unk> it has a blood channel
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 750.19 756.35 <NA> <unk> and it has cells in between that allow you to see what happens when you add a compound are those cells happy or not 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 755.92 765.68 <NA> you can do this same kind of chip technology for kidneys for hearts for muscles all the places where you want to see whether a drug is going to be a problem for the liver 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 765.4 774.99 <NA> and ultimately <unk> because you can do this for the individual we could even see this moving to the point where the ability to develop and test medicines
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 775 783.33 <NA> will be you on a chip what we 're trying to say here is the individualizing of the process of developing drugs and testing their safety 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 783.2 785.22 <NA> so let me sum up

FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 794.84 803.68 <NA> we have made all these discoveries pouring out of laboratories across the world what do we need to capitalize on this first of all we need resources this is research
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 804.72 810.69 <NA> <unk> sometimes high cost the payoff is enormous both in terms of health and in terms of economic growth we need to support that 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 810.7 822.47 <NA> second we need new kinds of partnerships between academia and government and the private sector and patient organizations just like the one i 've been describing here in terms of the way in which we could go after repurposing new compounds 
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 822.23 824.75 <NA> and third <unk> and maybe most important <unk> we need
FrancisCollins_2012P 1 FrancisCollins_2012P 825.76 835.43 <NA> <unk> we need the best and the brightest from many different disciplines to come and join this effort all ages all different groups because this is the time folks this is the <unk>
