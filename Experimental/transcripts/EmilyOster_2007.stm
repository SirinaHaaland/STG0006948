EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 17.98 20.21 <NA> <unk> so i imagine you all know something about aids
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 20.2 29.82 <NA> <unk> you probably know that roughly twenty five million people in africa are infected with the virus that aids is a disease of poverty and that if we can bring africa out of poverty <unk> we would decrease aids
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 30.47 40.8 <NA> if you know something more you probably know that uganda to date is the only country in sub saharan africa that has had success in combating the epidemic <unk> using a campaign that encouraged people <unk>
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 40.7 49.9 <NA> <unk> to abstain be faithful and use condoms the abc campaign they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s from about fifteen percent to six percent over
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 50.1 51.22 <NA> <unk> a few years
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 50.94 61.82 <NA> if you follow policy you probably know that a few years ago the president pledged fifteen billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years <unk> and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate uganda and use
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 61.82 64.33 <NA> behavior change to encourage people
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 64.38 67.15 <NA> and decrease the epidemic <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 66.66 74.84 <NA> so today i 'm going to talk about some things that you you might not know about the epidemic <unk> and i 'm actually also going to challenge some of these things that you you think that you do know
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 75.67 85.37 <NA> <unk> to do that i 'm going to talk about my research as an economist on the epidemic and i 'm not really going to talk much about the economy i 'm not going to tell you about exports and prices
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 84.91 93.15 <NA> but i 'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists to think about a problem that 's more traditionally part of public health and epidemiology <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 93.15 101.57 <NA> and i think in that sense this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea here i 'm really using the tools of one academic discipline to think about problems of another <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 102.07 104.76 <NA> so we think first and foremost aids is a policy issue
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 105.01 108.57 <NA> <unk> and probably for most people in this room that 's how you think about it 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 108.14 119.86 <NA> but this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic it 's going to be about thinking about how it evolves and how people respond to it i think it may seem like i 'm ignoring the policy stuff which is really the most important
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 119.38 127.38 <NA> but i 'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will you will conclude that we actually cannot develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 127.01 129.85 <NA> and the first thing that i want to talk about the first thing i think we need to
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 129.81 133.68 <NA> <unk> understand is how do people respond to the epidemic <unk> so
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 133.69 141.31 <NA> aids is a sexually transmitted infection and it kills you <unk> so this means that in a place with a lot of aids there 's a really significant cost of sex
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 140.88 150.14 <NA> if you 're an uninfected man living in botswana where the hiv rate is thirty percent if you have one more partner this year a long term partner girlfriend mistress your chance
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 150 158.1 <NA> <unk> of dying in ten years increases by three percentage points that is a huge effect <unk> and so i think that we really feel like then people should should have less sex <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 157.89 162.36 <NA> and in fact among gay men in the us we did see that kind of change in the 1980s 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 162.18 169.34 <NA> so if we look in this particularly high risk sample they 're being asked did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 169.34 174.96 <NA> over a period from ' eighty four to ' eighty eight that share drops from about eighty five percent to fifty five percent
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 175 177.42 <NA> <unk> huge change in a very short period of time 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 177.05 187.44 <NA> we didn 't see anything like that in africa <unk> so we don 't have quite as good data <unk> but you can see here the share of single men having pre marital sex or married men having extra marital sex and how that changes from <unk>
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 187.39 199.32 <NA> the early ' 90s to late ' 90s and late ' 90s to early 2000s the epidemic is getting worse people are learning more things about it we see almost no change in sexual behavior these are just tiny decreases two percentage points not significant 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 202.59 209.92 <NA> <unk> be surprised by this and that that to understand this you need to think about health the way than an economist does as an investment <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 209.91 215.44 <NA> so if you 're a software engineer and you 're trying to think about whether to add some new functionality to your program 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 214.98 225.11 <NA> it 's important to think about how much it costs it 's also important to think about what the benefit is and one part of that benefit is how much longer you think this program is going to be active if version ten is coming out next
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 225.52 228.27 <NA> <unk> there 's no point in adding more functionality into version nine 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 228.03 230.37 <NA> but your health decisions are the same <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 230.19 237.39 <NA> every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie <unk> every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies that 's a costly investment in your health 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 237.39 244.07 <NA> but how much you want to invest is going to depend on how much longer you expect to live in the future even if you don 't make those investments 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 243.79 248.64 <NA> aids is the same kind of thing <unk> it 's costly to avoid aids people really like to have sex
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 255.23 260.34 <NA> but life expectancy in africa even without aids is really really low 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 259.97 262.89 <NA> forty or fifty years in a lot of places <unk>
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 262.4 271.26 <NA> i think it 's possible if we think about that intuition and think about that fact that maybe that explains some of this this low behavior change but we really need to test that 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 271.26 274.99 <NA> and a great way to test that is to look across areas in africa and see 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 275 283.48 <NA> do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more and the way that i 'm going to do that is i 'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 283.48 285.35 <NA> so malaria is a disease
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 285.02 286.51 <NA> that kills you
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 286.11 290.12 <NA> <unk> it 's a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa in addition to a lot of children
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 289.88 296.86 <NA> and so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 296.86 304.97 <NA> so one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 304.99 307.61 <NA> <unk> areas where there 's less malaria <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 307.18 315.75 <NA> so that 's what this figure shows you this shows you in areas with low malaria medium malaria high malaria what happens to the number of sexual partners
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 315.59 324.84 <NA> as you increase hiv prevalence if you look at the blue line the areas with low levels of malaria you can see in those areas actually the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot as
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 325.16 332.55 <NA> <unk> prevalence goes up areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some it doesn 't decrease as much and areas with high levels of malaria actually it 's
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 332.33 335.97 <NA> increasing a little bit although that 's not significant 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 337.01 339.33 <NA> this is not just through malaria <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 339.05 349.38 <NA> young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality change their behavior less in response to hiv than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality there 's another risk <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 349.38 351.99 <NA> and they respond less to this existing risk <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 352.13 354.97 <NA> so by itself i think this tells a lot about how people
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 354.93 361.06 <NA> <unk> behave <unk> it tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in africa <unk> but it also tells us something about policy <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 360.99 370.96 <NA> even if you only cared about aids in africa <unk> it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria <unk> in combating poor indoor air quality in improving maternal mortality <unk>
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 370.86 376.63 <NA> <unk> rates <unk> because if you <unk> if you improve those things then people are going to have an incentive to avoid aids on their own <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 380.45 391.82 <NA> education campaigns like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding may not be enough at least not alone if people have no incentive to avoid aids on their own even if they know everything about the disease they still may not change their behavior 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 391.84 399.99 <NA> so the other thing that i think we learn here is that that aids is not going to fix itself people aren 't changing their behavior enough to decrease the growth in
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 401.45 408 <NA> <unk> to think about policy and what kind of policies might be effective <unk> and a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 407.6 417.91 <NA> the reason that we know that that the abc campaign was effective in uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time in uganda we see the prevalence went down we know they had this campaign that 's how we learn about what works it
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 417.91 421.02 <NA> 's not the only place we had any interventions 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 420.8 426.42 <NA> other places have tried things <unk> so why don 't we look at those places and see see what happened to their prevalence 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 426.44 429.82 <NA> unfortunately there 's almost no good data on hiv
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 429.75 433.37 <NA> <unk> prevalence in the general population in africa until about two thousand and three <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 433.13 434.58 <NA> so if i asked you why don
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 434.42 440.52 <NA> 't you go and find me the prevalence in burkina faso in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one you get on google you google <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 440.53 449.2 <NA> and you find actually the only people tested in burkina faso in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one are std patients and pregnant women which is not a terribly representative group of people 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 450 453.6 <NA> poked a little more you looked a little more at what was going on you 'd find that actually
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 453.42 458.15 <NA> that was a pretty good year because in some years the only people tested are iv drug users <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 457.66 466.07 <NA> but even worse some years it 's only iv drug users some years it 's only pregnant women we have no way to figure out what happened over time we have no consistent testing 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 466.06 468.08 <NA> now in the last few years 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 467.86 470.36 <NA> we actually have done some good testing
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 469.96 479.97 <NA> in kenya in zambia and a bunch of countries there 's been testing in random samples of the population <unk> but this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge so
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 479.93 486.51 <NA> <unk> i can tell you what the prevalence was in kenya in two thousand and three <unk> but i can 't tell you anything about one thousand nine hundred and ninety three or one thousand nine hundred and eighty three 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 486.14 491.7 <NA> so this is this is a problem for policy it was a problem for my research <unk> and i started thinking about
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 491.33 496.56 <NA> how else might we figure out what the prevalence of hiv was in africa in the past <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 496.56 503.58 <NA> and i think that the answer is we can look at mortality data and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 503.09 504.94 <NA> to do this we 're going to have to rely
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 504.96 516.79 <NA> <unk> on the fact that aids is a very specific kind of disease it kills people in the prime of their lives not a lot of other diseases have that that profile and you can see here this is a graph of death rates by age in botswana and egypt 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 516.78 529.61 <NA> botswana is a place with a lot of aids <unk> egypt is a place without a lot of aids and you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people that suggests it 's pretty similar levels of development but in this middle region between twenty and
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 529.92 534.08 <NA> the death rates in botswana are much much much higher than in egypt but since there <unk>
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 536.35 540.98 <NA> <unk> are very few other diseases that kill people we can really attribute that mortality to hiv 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 540.64 547.67 <NA> but because people who died this year of aids got it a few years ago we can use this data on mortality to figure out
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 547.33 554.91 <NA> what hiv prevalence was in the past <unk> so it turns out if you use this technique actually your estimates of prevalence are very close to what
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 554.96 565.83 <NA> <unk> get from testing random samples in the population <unk> but they 're very very different than what unaids tells us the prevalences are <unk> so this is a graph of prevalence estimated by unaids and prevalence
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 565.83 575.05 <NA> based on the mortality data for the years in the late <unk> 1990s in nine countries in africa <unk> you can see almost without exception the <unk> unaids estimates are much
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 577.68 580.6 <NA> <unk> us that the hiv rate in zambia is twenty percent 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 580.37 584.48 <NA> and mortality estimates suggest it 's only about five percent 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 584.27 597.37 <NA> and these are not trivial differences in in mortality rates so this is another way to see this you can see that for the prevalence to be as high as unaids says we have to really see sixty deaths per ten thousand rather than twenty deaths per ten thousand in this age group 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 597.37 599.93 <NA> i 'm going to talk a little bit in in a minute about how we
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 600.73 609.95 <NA> <unk> this kind of information to learn something that that 's going to help us think about the world <unk> but this also tells us that one of these facts that i mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right if you
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 609.52 619.85 <NA> think that twenty five million people are infected if you think that the <unk> unaids numbers are are much too high maybe that that 's more like ten or fifteen million it doesn 't mean that aids isn 't a problem <unk>
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 619.8 624.35 <NA> it 's a gigantic problem <unk> but it does suggest that that number might be might be a little big
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 629.87 636.33 <NA> <unk> faster or slower <unk> and i said in the beginning i wasn 't going to tell you about exports when i started working on these projects i was
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 636.33 643.74 <NA> not thinking at all about economics but eventually it kind of sucks you back in so i am going to talk about exports and prices
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 643.28 649.9 <NA> and i want to talk about the relationship between economic activity in particular export volume <unk> and hiv
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 654.18 665.34 <NA> <unk> deeply familiar with the fact that development that openness to trade is really good for developing countries it 's good for improving improving people 's lives <unk> but openness and inter connectedness it comes with a cost when we think about disease <unk>
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 665.35 672.29 <NA> i don 't think this should be a surprise on wednesday i learned from from laurie garrett that i 'm definitely going to get the bird flu <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 672.11 673.12 <NA> and
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 672.72 675.02 <NA> i wouldn 't be at all worried about that if we never
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 675 677.39 <NA> <unk> had any contact with with asia <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 676.99 681.2 <NA> and hiv is actually particularly closely linked to transit <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 681.2 691.23 <NA> the epidemic was introduced to the us by actually one male steward on an airline flight who got the disease in africa and brought it back and that was the genesis of the entire epidemic
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 691.05 700.02 <NA> in the us in africa <unk> epidemiologists have noted for a long time that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than than other people
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 700.34 703.29 <NA> <unk> areas with a lot of economic activity with a lot of
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 702.92 709.87 <NA> roads with a lot of urbanization those areas have higher prevalence than others <unk> but that actually doesn 't mean at all that that
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 709.87 718.38 <NA> if we gave people more more exports more trade that that would increase prevalence by using this new data using this information about prevalence over time we can actually test that 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 718.46 721.09 <NA> and so it seems to be
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 720.9 730 <NA> fortunately i think it seems to be the case that these things are positively related more exports means more aids <unk> and that effect is really big <unk> so the data that i have
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 730.02 737.02 <NA> <unk> suggests that if you double export volume <unk> it will lead to a quadrupling of new hiv infections <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 737.22 743.89 <NA> so this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy from a forecasting perspective if we know
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 743.64 750.05 <NA> where trade is likely to change for example because of the african growth and opportunities act or other policies that encourage trade
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 750.16 758 <NA> <unk> we can actually think about which areas are are likely to be heavily infected with hiv and we can go and we can we can try to have <unk>
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 759.64 771.15 <NA> <unk> preventive measures there likewise as we 're developing policies to try to encourage exports if we know there 's this externality this this extra thing that 's going to happen as we increase exports we can we can think about what the right kinds of policies are <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 771.15 779.64 <NA> but it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know even though it is the case that poverty is linked to aids in the sense that africa is poor and they have a lot of aids
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 779.93 786.86 <NA> <unk> 's not necessarily the case that improving improving poverty at least in the short run that improving exports and improving development it 's not necessarily the case that
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 786.87 789.93 <NA> that 's going to lead to a decline in hiv prevalence 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 790.46 799.87 <NA> so throughout this talk i 've mentioned a few times the special case of uganda and the fact that it 's the only country in sub saharan africa with successful prevention it 's been widely
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 801.48 809.17 <NA> <unk> replicated in kenya and tanzania and south africa and many other places <unk> but now i want to actually also
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 808.71 810.58 <NA> also question that 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 810.57 818.52 <NA> because it is true that there was a decline in prevalence in uganda in the in the 1990s it 's true that they had an education campaign <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 818.52 822.58 <NA> but there was actually something else that happened in uganda in this period 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 823.65 825.02 <NA> there was a big decline in
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 826 836.15 <NA> <unk> coffee is uganda 's major export their exports went down a lot in the early <unk> 1990s and actually that decline lines up really really closely with this decline in <unk>
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 836.05 850.89 <NA> <unk> new hiv infections <unk> so you can see that both of these series the black line is export value the red line is new hiv infections you can see they 're both increasing starting about one thousand nine hundred and eighty seven they 're both going down a lot <unk> and then actually they track each other a little bit on the increase later in the decade <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 854.93 857.8 <NA> <unk> about before it suggests that somewhere between
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 859.52 865.41 <NA> <unk> and fifty percent of the decline in prevalence in uganda actually would have happened even without any education campaign <unk> 
EmilyOster_2007 1 EmilyOster_2007 865.01 879.82 <NA> but that 's enormously important for policy we 're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign and if it was only fifty percent as effective as we we think that it was then there are all sorts of other things maybe we should be spending our money on instead trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted
