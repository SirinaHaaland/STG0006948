AliceBowsLarkin_2015G 1 AliceBowsLarkin_2015G 514.23 520.18 <NA> so if we continue on this red four degree centigrade scenario pathway 
AliceBowsLarkin_2015G 1 AliceBowsLarkin_2015G 519.81 529.43 <NA> the longer we continue on it that will need to be made up for in later years to keep the same carbon budget to keep the same area under the curve
AliceBowsLarkin_2015G 1 AliceBowsLarkin_2015G 529.9 542.06 <NA> <unk> which means that that trajectory the red one there becomes steeper <unk> so in other words if we don 't reduce emissions in the short to medium term then we 'll have to make more significant year on year emission reductions
