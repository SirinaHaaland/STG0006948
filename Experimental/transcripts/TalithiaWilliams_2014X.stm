TalithiaWilliams_2014X 1 TalithiaWilliams_2014X 609.07 618.74 <NA> now <unk> what is it if you had a thyroid problem and you went to the doctor your doctor would actually test the amount of thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood 
TalithiaWilliams_2014X 1 TalithiaWilliams_2014X 619.36 624.96 <NA> fine <unk> but the problem with that test is it doesn 't tell you how active the hormone is in
