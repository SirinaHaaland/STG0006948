AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 16.38 19.76 <NA> music <unk> machines and life 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 19.36 26.63 <NA> or more specifically what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 26.41 29.97 <NA> some of you may recognize this image this is the opening
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 29.96 36.88 <NA> <unk> frame of the video that we created we 'll be showing the video at the end but before we do i want to talk a little bit about
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 36.88 41.64 <NA> what it is that they wanted <unk> now when we first started talking to ok go
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 41.54 44.82 <NA> the name of the song is this too shall pass 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 44.75 53.19 <NA> we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with <unk> and we were very excited about this because 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 53.19 54.97 <NA> of course they have a history of
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 54.99 56.71 <NA> <unk> dancing with machines 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 56.31 59.99 <NA> they 're responsible for this video here it goes again
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 59.75 64.72 <NA> <unk> 50 million plus views on youtube <unk> four guys dancing on treadmills
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 64.72 71.32 <NA> <unk> no cuts just a static camera a fantastically viral and wonderful video so we were really excited about working with them and
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 71.28 79.97 <NA> we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted and they explained that they wanted kind of a rube goldberg machine now for those of you
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 79.93 85.77 <NA> <unk> who don 't know a rube goldberg machine is a complicated contraption an incredibly
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 86.91 99.87 <NA> piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task <unk> so we were excited by this idea <unk> and we started talking about exactly what it would look like <unk> and we came up with some parameters <unk> because you know
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 104.66 111.99 <NA> <unk> but it also is pretty wide open <unk> and we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video <unk> so
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 112.04 125.02 <NA> we came up with a list of requirements the ten commandments and they were in order of ascending difficulty <unk> the first is no magic everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 126.63 131.33 <NA> <unk> rule of thumb was that if my mother couldn 't understand it then we couldn 't use it in the video <unk> 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 131.12 137.75 <NA> they wanted band integration that is the machine acting upon the band members <unk> specifically not the other way around 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 137.75 146.27 <NA> they wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling so as the song picks up emotion so should the machine get grander
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 146.04 149.93 <NA> in its process they wanted us to make use of the space <unk> so we have this
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 150.88 164.57 <NA> <unk> warehouse we were using divided between two floors it included an exterior loading dock we used all of that including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through they wanted it messy and we were happy to oblige 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 164.83 174.8 <NA> the machine itself would start the music <unk> so the machine would get started it would travel some distance <unk> reacting along the way <unk> hit play on an ipod or a <unk>
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 174.7 179.97 <NA> <unk> tape deck or something that would start playback and the machine would maintain synchronization throughout
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 180.25 186.24 <NA> and speaking of synchronization they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way <unk> 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 187.28 188.76 <NA> okay 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 190.64 199.99 <NA> they wanted it to end precisely on time okay so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect <unk> and they wanted the music to drop out at a
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 200 205.51 <NA> certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 205.5 213.01 <NA> and as if that wasn 't enough all of these incredibly complicating things right <unk> they wanted it in one shot <unk>
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 224.03 225.08 <NA> just some statistics
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 235.24 243.2 <NA> <unk> get it on film to our satisfaction of those eighty five takes <unk> only three actually successfully completed their run 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 243.34 249.84 <NA> we destroyed two pianos and ten televisions in the process <unk> we went to home
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 260.45 271.5 <NA> <unk> shoe after a nice dinner and returned back to the build and left it in a pile of stuff and another engineer thought well that would be a really good thing to use and ended up using it as a really nice trigger and it 's actually in the machine 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 272.03 275.17 <NA> so what did we learn from all of this well
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 275.22 282.39 <NA> <unk> having completed this we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things <unk> and we learned that small stuff stinks 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 282.4 292.79 <NA> little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust <unk> and they fall out of the tracks the exact angles makes it hard to
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 292.63 300.02 <NA> to get right and yet a bowling ball will always follow the same path it doesn 't matter what temperature it is doesn 't matter what 's in its way
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 300 313.76 <NA> will pretty much get where it needs to go <unk> but as much as the small stuff stinks <unk> we needed somewhere to start so that we would have somewhere to go <unk> and so you have to start with it you have to focus on it small stuff stinks <unk> but of course it 's essential <unk> right <unk> 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 313.3 316.31 <NA> what else planning is incredibly important you
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 320.14 324.9 <NA> we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things it 's been said
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 325.52 331.35 <NA> <unk> no battle plan survives contact with the enemy i think our enemy was physics and
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 331.58 334.35 <NA> she 's a cruel mistress <unk> 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 334.76 347.1 <NA> often we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever <unk> and so while planning is important so is flexibility these are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 346.88 350.17 <NA> so also put reliable stuff last
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 351.54 354.85 <NA> <unk> stuff that 's going to run every time again small to large
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 354.36 368.2 <NA> is relevant here the little lego car in the beginning of the video references the big <unk> real car near the end of the video the big real car works every time there 's no problem about it the little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 368.2 378.86 <NA> that 's a problem but you don 't want to have to reset the whole machine because the lego car at the end doesn 't work right so you put that up front so that if it fails at least you know you know you don 't have to reset the whole thing
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 381.34 384.8 <NA> can be messy <unk> 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 386.17 399.26 <NA> there were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing <unk> months were spent in this tiny cold warehouse and the wonderful elation that we that we had when we finally completed it so it 's important to remember that whether it 's good or it 's bad 
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 398.86 399.93 <NA> this too shall
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 409.7 413.86 <NA> <unk> and now to introduce their music video <unk> we have ok go
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 452.89 454.14 <NA> <unk> we can still do one better i think
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 606.07 607.32 <NA> <unk> oh
AdamSadowsky_2010X 1 AdamSadowsky_2010X 678.03 680.45 <NA> <unk> okay
