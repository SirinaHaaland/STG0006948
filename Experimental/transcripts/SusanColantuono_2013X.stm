SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 261.04 270.18 <NA> five years ago i was asked to moderate a panel of executives and the topic for the evening was what do you look for in high potential employees

SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 350.02 352.27 <NA> and to a man they said

SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 386.92 391.11 <NA> so this is obvious right <unk> but how can it be 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 391.11 398.93 <NA> well there are primarily three reasons that there 's this missing thirty three percent in the career success advice given to women 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 398.53 405 <NA> when organizations direct women toward resources that focus on the conventional
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 405.11 407.82 <NA> <unk> advice that we 've been hearing for over forty years 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 407.65 417.78 <NA> there 's a notable absence of advice that relates to business strategic and financial acumen <unk> much of the advice is emphasizing <unk>
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 417.68 424.18 <NA> <unk> personal actions that we need to take like become more assertive become more confident develop your personal brand <unk> 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 430.19 440.86 <NA> learn to self promote get a mentor enhance your network and virtually nothing said about the importance of business strategic and financial acumen <unk> 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 440.82 445.13 <NA> this doesn 't mean that this advice is unimportant 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 445.13 452.9 <NA> what it means is that this is advice that 's absolutely essential for breaking through from career start
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 452.74 454.67 <NA> to middle management
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 455.08 464.4 <NA> but it 's not the advice that gets women to break through from the middle where we 're fifty percent to senior and executive positions <unk> 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 464.4 467.96 <NA> and this is why conventional advice to women
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 467.5 473.84 <NA> in forty years hasn 't closed the gender gap at the top and won 't close it 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 473.89 479.97 <NA> now the second reason relates to tonya 's comments about having had excellent
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 480.28 489.6 <NA> performance evals great feedback from her teams <unk> and having taken every management training program she can lay her hands on 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 489.65 504.19 <NA> so you would think that she 's getting messages from her organization through the talent development systems and performance management systems that let her know how important it is to develop business strategic and financial acumen
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 505.08 509.8 <NA> <unk> but here again that green square is quite small 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 509.52 516.68 <NA> on average talent and performance management systems in the organizations that i 've worked with
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 516.45 524.99 <NA> focus three to one on the other two elements of leadership compared to the importance of business strategic and financial
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 526.06 528.44 <NA> <unk> which is why typical
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 528.04 534.98 <NA> talent and performance systems haven 't closed and won 't close the gender gap at the top <unk> 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 535.51 537.02 <NA> now 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 536.65 539.88 <NA> tonya also talked about working with a mentor <unk> 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 539.88 550.53 <NA> and this is really important to talk about because if organizations talent and performance systems aren 't giving people in general information about the importance of
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 550.3 553.95 <NA> business strategic and financial acumen how are men getting to the top
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 555.04 565.69 <NA> there are primarily two ways one is because of the positions they 're guided into and the other is because of informal mentoring and sponsorship <unk> 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 565.69 569.58 <NA> so what 's women 's experience as it relates to mentoring 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 569.54 570.97 <NA> well this
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 570.76 579.79 <NA> comment from an executive that i worked with recently illustrates that experience <unk> he was very proud of the fact that last year he had two
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 580.13 582.94 <NA> protgs a man and a woman <unk> 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 582.93 586.94 <NA> and he said i helped the woman build confidence 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 586.94 595.27 <NA> i helped the man learn the business <unk> and i didn 't realize that i was treating them any differently and he was sincere about that 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 595.17 600.02 <NA> so what this illustrates is that as managers whether we 're women or men
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 600 610.46 <NA> we have mindsets about women and men about careers in leadership and these unexamined mindsets won 't close the gender gap at the top <unk> 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 610.48 616.65 <NA> so how do we take this idea of the missing thirty three percent and turn it into action 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 616.65 627.54 <NA> well for women the answer is obvious we have to begin to focus more on developing and demonstrating the skills we have that show that we 're
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 627.33 629.82 <NA> people who understand our businesses
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 629.87 636.9 <NA> <unk> where they 're headed <unk> and our role in taking it there that 's what enables that breakthrough from

SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 640.37 648.54 <NA> but you don 't have to be a middle manager to do this one young scientist that works in a biotech firm used her
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 648.05 650.08 <NA> insight about the missing

SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 661.26 670.96 <NA> so we don 't want to put one hundred percent of the responsibility on women 's shoulders <unk> nor would it be wise to do so and here 's why 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 671.04 679.94 <NA> in order for companies to achieve their strategic financial goals executives understand that they have to have everyone pulling in the same direction
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 680.05 687.08 <NA> in other words the term we use in business is we have to have strategic alignment <unk> and
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 686.62 698.04 <NA> executives know this very well and yet only thirty seven percent according to a recent conference board report believe that they have that strategic alignment in place <unk> 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 698.04 699.87 <NA> so for sixty three percent of
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 701.87 705.93 <NA> <unk> achieving their strategic financial goals is questionable <unk> 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 705.74 714.13 <NA> and if you think about what i 've just shared that you have situations where at least fifty percent of your middle managers
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 713.71 718.32 <NA> haven 't received clear messaging that they have to become
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 718.12 728.49 <NA> focused on the business <unk> where it 's headed <unk> and their role in taking it there it 's not surprising that that percentage of executives who are confident about alignment is so low 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 728.54 729.94 <NA> which is why
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 730.41 737.83 <NA> there are other people who have a role to play in this it 's important for directors on boards
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 737.83 749.87 <NA> to expect from their executives proportional pools of women when they sit down once a year for their succession discussions why because if they aren 't seeing that it could be a red
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 750.82 757.95 <NA> <unk> that their organization isn 't as aligned as it could potentially be it 's important for ceos
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 757.74 767.88 <NA> to also expect these proportional pools and if they hear comments like well she doesn 't have enough business experience ask the question what are we going to do about that 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 767.7 775.13 <NA> it 's important for h r executives to make sure that the missing thirty three percent is appropriately emphasized <unk> 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 775.13 779.97 <NA> and it 's important for women and men who are in management positions to examine
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 779.96 787.89 <NA> <unk> the mindsets we hold about women and men about careers and success to make sure we are creating a level playing field for everybody <unk> 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 787.85 792.04 <NA> so let me close with the latest chapter in tonya 's story 
SusanColantuono_2013X 1 SusanColantuono_2013X 792.04 803.44 <NA> tonya emailed me two months ago and she said that she had been interviewed for a new position and during the interview they probed about her business acumen and her strategic insights into the industry <unk>
