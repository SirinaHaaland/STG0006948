AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 453.01 465.86 <NA> <unk> so for me personally it was quite a challenge because when i decided to make this my full time job at google my mother was not very supportive <unk> i love my mother <unk> but she thought i was wasting my life with this museum stuff
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 465.49 471.75 <NA> and for her a museum is what you do when you go on vacation and you tick mark and it 's over right and
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 471.75 479.85 <NA> it took around four and a half years for me to convince my lovely indian mother that actually this is worthwhile and the way i did it was i realized one day that she
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 480.08 492.54 <NA> <unk> gold so i started showing her all objects that have the material gold in them and the first thing my mom asks me is how can we buy these 
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 492.41 494.73 <NA> and obviously
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 494.72 502.71 <NA> <unk> my salary is not that high so i was like we can 't actually do that mom but you can explore them virtually and so now my mom

AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 504.9 515.24 <NA> <unk> more gold any more silver in your project can you show me and that 's the idea i 'm trying to illustrate <unk> it does not matter how you get in as long as you get in once you get in you 're
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 515.24 517.87 <NA> hooked moving on from here very quickly there
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 517.38 518.71 <NA> is
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 518.34 525.02 <NA> kind of a playful idea actually to illustrate the point of access and i 'm going to go quite quickly on this one we
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 525 527.88 <NA> <unk> all know that seeing the artwork
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 527.7 537.38 <NA> in person is amazing but we also know that most of us can 't do it and the ones that can afford to do it it 's complicated so cyril can we load up our
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 537.38 538.8 <NA> art trip
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 538.58 541.73 <NA> what do we call it we don 't have a good name for this but
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 541.39 549.2 <NA> essentially <unk> we have around one thousand amazing institutions sixty eight countries but let 's start with rembrandt
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 548.86 554.91 <NA> we might have time for only one example <unk> but thanks to the diversity we 've got around five hundred

AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 582.84 587.42 <NA> <unk> moving on swiftly from here is something a little bit more technical and more interesting
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 587.18 592.54 <NA> all that we 've shown you so far uses metadata to make the connections 
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 592.54 599.99 <NA> but obviously we have something cool nowadays that everyone likes to talk about which is machine learning so what we thought is let 's strip out all the
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 601.3 612.17 <NA> <unk> let 's look at what machine learning can do based purely on visual recognition of this entire collection <unk> what we ended up with is this very interesting <unk>

AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 622.15 629.97 <NA> <unk> is an art to us by itself of discovery <unk> but one of the clusters we want to show you very quickly is this amazing cluster of portraits

AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 664.8 674.04 <NA> <unk> i 'm just going to let cyril show his beautiful face and essentially what 's happening is with the movement of his head we are matching different portraits

AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 721.01 727.84 <NA> <unk> for our last quick experiment we call all of these experiments our last quick experiment comes back to machine learning
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 730.71 742.69 <NA> but what if we could ask the machine to also name these clusters <unk> what if it could automatically tag them using no actual metadata <unk> so what we have is this kind of
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 743.16 749.81 <NA> explorer <unk> where we have managed to match i think around four thousand labels <unk> and we haven 't really
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 749.81 754.97 <NA> done anything special here just fed the collection <unk> and we found interesting categories we can
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 754.93 757.22 <NA> <unk> start with horses a very straightforward
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 757.05 767.57 <NA> category you would expect to see that the machine has put images of horses right and it has but you also notice right over there that it has a very abstract image <unk>
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 767.52 775.05 <NA> that it has still managed to recognize and cluster as horses we also have an amazing head in terms of of a horse and each one
AmitSood_2016 1 AmitSood_2016 775.49 786.61 <NA> <unk> the tags as to why it got categorized in this so let 's move to another one which i found very funny and interesting because i don 't understand how this category came up it 's called lady in waiting <unk>
