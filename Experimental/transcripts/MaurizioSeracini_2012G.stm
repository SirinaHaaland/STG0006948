MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 23.12 28.85 <NA> of leonardo da vinci <unk> well <unk> he asked me if i could find some technological way
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 28.36 29.52 <NA> to unfold
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 29.83 31.68 <NA> a five centuries old mystery
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 31.25 33.03 <NA> related to
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 32.57 37.62 <NA> a lost masterpiece by leonardo da vinci the battle of anghiari which is supposed to be located
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 37.39 41.52 <NA> in the hall of the five hundred in palazzo vecchio in florence <unk> well <unk> 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 41.12 49.77 <NA> in the mid ' 70s there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me <unk> especially in italy <unk> and so i decided with
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 49.43 54.94 <NA> some researchers from the united states and the university of florence to start probing
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 55.04 56.5 <NA> the murals
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 56.19 64.25 <NA> decorated by vasari on the long walls of the hall of the five hundred searching for the lost leonardo <unk> unfortunately at that time
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 64.25 65.95 <NA> we did not know that
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 66.57 70.66 <NA> that was not exactly where we should be looking
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 70.38 79.82 <NA> because we had to go much deeper in <unk> and so the research came to a halt <unk> and it was only taken up in two thousand thanks to the
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 79.75 89.63 <NA> <unk> interest and the enthusiasm of the guinness family <unk> well <unk> this time we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the hall of the five hundred was before the remodeling <unk> 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 89.17 97.49 <NA> and the so called sala grande <unk> which was built in one thousand four hundred and ninety four and to find out the original doors windows <unk> and
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 97 99.99 <NA> in order to do that we first created a
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 101 108.69 <NA> <unk> and then with thermography we went on to discover hidden windows these are the original windows of the hall of the sala grande 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 108.5 116.77 <NA> we also found out about the height of the ceiling <unk> and we managed to reconstruct therefore all the layout of this original hall
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 116.35 123.42 <NA> the way it was before there came vasari <unk> and restructured the whole thing <unk> including
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 123.42 129.61 <NA> a staircase that that was very important in order to precisely place the battle of
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 130.16 132.13 <NA> on a specific area
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 132.12 141.04 <NA> of one of the two walls <unk> well <unk> we also learned that vasari <unk> who was commissioned to remodel the hall of the five hundred between one thousand five hundred and sixty <unk>
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 142.22 150.56 <NA> by the grand duke cosimo i of the medici family <unk> we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 150.56 154.94 <NA> by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 155.1 159.33 <NA> one that we [ see ] here masaccio the church of santa maria novella in florence 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 159.33 168.84 <NA> so we just said well maybe visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by leonardo since he was a great admirer of leonardo da vinci and so
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 168.68 175.17 <NA> we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 174.99 176.99 <NA> and searching for
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 176.5 179.58 <NA> an air gap <unk> and we did find
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 179.78 184.68 <NA> <unk> many on the right panel of the east wall an air gap <unk> and
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 184.34 193.14 <NA> that 's where we believe the battle of anghiari or at least the part that we know has been painted which is called the fight for the standard should be located <unk> well
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 192.74 198.06 <NA> from there <unk> unfortunately in two thousand and four the project
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 198.05 204.73 <NA> came to a halt <unk> many political reasons so i decided to go back to my alma mater and
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 205.05 210.67 <NA> <unk> the university of california san diego and i proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 210.18 212.11 <NA> cultural heritage <unk> 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 211.86 215.17 <NA> and in two thousand and seven we created <unk> cisa3
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 214.92 229.1 <NA> as a research center for cultural heritage specifically art architecture and archaeology so students started to flow in and we started to build technologies because that 's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and go and do fieldwork
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 230.2 234.11 <NA> <unk> we came back in the hall of the five hundred in two thousand and eleven 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 234.11 241.97 <NA> and this time with a great group of students and my colleague professor falko kuester who is now the director at cisa3 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 241.48 243.45 <NA> and we
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 243.22 249.6 <NA> came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left <unk>
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 251.06 260.89 <NA> <unk> we were confined though <unk> limited i should rather say for several reasons that it 's not worth explaining to endoscopy only of the many other options we had <unk> 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 260.89 266.62 <NA> and with a 4mm camera attached to it <unk> we were successful
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 266.4 267.4 <NA> in
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 267.19 269.01 <NA> documenting and
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 268.58 271.92 <NA> taking some fragments of
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 271.97 275.05 <NA> what it turns out to be a reddish
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 276.06 281.8 <NA> <unk> black color and there is some beige fragments that later on
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 281.34 287.56 <NA> we ran a much more sophisticated exams <unk> xrf <unk> x ray diffraction 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 287.1 292.36 <NA> and the results are very positive so far it seems to indicate that indeed
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 291.87 299.87 <NA> we have found some pigments and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before vasari came in about sixty years
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 301.06 310.25 <NA> <unk> those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to leonardo <unk> well <unk> we are searching for the highest
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 310.25 319.86 <NA> and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind <unk> as a matter of fact <unk> this is by far the most important commission that leonardo has ever
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 319.63 322.37 <NA> had and for doing
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 321.91 327.81 <NA> this great masterpiece he was named the number one artist influence at
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 330.2 334.14 <NA> <unk> i had also had the privilege since the last thirty seven years
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 333.71 343.5 <NA> to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me but basically to do what well to assess for example the state of conservation see here the face of the
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 343.34 349.99 <NA> madonna of the chair that when just shining a uv light on it you suddenly see another different lady 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 349.99 354.61 <NA> aged lady i should rather say there is a lot of varnish still sitting there
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 354.78 368.91 <NA> <unk> several retouches and some over cleaning <unk> it becomes very visible <unk> but also technology has helped to write new pages of our history or at least to update pages of our histories for example the lady with the unicorn another painting by rafael <unk> 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 368.91 374.99 <NA> well <unk> you see the unicorn a lot has been said and written about the unicorn <unk> but if you take an x ray of the unicorn it
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 381.79 384.4 <NA> <unk> with the scientific examination of this painting came out
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 384.41 392.73 <NA> that rafael did not paint the unicorn did not paint the puppy dog <unk> actually left the painting unfinished so all this writing about the
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 392.52 398.27 <NA> the exotic symbol of the unicorn unfortunately is not very reliable 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 401.54 408.33 <NA> <unk> just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 408.33 417.87 <NA> there would be a cultural revolution to say the least but also i would say a market revolution let me add take this example <unk> otto marseus <unk> nice painting
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 417.71 423.94 <NA> <unk> which is still life at the pitti gallery <unk> and just have an infrared camera peering through 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 423.94 429.94 <NA> and luckily for art historians it just was confirmed that there is a signature of otto marseus it even says
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 429.95 434.83 <NA> when it was made and also the location <unk> so that was a good result <unk>
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 436.38 441.31 <NA> <unk> not that good <unk> and so <unk> again authenticity and science
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 441 444.83 <NA> could go together and change the way 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 444.83 451.85 <NA> not attributions being made but at least lay the ground for a more objective <unk> or i should rather say
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 454.93 462.99 <NA> <unk> as it is done today <unk> but i would say the discovery that really caught my imagination my admiration is
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 462.99 466.37 <NA> the incredibly vivid drawing under this
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 465.91 472.68 <NA> layer brown layer of the adoration of the magi here you see a handmade setting
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 472.68 479.79 <NA> xyz scanner with an infrared camera put on it and just peering through this brown layer of this
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 479.75 483.93 <NA> <unk> masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 483.98 490.2 <NA> well this happens to be the most important painting we have in italy by leonardo da vinci <unk> and
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 490.07 500.02 <NA> look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries look at these portraits <unk> they 're magnificent you see leonardo at work
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 500.04 503.29 <NA> <unk> you see the geniality of his creation <unk> right
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 503.29 511.24 <NA> directly on the ground layer of the panel <unk> and see this cool thing <unk> finding i should rather say
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 512.73 520.33 <NA> an elephant because of this elephant <unk> over seventy new images came out never seen for centuries 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 520.2 524.9 <NA> this was an epiphany <unk> we came to understand and to prove
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 524.74 529.97 <NA> that the brown coating that we see today was not done by leonardo da vinci <unk> which left us only
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 529.99 535.25 <NA> <unk> the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see so thanks only to
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 535.36 543.17 <NA> technology <unk> well <unk> the tablet <unk> well <unk> we thought well <unk> if we all have this pleasure this
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 542.77 549.38 <NA> privilege to see all this to find all these discoveries what about for everybody else so we thought of
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 548.98 554.64 <NA> an augmented reality application using a tablet let me show you just
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 554.6 560.5 <NA> <unk> simulating what we could be doing <unk> any of us could be doing <unk> in a museum environment 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 560.5 565.77 <NA> so let 's say that we go to a museum with a tablet okay 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 565.49 567.61 <NA> and we just aim
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 567.41 569.58 <NA> the camera of the tablet
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 569.84 573.28 <NA> to the painting that we are interested to see
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 580.38 581.86 <NA> <unk> and now
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 581.37 592.03 <NA> let me turn to you so the moment the the image or i should say the camera has locked in the the painting then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded <unk> 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 592.02 593.53 <NA> and so
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 593.13 598.99 <NA> see we can as we said we can zoom in then we can scroll

MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 603.79 609.59 <NA> <unk> all we need is one finger just wipe off and we see the elephant 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 615.97 625.17 <NA> and then if we want we can continue the scroll to find out for example on the staircase the whole iconography is going to be changed
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 625.13 632.07 <NA> <unk> a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple <unk> and there are a lot of figures showing up see 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 632.9 641.61 <NA> this is not just a curiosity because it changes not just the iconography as you see it <unk> but the iconology <unk> the meaning of the painting 
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 641.39 642.64 <NA> and
MaurizioSeracini_2012G 1 MaurizioSeracini_2012G 642.43 649.93 <NA> we believe this is a cool way easy way that everybody could have access to to become more the protagonist of your own
