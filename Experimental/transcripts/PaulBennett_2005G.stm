PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 42.13 49.63 <NA> i thought talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers to bring people into the process of creating things
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 50.04 55.15 <NA> <unk> and that 's what i want to talk about today <unk> so <unk> bringing together the small
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 54.95 63.08 <NA> to help facilitate and create the big i think is something that we believe in something i believe in and something that we kind of bring to life
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 63.08 72.89 <NA> through what we do at ideo <unk> i call this first chapter for the brits in the room the blinding glimpse of the bleeding obvious often the good ideas are so

PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 83.14 92.13 <NA> and rather than talk about it in the theory i think i 'm just going to show you an example we were asked by a large healthcare system in minnesota
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 91.89 104.94 <NA> to describe to them what their patient experience was and i think they were expecting they 'd worked with lots of consultants before i think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this that and

PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 147.27 154.97 <NA> <unk> we showed them the whole cut and they were all completely what is this and the point is
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 154.69 156.02 <NA> <unk> is
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 157.78 160.17 <NA> when you lie in a hospital bed

PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 165.99 172.11 <NA> and just putting yourself in the position of the patient this is christian who works with us at ideo 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 172.11 177.3 <NA> he just lay in the hospital bed and kind of stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 177.09 179.76 <NA> that 's what it 's like to be a patient in the hospital
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 180.08 189.17 <NA> <unk> and they were sort <unk> you know blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious oh my goodness <unk> so <unk> looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 188.95 192.94 <NA> as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 192.94 199.93 <NA> was for these guys quite a revelation <unk> and so that was a really catalytic thing
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 200.19 209.35 <NA> <unk> so they snapped into action they said ok <unk> it 's not about systemic change it 's not about huge ridiculous things that we need to do it 's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference <unk> 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 209.35 216.65 <NA> so we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact <unk> the first thing we did
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 216.49 219.38 <NA> was we took a little bicycle mirror
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 219.14 224.9 <NA> and we band aided it here onto a gurney a hospital trolley <unk> so that when you were
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 225 233.91 <NA> wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor you could actually have a conversation with them you could kind of see them in your rear view mirror so it created a tiny human interaction 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 233.91 236.66 <NA> very small example of something that they could do interestingly
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 236.38 242.96 <NA> the nurses themselves <unk> sort of snapped into action said ok <unk> we embrace this what can we do 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 242.59 246.17 <NA> the first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 246.17 252.99 <NA> which i thought was really i showed this to my mother recently i think my mother now thinks that i 'm some sort of interior decorator it 's what i do for a living <unk> sort of laurence
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 254.96 261.55 <NA> <unk> world 's best design solution for those of us who are real sort of hard core designers but nonetheless a fabulous empathic solution for
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 261.37 267.77 <NA> people things that they started doing themselves like changing the floor
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 267.77 274.93 <NA> going into the patient 's room so that it signified this is my room this is my personal space was a really interesting sort of
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 275 281.5 <NA> design solution to the problem so you went from public space to private space and another idea again that came from one of the nurses which i love
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 281.01 288.56 <NA> was they took traditional sort of corporate white boards <unk> then they put them on one wall of the patient 's room and they put this sticker there 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 288.56 291.73 <NA> so that what you could actually do was go into the room
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 291.3 299.75 <NA> and write messages to the person who was sick in that room which was lovely so tiny tiny tiny solutions that made a huge amount of
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 300.73 303.92 <NA> <unk> i thought that was a really really nice
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 303.46 305.12 <NA> example 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 304.84 314.34 <NA> so this is not particularly a new idea kind of <unk> seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution it 's a history
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 314.15 326.93 <NA> of invention based around this i 'm going to read this because i want to get these names right joan ganz cooney saw her daughter came down on a saturday morning saw her daughter watching the test card waiting for programs to come on one morning
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 326.68 329.22 <NA> and from that came sesame street
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 330.52 339.72 <NA> <unk> malcolm mclean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 339.59 346.68 <NA> and he invented the shipping container george de mestral this is not bugs all over a birkenstock
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 346.4 350.26 <NA> was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 350.49 354.19 <NA> <unk> sort of little prickly things and from that
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 354.18 356.08 <NA> came velcro <unk> 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 356.88 365.35 <NA> and finally for the brits percy shaw this is a big british invention saw the cat 's eyes at the side of the road when he was driving home one night
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 365.07 366.98 <NA> and from that came
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 366.8 373.36 <NA> the catseye <unk> so there 's a whole series of just using your eyes seeing things for the first time seeing things afresh
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 373.36 379.52 <NA> and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities <unk> second one without sounding overly zen
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 379.96 387.59 <NA> <unk> is a quote from the buddha finding yourself in the margins looking to the edges of things is often a really interesting place to start 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 387.79 394.88 <NA> blinkered vision tends to produce i think blinkered solutions so looking wide using your peripheral vision
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 394.88 399.87 <NA> is a really interesting place to look for opportunity again another medical example
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 401.18 404.73 <NA> <unk> we were asked by a device producer
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 404.24 414.63 <NA> we did the palm pilot and the treo we did a lot of sexy tech at ideo they 'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics this was a device that a nurse <unk>
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 414.53 424.39 <NA> <unk> uses when they 're doing a spinal procedure in hospital they 'll ask the nurses to input data <unk> and they had this vision of the nurse kind of clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 430.01 436.45 <NA> this procedure taking place and i 'll explain this in a second it became very obvious that there was a human
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 436.11 442.77 <NA> dimension to this that they really weren 't recognizing when you 're having a four inch needle
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 442.77 449.72 <NA> inserted into your spine which was the procedure that this device 's data was about it was for pain management you 're shit
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 450.37 457.4 <NA> <unk> you 're freaking out and so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did was hold the patient 's hand
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 457.15 460.07 <NA> to comfort them human gesture
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 459.64 467.3 <NA> which made the fabulous two handed data input completely impossible so 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 466.96 472.43 <NA> the thing that we designed much less sexy but much more human and practical 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 472.27 473.93 <NA> was this <unk> 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 474.13 479.97 <NA> so it 's not a palm pilot by any stretch of the imagination but it has a thumb scroll so you can do everything with one hand
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 480.14 486.36 <NA> so again going back to this the idea that a tiny human gesture
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 486.13 491.28 <NA> dictated the design of this product <unk> and i think that 's really really important 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 491.87 499.9 <NA> so again this idea of workarounds we use this phrase workarounds a lot sort of looking around us i was actually looking around the ted and just watching all of these kind of
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 500 501.35 <NA> <unk> happen while i 've been here <unk> 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 501.35 510.92 <NA> this idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 510.59 513.71 <NA> is something that we look at a lot <unk> we wrote a book recently <unk>
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 513.71 521.98 <NA> <unk> i think you might have received it called thoughtless acts it 's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do which have huge intention and huge opportunity <unk> 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 521.85 523.7 <NA> why do we all
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 523.52 525.14 <NA> follow the line in the street
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 525.73 531.95 <NA> <unk> a picture in a japanese subway people consciously follow things even though <unk> why <unk> we don 't know 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 532.27 536.93 <NA> why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 536.53 543.23 <NA> because we kind of have to we 're just compelled to we don 't know why <unk> but we do <unk> 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 544.6 550.29 <NA> why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle again we 're sort of using
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 550.25 553.56 <NA> <unk> the world around us to create our own design solutions 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 553.4 562.53 <NA> and we 're always saying to our clients you should look at this stuff this stuff is really important this stuff is really vital this is people designing their own experiences you can draw from this <unk> 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 563.33 568.66 <NA> we sort of assume that because there 's a pole in the street that it 's okay to use it <unk> 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 568.66 572.98 <NA> so we park our shopping cart there it 's there for our use on some
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 572.77 579.73 <NA> some level so again we sort of co opt our environment to do all these different things we co opt other experiences we take
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 579.9 582.16 <NA> <unk> one item and transfer it to another 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 582.54 588.07 <NA> and this is my favorite one my mother used to say to me just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn 't mean you have to 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 587.61 595.48 <NA> but of course we all do we all follow each other every day so somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something that 's permission for them to do the same thing 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 595.8 604.97 <NA> and there 's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time i mean shopping bag equals parking meter out of order and we all kind of know how to read these signals now we all talk to
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 604.96 612.95 <NA> <unk> one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we 're doing third section is this idea
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 612.72 619 <NA> of not knowing of consciously putting yourself backwards i talk about unthinking situations all the time 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 619 625.05 <NA> sort of having beginner 's mind scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh a friend of mine was a designer
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 626.6 630.6 <NA> <unk> and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 630.29 640.21 <NA> this is the billy bookcase it 's ikea 's biggest selling product <unk> hammer it together hammer it together with a shoe if you 're me because they 're impossible to assemble <unk> but big selling
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 640.05 649.99 <NA> bookcase how do we replicate this for children the reality is when you actually watch children children don 't think about things like storage in linear
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 650.31 657.02 <NA> <unk> children assume permission in a very different way children live on things they live under things they live around things <unk> 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 657.02 663.58 <NA> and so their spatial awareness relationship and their thinking around storage is totally different so the first thing you have to do
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 663.48 672.67 <NA> this is graham the designer is sort of put yourself in their shoes and so <unk> here he is sitting under the table <unk> so what came out of this 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 672.24 678.14 <NA> this is the storage system that he designed <unk> so what is this i hear you all ask no i don 't
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 680.01 684.14 <NA> it 's this and i think this is a particularly lovely solution <unk> 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 683.92 690.11 <NA> so you know it 's a totally different way of looking at the situation it 's a completely empathic solution
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 690.55 693.62 <NA> apart from the fact that teddy 's probably not loving it 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 695.02 698.84 <NA> but a really nice way of <unk>
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 701.81 708.72 <NA> <unk> and i think that 's one of the things and putting yourself in the position of the person and i think that 's one of the threads that i 've heard again from
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 708.49 715.63 <NA> this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples ' shoes and really feel what they feel and then use that information to fuel solutions and i think that
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 715.63 724.84 <NA> that 's what this is very much about last section green armband we 've all got them it 's about this
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 725.34 732.07 <NA> <unk> it 's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win again that 's one of the themes that i think has come through loud and clear
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 731.87 740.63 <NA> in this conference is where do we start <unk> how do we start what do we do to start <unk> so again <unk> we were asked to design a water pump
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 740.45 744.88 <NA> for a company called approtec in kenya they 're now called kickstart 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 745.38 754.55 <NA> and again as designers we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form and that was completely irrelevant when you put yourself
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 754.72 756.56 <NA> <unk> position of
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 756.19 762.27 <NA> these people things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle <unk> 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 762.27 767.43 <NA> become much more relevant than the form of it the way it 's produced it has to be produced with indigenous
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 766.98 770.19 <NA> manufacturing methods and indigenous materials 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 770.19 779.04 <NA> so it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user we had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world so
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 778.79 779.79 <NA> what seems like a very
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 779.75 786.21 <NA> <unk> clunky product is in fact incredibly useful it 's powered a bit like a stairmaster you pump up and down on it
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 785.87 793.06 <NA> <unk> children can use it adults can use it everybody uses it it 's turning these guys again one of the themes it 's turning them
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 792.9 796.18 <NA> into entrepreneurs these guys are using this
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 796 800.14 <NA> very successfully and for us it 's been great because it 's won loads of design awards so we actually managed
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 800 801.14 <NA> <unk> to reconcile
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 800.93 806.66 <NA> the needs of the design company the needs of the individuals in the company to feel good about a product we were actually designing 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 806.66 809.86 <NA> and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 810.9 815.86 <NA> there it is pumping water from thirty feet <unk> so
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 815.97 824.9 <NA> as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning we 've made a donation on everybody 's behalf here to kick start no pun
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 825.28 827.24 <NA> <unk> their next project 
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 827.32 831.74 <NA> because again i think sort of putting our money where our mouth is here
PaulBennett_2005G 1 PaulBennett_2005G 831.58 838.53 <NA> <unk> we feel that this is an important gesture so we 've handed out bracelets small is the new big i hope you 'll all wear them <unk> so that 's it
