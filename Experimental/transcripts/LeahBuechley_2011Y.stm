LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 13.54 17.42 <NA> <unk> i 'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics 
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 17.23 25.05 <NA> i 'm <unk> among several other things <unk> an electrical engineer <unk> and that means that i spend a good
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 24.86 29.97 <NA> amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 30.43 35.46 <NA> and more specifically designing and building electronics
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 35.09 40.99 <NA> <unk> and what i 've found is that the process of designing and building
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 40.78 42.72 <NA> electronics is
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 42.53 48.03 <NA> problematic in all sorts of ways so it 's a really slow process 
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 48.03 54.97 <NA> it 's really expensive and the outcome of that process namely electronic circuit boards are
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 55.04 65.17 <NA> limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways so they 're really small generally <unk> they 're square and flat and hard <unk> and frankly <unk>
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 65.12 79.94 <NA> <unk> most of them just aren 't very attractive <unk> and so my team and i have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome of designing electronics and so what if
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 80.07 87.38 <NA> you could design and build electronics like this so what if you could do it extremely quickly
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 87.28 97.98 <NA> <unk> extremely inexpensively <unk> and maybe more interestingly really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally 
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 97.98 99.93 <NA> wouldn 't that be so cool
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 100.19 109.38 <NA> <unk> wouldn 't that open up all sorts of new possibilities i 'm going to share with you two projects that are investigations along
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 109.38 111.85 <NA> these lines and we 'll start with this one
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 125 154.94 <NA> the
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 150 173.07 <NA> that
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 217.44 226.36 <NA> <unk> we think so so now that we developed these tools and found these materials that let us do these things
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 226.17 229.94 <NA> <unk> we started to realize that essentially
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 229.93 242.51 <NA> <unk> anything that we can do with paper <unk> anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen we can now do with electronics so the next project that i want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 242.05 245.49 <NA> possibility and i 'll kind of let it speak for itself
LeahBuechley_2011Y 1 LeahBuechley_2011Y 260.48 261.76 <NA> <unk> aren
