ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 21.26 24.29 <NA> were wondering if this was really true 
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 25.57 29.73 <NA> so we assembled a team of experts spanning harvard

ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 48.83 54.97 <NA> ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth

ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 59.01 61.24 <NA> so how did we get to this conclusion <unk> 
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 61.07 71.38 <NA> so erez and i were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time <unk> so many books actually have been written over the years so we were thinking well <unk>
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 71.33 78.74 <NA> the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books <unk> now of course if there 's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely

ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 89.05 98.3 <NA> now people tend to use an alternative approach <unk> which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome <unk>

ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 211.14 217.84 <NA> now of course we were thinking well let 's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now we
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 217.35 223.09 <NA> 're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these five million books <unk> 
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 223.09 228.56 <NA> now google and jon orwant in particular told us a little equation that we should learn so you have five million

ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 475.43 486.33 <NA> <unk> with a little twist <unk> because now we 've got these nice charts <unk> and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely <unk>
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 486.28 491.47 <NA> equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result

ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 502.79 513.37 <NA> so for those of you who seek to be famous we can learn from the twenty five most famous famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor <unk> because then fame <unk>
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 513.32 523 <NA> starts rising by the end of your <unk> 20s you 're still young it 's really great <unk> now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great heights like mark twain for instance extremely famous

ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 583.32 588.02 <NA> rebounding afterward and of course what we 're seeing is the fact
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 588.02 596.89 <NA> marc chagall was a jewish artist in nazi germany now these signals are actually so strong that
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 596.73 604.94 <NA> we don 't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here 's a simple way to do it
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 605.14 611.39 <NA> well a reasonable expectation is that somebody 's fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their fame before
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 611.22 614.73 <NA> and their fame after so that 's sort of what we expect <unk> 
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 614.55 617.88 <NA> and we compare that to the fame that we observe <unk> 
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 617.88 625.2 <NA> and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then

ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 646.79 649.96 <NA> this is distribution as seen in germany very different it 's shifted to the
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 650.37 660.49 <NA> <unk> people talked about it twice less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider <unk> there are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution who are talked about ten times fewer than they <unk>
ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 1 ErezLiebermanAiden_2011X 660.39 668.47 <NA> <unk> should have been but then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda this picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record ela
