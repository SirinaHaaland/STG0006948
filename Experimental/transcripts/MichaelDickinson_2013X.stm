MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 505.74 516.04 <NA> i want to get across that it 's not just a matter of numbers but but also the challenge for a fly to compute everything its brain has to compute with such tiny neurons so this is a beautiful image of a <unk>

MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 585.23 592.84 <NA> so this is a session on frontiers in neuroscience i would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works
MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 592.89 600.05 <NA> <unk> but let 's think about this how can you make a small number of neurons do a lot and i think from
MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 601.36 611.72 <NA> <unk> you think of multiplexing you can take a hardware and have that hardware do different things at different times or have different parts of the hardware doing different things and these are the two

MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 661.95 677.09 <NA> <unk> is actually inundated by many many neuromodulators you heard about neuromodulators earlier there are more neuromodulators that that alter that innervate this structure than actually neurons in the structure <unk> and they 're able to generate
MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 679.84 689.96 <NA> <unk> work by eve marder and her many colleagues who 've been studying this fascinating system that show how a smaller cluster of neurons can do many many many things because of <unk>

MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 710 720.3 <NA> is there any evidence that flies do this well for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world we 've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators you can tether a fly to a little stick <unk>
MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 720.25 729.97 <NA> you can measure the aerodynamic forces it 's creating you can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display so let me show you

MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 814.98 829.85 <NA> <unk> the flies actually engage in active behaviors like flying and walking and so forth and why is the the physiology different well it turns out it 's these neuromodulators just like the neuromodulators in that little tiny ganglion in the crabs so here 's a picture
MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 829.96 833.3 <NA> <unk> of the octopamine system octopamine is a neuromodulator
MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 833.1 843.41 <NA> that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors but this is just one of many neuromodulators that 's in the fly 's brain <unk> so i really think that as we we learn <unk>
MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 843.31 854.94 <NA> <unk> more <unk> it 's going to turn out that the the whole fly brain is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion and that 's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons now another idea
MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 855.19 865.29 <NA> another way of multiplexing is multiplexing in space having different parts of a neuron do different things at the same time so here 's two sort of canonical neurons from a vertebrate and an <unk>

MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 880.25 893.29 <NA> idea based on the fact that this neuron from a locust does not fire action potentials it 's a non spiking cell so a typical cell like the neurons in our brain has a region called the dendrites that receives input
MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 892.86 904.97 <NA> <unk> and that input sums together and will produce action potentials that run down the axon and then activate all the output regions of the neuron but non spiking neurons are actually quite complicated
MichaelDickinson_2013X 1 MichaelDickinson_2013X 905.16 919.64 <NA> because they can have input synapses and output synapses all interdigitated <unk> and there 's no single action potential that drives all the the outputs at the same time <unk> so there 's a possibility that you have computational compartments that allow the <unk>
