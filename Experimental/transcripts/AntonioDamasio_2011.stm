AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 76.81 84.92 <NA> <unk> so much for the wonder now for the mystery this is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 84.52 90.95 <NA> all the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 90.52 104.97 <NA> <unk> this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation has got major controversies and there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it <unk> we should just leave it alone <unk> it 's not to be solved i don 't believe that
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 105.02 112.26 <NA> <unk> and i think the situation is changing <unk> it would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 112.01 121.14 <NA> in our in our brains but we certainly can begin to approach the question <unk> and we can begin to see the shape
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 120.68 126.87 <NA> of a solution and one more wonder to celebrate is the fact that
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 126.53 129.97 <NA> we have imaging technologies that now allow
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 130.11 140.41 <NA> <unk> us to go inside the human brain and be able to do for example <unk> what you 're seeing right now these are images that come from hanna damasio 's lab <unk> and which <unk>

AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 155.07 165.47 <NA> amazed about is what i 'm going to show you next which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real <unk>

AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 182.54 189.45 <NA> <unk> they are there the colors are codes for the direction from whether it is back to front or vice versa 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 189.32 194.8 <NA> at any rate <unk> what is consciousness what is a conscious mind
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 194.56 202.53 <NA> and we could take a very simple view and say well it is that which we lose when we fall into
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 202.07 204.97 <NA> deep sleep without dreams
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 205.17 212.98 <NA> or when we go under anesthesia <unk> and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 212.79 220.01 <NA> <unk> but what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia <unk> or when we are in deep dreamless sleep <unk> 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 220.01 229.76 <NA> well first of all it is a mind which is a flow of mental images <unk> and of course consider images that can be sensory patterns visual
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 229.99 241.5 <NA> <unk> as you 're having right now in relation to the stage and me or auditory images as you are having now in relation to my to my words that flow of mental images is mind <unk> 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 241.5 249.63 <NA> but there is something else that we are all experiencing in this room we are not passive exhibitors of visual or
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 254.54 269.13 <NA> <unk> we have a me that is automatically present in our minds right now we own our minds and we have a sense that it 's everyone of us that is experiencing this not the person who is sitting
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 268.64 277.11 <NA> next to you so in order to have a conscious mind <unk> you have a self within the conscious mind 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 277.11 279.94 <NA> so a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 279.96 287.28 <NA> <unk> the self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind and we are only fully conscious when self comes to mind <unk> 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 287.29 297.32 <NA> so what we need to know to even address this mystery is number one how are minds are put together in the brain and number two how selves are constructed 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 297.1 298.25 <NA> now
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 298.06 300.14 <NA> the first part the first problem
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 302.08 308.13 <NA> <unk> 's not easy at all but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience <unk> and
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 307.92 318.35 <NA> it 's quite clear that in order to make minds we need to construct neural maps <unk> so imagine a grid like the one i 'm showing you right now and now imagine within that <unk>
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 318.25 324.87 <NA> <unk> grid that <unk> two dimensional sheet imagine neurons and picture if you will a

AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 335.98 343.06 <NA> <unk> the digital elements or for that matter the neurons in the sheet you 're going to be able to construct a map 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 350.67 360.44 <NA> <unk> or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate now to bring home the point of how close it is
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 360.26 371.72 <NA> the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the the activity of the neurons and our mental experience i 'm going to tell you a personal story <unk> 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 371.72 379.97 <NA> so if i cover my left eye i 'm talking about me personally not all of you if i cover my left eye i look at the grid pretty
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 379.96 387.67 <NA> <unk> much like the one i 'm showing you everything is nice and fine and perpendicular <unk> but sometime ago i discovered that if i cover my
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 387.68 399.87 <NA> left eye <unk> instead what i get is this <unk> i look at the grid and i see a warping at the edge of my central left field very odd i 've analyzed this for a while <unk> 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 402.08 412.35 <NA> <unk> through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine carmen puliafito <unk> who developed a laser scanner of the retina <unk> i found out the the following <unk> if <unk>
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 412.3 425.4 <NA> i scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner what i get is the following on the right side my retina is perfectly symmetrical you see the going down towards the fovea
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 429.87 440.02 <NA> <unk> which is marked there by the red arrow and it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below and that is exactly what causes the warping of my <unk>
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 439.97 448.36 <NA> visual image so just think of this you have a grid of neurons and now you have a plane mechanical
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 454.9 465.38 <NA> <unk> close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball or for that matter a sheet <unk>
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 465.33 479.64 <NA> of visual cortex so from the retina you go onto visual cortex and of course the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina and in that image there
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 479.9 490.05 <NA> <unk> see a variety of islands of what i call image making regions in the brain <unk> you have the green for example that corresponds to tactile information or the <unk>
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 489.95 501.34 <NA> <unk> blue that corresponds to auditory information <unk> and something else that happens is that those image making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 504.96 515.26 <NA> <unk> purple that you see around which is the association cortex where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image making and the great <unk>
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 515.16 529.94 <NA> <unk> beauty is that you can then go from memory out of those association cortices <unk> and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception so think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 530.04 542.84 <NA> the the brain is so it provides certain areas for perception and image making and those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image making when we recall information
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 542.84 554.97 <NA> so far the mystery of the conscious mind is diminishing a little bit because we have a general sense of how we make these images <unk> but what about the self the self is really
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 554.96 557.97 <NA> <unk> the elusive problem <unk> and
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 558.29 572.19 <NA> for a long time people did not even want to touch it because they 'd say how can you have this reference point this stability that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 571.85 575.2 <NA> and i thought about a solution to this problem
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 576.12 586.26 <NA> <unk> we generate brain maps of the body 's interior and use them as the reference for all other maps <unk> so let me tell you just a little bit about how i came to this 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 586.27 588.41 <NA> i came to this because 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 588.2 596.53 <NA> if you 're going to have a reference that we know as self the me the i in in our own
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 596.04 604.97 <NA> processing we need to have something that is stable something that does not deviate much from day to day <unk> well it so
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 604.96 613.73 <NA> <unk> happens that we have a singular body we have one body not two not three and so that is a beginning <unk> there is just one reference point which is the body <unk> 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 613.73 616.53 <NA> but then of course the body has many parts <unk> and
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 616.34 624.93 <NA> things grow at different rates and they have different sizes and different people however <unk> not so with the interior <unk> the things that have to do
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 625 637.18 <NA> what is known as our internal milieu for example the whole management of the chemistries within our body are in fact extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 637.18 643.45 <NA> if you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 644.89 650.02 <NA> survival range you go into disease or death <unk> so we
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 651.45 661.69 <NA> <unk> within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity i like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day because if you don 't have that <unk>
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 661.59 669.02 <NA> <unk> sameness <unk> physiologically you 're going to be sick or you 're going to die <unk> so that 's one more element for this continuity 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 680.14 690.35 <NA> <unk> other coupling so for example i 'm making images of you <unk> but there 's no physiological bond between the images i have of you as an audience and my <unk>
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 690.25 699.81 <NA> <unk> brain <unk> however there is a close permanently maintained bond between the body regulating parts of my brain and my own
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 701 711.21 <NA> <unk> here 's how it looks <unk> look at the region there there is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord and it is within that region that i 'm going <unk>
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 711.11 716.86 <NA> <unk> to highlight now that we have this housing of all the

AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 719.96 729.97 <NA> the body <unk> this is so specific that for example <unk> if you look at the part that is covered in red in the upper part of the brain stem <unk> if you damage that
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 729.93 742.48 <NA> <unk> as a result of a stroke for example <unk> what you get is coma or vegetative state <unk> which is a state of course in which your mind disappears your consciousness disappears
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 742.11 750.05 <NA> <unk> what happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self you have no longer access to any feeling of your
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 750.04 757.85 <NA> <unk> own existence and in fact there can be images going on being formed in the cerebral cortex <unk> except you don 't know they 're there
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 757.36 767.57 <NA> <unk> you have in effect lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem but if you consider the green part <unk>
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 767.47 777.48 <NA> <unk> of the brain stem <unk> nothing like that happens it is that specific <unk> so in that green component of the brain stem <unk> if you damage it and often it happens 
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 779.98 791.91 <NA> but your conscious mind is maintained you feel <unk> you know you have a fully conscious mind that you can report very indirectly this is a horrific condition you don 't want to see it
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 791.42 797.92 <NA> and people are in fact imprisoned within their own bodies <unk> but they do have a mind there was a
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 797.92 804.94 <NA> very interesting film one of the rare good films done about a situation like this by julian schnabel some
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 805.01 814.84 <NA> some years ago about a patient that was in that condition <unk> so now i 'm going to show you a picture i promise not to say anything about this <unk> except this is to frighten you it
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 814.84 826.88 <NA> 's just to tell you that in that red section of the brain stem <unk> there are to make it simple all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make

AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 840.06 848.48 <NA> out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that i believe and i could be wrong but i don 't think i am
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 854.87 857.43 <NA> <unk> comes in the form of feelings
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 856.97 867.51 <NA> primordial feelings by the way so what is the picture that we get here look at cerebral cortex look at brain stem look at body and you get the picture of the interconnectivity <unk>
AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 867.46 879.94 <NA> in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self in a very tight interconnection with the body <unk> and you have the cerebral cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with

AntonioDamasio_2011 1 AntonioDamasio_2011 920.08 929.97 <NA> <unk> is very similar to ours <unk> which is one of the reasons why i think those other species have conscious minds like we do <unk> except that they 're not as rich as ours because they
