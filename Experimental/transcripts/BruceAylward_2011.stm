BruceAylward_2011 1 BruceAylward_2011 409.9 419.01 <NA> smallpox eradication was hard it was very very hard <unk> and polio eradication in many ways is even tougher and there 's a few reasons for that 
BruceAylward_2011 1 BruceAylward_2011 419.12 420.94 <NA> the first
BruceAylward_2011 1 BruceAylward_2011 420.75 425.14 <NA> is that when we started trying to eradicate polio about twenty years ago

BruceAylward_2011 1 BruceAylward_2011 446.64 454.97 <NA> <unk> deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we 've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly
BruceAylward_2011 1 BruceAylward_2011 455.05 462.21 <NA> <unk> when it 's exposed to too much heat and we can tell that it 's not a good vaccine to use on a child it 's not potent it 's not going to protect them

BruceAylward_2011 1 BruceAylward_2011 465.67 470.07 <NA> but the third challenge we have and probably even bigger one the biggest challenge
BruceAylward_2011 1 BruceAylward_2011 469.86 479.97 <NA> is that in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash <unk> so you could get around
BruceAylward_2011 1 BruceAylward_2011 479.99 483.08 <NA> <unk> the disease you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off with
