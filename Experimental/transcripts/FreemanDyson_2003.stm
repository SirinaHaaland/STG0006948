FreemanDyson_2003 1 FreemanDyson_2003 545.05 551.96 <NA> but better what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight the sunlight in jupiter

FreemanDyson_2003 1 FreemanDyson_2003 788.48 796.08 <NA> the rabbits compete with the sheep <unk> in new zealand <unk> so the farmers go out at night with heavily armed jeeps

FreemanDyson_2003 1 FreemanDyson_2003 797.27 802.18 <NA> shine the headlights <unk> and anything that doesn 't look like a sheep you shoot
FreemanDyson_2003 1 FreemanDyson_2003 805.38 808.32 <NA> <unk> so i have proposed to apply the same trick
FreemanDyson_2003 1 FreemanDyson_2003 808.16 816 <NA> to looking for life in the universe that if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces either on europa <unk> or further out

FreemanDyson_2003 1 FreemanDyson_2003 822.39 829.97 <NA> in order to concentrate sunlight they have to have lenses and mirrors in order to keep themselves warm <unk> and then when you shine sunlight

FreemanDyson_2003 1 FreemanDyson_2003 846.34 854.21 <NA> away from the sun <unk> the more powerful this reflection will be so actually this method of of hunting for life
FreemanDyson_2003 1 FreemanDyson_2003 853.84 854.97 <NA> gets stronger
FreemanDyson_2003 1 FreemanDyson_2003 854.99 863.92 <NA> <unk> and stronger as you go further away <unk> because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light shines out even more in

FreemanDyson_2003 1 FreemanDyson_2003 867.65 872.76 <NA> so as you go further away from the sun <unk> this becomes more and more powerful
