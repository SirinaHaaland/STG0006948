StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 534.7 539.66 <NA> and i must say that i thought that that step might just be plain impossible
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 540.82 543.14 <NA> two big things happened 
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 542.86 554.82 <NA> first a bunch of new ideas about linguistics that came from studying the computational universe and second the realization that having actual computable knowledge completely changes how one can set about

StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 581.6 586.39 <NA> so i 'm pretty pleased with it all but in many ways we 're
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 586.19 596.65 <NA> still at the very beginning with wolfram alpha <unk> i mean everything is scaling up very nicely and we 're getting getting more confident you can expect to see wolfram alpha technology showing up in more and more places

StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 715.59 729.91 <NA> to democratize programming <unk> i mean anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language then the idea is that wolfram alpha will be able to figure out what precise pieces of code can do what they 're asking for and then show them examples that will let them

StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 891.21 896.24 <NA> which when it gets big enough behaves like continuous space in much the same way as
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 896.06 904.85 <NA> having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid <unk> well <unk> then the universe has to evolve by applying little rules that progressively update this network
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 904.86 912.8 <NA> and each possible rule in a sense corresponds to a candidate universe <unk> actually i haven 't shown these before but
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 913.03 914.96 <NA> here are a few of the
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 914.76 916.84 <NA> candidate universes that
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 916.84 925.08 <NA> that i 've looked at some of these are hopeless universes completely sterile with other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space no notion
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 926.96 929.49 <NA> <unk> other problems like that but
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 929.27 941.73 <NA> the exciting thing that i 've found in the last few years is that you actually don 't have to go very far in the computational universe before you start finding candidate universes that aren 't obviously not our universe here
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 941.27 950.08 <NA> 's the problem <unk> any serious candidate for our universe is inevitably full of computational irreducibility <unk> which means
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 950.37 957.49 <NA> <unk> irreducibly difficult to find out how it will really behave and whether it matches our physical universe a
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 957.51 971.98 <NA> few years ago i was pretty excited to discover that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully reproduce special relativity and even general relativity and gravitation and at least give hints of quantum mechanics <unk> 
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 971.55 975.05 <NA> so <unk> will we find the whole of physics i don 't know
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 975.88 979.97 <NA> <unk> but i think at this point it 's sort of almost embarrassing not to at least try 
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 979.69 987.77 <NA> not an easy project one 's got to build a lot of technology one 's got to build a structure that 's probably at least as deep as existing physics <unk> 
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 987.37 993.72 <NA> and i 'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is build a team open it up offer prizes and so on but
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 993.72 1000.02 <NA> i 'll tell you here today that i 'm committed to seeing this project done to see if within
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1001.18 1009.24 <NA> <unk> we can finally hold in our hands the rule for our universe and know where our universe lies in the space of all possible universes

StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1015.37 1017.15 <NA> so
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1016.96 1028.01 <NA> i 've been working on the idea of computation now for more than thirty years building tools and methods and turning intellectual ideas into millions of lines of code and grist for server farms and so on <unk>

StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1039.92 1048.34 <NA> <unk> to the limits of technology to the very definition of the human condition <unk> i think computation is destined to be the defining idea of our future <unk> 
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1078.1 1083.99 <NA> <unk> you able to say in a sentence or two how this type of thinking
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1083.65 1090 <NA> could integrate at some point to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of as the fundamental explanations of the universe <unk>
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1092.11 1097.88 <NA> <unk> the parts of physics that we kind of know to be true things like the standard model of physics 
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1097.42 1104.94 <NA> what i 'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics or it 's simply wrong the things that people have tried to do in the last twenty five years or so with string
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1104.87 1112.45 <NA> <unk> theory and so on have been an interesting exploration that has tried to get back to the standard model but hasn 't quite gotten there 
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1112.45 1117.91 <NA> my guess is that some great simplifications of what i 'm doing may actually have
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1117.72 1124.68 <NA> considerable resonance with what 's been done in string theory but that 's a complicated math thing that
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1128.55 1135.43 <NA> <unk> in the audience he also has shown how complexity can arise out of a simple start does your work relate to his sw 
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1135.12 1141.05 <NA> i think so i view benoit mandelbrot 's work as as one of the

StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1150 1158.87 <NA> <unk> the structure is something that 's kind of tree like and where there 's sort of a big branch that makes little branches and even smaller branches and so on that 's
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1158.87 1166.17 <NA> one of the ways that you get towards true complexity <unk> i think things like the rule thirty cellular automaton
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1165.95 1175.05 <NA> get us to a different level <unk> in fact <unk> in a very precise way they get us to a different level because they seem to be things that are capable
StephenWolfram_2010 1 StephenWolfram_2010 1176.09 1182.8 <NA> <unk> complexity that 's sort of as great as complexity can ever get <unk> i could go on about this at great length
