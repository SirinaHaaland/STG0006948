AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 17.95 24.81 <NA> this is what the us congress and the national cancer institute declared just just a few years ago in two thousand and three
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 27.98 33.78 <NA> <unk> i don 't buy that i don 't think we quite won this war yet <unk> and i don 't think anyone here will will question that <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 33.32 40.59 <NA> now <unk> i will argue that a primary reason why we 're not winning this war against cancer is because we 're fighting blindly
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 40.28 44.76 <NA> i 'm going to start by sharing with you a story about a good friend of mine his name is ehud 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 44.6 46.14 <NA> and
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 45.65 54.97 <NA> a few years ago ehud was diagnosed with brain cancer and not just any type of brain cancer he was diagnosed with one of the most deadly forms of brain cancer in fact it was so deadly that
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 55.13 62.5 <NA> doctors told him that they only have twelve months <unk> and during those twelve months they have to find a treatment they have to find a cure <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 62.5 65.32 <NA> and if they cannot find a cure <unk> he will die <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 65.31 71.39 <NA> now the good news they said is that there are tons of different treatments to choose from but the bad news
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 71.22 79.46 <NA> is that in order for them to tell if a treatment is even working or not well that takes them about three months or so so they cannot try that many things
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 79.9 82.86 <NA> <unk> well <unk> ehud is now going into his first treatment <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 82.62 90.51 <NA> and during that first treatment just a few days into that treatment i 'm meeting with him and he tells me adam i think this is working i think we really lucked out here
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 90.51 97.16 <NA> <unk> something is happening and i ask him really <unk> how do you know that ehud and he says well i feel so terrible inside
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 96.7 100.04 <NA> <unk> something 's gotta be working up there it just has to 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 101.93 105.3 <NA> <unk> three months later we got the news <unk> it didn 't work <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 105.08 111.66 <NA> and so ehud goes into his second treatment <unk> and again the same story it feels so bad something 's gotta be working there 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 111.17 114.63 <NA> and then three months later again we get bad news ehud
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 114.83 121.53 <NA> is going into his third treatment and then his fourth treatment <unk> and then as predicted <unk> ehud dies <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 121.34 129.52 <NA> now <unk> when someone really close to you is going through such a huge struggle you get really swamped with emotions a lot of things are going through your head
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 130.05 133.51 <NA> <unk> for me it was mostly outrage i was just outraged that
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 133.31 136.54 <NA> that how come this is the best that we can offer <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 136.11 144.29 <NA> and i started looking more and more into this as it turns out this is not just the best that doctors could offer ehud it 's not just the best doctors could offer
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 143.93 149.74 <NA> patients with brain cancer generally we 're actually not doing that well all across the board with cancer <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 149.76 154.58 <NA> i picked up one of those statistics and i 'm sure some of you have seen those statistics before
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 154.87 160.46 <NA> <unk> this is going to show you here how many patients actually died of cancer in this case females in the united states <unk> ever since the <unk>
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 161.89 165.83 <NA> <unk> notice that there aren 't that many things that have changed it 's still a huge issue 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 165.79 172.22 <NA> you 'll see a few changes though you 'll see lung cancer for example on the rise <unk> thank you cigarettes <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 171.91 179.61 <NA> and you 'll also see that for example stomach cancer once used to be one of the biggest killers of all cancers is essentially eliminated
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 180.02 187.59 <NA> now why is that anyone knows by the way why is it that that humanity is no longer struck by stomach cancer <unk> what was the huge huge
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 187.39 194.58 <NA> medical technology breakthrough that came to our world that saved humanity from from stomach cancer
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 194.69 199.9 <NA> <unk> was it maybe a new drug <unk> or a better diagnostic you guys are right
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 200.37 207.94 <NA> <unk> it 's the invention of the refrigerator and the fact that we 're no longer eating spoiled meats so the best thing that happened to us so far
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 207.51 212.27 <NA> in the medical arena in cancer research is the fact that the refrigerator was invented 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 212.27 219.53 <NA> laughter and so yeah <unk> i know we 're not doing so well here i don 't want to miniaturize the progress and
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 219.11 225.14 <NA> and everything that 's been done in cancer research look there is like 50 plus years of good cancer research
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 225.14 229.97 <NA> that discovered major major things that taught us about cancer <unk> but all that said
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 230.01 233.54 <NA> <unk> we have a lot of heavy lifting to still do ahead of us 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 234.46 246.14 <NA> again i will argue that the primary reason why this is the case why we have not done that remarkably well is really we 're fighting blindly here and this is where medical imaging comes in this is where my own work comes in 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 245.92 254.97 <NA> and so to give you a sense of the best medical imaging that 's offered today to brain cancer patients or actually generally to all cancer patients take a look at this pet scan
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 254.96 261.67 <NA> <unk> right here let 's see there we go so this is a pet ct scan and what you 'll see in this pet ct scan
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 261.46 267.75 <NA> is the ct scan will show you where the bones are and the pet scan will show you where tumors are 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 267.74 274.84 <NA> now <unk> what you can see here is essentially a sugar molecule that was added a small little tag that is
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 277.86 286.06 <NA> <unk> and those sugar molecules are injected into these patients by the billions and they 're going all over the body looking for cells that are hungry for sugar 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 285.87 291.13 <NA> you 'll see that the heart for example lights up there that 's because the heart needs a lot of sugar 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 290.76 297.82 <NA> you 'll also see that the bladder lights up there that 's because the bladder is the thing that 's clearing the sugar away from our body 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 297.72 299.99 <NA> and then you 'll see a few other hot spots and these
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 302.11 311.91 <NA> <unk> a wonderful technology for the first time it allowed us to look into someone 's body without picking up each and every one of the cells and putting them under the microscope but in a noninvasive way
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 311.67 320.1 <NA> allowing us to look into someone 's body and ask hey <unk> has the cancer metastasized where is it and the pet scans here are showing you very clearly
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 320.1 323.69 <NA> where are these hot spots where is the tumor <unk> so <unk>
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 324.67 329.55 <NA> <unk> as miraculous as this might seem unfortunately well <unk> it 's not that great
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 330.32 337.68 <NA> <unk> you see those small little hot spots there can anyone guess how many cancer cells are in any one of these tumors <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 338.15 343.65 <NA> so it 's about one hundred million cancer cells and let me make sure that this number sunk in 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 343.19 350.17 <NA> in each and every one of these small little blips that you 're seeing on the image there needs to be at least one hundred million
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 350.28 357.94 <NA> <unk> cancer cells in order for it to be detected now if that seemed to you like a very large number it is a very large number 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 358.17 365.68 <NA> this is in fact an incredibly large number because what we really need in order to pick up something early enough to do something about it to do something meaningful about it 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 365.68 373.73 <NA> well <unk> we need to pick up tumors that are a thousand cells in size <unk> and ideally just a handful of cells in size <unk> so we 're clearly pretty far away from this 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 373.51 375.34 <NA> so we 're going to play a little
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 374.88 379.58 <NA> experiment here i 'm going to ask each of you to now play and imagine that you are brain
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 379.6 387.02 <NA> <unk> surgeons and you guys are now at an operating room and there 's a patient in front of you 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 386.59 391.31 <NA> and your task is to make sure that the tumor is out <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 390.94 393.48 <NA> so you 're looking down at the patient
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 394.81 399.78 <NA> <unk> the skin and the skull have already been removed so you 're looking at the brain <unk> and all you know about this patient
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 400.28 403.17 <NA> <unk> there 's a tumor about the size of a golf ball or so
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 402.83 405.78 <NA> in the right frontal lobe of this person 's brain 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 405.62 415.24 <NA> and that 's more or less it <unk> so you 're looking down and unfortunately everything looks the same because brain cancer tissue and healthy brain tissue really just look the same <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 415.24 424.87 <NA> and so you 're going in with your thumb and you start to press a little bit on the brain because tumors tend to be a little harder stiffer <unk> and so you go in and go a little bit like this and say it seems like the
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 427.17 432.28 <NA> <unk> then you take out your knife and start cutting the tumor piece by piece by piece and as you 're taking the tumor out 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 432.11 436.24 <NA> then you 're getting to a stage where you think alright i 'm done i took out everything 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 436.24 444.8 <NA> and at this stage if that 's so far everything sounded like pretty crazy you 're now about to face the most challenging decision of your life here <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 444.56 449.99 <NA> because now you need to decide should i stop here <unk> and let this patient go <unk> risking that
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 450.04 453.72 <NA> <unk> might be some leftover cancer cells behind that i just couldn 't see 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 453.72 462.2 <NA> or should i take away some extra margins typically about an inch or so around the tumor just to be sure that i removed everything <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 462.91 465.65 <NA> so this is not a simple
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 465.82 474.92 <NA> decision to make and unfortunately this is the decision that that brain cancer surgeons have to take every single day as they 're seeing their patients <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 474.85 478.05 <NA> and so i remember talking to a few friends of mine in the lab and
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 479.93 486.12 <NA> <unk> but not just like you tell a friend that there 's got to be a better way there 's just got to be a better way here
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 485.63 488.42 <NA> this is just incredible <unk> and so
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 488.26 498.04 <NA> we looked back remember those pet scans i told you about the sugar and so on we said hey <unk> how about instead of using sugar molecules <unk> let 's maybe take tiny tiny little particles made of gold 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 498.04 504.52 <NA> and let 's program them with some interesting chemistry around them let 's program them to look for cancer cells and
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 505.08 507.43 <NA> <unk> these gold particles into these patients
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 506.97 512.32 <NA> by the billions again and we 'll have them go all over the body and just like secret agents if you will go
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 512.32 525.05 <NA> and walk by every single cell in our body and knock on the door of that cell and ask are you a cancer cell or are you a healthy cell if you 're a healthy cell we 're moving on if you 're a cancer cell we 're sticking in and shining out and telling us 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 527.05 537.36 <NA> <unk> do it through some interesting cameras that we developed in the lab <unk> and once we see that maybe we can guide brain cancer surgeons towards taking only the tumor and leaving the healthy brain alone
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 537.36 542.75 <NA> <unk> and so we 've tested that and boy this works well <unk> so i 'm going to show you an example now <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 542.29 544.59 <NA> what you 're looking at here
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 544.36 551.6 <NA> is an image of a mouse 's brain <unk> and we 've implanted into this mouse 's brain
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 551.26 554.97 <NA> a small little tumor and so this tumor is now growing in this mouse 's brain
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 555.04 559.61 <NA> <unk> and then we 've taken a doctor and asked the doctor to please operate on the mouse as if
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 559.45 560.94 <NA> that was a patient 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 560.94 570.01 <NA> and take out piece by piece out of the tumor and while he 's doing that we 're going to take images to see where the gold particles are <unk> and so we 're going to first start
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 569.83 578.41 <NA> by injecting these gold particles into this mouse and we 're going to see right here at the very left there that image at the bottom is the image that shows where the gold particles
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 579.87 586.66 <NA> <unk> that these gold particles actually made it all the way to the tumor and then they shine out and tell us hey we 're here here 's the tumor 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 586.5 589.88 <NA> so now we can see the tumor but we 're not showing this to the doctor yet <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 589.88 598.27 <NA> we 're asking the doctor now please start cutting away the tumor and you 'll see here the doctor just took the first quadrant of the tumor and you see that first quadrant is now missing 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 597.78 602.44 <NA> the doctor then took the second quadrant the third and now it appears to be everything <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 602.37 604.97 <NA> and so at this stage the doctor came back
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 604.96 606.83 <NA> <unk> to us and said alright i 'm done 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 606.85 613.49 <NA> what do you want me to do should i keep things as they are or do you want me to take some extra margins around and then we said well hang on 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 613.49 619.8 <NA> we told the doctor you 've missed those two spots so rather than taking huge margins around <unk> only take out those tiny little areas 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 619.59 623.87 <NA> take them out and then let 's take a look and so the doctor took them away <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 623.41 624.69 <NA> and
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 624.51 629.91 <NA> lo and behold the cancer is now completely gone now the important thing is that it 's not
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 630.05 634.86 <NA> <unk> that the cancer is completely gone from this person 's brain or from this mouse 's brain 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 634.7 640.59 <NA> the most important thing is that we did not have to take huge amounts of of healthy brain in the process <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 640.1 650.17 <NA> and so now we can actually imagine a world where doctors and surgeons as they take away a tumor they actually know what to take out and they no longer have to guess with
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 651.78 659.35 <NA> <unk> here 's why it 's extremely important to take those tiny little leftover tumors those leftover tumors <unk> even if it 's just a handful of cells they will grow
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 659.04 668.81 <NA> to recur the tumor <unk> for the tumor to come back in fact the reason why eighty to ninety percent of those brain cancer surgeries ultimately fail is because of those small little
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 668.63 676.19 <NA> extra margins that were left positive those small little leftover tumors that were left there <unk> so
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 676.19 679.97 <NA> this is clearly very nice but what i really want to share with you is where i think
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 679.93 685.32 <NA> <unk> we 're heading from here <unk> and so in my lab at stanford my students and i are
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 687.69 692.28 <NA> what should we be working on now <unk> and i think where medical imaging is heading to
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 692.07 698.72 <NA> is the ability to look into the human body and actually see each and every one of these cells separately 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 698.53 704.97 <NA> the ability like this would allow us to to actually pick up tumors way way earlier in the process way before it 's one hundred
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 704.99 707.97 <NA> <unk> million cells inside so we can actually do something about it 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 707.72 721.06 <NA> an ability to to see each and every one of the cells might also allow us to ask insightful questions so in the lab we are now getting to a point where we can actually start asking these these cancer cells real questions like for example are you responding to the treatment we are giving you or not 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 721.06 727.92 <NA> so if you 're not responding we 'll know to stop the treatment right away days into the treatment not three months <unk> 
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 728 729.94 <NA> and so also for patients like
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 730.13 733.54 <NA> like ehud that are going through these nasty nasty chemotherapy
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 733.56 737.62 <NA> drugs for them not to suffer through those horrendous
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 737.62 742.87 <NA> side effects of the drugs when the drugs are in fact not even helping them so
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 743.61 750.14 <NA> to be frank here <unk> we 're pretty far away from from winning the war against cancer just to be realistic but
AdamdelaZerda_2016X 1 AdamdelaZerda_2016X 750.14 758.12 <NA> at least i am hopeful that we should be able to fight this war with better medical imaging techniques in the way that is not blind <unk> thank you
