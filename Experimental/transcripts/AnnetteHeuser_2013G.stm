AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 64.71 70 <NA> so let me tell you a little bit about what rating agencies really do 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 70.02 79.73 <NA> as you would read a car magazine before purchasing a new car or taking a look at a product review before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 80.05 87.77 <NA> <unk> investors are reading ratings before they decide in which kind of product they are investing their money 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 87.58 96.92 <NA> a rating can range from a so called aaa which means it 's a top performing product <unk> and it can go down to the level of the <unk>
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 99.09 104.55 <NA> which means it 's a fairly risky investment rating agencies are rating
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 104.51 112.05 <NA> <unk> companies they are rating banks they are rating even financial products like the infamous <unk> mortgage backed securities <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 111.59 114.21 <NA> but they can also rate countries 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 114.21 121.35 <NA> and these ratings are called sovereign ratings <unk> and i would like to focus in particular on these sovereign ratings <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 121.37 129.16 <NA> and i can tell as you 're listening to me right now you 're thinking so why should i really care about this right be honest
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 129.81 134.2 <NA> <unk> well <unk> ratings affect you they affect all of us 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 133.89 142.52 <NA> if a rating agency rates a country it basically assesses and evaluates a country 's debt
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 142.31 150.14 <NA> and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt so if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 150 164.15 <NA> <unk> the country has to pay more in order to borrow money on the international markets so it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 163.87 169.43 <NA> but what if a country can 't afford to pay more because it 's maybe too expensive <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 169.27 175.08 <NA> well <unk> then the country has less available for other services like roads schools
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 176.24 178.86 <NA> <unk> and this is the reason why you should care 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 178.37 189.4 <NA> because sovereign ratings affect everyone and that is the reason why i believe they should be defined as public goods <unk> they should be transparent <unk> accessible 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 189.4 193.77 <NA> and available to everyone at no cost <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 193.73 200.14 <NA> but here 's the situation <unk> the rating agency market is dominated by three players and three players
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 202.68 203.95 <NA> <unk> and fitch
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 203.46 210.15 <NA> and we know whenever there is a market concentration there is really no competition <unk> there is no incentive

AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 212.94 217.38 <NA> and let 's face it the credit rating agencies have contributed <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 217.38 223.36 <NA> putting the global economy on the brink and yet they have to change the way they operate <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 223.71 224.75 <NA> the second
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 226.3 231.38 <NA> <unk> you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 231.07 240.98 <NA> obviously not right that would be irresponsible <unk> but that 's actually what 's going on in the rating agency sector every single day <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 240.55 246.03 <NA> the customers of these rating agencies like countries or companies <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 246.03 252.83 <NA> they are paying for their own ratings <unk> and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 253 254.82 <NA> the third point is
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 255.38 261.57 <NA> the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 261.08 268.06 <NA> but in this day and age you can 't even sell a candy bar without listing everything that 's inside <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 268.06 272.13 <NA> but for ratings a crucial element of our economy 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 271.79 274.69 <NA> we really do not know what all the different
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 276.09 282.73 <NA> <unk> we are allowing the rating agencies to be intransparent about their work <unk> and we need to change this 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 282.51 289.43 <NA> i think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul not just a trimming at the margins 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 289.43 294.88 <NA> i think it 's time for a bold move i think it 's time to upgrade the system <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 294.57 299.84 <NA> and this is why we at the bertelsmann foundation have invested a lot of time and effort
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 300.13 303.41 <NA> <unk> thinking about an alternative for the sector <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 303.55 311.48 <NA> and we have developed the first model for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 311.48 314.93 <NA> and we call it by its acronym incra
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 315.76 319.7 <NA> incra would make a difference to the current system
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 319.6 327.57 <NA> by adding another nonprofit player to the mix it would be based on a nonprofit model
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 327.57 329.97 <NA> that would be based on a sustainable
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 330.11 342.99 <NA> <unk> endowment the endowment would create income that would allow us to run the operation to run the rating agency <unk> and it would also allow us to make our ratings publicly available 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 342.89 346.14 <NA> but this is not enough to make a difference right 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 345.71 354.88 <NA> incra would also be based on a very very clear governance structure that would avoid any conflict of interest <unk> and it would include
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 354.86 358.21 <NA> many stakeholders from society 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 358.05 368.32 <NA> incra would not only be a european or an american rating agency it would be a truly international one in which in particular the emerging economies <unk>
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 368.27 373.18 <NA> would have an equal interest voice and representation <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 380.01 382.55 <NA> on a broader set of indicators 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 382.72 390.65 <NA> think about it that way <unk> if we conduct a sovereign rating we basically take a look at the economic soil of a country 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 390.25 399.6 <NA> its macroeconomic fundamentals <unk> but we also have to ask the question <unk> who is cultivating the economic soil of a country right <unk>
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 400.97 409.01 <NA> <unk> a country has many gardeners and one of them is the government so we have to ask the question how is a country governed how is it managed <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 409.01 414.45 <NA> and this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward looking indicators 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 413.96 421.17 <NA> these are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 420.8 425.08 <NA> i hope you would agree it 's important for you to know if your government
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 431.25 432.88 <NA> <unk> important for you to know
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 432.68 442.96 <NA> if the government of your country is able to manage a crisis <unk> if the government is finally able to implement the reforms that it 's promised 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 443.13 447.32 <NA> for example if incra would rate south africa right now 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 447.32 454.19 <NA> of course we would take a very very close look at the youth unemployment of the country the highest in the world
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 455.56 460.98 <NA> <unk> if over seventy percent of a country 's population under the age of thirty five
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 460.98 469.34 <NA> is unemployed of course this has a huge impact on the economy today and even more so in the future 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 469.75 479.52 <NA> well our friends at moody 's standard & poor 's and fitch will tell us we would take this into account as well <unk> but guess what we do not know
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 480.05 486.66 <NA> <unk> how they will take this into account <unk> and this leads me to the third big difference that incra would make
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 486.41 496.56 <NA> incra would not only release its ratings but it would also release its indicators and methodology <unk> so in contrast to the current system 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 496.55 499.29 <NA> incra would be fully transparent <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 499.79 504.97 <NA> so in a nutshell incra would offer an alternative to the current
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 504.9 507.68 <NA> <unk> system of the big three rating agencies
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 507.5 514 <NA> by adding a new nonprofit player to the mix that would increase the competition 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 513.54 519.4 <NA> it would increase the transparency of the sector <unk> and it would also increase the quality 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 519.09 528.49 <NA> i can tell that sovereign ratings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very complex global financial world <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 528.63 529.94 <NA> but i tell you it 's
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 529.9 536.75 <NA> <unk> a very important one and a very important one to fix <unk> because sovereign ratings affect all of us 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 536.75 540.42 <NA> and they should be addressed and should be defined
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 540.2 549.99 <NA> as public goods <unk> and this is why we are testing our model right now and why we are trying to find out if it can bring together a group of able and
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 550 553.14 <NA> willing actors to bring incra to life 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 553.01 562.36 <NA> i truly believe building up incra is in everyone 's interest <unk> and that we have the unique opportunity right now
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 561.88 568.95 <NA> to turn incra into a cornerstone of a new more inclusive financial system <unk> 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 568.52 575.4 <NA> because for way too long we have left the big financial players on their own 
AnnetteHeuser_2013G 1 AnnetteHeuser_2013G 575.06 578.77 <NA> it 's time to give them some company <unk> thank you
