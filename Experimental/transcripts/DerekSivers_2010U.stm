DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 13.51 22.91 <NA> <unk> ted we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement <unk> so let 's watch a movement happen start to finish in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it 
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 22.42 27.57 <NA> first of course you know a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 29.98 36.02 <NA> he 's doing is so easy to follow here 's his first follower with a crucial role he 's going to show everyone else how to follow now 
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 36.03 42.52 <NA> notice that the leader embraces him as an equal now it 's not about the leader anymore it 's about them <unk> plural now
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 42.34 44.64 <NA> there he is calling to his friends now
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 44.15 52.35 <NA> if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself it takes guts to stand out like that 
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 51.98 54.94 <NA> the first follower is what transforms a
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 54.87 57.37 <NA> <unk> lone nut into a leader 
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 61.95 71.22 <NA> and here comes a second follower now it 's not a lone nut it 's not two nuts three is a crowd and a crowd is news so a movement must be public 
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 71.22 78.88 <NA> it 's important to show not just the leader <unk> but the followers because you find that new followers emulate the followers not the leader <unk> 
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 78.51 79.91 <NA> now here come two more
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 79.84 87.77 <NA> <unk> people and immediately after three more people <unk> now we 've got momentum <unk> this is the tipping point <unk> now we 've got a movement 
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 88.12 89.54 <NA> so 
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 89.17 98.21 <NA> notice that as more people join in it 's less risky so those that were sitting on the fence before now have no reason not to they won 't stand out 
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 97.78 102.27 <NA> they won 't be ridiculed <unk> but they will be part of the in crowd if they hurry
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 105.35 112.71 <NA> <unk> over the next minute you 'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in 
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 112.71 117.48 <NA> and that 's how you make a movement <unk> but let 's recap some lessons from this 
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 117.11 119.77 <NA> so first <unk> if you are the type 
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 119.77 129.28 <NA> like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone <unk> remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it 's clearly about the movement not you
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 130.65 137.75 <NA> <unk> okay <unk> but we might have missed the real lesson here the biggest lesson if you noticed did you catch it is that leadership is
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 139.86 152.35 <NA> <unk> yes it was the shirtless guy who was first and he 'll get all the credit <unk> but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut into a leader <unk> so as we 're told that we should all be leaders that would be really ineffective 
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 151.98 154.97 <NA> if you really care about starting a movement have
DerekSivers_2010U 1 DerekSivers_2010U 154.99 166.53 <NA> <unk> the courage to follow and show others how to follow and when you find a lone nut doing something great have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in <unk> and what a perfect place to do that at ted
