PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 12.78 21.33 <NA> biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo real digital human face and one of the reasons it is so difficult is that unlike
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 21.33 24.87 <NA> aliens and dinosaurs we look at human faces every day they are
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 25.04 32.35 <NA> <unk> important to how we communicate with each other as a result <unk> we 're tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering 
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 32.35 40.41 <NA> in order to believe whether these things are realistic <unk> and what i 'm going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably <unk>
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 41.99 53.02 <NA> <unk> face using some computer graphics technology we 've developed <unk> and also some collaborators at a company called image metrics and we 're going to try to do a photo real face of an actress named emily o 'brien who is right there <unk> and that 's actually a completely
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 54.93 57.13 <NA> <unk> by the end of the talk we 're going to see it move 
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 56.67 67.13 <NA> the way that we did this is we tried to start with emily herself who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory in marina del rey <unk> and sit for a session in light stage five this is a
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 67.13 79.97 <NA> face scanning sphere with one hundred and <unk> fifty six white leds all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions and the lighting that we use these days looks something like this we shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 80.25 90.5 <NA> and we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face and different principle directions of light from the light stage to figure out both <unk>
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 90.4 99.84 <NA> <unk> the coarse scale and the <unk> fine scale detail of her face if we zoom in on this photograph right here we can see it 's a really nice photograph to have of her because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 100 110.58 <NA> same time to get a nice image of her facial texture and in addition <unk> we 've actually used polarizers on all the lights just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road polarizers <unk>
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 110.48 124.15 <NA> <unk> can block the shine off of the skin so we don 't get all those specular reflections to take this map now if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit we can actually bring that specular reflection of the skin back in <unk> and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 129.87 136.46 <NA> <unk> just the shine off of emily 's skin i don 't think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this <unk> and
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 136.28 146.62 <NA> this is very important light to capture <unk> because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin it doesn 't get underneath the translucent layers of the skin and blur out and as a result it 's a very good <unk>
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 146.52 154.94 <NA> <unk> cue to the detailed shape of the skin pore structure and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have the things that actually make us look like real humans <unk> so if we
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 154.87 158.15 <NA> <unk> use information that comes off of this specular reflection <unk> 
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 157.72 167.99 <NA> we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore <unk>
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 167.89 179.55 <NA> <unk> structure and fine wrinkles and even more importantly since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture <unk> we can shoot emily in just part of an afternoon in many different facial poses and
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 180.02 190.5 <NA> <unk> expressions <unk> so here you can see her moving her eyes around moving her mouth around and these we 're actually going to use to create a photo real digital character <unk> if you take a look at these scans that we have of emily <unk>
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 190.45 198.9 <NA> <unk> you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions <unk> you can see things
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 200.67 205.12 <NA> <unk> all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs you can see that
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 204.92 210.28 <NA> the skin pore structure changes enormously from stretched skin pores
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 210.08 222.19 <NA> to the regular skin texture <unk> you can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there you can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that 
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 222.19 224.99 <NA> in addition to this kind of high resolution geometry <unk>
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 225 239.59 <NA> since it 's all captured with cameras we 've got a great texture map to use for the face and by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination the red and the green and the blue <unk> diffuse the light differently <unk> we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer then instead of looking like a
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 239.43 249.59 <NA> plaster mannequin it actually looks like it 's made out of living human flesh <unk> and this is what we used to give to the company image metrics to create a rigged <unk> 
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 250.1 260.46 <NA> <unk> version of emily we 're just seeing the coarse scale geometry here but they basically created a digital puppet of her where you can pull on these various strings <unk> and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely <unk>
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 260.36 270.96 <NA> <unk> consistent with the scans that we took and in addition to the coarse scale geometry <unk> they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called displacement maps that animate as well 
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 272.24 279.97 <NA> these are the displacement maps here and you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates <unk> so the next process was then to animate her we actually
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 279.99 290.53 <NA> <unk> used one of her own performances to provide the source data <unk> so by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques they were able to drive the facial rig with the computer generated performance <unk>
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 290.48 300.43 <NA> so what you 're going to see now <unk> after this is a completely photo real digital face we can turn the volume up a little bit if that 's available emily image metrics is a markerless <unk> performance driven animation company <unk> 
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 305.16 309.48 <NA> <unk> image metrics is a markerless performance driven animation company
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 309.24 314.87 <NA> we specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films paul debevec 
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 314.5 323.27 <NA> so if we break that down into layers here 's that diffuse component we saw in the first slide here is the specular component animating you can see all the wrinkles happening there <unk> 
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 322.9 324.84 <NA> and there is the underlying wireframe
PaulDebevec_2009X 1 PaulDebevec_2009X 328.52 329.68 <NA> <unk> and that is emily herself
