GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 429.84 440.41 <NA> <unk> actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot the robot is the same lamp that you saw and i put two brains in it for one half of the people i put in a brain that 's kind of the traditional

GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 466.99 475.02 <NA> what i found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot they thought it was more intelligent more committed a better member of the team contributed to

GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 504.41 513.28 <NA> almost what people expect robots to do so i was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots than what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing 
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 513.57 517.91 <NA> and in a way i thought maybe it 's time just like method acting
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 517.72 525.08 <NA> changed the way people thought about acting in the 19th century from going from the very calculated planned way of behaving to a more intuitive
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 526.15 530.87 <NA> <unk> embodied way of behaving maybe it 's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution

GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 540.28 549.99 <NA> to look at teamwork coordination timing improvisation and we just got this robot playing marimba and the marimba for everybody like me it was this
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 553.52 566 <NA> <unk> when i was looking at this i looked at other works in human robot improvisation yes there are other works in human robot improvisation and they were also a little bit like a chess game <unk> the human would play the robot analyzed what was played and
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 566 568.26 <NA> would improvise their own part 
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 567.77 574.9 <NA> so this is what musicians called a call and response interaction and it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 575.13 583.69 <NA> <unk> but i thought if i use the same ideas i used in the in the theater play and in the teamwork studies <unk> maybe i can make the the robots jam together like a like

GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 587.75 596.81 <NA> and so i tried to do the same things this time with music <unk> where the robot doesn 't really know what it 's about to play it just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play 
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 596.81 604.52 <NA> and does what my jazz teacher when i was seventeen taught me she said when you improvise <unk> sometimes you don 't know what you 're doing and you still do it so i tried to make a robot

GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 612.83 620.15 <NA> and improvises <unk> and then look how the human musician also responds to what the robot is doing and picking up from its

GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 679.9 687.41 <NA> <unk> ever go see a live show musicians also communicate with their bodies with other band members with the audience they use their bodies to express the music <unk> 
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 687.18 692.69 <NA> and i thought we already have a robot musician on stage why not make it be a full fledged musician 
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 692.68 699.93 <NA> and i started designing a socially expressive head for the robot <unk> the head doesnt actually touch the marimba <unk> it just expresses what the

GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 711.32 714.42 <NA> i think and
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 714.56 726.06 <NA> i went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic musician would look like but especially what a robotic musician would move like to sort of show that it doesn 't like what the other person is playing
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 725.63 728.8 <NA> and maybe show whatever whatever beat it 's feeling at the
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 730.13 739.08 <NA> <unk> so we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot which was nice i 'm going to show you now the same kind of performance this time with a socially expressive head 
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 738.86 748.63 <NA> and notice one thing how the robot is really showing us the beat it 's picking up from the human while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it 's doing 
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 748.63 749.99 <NA> and also how it changes the way

GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 781.22 785.85 <NA> <unk> now look at the final chord of the of the piece again and this time the robot
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 785.72 793.06 <NA> communicates with its body when it 's busy doing its own thing and when it 's ready to coordinate the final chord with me
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 818.28 825.08 <NA> <unk> part of the body that doesn 't touch the instrument actually helps with the musical performance <unk> and at some point we are in atlanta
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 825 834.54 <NA> so obviously some rapper will come into our lab at some point and we had we had this rapper come in and do a little jam with the with the robot <unk> here you can see
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 834.54 835.94 <NA> the robot
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 835.45 843.83 <NA> basically responding to the beat notice two things one how irresistible it is to join the robot while it 's moving its head you kind of want to move your own head when it does it
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 843.83 848.24 <NA> and second even though the rapper is really focused on his iphone 
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 847.96 854.67 <NA> as soon as the robot turns to him he turns back so even though it 's just in the periphery of his vision in the corner of his eye
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 854.99 864.57 <NA> <unk> it 's very powerful and the reason is that we can 't ignore physical things moving in our environment <unk> we are wired for that so if you have a problem maybe your partner is
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 864.57 867.69 <NA> looking at their iphone or smartphone too much
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 867.35 870.13 <NA> you might want to have a robot there to get their attention
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 897.81 904.94 <NA> <unk> to introduce the last robot that that we 've worked on it came out of something surprising that we found some point people didn 't care
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 905.04 915.8 <NA> about the robot being intelligent able to improvise and listen and do all these embodied intelligence things that i spent years developing they really liked that the robot was enjoying the music 
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 915.85 920.38 <NA> and they didn 't say the robot was moving to the music they said enjoying the music and
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 920.38 929.58 <NA> we thought why don 't we take this idea <unk> and i designed a new piece of furniture this time it wasn 't a desk lamp it was a speaker dock one of those things you plug your

GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 930.55 940.72 <NA> and i thought <unk> what would happen if your speaker dock didn 't just play the music for you but would actually enjoy it too and so again here are some animation tests from from an early stage
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 943.4 946.63 <NA> and this is what the final product looked like
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 987.76 995.88 <NA> <unk> a lot of bobbing heads in the audience so we can still see robots influence people and it 's not just fun and games i think
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 995.88 999.99 <NA> one of the reasons i care so much about robots that use their body to communicate and use their body
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 1001.72 1008.51 <NA> <unk> let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot at some point in your

GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 1013.55 1020.94 <NA> and i want these robots to be to be more fluent more engaging more graceful than currently they seem to be 
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 1020.76 1029.4 <NA> and for that i think maybe robots need to be less like chess players and more like stage actors and more like musicians maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise
GuyHoffman_2013X 1 GuyHoffman_2013X 1030.05 1035.89 <NA> <unk> they should be able to anticipate what you 're about to do maybe they even need to be able to make mistakes and correct them <unk>
