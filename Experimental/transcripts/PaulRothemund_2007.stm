PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 12.97 21.98 <NA> <unk> there 's an ancient and universal concept that words have power that spells exist and that if we could only pronounce the right words then
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 21.76 24.84 <NA> whoosh you know an avalanche would come and wipe out the
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 25.91 36.66 <NA> <unk> so this is a very attractive idea because we 're very lazy like the sorcerer 's apprentice or the world 's greatest computer programmer <unk> this idea has a lot of traction with us we love the idea that words when pronounced <unk>
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 36.61 50.25 <NA> are little more than pure information but they evoke physical action in the real world that helps us do work so of course with lots of programmable computers and robots around this is an easy thing to picture how many of you know what i 'm talking about raise your right hand
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 54.87 59.98 <NA> <unk> that was that was too easy you guys have very insecure computers <unk> ok
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 59.64 70.04 <NA> so now the thing is this is a different kind of spell this is a computer program made of zeros and ones it can be pronounced on a computer does something like this the important thing is we can write it in a high level
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 69.99 75.02 <NA> <unk> language a computer magician can write this thing it can be compiled into
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 75.04 82.13 <NA> <unk> zeros and ones and pronounced by a computer and that 's what makes computers powerful these high level languages that can be compiled and so 
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 82.18 92.78 <NA> i 'm here to tell you you don 't need a computer to actually have a spell in fact what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information you encode a spell or program as molecules <unk>
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 92.73 104.91 <NA> then physics can actually actually directly interpret that information and run a program it 's what happens in proteins <unk> when this <unk> amino acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms these little letters are sticky for each other it collapses into a
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 105.04 115.2 <NA> three dimensional shape that turns it into a nanomachine that actually cuts dna the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence you change the three dimensional folding you get now a dna <unk>
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 115.1 129.97 <NA> <unk> stapler instead these are the kind of molecular programs we want to be able to write the problem is we don 't know the machine language of proteins or have a compiler for proteins so i 've joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using dna we use dna because it 's cheaper it 's easier
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 130.02 140.71 <NA> <unk> to handle it 's something we understand really well so well in fact that we think we can actually write programming languages for dna and have molecular compilers <unk> so then we think we can do that <unk>
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 143.1 150.02 <NA> <unk> one of my first questions doing this was how can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of dna i decided to use a type of dna origami where you take a
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 150.04 158.88 <NA> <unk> long strand of dna and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want so here 's a shape i actually spent about a year in my home in my underwear coding 
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 158.67 168.98 <NA> like linus [ torvalds ] in that picture before this program takes a shape and spits out two hundred and fifty dna sequences these short dna sequences are what are going to fold the long strand into this shape that we want <unk>
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 168.88 178.23 <NA> <unk> to make so you send an e mail with these sequences in it to a company and the company pronounces them on a dna synthesizer a machine about the size of a photocopier and
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 180.08 195.1 <NA> <unk> and every letter in your e mail they replace with a 30 atom cluster one for each letter a t c and g in dna they string them up in the right sequence and then they send them back to you via fedex so you get two hundred and fifty of these in the mail in little tubes i mix them together add a little bit of salt water <unk> 
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 195.1 199.93 <NA> and then add this long strand i was telling you about that i 've stolen from a virus <unk> and then what happens is you
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 200.61 211.15 <NA> <unk> whole thing up to about boiling you cool it down to room temperature and as you do those short strands do the following thing each one of them binds that long strand in one place <unk>
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 211.1 222.4 <NA> <unk> and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so they stick together so the net effect of all two hundred and fifty of these strands is to <unk>
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 225 235.25 <NA> <unk> into the shape you 're looking for it 'll approximate that shape we do this for real in the test tube in each little drop of water you get fifty billion of these guys with a microscope you can see them on a surface the neat <unk>
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 235.15 249.87 <NA> <unk> thing is if you change the sequence and change the spell just change the sequence of the staples <unk> you can make a molecule that looks like this and you know he likes to hang out with his buddies <unk> a lot of them are actually pretty good if you change the spell again you change the sequence
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 253.04 254.32 <NA> <unk> if you do it again <unk> 
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 254.32 268.33 <NA> you can get arbitrary patterns so on a rectangle you can paint patterns of north and south america or the words dna so that 's dna origami that 's one way <unk> there are many ways of casting molecular spells
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 268.1 280 <NA> using dna what we really want to do in the end is learn how to program self assembly so we can build anything right we want to be able to build technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world we want to learn how to build
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 280.22 292.06 <NA> biological artifacts like people and whales and trees and if it 's the case that we can reach that level of complexity if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good then that will truly be magic
PaulRothemund_2007 1 PaulRothemund_2007 291.84 293.66 <NA> <unk> thank you very much
