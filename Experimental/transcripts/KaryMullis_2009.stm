KaryMullis_2009 1 KaryMullis_2009 58.62 68.56 <NA> now i was thinking about that and i said you know we 've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don 't make and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff

KaryMullis_2009 1 KaryMullis_2009 69.31 74.96 <NA> i said <unk> we can 't get rid of it because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can 't get rid of that
KaryMullis_2009 1 KaryMullis_2009 76.15 85.82 <NA> <unk> you use that what if i could stick this molecule slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me that had just invaded my lungs

KaryMullis_2009 1 KaryMullis_2009 93.18 99.84 <NA> it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on it was kind of like the same thing that happens when you like when you 're getting

KaryMullis_2009 1 KaryMullis_2009 179.96 184.95 <NA> <unk> of symbolizing this right now you can stick this to something called a dna aptamer 
KaryMullis_2009 1 KaryMullis_2009 184.46 191.47 <NA> and that dna aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it so you can find a little feature
KaryMullis_2009 1 KaryMullis_2009 191.26 200.02 <NA> on a bacterium that you don 't like like staphylococcus i don 't like it in particular because it killed a professor friend of mine last year it doesn 't respond to

KaryMullis_2009 1 KaryMullis_2009 211.16 215.77 <NA> here 's what happened <unk> see that line on the very top with the little dots 
KaryMullis_2009 1 KaryMullis_2009 215.46 225.86 <NA> that 's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in texas at brooks air base with anthrax and they had also been treated

KaryMullis_2009 1 KaryMullis_2009 230.08 243.5 <NA> <unk> direct your immune system to it you 'll notice they all lived the ones on the top line that 's a one hundred percent survival rate <unk> and they actually lived another fourteen days or twenty eight when we finally killed them and took them apart and figured out what
KaryMullis_2009 1 KaryMullis_2009 243.28 248.76 <NA> went wrong why did they not die and they didn 't die because they didn 't have anthrax anymore
