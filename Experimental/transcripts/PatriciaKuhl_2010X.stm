PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 80.02 84.89 <NA> what we see here is that language has a critical period for learning <unk>

PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 112.04 121.63 <NA> work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 121.63 129.79 <NA> we think by studying how the sounds are learned we 'll have a model for the rest of language and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for

PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 132.54 142.81 <NA> so we 've been studying the babies using a technique that we 're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages <unk> the baby sits on a parent 's lap <unk> and we train them to turn their heads <unk>

PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 161.43 167.78 <NA> they can discriminate all the sounds of all languages no matter what country we 're testing and what language we 're using

PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 176.74 186.18 <NA> so the question arises when do those citizens of the world turn into the language bound listeners that we are and the answer <unk> before their first birthdays <unk> 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 185.98 193.29 <NA> what you see here is performance on that head turn task for babies tested in tokyo and the united states here in seattle 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 193.29 198.1 <NA> as they listened to ra and la sounds important to english but not to japanese 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 197.89 199.87 <NA> so at six to eight months the babies are
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 200 201.34 <NA> <unk> totally equivalent 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 201.34 213.74 <NA> two months later something incredible occurs the babies in the united states are getting a lot better babies in japan are getting a lot worse but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn <unk> 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 213.51 216.08 <NA> so the question is what 's happening
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 215.75 222.02 <NA> during this critical two month period this is the critical period for sound development but what 's going on up there 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 222.02 229.97 <NA> so there are two things going on the first is that the babies are listening intently to us and they 're taking statistics as they listen to
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 229.93 240.69 <NA> <unk> us talk they 're taking statistics <unk> so listen to two mothers speaking motherese the universal language we use when we talk to kids first in english and then in japanese
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 255.44 263.22 <NA> <unk> production of speech when babies listen what they 're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear <unk> 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 262.82 274.35 <NA> and those distributions grow <unk> and what we 've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics and the statistics of japanese and english are very very different 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 274.35 279.61 <NA> english has a lot of rs and ls the distribution shows and the
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 280.22 287.53 <NA> of japanese is totally different where we see a group of intermediate sounds which is known as the japanese r 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 287.53 295.99 <NA> so babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains it changes them from the citizens of the world to the
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 295.56 299.63 <NA> <unk> culture bound listeners that we are but we as adults are no
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 301.57 308.09 <NA> <unk> those statistics we are governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development <unk> 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 307.69 321.42 <NA> so what we 're seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about we 're arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize it
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 321.42 329.97 <NA> 's raising lots of questions about bilingual people <unk> bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once and flip between
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 330.05 338.28 <NA> <unk> them <unk> one after the other depending on who they 're speaking to so we asked ourselves can the babies take statistics on a brand new language 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 337.79 345.49 <NA> and we tested this by exposing american babies who 'd never heard a second language to mandarin for the first time during the critical period <unk> 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 345.49 354.46 <NA> we knew that when monolinguals were tested in taipei and seattle on the mandarin sounds they showed the same pattern six to eight months they 're totally equivalent
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 354.96 364.49 <NA> <unk> months later something incredible happens but the taiwanese babies are getting better not the american babies what we did was expose american babies during this period 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 364.49 372.94 <NA> to mandarin it was like having mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for twelve sessions here 's
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 372.45 374.57 <NA> what it looked like in the laboratory
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 396.52 399.48 <NA> <unk> so what have we done to their little brains 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 401.21 411.42 <NA> <unk> we had to run a control group to make sure that coming into the laboratory didn 't improve your mandarin skills so a group of babies came in and listened to english and we can see from the graph that exposure <unk>
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 411.32 421.62 <NA> <unk> to english didn 't improve their mandarin but look at what happened to the babies exposed to mandarin for twelve sessions they were as good as the babies in taiwan who 'd been listening for ten <unk>
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 421.52 429.52 <NA> <unk> and a half months what it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language whatever you put in front of them they 'll take statistics on
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 429.96 434.11 <NA> <unk> but we wondered what role the human being played in this
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 434.1 439.1 <NA> learning exercise <unk> so we ran another group of babies in which the kids
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 438.86 443.14 <NA> got the same dosage the same twelve sessions but over a television set 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 443.14 450.05 <NA> and another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen <unk> what did we do to their
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 450.91 458.81 <NA> <unk> what you see here is the audio result no learning whatsoever and the video result
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 458.74 465.43 <NA> no learning whatsoever it takes a human being for babies to take their statistics 
PatriciaKuhl_2010X 1 PatriciaKuhl_2010X 465.44 475.23 <NA> the social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics we want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of televisions
