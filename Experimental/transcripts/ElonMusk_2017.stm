ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 19.21 25.02 <NA> <unk> in the next half hour or so we 're going to spend some time exploring your vision
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 25 33.99 <NA> for what an exciting future might look like <unk> which i guess makes the first question a little ironic <unk> why are you boring em yeah i
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 33.95 36.3 <NA> ask myself that frequently
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 37.64 41.64 <NA> we 're trying to dig a hole
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 41.51 49.63 <NA> under la and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefully be a 3d network of
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 57.33 58.81 <NA> <unk> things is traffic 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 58.86 61.99 <NA> it affects people in every part of the world
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 61.98 69.1 <NA> <unk> it takes away so much of your life it 's horrible it 's particularly horrible in <unk>
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 71.88 74.96 <NA> i think you 've brought with you the first
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 75 80.7 <NA> <unk> visualization that 's been shown of this can i show this em yeah absolutely so this is the first time
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 80.7 85.97 <NA> just to show what we 're talking about so a couple of key things that are important in
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 85.48 86.93 <NA> having
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 87.19 95.69 <NA> a 3d tunnel network first of all you have to be able to integrate the entrance and exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city so
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 95.69 100.05 <NA> by having an elevator sort of a car
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 103.31 105.93 <NA> <unk> you can integrate the entrance and exits
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 105.93 115.44 <NA> to the tunnel network just by using two parking spaces <unk> and then the car gets on a skate there 's no speed limit here so
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 115.04 119.31 <NA> we 're designing this to be able to operate at two hundred kilometers an hour <unk>
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 120.31 127.9 <NA> two hundred kilometers an hour or about one hundred and thirty miles per hour <unk> so you should be able to get from say
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 130.25 133.48 <NA> lax in six minutes five six minutes 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 137.13 140.08 <NA> ca so possibly initially done it 's like on a sort of toll <unk>
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 141.99 146.35 <NA> which i guess alleviates some traffic from the surface streets as well 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 146.35 154.57 <NA> em so i don 't know if people noticed it in the video but there 's no real limit to how many levels of of tunnel you can have 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 154.99 163.82 <NA> <unk> much further deep than you can go up the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings are tall <unk> so you can alleviate any
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 163.33 166.46 <NA> arbitrary level of urban congestion
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 166.33 173.96 <NA> with with a 3d tunnel network this is a very important point so a key rebuttal to the tunnels is that if you add
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 173.92 174.96 <NA> one layer
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 176.39 179.55 <NA> <unk> that will simply alleviate congestion it will get used up 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 179.12 186.91 <NA> and then you 'll be back where you started back with congestion but you can go to any arbitrary number of tunnels any number of levels ca but people
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 186.49 192.21 <NA> seen traditionally it 's incredibly expensive to dig and that would block this idea em 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 192.53 199.44 <NA> yeah well <unk> they 're right to give you an example the la subway extension which is
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 199.02 200.02 <NA> i think it 's a
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 200.46 209.42 <NA> <unk> mile extension that was just completed for two billion dollars so it 's roughly a billion dollars a mile to do the the subway extension in la
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 209.42 212.65 <NA> and this is not the highest utility subway in the world
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 212.64 214.6 <NA> <unk> so
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 214.95 219.5 <NA> yeah it 's quite difficult to dig tunnels normally <unk> i think we need to have at least
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 219.5 225.05 <NA> a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling ca and how could you
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 228.73 233.84 <NA> <unk> if you just do two things <unk> you can get to approximately an order of magnitude improvement
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 233.41 239.6 <NA> and i think you can go beyond that <unk> so the the first thing to do is to cut the tunnel diameter
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 239.65 245.09 <NA> by a factor of two or more so a single road lane tunnel according to
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 245.08 251.9 <NA> regulations has to be twenty six feet maybe twenty eight feet in diameter to allow for crashes and emergency vehicles
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 251.47 254.91 <NA> and sufficient ventilation for combustion
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 254.87 265.02 <NA> <unk> engine cars <unk> but <unk> if you shrink that diameter to what we 're attempting which is twelve feet which is plenty to get an electric skate through you drop the
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 264.71 270.6 <NA> the diameter by a factor of two and the cross sectional area by by a factor of four 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 270.11 274.96 <NA> and the tunneling cost scales with the cross sectional area <unk> so that 's roughly a half order of magnitude
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 276.12 277.93 <NA> <unk> then tunneling machines
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 277.56 279.04 <NA> currently
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 278.81 282.53 <NA> tunnel for half the time <unk> then they stop <unk> and then
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 282.32 285.97 <NA> the rest of the time is putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 285.97 295 <NA> so if you design the machine instead to do continuous tunneling and reinforcing that will give you a factor of two improvement <unk> combine that and that 's a factor of eight
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 294.78 297.59 <NA> also these machines are far from
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 297.35 304.82 <NA> being at their their power or thermal limits <unk> so you can jack up the power to the machine substantially <unk> i think you can get at least a factor of two
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 304.75 306.71 <NA> <unk> maybe a factor of
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 306.51 310.91 <NA> four or five improvement on on top of that so i think
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 310.91 317.93 <NA> there 's a fairly straightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess of an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 317.92 319.46 <NA> and
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 319.66 325.05 <NA> our target actually is we 've got a pet snail called gary this is from gary
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 333.41 340.3 <NA> <unk> is capable of currently he 's capable of going fourteen times faster than
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 354.96 356.44 <NA> <unk> beating the snail ca 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 356.79 366.46 <NA> but a lot of people imagining dreaming about future cities they imagine that actually the solution is flying cars drones etc you go aboveground
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 366.03 370.24 <NA> <unk> why isn 't that a better solution you save all that tunneling cost em 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 369.87 375.05 <NA> right <unk> i 'm in favor of flying things obviously i do rockets <unk> so i like
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 375 380.54 <NA> <unk> things that fly this is not some inherent bias against flying things <unk> but
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 380.41 388.79 <NA> there is a challenge with flying cars in that they 'll be quite noisy <unk> the wind force generated will be very high
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 392.11 399.57 <NA> <unk> just say that if something 's flying over your head <unk> a whole bunch of flying cars going all over the place that is not an
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 405.17 408.01 <NA> <unk> you don 't think to yourself well i feel better about
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 408.01 416.02 <NA> today you 're thinking did they service their hubcap or is it going to come off and guillotine me
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 429.75 436.18 <NA> <unk> these tunnels to use for this hyperloop idea you released a few years ago em yeah <unk> so
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 436.32 440.17 <NA> we 've been sort of puttering around with the hyperloop stuff for
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 439.92 449.62 <NA> a while <unk> we built a <unk> hyperloop test track adjacent to spacex just for a student competition to encourage innovative ideas in transport and
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 463.27 468.23 <NA> <unk> quite fun to do that but it was kind of a hobby thing <unk> and then
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 468.37 475.11 <NA> we we think we might so we 've built a little pusher car to push <unk> the student pods
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 476.63 482.04 <NA> <unk> going to try seeing how fast we can make the the pusher go if it 's not pushing something 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 482.21 488.13 <NA> so <unk> we 're cautiously optimistic we 'll be able to be faster than
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 488.39 490.36 <NA> <unk> the world 's fastest bullet train even
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 509.55 514.99 <NA> <unk> and looking at tunneling technology it turns out that in order to make a tunnel you have to
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 515.85 524.63 <NA> in order to seal against the water table <unk> you 've got to typically design a tunnel wall to be good to about five or six
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 527.5 532.76 <NA> <unk> to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere or near vacuum so
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 532.75 542.19 <NA> actually it sort of turns out that automatically if you build a tunnel that is good enough to resist the water table it is automatically capable of holding vacuum
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 557.39 562.62 <NA> <unk> you could dig as much as you want <unk> i think if you were to do something like
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 562.82 565.05 <NA> a dc to new york
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 565.4 572.76 <NA> <unk> hyperloop i think you 'd probably want to go underground the entire way because it 's a high density area you 're going
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 572.87 575.14 <NA> under a lot of buildings and houses
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 580.95 592.3 <NA> <unk> 's going to be pretty annoying to have a tunnel dug under my house like if that tunnel is dug more than about three or four tunnel diameters beneath your house you will not be able to detect it being dug at all 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 592.41 597.88 <NA> in fact if you 're able to detect the tunnel
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 597.48 604.88 <NA> being being dug whatever device you are using you can get a lot of money for that device from the israeli military who is trying to
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 604.81 609.24 <NA> <unk> detect tunnels from hamas <unk> and from the us
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 609.24 616.64 <NA> customs and border patrol that try and detect drug tunnels so the reality is that
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 616.36 628.41 <NA> earth is incredibly good at absorbing vibrations <unk> and once the tunnel depth is below a certain level it is undetectable maybe if you have a very sensitive seismic instrument you might be able to detect it
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 629.93 635.11 <NA> <unk> 've started a new company to do this called the boring company very nice very funny
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 668.31 674.87 <NA> <unk> it 's kind of puttering along but it 's making good progress so ca so an even bigger part of your time is being spent on
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 675.91 683.35 <NA> <unk> cars and transport through tesla is one of the motivations for the tunneling project the realization that
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 683.36 686.45 <NA> actually in a world where cars are electric and where they <unk>
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 687.69 693.21 <NA> there may end up being more cars on the roads on any given hour than there are now
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 704.96 709.9 <NA> <unk> will alleviate congestion <unk> and to some degree that will be true <unk> but
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 709.9 719.19 <NA> once you have shared autonomy where it 's much cheaper to go by car and you can go point to point <unk> the affordability of
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 718.88 724.05 <NA> of going in a car will be better than that of a bus like it will cost less than a bus ticket
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 723.89 725.49 <NA> so
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 725.84 729.97 <NA> the amount of driving that will occur will be much greater with shared autonomy and actually
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 729.96 736.22 <NA> <unk> traffic will get far worse ca you started tesla with the goal of of persuading the world
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 738.06 744.29 <NA> <unk> was the future of cars and a few years ago people were laughing at you now not so much
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 763.24 768.08 <NA> <unk> i think almost every automaker has some electric vehicle program 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 767.77 774.87 <NA> they vary in seriousness some are very serious about transitioning entirely to electric and some are just
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 788.6 791.94 <NA> <unk> the world electrify and you go on and focus on other stuff em 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 793.04 794.4 <NA> yeah
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 795.89 799.84 <NA> i intend to stay with tesla as as far into the future as i can imagine
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 819.63 828.4 <NA> <unk> it 's looking quite good for starting production in july ca wow <unk> one of the things that people are so excited about is is the fact that it it
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 828.87 829.97 <NA> 's got autopilot
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 830.31 834.41 <NA> and you put out this video a while back showing what that
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 834.88 840.08 <NA> what that technology would look like em yeah there 's obviously
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 839.62 844.94 <NA> autopilot in model s right now what are we seeing here em yeah so this is
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 844.84 854.7 <NA> using only cameras and gps so there 's no lidar or radar being used here <unk> this is just using passive optical which is
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 855.02 860.73 <NA> <unk> what a person uses <unk> the whole road system is meant to be navigated with
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 861.29 864.88 <NA> passive optical or cameras and so
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 864.64 867.2 <NA> once you solve cameras
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 867.04 868.92 <NA> or vision
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 869.21 877.56 <NA> <unk> then autonomy is solved <unk> if you don 't solve vision it 's not solved <unk> so that that 's why our focus is so heavily on
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 877.13 878.58 <NA> having
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 878.24 879.94 <NA> a vision neural
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 879.84 888.85 <NA> <unk> net that 's very effective for road conditions ca right many other people are going the lidar route <unk> you want cameras plus radar is is most of it em 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 888.51 892.15 <NA> you can absolutely be superhuman with just cameras 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 891.9 898.43 <NA> like you can probably do it ten times better than humans would just cameras ca so the new cars being sold right now have
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 898.24 900.02 <NA> eight cameras
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 920.29 925.17 <NA> <unk> by the end of the year you 're saying someone 's going to sit in a tesla without
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 929.27 937.65 <NA> <unk> won 't ever have to touch the wheel by the end of two thousand and seventeen em yeah essentially november
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 937.22 944.82 <NA> or december of this year <unk> we should be able to go all the way from a parking lot in california to a parking lot in new york <unk> 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 944.81 947.74 <NA> no controls touched at any point during the entire journey
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 955.16 962.23 <NA> teslas driving all these roads you 're accumulating a huge amount of data of that national road system em 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 963 967.03 <NA> yes but the thing that will be interesting is that
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 966.63 971.77 <NA> i 'm actually fairly confident it will be able to do that route
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 972.48 975.05 <NA> even if you change
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 978.4 979.73 <NA> <unk> it 's fairly easy
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 979.57 984.68 <NA> if you say i 'm going to be really good at one specific route <unk> that 's one thing but
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 984.7 993.44 <NA> it should be able to go really be very good certainly once you enter a highway to go anywhere on the highway system
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 993.07 999.78 <NA> in a given country <unk> so it 's not sort of limited to <unk> la to new york we could change it and make it
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1005.52 1009.68 <NA> la to new york now go from la to toronto 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1009.85 1015.41 <NA> ca so leaving aside regulation for a second in terms of the technology alone
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1015.37 1021.14 <NA> the time when someone will be able to buy one of your cars and literally just
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1021.07 1027.27 <NA> take the hands off the wheel and go to sleep and wake up and find that they 've arrived how far away is that to do that
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1030.04 1032.1 <NA> so the real trick of it is not
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1031.61 1036.96 <NA> how do you make it work say ninety nine point nine percent of the time <unk> because 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1036.77 1043.51 <NA> like if a car crashes one in a thousand times <unk> then you 're probably still not going to be comfortable falling asleep
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1054.99 1058.51 <NA> <unk> no system is going to be perfect <unk> but if you say it 's perhaps
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1059.01 1066.23 <NA> the car is unlikely to crash in a hundred lifetimes or a thousand lifetimes <unk> 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1066.23 1068.65 <NA> then people are like ok wow <unk> 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1068.16 1070.97 <NA> if i were to live a thousand lives <unk> i would
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1070.79 1074.81 <NA> still most likely never experience a crash then that 's probably ok ca to sleep
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1075.55 1083.78 <NA> <unk> i guess the big concern of yours is that people may actually get seduced too early to think that this is safe <unk> and that you 'll have some horrible incident happen that
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1083.5 1091.52 <NA> puts things back em well i think that the autonomy system is likely to at least mitigate the crash <unk> 
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1091.03 1093.71 <NA> except in rare circumstances <unk>
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1093.43 1096.09 <NA> the thing to appreciate about
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1095.93 1098.84 <NA> vehicle safety is this is this is probabilistic
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1101 1106.83 <NA> <unk> there 's some chance that any time a human driver gets in a car that they will have an accident that is their fault
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1107.09 1114.7 <NA> <unk> it 's never zero <unk> so really the key threshold for autonomy is
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1114.51 1117.33 <NA> how much better does autonomy need to be
ElonMusk_2017 1 ElonMusk_2017 1117.14 1123.24 <NA> than a person before you can rely on it ca but once you get literally safe hands off driving
