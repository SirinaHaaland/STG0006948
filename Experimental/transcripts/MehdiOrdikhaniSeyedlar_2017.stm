MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 67.2 73.09 <NA> but that 's your covert attention which is constantly scanning the surrounding area <unk> 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 73.11 75.02 <NA> where you don 't actually look at

MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 99.42 101.75 <NA> and if it doesn 't function well <unk> 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 101.62 104.85 <NA> then these computers themselves can be used as assistive

MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 106.28 110.49 <NA> for therapies <unk> but that also means something 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 110.84 118.32 <NA> because choosing the wrong patterns will give us the wrong models and therefore the wrong therapies right 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 119.12 123.24 <NA> in case of attention <unk> the fact that we can
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 123.38 129.88 <NA> shift our attention not only by our eyes but also by thinking that
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 129.84 139.03 <NA> <unk> makes covert attention an interesting model for computers <unk> so i wanted to know what are the brainwave patterns when you look
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 138.63 141.94 <NA> overtly or when you look covertly 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 142.02 144.61 <NA> i set up an experiment for that 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 144.48 151.54 <NA> in this experiment there are two flickering squares one of them flickering at a slower rate than the other one 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 152.13 154.88 <NA> depending on which of these flickers you are
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 154.84 161 <NA> <unk> paying attention to certain parts of your brain will start resonating in the same rate
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 160.72 170.51 <NA> as that flickering rate so by analyzing your brain signals <unk> we can track where exactly you are watching
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 170.29 172.7 <NA> or you are paying attention to 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 174.49 179.97 <NA> so to see what happens in your brain when you pay overt attention <unk> i asked people
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 180.02 188.4 <NA> <unk> to look directly in one of the squares and pay attention to it in this case not surprisingly we saw that
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 188.3 194.91 <NA> these flickering squares appeared in their brain signals which was coming from the back of their head 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 195.11 199.5 <NA> which is responsible for the processing of your visual information 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 201 206.32 <NA> <unk> was really interested to see what happens in your brain when you pay covert attention <unk> 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 205.98 212.8 <NA> so this time i asked people to look in the middle of the screen and without moving their eyes 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 212.67 216.46 <NA> to pay attention to either of these squares 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 216.63 224.26 <NA> when we did that we saw that both of these flickering rates appeared in their brain signals <unk> but interestingly 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 224.16 229.7 <NA> only one of them which was paid attention to had stronger signals
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 229.84 241.46 <NA> <unk> so there was something in the brain which was handling this information so that thing in the brain was basically the activation of the frontal area 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 241.96 249.72 <NA> the front part of your brain is responsible for higher cognitive functions as a human the frontal
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 250.52 254.13 <NA> <unk> it seems that it works as a filter
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 254.15 261.18 <NA> trying to let information come in only from the right flicker that you are paying attention to
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 260.96 265.77 <NA> and trying to inhibit the information coming from the ignored one 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 266.96 275.05 <NA> the filtering ability of the brain is indeed a key for attention which is missing in some people

MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 281.39 288.91 <NA> inhibit these distractors and that 's why they can 't focus for a long time on a single task <unk> 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 289.11 292.21 <NA> but what if this person could

MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 352.2 359.14 <NA> <unk> imagine if we can find brainwave patterns when people think about images or even letters <unk> 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 359.25 364.93 <NA> like the letter a generates a different brainwave pattern than the letter b and so on 
MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 1 MehdiOrdikhaniSeyedlar_2017 364.47 369.1 <NA> could a computer one day communicate for people who can 't speak
