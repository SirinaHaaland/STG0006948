ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 380.02 387.62 <NA> <unk> it 's unfiltered <unk> and sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now <unk> they 're endangered because we 're moving towards

ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 465.82 475.2 <NA> is being served here by just allowing people there are very few places now where you can go and not have identity to be be completely anonymous and say and say whatever you 'd like
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 475.16 481.02 <NA> <unk> and saying whatever you like i think is powerful doing whatever you like is now crossing a line <unk> but
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 480.79 489 <NA> i think it 's important to have these places when i get emails people say thank you for giving me this place this outlet where i can come after work and
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 488.8 495.48 <NA> be myself ca but words saying things you know can be
ChristopherPoole_2010 1 ChristopherPoole_2010 495.48 504.52 <NA> constructive it can be really damaging and if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you <unk> i mean surely there are huge risks with that
