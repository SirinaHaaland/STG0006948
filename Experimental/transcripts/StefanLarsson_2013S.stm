StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 13.42 22.59 <NA> <unk> i was on a sabbatical <unk> and i returned to the medical university where i studied i saw real patients and i wore
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 22.59 29.28 <NA> the white coat for the first time in seventeen years in fact since i became a management consultant
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 30.47 34.17 <NA> <unk> there were two things that surprised me during the month i spent 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 33.98 41.16 <NA> the first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost cutting 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 41.45 48.46 <NA> and the second thing which really bothered me actually was that several of the colleagues i met <unk> former friends from medical school 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 48.46 53.5 <NA> who i knew to be some of the smartest most motivated engaged and passionate
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 53.28 54.64 <NA> people i 'd ever met
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 55.26 62.05 <NA> <unk> many of them had turned cynical disengaged <unk> or had distanced themselves from hospital management 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 62.28 68.71 <NA> so with this focus on cost cutting i asked myself are we forgetting the patient 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 69.3 74.75 <NA> many countries that you represent and where i come from struggle with the cost of
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 76.24 82.79 <NA> <unk> it 's a big part of the national budgets and many different reforms aim at holding back this growth 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 82.51 87.05 <NA> in some countries we have long waiting times for patients for surgery 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 86.71 92.3 <NA> in other countries new drugs are not being reimbursed and therefore don 't reach patients 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 92.23 102.21 <NA> in several countries <unk> doctors and nurses are the targets to some extent for the governments after all the costly decisions
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 102.04 104.76 <NA> in health care are taken by doctors and nurses
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 105.02 110.52 <NA> <unk> you choose an expensive lab test <unk> you choose to operate on an old and frail patient 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 110.69 117.93 <NA> so by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians this is a way to hold costs down 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 118.4 126.93 <NA> and ultimately some physicians will say today that they don 't have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 126.83 129.94 <NA> so no wonder that some of my old colleagues are
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 129.9 131.11 <NA> <unk> frustrated 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 131.7 139.66 <NA> at bcg we looked at this and we asked ourselves this can 't be the right way of managing healthcare <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 139.53 141.82 <NA> and so we took a step back
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 141.69 150.26 <NA> and we said what is it that we are trying to achieve ultimately in the healthcare system <unk> we 're aiming at improving health
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 150.25 151.94 <NA> <unk> for the patients 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 151.66 158.66 <NA> and we need to do so at a limited or affordable cost we call this value based healthcare 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 158.32 161.96 <NA> on the screen behind me you see what we mean by value 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 161.89 167.03 <NA> outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 167.44 174.9 <NA> this was described beautifully in a book in two thousand and six by michael porter and elizabeth teisberg on this
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 177.71 180.87 <NA> <unk> surrounded by his three beautiful daughters <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 180.71 189.06 <NA> when we started doing our research at bcg <unk> we decided not to look so much at the costs but to look at the quality instead 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 188.87 195.3 <NA> and in the research one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 195.2 200.05 <NA> you compare hospitals in a country you 'll find some that are extremely good but you 'll find
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 207.24 215.47 <NA> <unk> he suffers from prostate cancer <unk> and he probably needs surgery <unk> now living in europe he can choose to go to germany that has a <unk>
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 216.44 225.46 <NA> healthcare system if he goes there and goes to the average hospital he will have the risk of becoming incontinent
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 225.84 229.97 <NA> by about fifty percent so he would have to start wearing diapers
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 230.02 234.86 <NA> <unk> again <unk> you flip a coin <unk> fifty percent risk that 's quite a lot 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 234.7 242.72 <NA> if he instead would go to hamburg <unk> and to a clinic called the martini klinik the risk would be only one in twenty 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 242.83 250.19 <NA> either you a flip a coin or you have a one in twenty risk that 's a huge difference a seven fold difference <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 249.82 252.59 <NA> when we look at many hospitals
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 252.4 254.97 <NA> for many different diseases we see these huge
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 255.05 256.53 <NA> <unk> differences <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 256.64 263.19 <NA> but you and i don 't know <unk> we don 't have the data <unk> and often the data actually doesn 't exist nobody knows <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 263 266.07 <NA> so going the hospital is a lottery <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 267.41 270.9 <NA> now it doesn 't have to be that way <unk> there is hope 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 271.64 279.97 <NA> in the late ' 70s there were a group of swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting <unk> and they were discussing
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 279.93 281.8 <NA> <unk> the different procedures they used
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 281.63 290.77 <NA> to operate hip surgery to the left of this slide you see a variety of metal pieces artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 291.39 299.95 <NA> they all realized they had their individual way of operating <unk> they all argued that my technique is the best but none of them actually knew and they admitted that <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 301.03 304.05 <NA> <unk> we probably need to measure quality
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 303.84 308.09 <NA> so we know and can learn from what 's best 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 308.02 313.91 <NA> so they in fact spent two years debating so what is quality in hip surgery oh
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 313.66 320.63 <NA> we should measure this no we should measure that and they finally agreed <unk> and once they had agreed they started measuring 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 320.71 325.11 <NA> and started sharing the data <unk> very quickly they found that if you
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 325.37 331.74 <NA> <unk> put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in it actually lasted a lot longer 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 331.4 335.67 <NA> and most patients would never have to be <unk> re operated on in their lifetime 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 335.45 340.59 <NA> they published the data <unk> and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 340.31 349.87 <NA> everybody saw this makes a lot of sense since then they publish every year <unk> once a year they publish the league table who 's best who 's at the bottom <unk>
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 350.49 355.66 <NA> <unk> and they visit each other to try to learn so a continuous cycle of improvement 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 356.52 361.9 <NA> for many years swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 361.9 366.19 <NA> at least for those who actually were measuring and many were not 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 366.69 375.2 <NA> now i found this principle really exciting so the physicians get together they agree on what quality is they start measuring
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 375.85 382.58 <NA> <unk> they share the data <unk> they find who 's best <unk> and they learn from it continuous improvement <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 383.32 388.01 <NA> now that 's not the only exciting part that 's exciting in itself 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 387.97 391.38 <NA> but if you bring back the cost side of the equation 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 391.38 400.02 <NA> and look at that it turns out those who have focused on quality <unk> they actually also have the lowest costs although that 's not been the purpose in the first place
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 400.64 409.44 <NA> <unk> so if you look at the hip surgery story again <unk> there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the u s and sweden <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 409.52 415.77 <NA> they looked at how many patients have needed to be re operated on seven years after the first surgery 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 415.67 420.48 <NA> in the united states the number was three times higher than in sweden <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 420.65 429.82 <NA> so many unnecessary surgeries <unk> and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 429.75 438.74 <NA> <unk> period <unk> now you can imagine how much savings there would be for society <unk> we did a study where we looked at oecd data
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 439.76 447.88 <NA> does every so often look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries the
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 447.84 453.23 <NA> united states has for many diseases <unk> actually a quality which is below the average in
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 455.14 464.67 <NA> <unk> now if the american healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality and raise quality just to the level of average oecd <unk> it would save the american
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 464.46 471.22 <NA> people five hundred billion u s dollars a year that 's twenty percent
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 471.22 474.83 <NA> of the budget of the healthcare budget of the country <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 475.58 485.04 <NA> <unk> now you may say that these numbers are fantastic and it 's all logical <unk> but is it possible this would be a paradigm shift in healthcare <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 484.7 486.76 <NA> and i would argue that
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 486.37 495.9 <NA> not only can it be done <unk> but it has to be done <unk> the agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system in
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 496.64 504.88 <NA> my practice as a consultant <unk> i meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 504.81 509.38 <NA> <unk> staff every year <unk> the one thing they have in common is
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 509.21 518.56 <NA> they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients physicians are like most of you in the audience very competitive 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 519.06 523.57 <NA> they were always best in class <unk> we were always best in class 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 524.34 529.49 <NA> and if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 529.78 536.21 <NA> <unk> better than what others do <unk> they will do whatever it takes to improve but most of them don 't know <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 536.44 542.87 <NA> but physicians have another characteristic <unk> they actually thrive from peer recognition 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 542.77 552.17 <NA> if a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results <unk> they will share <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 551.89 554.55 <NA> they will share the information on how to improve
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 555.41 562.35 <NA> so it is by measuring and creating transparency you get a cycle of continuous improvement <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 562.4 564.78 <NA> which is what this slide shows <unk> 
StefanLarsson_2013S 1 StefanLarsson_2013S 565.16 572.64 <NA> now you may say this is a nice idea <unk> but this isn 't only an idea this is happening in reality <unk>
