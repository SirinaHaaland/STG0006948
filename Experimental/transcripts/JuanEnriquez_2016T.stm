JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 32.96 38.88 <NA> as you 're thinking about that let me talk about that in the context of prosthetics

JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 63.57 72.22 <NA> more and more useful more and more modern you can hold soft boiled eggs <unk> you can have all types of controls and as you 're thinking about that 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 71.88 77.11 <NA> there are wonderful people like hugh herr who have been building absolutely extraordinary prosthetics 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 77.25 79.97 <NA> so the wonderful aimee mullins will go out and
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 80.22 87.02 <NA> say how tall do i want to be tonight or hugh will say what type of cliff do i want to climb <unk> or
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 86.65 95.93 <NA> does somebody want to run a marathon or does somebody want to ballroom dance and as you adapt these things the interesting thing about prosthetics is they 've been coming inside the body <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 96.16 100.08 <NA> so these external prosthetics have now become artificial knees they 've become
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 101.69 103.71 <NA> <unk> and then they 've evolved further
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 103.46 107.55 <NA> to become not just nice to have but essential to have 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 107.42 111.63 <NA> so when you 're talking about a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic you
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 111.32 121.14 <NA> 're talking about something that isn 't just i 'm missing my leg it 's if i don 't have this i can die and at that point a prosthetic becomes a symbiotic

JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 131.88 143.5 <NA> are working on a center for extreme bionics and the interesting thing of what you 're seeing here is these prosthetics now get integrated into the bone they get integrated into the skin they get integrated into the muscle <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 143.88 147.1 <NA> and one of the other sides of ed
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 146.85 154.97 <NA> is he 's been thinking about how to connect the brain using light or other mechanisms directly to things like these prosthetics
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 155.22 158.3 <NA> <unk> and if you can do that then you can begin
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 158.13 166.31 <NA> changing fundamental aspects of humanity <unk> so how quickly you react to something depends on the diameter of a nerve <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 166.45 171.26 <NA> and of course if you have nerves that are external or prosthetic 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 171.07 179.97 <NA> say with light or liquid metal <unk> then you can increase that diameter and you could even increase it theoretically to the point where as long as you could see the muzzle flash
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 179.75 182.94 <NA> <unk> flash you could step out of the way of a bullet 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 183.35 187.26 <NA> those are the order of magnitude of changes you 're talking about 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 187.67 193.14 <NA> this is a fourth sort of level of prosthetics these are phonak hearing aids and
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 192.86 200.67 <NA> the reason why these are so interesting is because they cross the threshold from where prosthetics are something for somebody who is disabled 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 201.05 203.71 <NA> and they become something that somebody who is
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 204.72 207.49 <NA> <unk> normal might want to actually have 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 207.06 215.09 <NA> because what this prosthetic does which is really interesting is not only does it help you hear you can focus your hearing so it can hear the conversation going on over there 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 215.09 223.81 <NA> you can have superhearing you can have hearing in three hundred and sixty degrees you can have white noise you can record and oh by the way they also put a phone into this <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 223.95 229.91 <NA> so this functions as your hearing aid and also as your phone and at that point somebody might actually
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 229.84 232.07 <NA> <unk> want to have a prosthetic

JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 238.66 244.55 <NA> and it 's about time we ask the question how do we want to evolve human beings over the next century or two 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 245.14 248.09 <NA> and for that we turn to a great philosopher
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 248.44 251.79 <NA> who was a very smart man despite being a yankee fan
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 254.96 259.89 <NA> <unk> yogi berra used to say of course that it 's very tough to make predictions especially about the future 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 260.6 267.18 <NA> so instead of making a prediction about the future to begin with let 's take what 's happening in the present with people like tony atala 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 267.18 270.24 <NA> who is redesigning 30 some odd organs <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 270.71 278.8 <NA> and maybe the ultimate prosthetic isn 't having something external titanium maybe the ultimate prosthetic is take your own gene code remake your own body parts
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 279.96 283.96 <NA> <unk> because that 's a whole lot more effective than any kind of a prosthetic <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 283.92 288.46 <NA> but while you 're at it then you can take the work of craig venter and ham smith <unk>

JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 298.92 304.67 <NA> so if you can change the cells in those organs maybe you make those organs more radiation resistant maybe you make them

JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 347.87 354.97 <NA> where we can change human genetics by using viruses to attack things like aids <unk> or we can change the

JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 357.51 363.66 <NA> some hereditary diseases or we can change the environment and change the expression of those genes in the epigenome

JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 387.52 395.48 <NA> so why in the world would you ever want to do this stuff why would we really want to alter the human body in a fundamental way <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 396.52 399.9 <NA> the answer lies in part with lord

JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 817.5 826.12 <NA> so how about the brain two possible outcomes to this experiment <unk> if you can get a mouse
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 825.84 828.98 <NA> that is functional <unk> then you can see
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 829.99 835.76 <NA> <unk> is the new brain a blank slate <unk> and boy does that have implications 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 836.62 838.49 <NA> second option <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 838.36 847.22 <NA> the new mouse recognizes minnie mouse the new mouse remembers what it 's afraid of remembers how to navigate the maze <unk> and if that is true <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 847.75 851.81 <NA> then you can transplant memory and consciousness 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 852.61 854.94 <NA> and then the really interesting question is
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 855.01 859.31 <NA> <unk> if you can transplant this is the only input output mechanism
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 859.12 860.82 <NA> this down here 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 860.93 865.74 <NA> or could you transplant that consciousness into something that would be very different 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 865.67 873.49 <NA> that would last in space that would last tens of thousands of years that would be a completely redesigned body that could hold consciousness
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 873.3 875.05 <NA> for a long long period of
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 878.31 882.28 <NA> <unk> 's come back to the first question why would you ever want to do that <unk>
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 885.3 887.35 <NA> <unk> because this is the ultimate selfie 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 889.98 895.3 <NA> this is taken from six billion miles away <unk> and that 's earth <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 896.31 899.99 <NA> and that 's all of us <unk> and if that little
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 901.48 903.2 <NA> <unk> all of humanity goes <unk> 
JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 903.85 909.35 <NA> and the reason you want to alter the human body is because you eventually want a picture that says

JuanEnriquez_2016T 1 JuanEnriquez_2016T 917.08 921.41 <NA> and that 's the reason why it turns out it 's actually unethical
