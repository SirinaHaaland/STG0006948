TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 12.46 14.51 <NA> <unk> some years ago i
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 14.08 24.47 <NA> stumbled across a simple design exercise that helps people understand and solve complex problems and like many of these design exercises it kind of seems trivial at first <unk>
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 24.42 29.97 <NA> <unk> but under deep inspection it turns out that it reveals unexpected truths about the
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 29.87 39.42 <NA> <unk> way that we collaborate and make sense of things the exercise has three parts and begins with something that we all know how to do which is how to make toast 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 39.23 49.5 <NA> it begins with a clean sheet of paper a felt marker and without using any words you begin to draw how to make toast and most people draw something like this they draw <unk>
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 49.4 54.55 <NA> <unk> a loaf of bread which is sliced then put into a toaster the toast is then deposited for some time
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 54.99 60.64 <NA> <unk> it pops up <unk> and then voila after two minutes toast and happiness 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 60.54 74.93 <NA> now over the years i 've collected many hundreds of drawings of these toasts <unk> and some of them are very good because they really illustrate the toast making process quite clearly <unk> and then there are some that are well <unk> not so good <unk> they
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 75 77.96 <NA> <unk> really suck actually because you don 't know what they 're trying to say 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 78.94 92.46 <NA> under close inspection some reveal some aspects of toast making while hiding others so there 's some that are all about the toast and all about the transformation of toast and there 's others that are all about the toaster
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 92.46 96.74 <NA> <unk> and the engineers love to draw the the mechanics of this 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 97.27 100.05 <NA> and then there are others that are about people <unk> 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 100.28 112.8 <NA> <unk> about visualizing the experience that people have and then there are others that are about the supply chain of making toast that goes all the way back to the store it goes through the supply chain networks of teleportation
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 112.46 121.62 <NA> and all the way back to the field and and wheat and one all actually goes all the way back to the big bang so it 's crazy stuff but i think
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 121.62 129.91 <NA> it 's obvious that that even though these drawings are really wildly different they share a common quality and i 'm wondering if you can see it do you see it
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 129.95 131.63 <NA> what 's common about these
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 131.42 143.83 <NA> most drawings have nodes and links so nodes represent the tangible objects like the toaster and people and links represent the connections between the nodes 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 143.83 154.97 <NA> and it 's the combination of links and nodes that produces a full systems model and it makes our private mental models visible about how we think something works
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 155.07 162.24 <NA> <unk> so that 's the value of these things what 's interesting about these systems models is how they reveal our various points of view <unk> so for example <unk> 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 162.24 174 <NA> americans make toast with a toaster that seems obvious <unk> whereas many europeans make toast with a frying pan of course <unk> and many students make toast with a fire
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 179.9 185.22 <NA> <unk> counting the number of nodes and the average illustration has between four and eight nodes
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 185.22 193.29 <NA> <unk> less than that the drawing seems trivial but it 's quick to understand and more than thirteen the drawing
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 192.92 204.97 <NA> produces a feeling of map shock it 's too complex so the sweet spot is between five and thirteen so if you want to communicate something visually have between five and thirteen nodes in
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 204.93 218.43 <NA> <unk> your diagram <unk> so though we may not be skilled at drawing the point is that we intuitively know how to break down complex things into simple things and then bring them back together again so this brings us to our second
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 218.43 224.78 <NA> part of the exercise which is how to make toast <unk> but now with sticky notes or with cards <unk> so what happens then
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 226.3 236.45 <NA> <unk> with cards most people tend to draw clear more detailed <unk> and more logical nodes you can see the step by step analysis that takes place and as they build up <unk>
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 236.35 245.37 <NA> <unk> their model they move their nodes around <unk> rearranging them like lego blocks now <unk> though this might seem trivial it 's actually really important 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 254.72 261.99 <NA> <unk> process and systems theorists do tell us that the ease with which we can change a representation correlates
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 261.76 265.23 <NA> to our willingness to improve the model <unk> 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 265.04 274.99 <NA> so sticky note systems are are not only more fluid they generally produce way more nodes than static drawings the drawings are much richer and
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 275 282.58 <NA> brings us to our third part of the exercise which is to draw how to make toast but this time in a group so what happens then well
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 282.84 284.74 <NA> here 's what happens 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 284.37 294.64 <NA> it starts out messy <unk> and then it gets really messy <unk> and then it gets messier but as people refine the models the best nodes become more prominent and with <unk>
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 294.54 300.11 <NA> <unk> each iteration the model becomes clearer because people build on top of each other 's ideas
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 300.46 308.3 <NA> <unk> what emerges is a unified systems model that integrates the diversity of everyone 's individual points of view 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 308.07 321.81 <NA> so that 's a really different outcome from what usually happens in meetings isn 't it so these drawings can contain twenty or more nodes <unk> but participants don 't feel map shock because they participate in the building of their models themselves 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 321.81 329.97 <NA> now what 's also really interesting that the groups spontaneously mix and add additional layers of organization to it to deal with contradictions
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 329.93 333.54 <NA> <unk> for example they add branching patterns and parallel patterns oh 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 333.47 341.94 <NA> and by the way if they do it in complete silence they do it much better and much more quickly really interesting talking gets in the way 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 341.48 354.97 <NA> so here 's some key lessons that that can emerge from this <unk> first drawing helps us understand the situations as systems with nodes and their relationships movable cards produce better systems
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 354.93 364.66 <NA> <unk> models because we iterate much more fluidly <unk> and then the group notes produce the most comprehensive models because we synthesize several points of view <unk> 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 364.47 372.76 <NA> so that 's interesting <unk> when people work together under the right circumstances group models are much better than individual models
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 372.76 375.85 <NA> so this approach works really great for
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 375.81 379.94 <NA> drawing how to make toast but what if you wanted to draw something more relevant
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 380.11 382.19 <NA> <unk> or pressing like
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 382.21 388.79 <NA> your organizational vision or customer experience or long term sustainability 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 389.08 403.55 <NA> there 's a visual revolution that 's taking place as more organizations are addressing their wicked problems by collaboratively drawing them out and i 'm convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 403.06 404.64 <NA> really have an edge
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 405.26 418.47 <NA> <unk> and the practice is really pretty simple you start with a question <unk> you collect the nodes you refine the nodes you do it over again you refine and refine and refine and the patterns emerge
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 418.28 423.21 <NA> <unk> and the group gets clarity and you answer the question <unk> 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 424.85 429.94 <NA> so this simple act of visualizing and doing over
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 429.9 430.95 <NA> <unk> and over again
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 430.76 441.23 <NA> produces some really remarkable outcomes what 's really important to know is that it 's the conversations that are the important aspects not just the models themselves <unk> 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 441.23 449.96 <NA> and these visual frames of reference can grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes so one example is from an organization
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 450.94 463.97 <NA> <unk> big publishing company they lost a bunch of money one year and their executive team for three days visualized their entire practice and what 's interesting is that after visualizing the entire
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 463.63 474.93 <NA> business systems upon systems they reclaimed fifty million dollars of revenue <unk> and they also moved from a d rating to an a rating from their customers 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 475.16 478.23 <NA> <unk> because there 's alignment from the executive team 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 478.13 487.95 <NA> so i 'm now on a mission to help organizations solve their wicked problems by using collaborative visualization and on a site that i 've produced called <unk>
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 489.28 492.58 <NA> i 've collected a bunch of best practices 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 492.58 500.29 <NA> and so you can learn how to run a workshop here you can learn more about the visual language and the structure of links and nodes
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 500.05 501.4 <NA> that you can apply to general
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 504.87 508.87 <NA> <unk> various templates for unpacking the thorny problems that we all
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 508.67 510.77 <NA> face in our organizations 
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 510.77 524.72 <NA> so the seemingly trivial design exercise of drawing toast helps us get clear <unk> engaged and aligned so next time you 're confronted with an interesting challenge remember what design has to teach us make your ideas
TomWujec_2013G 1 TomWujec_2013G 527.65 534.75 <NA> <unk> it 's simple it 's fun <unk> it 's powerful and i believe it 's an idea worth celebrating <unk> thank you
