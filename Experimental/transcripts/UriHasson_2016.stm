UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 12.79 20.48 <NA> <unk> imagine that you invented a device that can record my memories my dreams my ideas and transmit them to your brain 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 20.23 29.76 <NA> that would be a game changing technology right but in fact <unk> we already possess this device and it 's called human communication system and
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 29.72 31.68 <NA> <unk> effective storytelling <unk>
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 31.34 40.2 <NA> to understand how this device works we have to look into our brains and we have to formulate the question in a slightly different manner <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 40.2 42.09 <NA> now we have to ask
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 41.84 44.71 <NA> how these neuron patterns in my brain
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 44.71 54.55 <NA> that are associated with my memories and ideas are transmitted into your brains <unk> and we think there are two factors that enable us to communicate
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 55.05 57.01 <NA> <unk> first your brain is now
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 56.81 61.48 <NA> physically coupled to the sound wave that i 'm transmitting to your brain 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 61.48 67.3 <NA> and second <unk> we developed a common neural protocol that enabled us to communicate <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 66.93 69.04 <NA> so how do we know that 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 68.79 74.99 <NA> in my lab in princeton <unk> we bring people to the fmri scanner and we scan their brains while they
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 78.61 83.69 <NA> <unk> and to give you a sense of the stimulus we are using let me play twenty seconds
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 83.41 92.61 <NA> from a story that we used <unk> told by a very talented storyteller jim o 'grady jim o 'grady so i 'm banging out my story and i know it 's good
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 92.61 94.76 <NA> and then i start to make it
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 94.57 95.99 <NA> better 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 97.87 99.81 <NA> by adding an element of
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 107.72 116.65 <NA> <unk> and they recommend against crossing that line <unk> but i had just seen the line crossed between a high powered dean
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 116.65 126.46 <NA> and assault with a pastry <unk> and i kinda liked it uri hasson ok <unk> so now let 's look into your brain and see what 's happening when you listen to these kinds of stories and let 's start simple
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 126.25 129.34 <NA> let 's start with one listener and one brain area
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 130.02 138.77 <NA> <unk> cortex that processes the sounds that come from the ear and as you can see in this particular brain area the responses are going up and down as the story is unfolding
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 138.77 149.47 <NA> now we can take these responses and compare them to the responses in other listeners in the same brain area <unk> and we can ask how similar are the responses across all listeners 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 150 152.73 <NA> so here you can see five listeners <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 152.52 159.54 <NA> and we start to scan their brains before the story starts when they 're simply lying in the dark and waiting for the story to begin <unk>
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 159.33 163.79 <NA> as you can see the brain area is going up and down in each one of them <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 163.79 172.25 <NA> but the responses are very different <unk> and not in sync <unk> however <unk> immediately as the story is starting something amazing is happening jo 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 172.45 175.14 <NA> so i 'm banging out my story and i know it 's good
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 175.4 180.48 <NA> <unk> and then i start to make it uh suddenly you can see that the responses in all of the subjects
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 180.02 190.18 <NA> lock to the story and now they are going up and down in a very similar way across all listeners and in fact <unk> this is exactly what is happening now in your brains when you
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 204.96 207.7 <NA> <unk> think of these five metronomes as five brains 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 207.5 210.46 <NA> and similar to the listeners before the story starts 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 210.46 214.81 <NA> these metronomes are going to click <unk> but they 're going to click out of phase 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 218.97 224.3 <NA> now see what will happen when i connect them together by placing them on these two cylinders
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 230.05 239.31 <NA> <unk> start to rotate this rotation vibration is going through the wood and is going to couple all the metronomes together and now listen to the click
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 256.51 264.75 <NA> is it simply the sounds that the speaker is producing or maybe it 's the words or maybe it 's the meaning that the speaker is trying to convey <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 264.26 273.73 <NA> so to test it we did the following experiment <unk> first we took the story and played it backwards <unk> and that preserved many of the original auditory features <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 273.73 275.22 <NA> but removed
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 283.32 289.37 <NA> <unk> and we flashed colors in the two brains to indicate brain areas that respond very similarly across people <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 289.37 299.77 <NA> and as you can see this incoming sound induced entrainment or alignment in all of the brains in auditory cortices that process the sounds but it didn 't spread deeper into the brain <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 300 312.42 <NA> <unk> now we can take these sounds and build words out of it so if we take jim o 'grady and scramble the words we 'll get a list of words jo an animal assorted facts <unk> and right on pie man potentially my stories uh 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 312.42 321.36 <NA> and you can see that these words start to induce alignment in early language areas <unk> but not more than that now we can take the words and start to build sentences out
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 330.25 332.19 <NA> nice details 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 331.88 342 <NA> didn 't she only know about him through me uh now you can see that the responses in all the language areas that process the incoming language become aligned or similar across all listeners <unk>
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 341.75 349.96 <NA> however only when we use the full <unk> engaging coherent story do the responses spread deeper into the brain into
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 350.61 359.73 <NA> <unk> which include the frontal cortex and the parietal cortex and make all of them respond very similarly <unk> and we believe that these responses in higher order areas are induced
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 359.51 369.18 <NA> or become similar across listeners <unk> because of the meaning conveyed by the speaker and not by words or sound <unk> and if we are right there 's a strong prediction over here
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 369.02 377.23 <NA> if i tell you the exact same ideas using two very very different sets of words your brain responses will still be similar 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 376.98 379.94 <NA> and to test it we did the following experiment in my lab
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 380.59 382.94 <NA> we took the english story
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 382.45 391.61 <NA> and translated it to russian now you have two different sounds and linguistic systems that convey the exact same meaning <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 391.27 395.37 <NA> and you play the english story to the english listeners <unk>
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 395.2 400.23 <NA> and the russian story to the russian listeners <unk> and we can compare their responses across the groups
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 401.09 403.53 <NA> <unk> we did that we didn 't see responses
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 403.04 411.54 <NA> that are similar in auditory cortices in language because the language and sound are very different however you can see that the responses in high order areas
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 411.14 414.45 <NA> were still similar across these two groups <unk>
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 414.62 423.39 <NA> we believe this is because they understood the story in a very similar way as we confirmed using a test after the story ended <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 423.86 429.94 <NA> and we think that this alignment is necessary for communication <unk> for example <unk> as you can tell
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 430.2 442.9 <NA> i am not a native english speaker i grew up with another language and the same might be for many of you in the audience <unk> and still we can communicate how come <unk> we think we can communicate because we have this
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 442.41 449.81 <NA> common code that presents meaning <unk> so far i 've only talked about what 's happening in the listener 's brain in your
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 451.93 455.87 <NA> <unk> happening in the speaker 's brain in my brain when i 'm speaking to you 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 455.65 457.82 <NA> to look in the speaker 's brain <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 457.81 468.41 <NA> we asked the speaker to go into the scanner <unk> we scan his <unk> brain and then compare his brain responses to the brain responses of the listeners listening to the story 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 468.22 474.33 <NA> you have to remember that producing speech and comprehending speech are very different processes
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 479.8 482.82 <NA> saw that all these complex patterns
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 482.48 487 <NA> within the listeners actually came from the speaker brain <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 487 492.58 <NA> so production and comprehension rely on very similar processes <unk> and we also found
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 492.39 494.56 <NA> the stronger the similarity
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 494.33 501.31 <NA> between the listener 's brain and the speaker 's brain the better the communication <unk> so i know
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 501.07 503.14 <NA> that if you are completely confused now
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 504.87 507.97 <NA> <unk> case your brain responses are very different than mine <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 507.97 515.99 <NA> but i also know that if you really understand me now then your brain <unk> and your brain and your brain are really similar to mine
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 517.35 524.63 <NA> now let 's take all this information together and ask how can we use it to transmit a memory that i have from my
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 529.96 536.24 <NA> <unk> people watch for the first time in their life a tv episode from the bbc series sherlock while we scanned their brains <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 536.24 542.84 <NA> and then we asked them to go back to the scanner and tell the story to another person that never watched the movie <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 542.71 551.55 <NA> so let 's be specific think about this exact scene when sherlock is entering the cab in london driven by the murderer he is looking for
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 554.87 563.58 <NA> <unk> there is a specific brain pattern in my brain when i watch it now the exact same pattern i can reactivate in my brain again by telling the <unk>
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 564.82 567 <NA> london <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 566.54 572.8 <NA> murderer and when i 'm transmitting these words to your brains now you have to reconstruct it in your mind <unk>
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 572.8 579.31 <NA> in fact we see that pattern emerging now in your brains and we were really surprised to see
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 580.14 590.14 <NA> <unk> that the pattern you have now in your brains when i 'm describing to you these scenes would be very similar to the pattern i had when i watched this movie a few months ago in the scanner
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 589.89 595.42 <NA> this starts to tell you about the mechanism by which we can tell stories and transmit information 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 595.2 604.76 <NA> because for example <unk> now you 're listening really hard and trying to understand what i 'm saying and i know that it 's not easy <unk> but i hope that at one point in the talk we
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 604.69 606.65 <NA> <unk> clicked <unk> and you got me
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 606.31 612.63 <NA> and i think that in a few hours a few days a few months you 're going to meet someone at a party <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 612.63 622.05 <NA> and you 're going to tell him about this lecture <unk> and suddenly it will be as if he is standing now here with us now you can see how we can take this
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 621.87 624.63 <NA> mechanism and try to transmit
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 624.32 625.32 <NA> memories
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 625.28 628.65 <NA> <unk> and knowledge across people which is wonderful right 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 628.52 632.22 <NA> but our ability to communicate relies
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 631.79 639.63 <NA> on our ability to have common ground <unk> because for example if i 'm going to use the british synonym 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 639.4 646.54 <NA> hackney carriage instead of cab i know that i 'm going to be misaligned with most of you in the audience
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 646.54 650.02 <NA> this alignment depends not only on our ability to understand the basic
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 650.94 657.43 <NA> <unk> it also depends on our ability to develop common ground and understanding and shared belief systems 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 657.43 664.03 <NA> because we know that in many cases people understand the exact same story in very different ways <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 663.96 667.6 <NA> so to test it in the lab we did the following experiment <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 667.59 669.16 <NA> we took a story by <unk>
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 670.67 678.53 <NA> in which a husband lost track of his wife in the middle of a party and he 's calling his best friend <unk> asking did you see my wife
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 680.07 685.46 <NA> half of the subjects we said that the wife was having an affair with the best friend <unk> for <unk>
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 687.37 688.58 <NA> that the
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 688.41 691.92 <NA> wife is loyal and the husband is very jealous 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 691.92 701.43 <NA> this one sentence before the story started was enough to make the brain responses of all the people that believed the wife was having an affair be very similar in
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 705.02 719.49 <NA> <unk> if one sentence is enough to make your brain similar to people that think like you and very different than people that think differently than you think how this effect is going to be amplified in real life when we are all listening to the exact same news item
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 719.15 729.82 <NA> after being exposed day after day after day to different media channels like fox news or the new york times that give us very different perspectives on reality
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 731.04 738.07 <NA> so let me summarize if everything worked as planned tonight i used my ability to vocalize sound
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 737.9 746.89 <NA> to be coupled to your brains and i used this coupling to transmit my brain patterns associated with my memories and ideas into your brains 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 746.73 754.91 <NA> in this i start to reveal the hidden neural mechanism by which we communicate and we know that in the future it will enable us to
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 754.87 759.95 <NA> <unk> improve and facilitate communication <unk> but these studies also reveal
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 760.03 763.73 <NA> that communication relies on a common ground 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 763.33 772.56 <NA> and we have to be really worried as a society if we lose this common ground and our ability to speak with people that are slightly different than us
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 772.4 779.97 <NA> because we let a few very strong media channels take control of the mic <unk> and manipulate and control the way we all
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 779.99 781.02 <NA> <unk> think 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 780.77 786.49 <NA> and i 'm not sure how to fix it because i 'm only a scientist but maybe one way to do it
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 786.49 793.83 <NA> is to go back to the more natural way of communication <unk> which is a dialogue in which it 's not only me speaking to you now <unk> 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 793.52 797.49 <NA> but a more natural way of talking in which i
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 797.06 804.97 <NA> am speaking and i am listening and together we are trying to come to a common ground and new ideas because after
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 805.02 807.49 <NA> <unk> all the people we are coupled to
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 807.06 809.05 <NA> define who we are 
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 808.88 814.59 <NA> and our desire to be coupled to another brain is something very basic that starts at a very
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 814.6 820.78 <NA> early age <unk> so let me finish with an example from my own private life
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 820.62 825.2 <NA> that i think is a good example of how coupling to other people
UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 825.4 833.74 <NA> <unk> really going to define who we are this my son jonathan at a very early age <unk> see how he developed a vocal game

UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 859.85 866.52 <NA> <unk> the ability of my son to be coupled to us and other people in his life is going to shape the man he is going to become

UriHasson_2016 1 UriHasson_2016 874.1 879.97 <NA> so keep being coupled to other people keep spreading your ideas <unk> because the sum of all of us
