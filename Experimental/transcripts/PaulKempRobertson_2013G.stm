PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 13.21 19.73 <NA> <unk> if i was to ask you what the connection between a bottle of tide detergent and sweat was
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 19.73 24.23 <NA> you 'd probably think that 's the easiest question that you 're going to be asked in edinburgh all week
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 24.16 29.94 <NA> but if i was to say that they 're both examples of alternative or new forms of currency
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 29.86 37.23 <NA> in a hyperconnected data driven global economy you 'd probably think i was a little bit bonkers
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 36.74 40.08 <NA> but trust me i work in advertising laughter and
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 41.42 46.42 <NA> i am going to tell you the answer but obviously after this short break
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 46.42 54.7 <NA> so a more challenging question is one that i was asked actually by one of our writers a couple of weeks ago and i didn 't know the answer what 's the world 's best performing currency
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 55.14 56.8 <NA> <unk> it 's actually bitcoin
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 56.43 62.57 <NA> now for those of you who may not be familiar bitcoin is a crypto currency a virtual currency synthetic currency
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 62.36 67.81 <NA> it was founded in two thousand and eight by this anonymous programmer using a pseudonym
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 67.81 74.3 <NA> satoshi nakamoto no one knows who or what he is he 's almost like the banksy of the internet
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 74.08 75.08 <NA> and i 'm probably not
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 75.16 76.2 <NA> <unk> do it
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 75.7 82.05 <NA> proper service here but my interpretation of how it works is that bitcoins are released through this process of mining
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 82.05 96.57 <NA> so there 's a network of computers that are challenged to solve a very complex mathematical problem and the person that manages to solve it first gets the bitcoins and the bitcoins are released they 're put into a public ledger called the blockchain and then they float so they become a currency
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 96.35 99.87 <NA> and completely decentralized that 's the sort of scary thing
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 100.67 106.38 <NA> <unk> so popular so it 's not run by the authorities or the state it 's actually managed by the network
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 105.89 112.2 <NA> and the reason that it 's proved very successful is it 's private it 's anonymous it 's fast and it 's cheap
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 111.86 126.38 <NA> and you do get to the point where there 's some wild fluctuations with bitcoin so in one level it went from something like thirteen dollars to two hundred and sixty six literally in the space of four months and then crashed and lost half of its value in six hours and it 's currently around that kind of one hundred and ten
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 126.38 128.37 <NA> dollar mark in value
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 127.91 129.97 <NA> but what it does show is
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 129.93 140.11 <NA> <unk> that it 's sort of gaining ground it 's gaining respectability you get services like reddit and wordpress are actually accepting bitcoin as a payment currency now and that 's showing you that people are actually <unk>
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 140.01 148.79 <NA> <unk> placing trust in technology and it 's started to trump and disrupt and interrogate traditional institutions and how we think about currencies
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 154.99 169.58 <NA> <unk> that said something like in america trust in banks is at an all time low it 's something like twenty one percent and you can see here some photographs from london where barclays sponsored the city bike scheme and some activists have done some nice piece of guerrilla marketing here and doctored the slogans
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 169.12 176.21 <NA> sub prime pedaling barclays takes you for a ride these are the more polite ones i could share with you today
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 176.26 179.97 <NA> but you get the gist so people have really started to sort of lose faith
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 179.75 180.8 <NA> <unk> faith
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 180.35 186.24 <NA> in institutions there 's a p r company called edelman they do this very interesting survey every year
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 186.24 192.09 <NA> precisely around trust and what people are thinking and this is a global survey so these numbers are global
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 191.69 195.13 <NA> and what 's interesting is that you can see that hierarchy
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 195.13 204.94 <NA> is having a bit of a wobble and it 's all about heterarchical now so people trust people like themselves more than they trust corporations and governments and if you look at these
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 204.9 215.32 <NA> <unk> figures for the more developed markets like u k germany and so on they 're actually much lower and i find that sort of scary people are actually trusting businesspeople more than they 're trusting governments and leaders
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 215.43 225.1 <NA> so what 's starting to happen if you think about money if you sort of boil money down to an essence it is literally just an expression of value an agreed value
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 225.19 234.27 <NA> <unk> so what 's happening now in the digital age is that we can quantify value in lots of different ways and do it more easily and sometimes the way that we quantify those values
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 234.27 240.71 <NA> it makes it much easier to create new forms and valid forms of currency
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 240.4 246.35 <NA> in that context you can see that networks like bitcoin suddenly start to make a bit more sense
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 246.97 254.82 <NA> so if you think we 're starting to question and disrupt and interrogate what money means what our relationship with it is what
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 254.75 259.26 <NA> <unk> defines money then the ultimate extension of that is
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 258.89 263.55 <NA> is there a reason for the government to be in charge of money anymore
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 263.06 267.55 <NA> so obviously i 'm looking at this through a marketing prism so from a brand perspective
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 267.55 274.11 <NA> brands literally stand or fall on their reputations and if you think about it reputation has now become a currency
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 273.65 279.7 <NA> you know reputations are built on trust consistency transparency so if you 've actually
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 280.14 287.12 <NA> <unk> that you trust a brand you want a relationship you want to engage with the brand you 're already kind of participating in lots of new forms
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 287.12 294.64 <NA> of currency so you think about loyalty loyalty essentially is a micro economy you think about rewards schemes
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 294.39 304.22 <NA> air miles the economist said a few years ago that there are actually more unredeemed air miles in the world than there are dollar bills in circulation
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 304.96 313.02 <NA> <unk> you know when you are standing in line in starbucks thirty percent of transactions in starbucks on any one day are actually being made with starbucks star points
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 313.02 316.82 <NA> so that 's a sort of starbucks currency staying within its ecosystem
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 316.51 323.09 <NA> and what i find interesting is that amazon has recently launched amazon coins
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 322.6 329.94 <NA> so admittedly it 's a currency at the moment that 's purely for the kindle so you can buy apps and make purchases within those apps but you think about
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 329.87 334.53 <NA> <unk> amazon you look at the trust barometer that i showed you where people are starting to trust
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 334.37 340.26 <NA> businesses especially businesses that they believe in and trust more than governments so suddenly
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 340.26 350.02 <NA> you start thinking well amazon potentially could push this it could become a natural extension that as well as buying stuff take it out of the kindle you could buy books music real life products
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 351.06 359.3 <NA> <unk> appliances and goods and so on and suddenly you 're getting amazon as a brand is going head to head with the federal reserve in terms of how you want to spend your money
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 359.3 362.08 <NA> what money is what what constitutes money
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 362.07 366.62 <NA> and i 'll get you back to tide the detergent now as i promised
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 366.62 376.87 <NA> this is a fantastic article i came across in new york magazine where it was saying that drug users across america are actually purchasing drugs with bottles of tide detergent
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 376.71 379.97 <NA> so they 're going into convenience stores stealing tide
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 380.08 387.08 <NA> <unk> and a dollar twenty bottle of tide is equal to ten dollars of crack cocaine or weed
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 386.86 401.54 <NA> and what they 're saying so some criminologists have looked at this and they 're saying well okay tide as a product sells at a premium it 's fifty percent above the category average it 's infused with a very complex cocktail of chemicals so it smells very luxurious and very distinctive
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 401.26 404.88 <NA> and being a procter and gamble brand it 's been supported by a lot of
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 404.81 407.01 <NA> <unk> mass media advertising
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 406.73 416.52 <NA> so what they 're saying is that drug users are consumers too so they have this in their neural pathways when they spot tide there 's a shortcut they say that is trust i trust that that 's quality
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 416.09 419.47 <NA> so it becomes this unit of currency
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 419.47 427.86 <NA> which the new york magazine described as a very oddly loyal crime wave brand loyal crime wave and criminals are actually calling tide liquid gold
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 427.49 429.88 <NA> now what i thought was funny was the reaction from the
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 429.81 435.1 <NA> <unk> the p g spokesperson they said obviously tried to dissociate themselves from drugs but said
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 435.06 440.32 <NA> it reminds me of one thing and that 's the value of the brand has stayed consistent laughter
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 440.67 451.7 <NA> which backs up my point and shows he didn 't even break a sweat when he said that so that brings me back to the connection with sweat in mexico nike has run a campaign recently called literally bid your sweat
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 451.47 454.61 <NA> so you think about these nike shoes have got sensors in them or
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 454.9 460.28 <NA> <unk> nike fuelband that basically tracks your movement your energy your calorie consumption
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 460.15 470.36 <NA> and what 's happening here this is where you 've actually elected to join that nike community you 've bought into it they 're not advertising loud messages at you and that 's where advertising has started to shift now is into things like <unk>
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 470.31 479.97 <NA> services tools and applications so nike is literally acting as a well well being partner a health and fitness partner and service provider so what happens with this is they 're saying right
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 480.1 490.53 <NA> you have a data dashboard we know how far you 've run how far you 've moved what your calorie intake all that sort of stuff what you can do is the more you run the more points you get and we have an auction where you can buy <unk>
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 490.48 495.58 <NA> nike stuff but only by proving that you 've actually used the product to do stuff
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 500 506.29 <NA> products you can 't buy stuff with pesos this is literally a closed environment a closed auction space
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 506.58 508.34 <NA> in africa
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 508.13 515.93 <NA> you know airtime has become literally a currency in its own right people are used to because mobile is king they 're very very used to
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 515.75 528.49 <NA> transferring money making payments via mobile and one of my favorite examples from a brand perspective going on is vodafone where in egypt lots of people make purchases in markets and very small independent stores
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 528.49 529.94 <NA> loose change small change
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 529.99 536.36 <NA> <unk> a real problem and what tends to happen is you buy a bunch of stuff you 're due say ten ten cents twenty cents in change
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 536.16 547.85 <NA> the shopkeepers tend to give you things like an onion or an aspirin or a piece of gum because they don 't have small change so when vodafone came in and saw this problem this consumer pain point they created some small change which they call fakka
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 547.85 554.88 <NA> which literally sits and is given by the shopkeepers to people and it 's credit that goes straight onto their mobile phone so this
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 554.81 564.84 <NA> <unk> currency becomes credit which again is really really interesting and we did a survey that backs up the fact that you know forty five percent of people in this very crucial demographic
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 564.38 574.05 <NA> in the u s were saying that they 're comfortable using an independent or branded currency so that 's getting really interesting here a really interesting dynamic going on
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 573.89 575.05 <NA> and you think
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 581.31 584.59 <NA> <unk> you think is it much of a leap it seems
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 584.28 586.87 <NA> farfetched but when you think about it
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 586.53 593.53 <NA> in america in one thousand eight hundred and sixty there were one thousand six hundred corporations issuing banknotes
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 593.52 603.31 <NA> there were eight thousand kinds of notes in america and the only thing that stopped that the government controlled four percent of the supply and the only thing that stopped it was the civil war
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 602.85 604.97 <NA> breaking out and the government suddenly wanted
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 604.96 610.13 <NA> <unk> take control of the money so government money war nothing changes there then
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 610.48 613.67 <NA> so what i 'm going to ask is basically
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 613.33 615.98 <NA> is history repeating itself
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 615.58 630 <NA> is technology making paper money feel outmoded are we decoupling money from the government you know you think about brands are starting to fill the gaps corporations are filling gaps that governments can 't afford to fill so i think you know will we be standing
PaulKempRobertson_2013G 1 PaulKempRobertson_2013G 629.96 638.59 <NA> <unk> on stage buying a coffee organic fair trade coffee next year using ted florins or ted shillings thank you very much
