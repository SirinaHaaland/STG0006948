AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 13.87 22.73 <NA> <unk> like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects i think it 's one of the most exciting that i 'm working on but i think it 's also the simplest <unk> it 's a
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 22.72 29.61 <NA> project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world it addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 30.02 34.95 <NA> <unk> the number one cause of death in children under five <unk> which is 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 35.18 40.41 <NA> water borne diseases <unk> diarrhea <unk> malnutrition no it
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 40.4 49.53 <NA> 's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires acute respiratory infections caused by this can you believe that 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 49.4 54.97 <NA> i find this shocking and somewhat appalling can 't we make cleaner burning cooking
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 54.93 69.83 <NA> <unk> fuels can 't we make better stoves how is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year <unk> i know bill joy was talking to you about the wonders of of carbon nanotubes so i 'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro tubes 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 69.83 71.68 <NA> which is charcoal 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 72.72 74.78 <NA> so this is a picture of rural
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 76.75 78.77 <NA> <unk> percent deforested 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 78.28 87.77 <NA> you 'll see scenes like this all over the island <unk> it leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 87.28 100.02 <NA> throughout the nation a couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths that 's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil so the rains come they go down the rivers and
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 102.38 111.19 <NA> <unk> now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this people need to cook and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it it
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 111.19 125.11 <NA> 's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage they know perfectly well but they have no other choice fossil fuels are not available and solar energy doesn 't cook the way that they like their food prepared and so this
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 125 128.77 <NA> <unk> this is what they do you 'll find families like this who go out into the
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 128.61 133.6 <NA> forest to find a tree cut it down and make charcoal out of it 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 133.92 141.04 <NA> so not surprisingly there 's a lot of effort that 's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 140.88 154.97 <NA> about four years ago i took a team of students down to haiti and we worked with peace corps volunteers there this is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked and the idea was that you could take waste paper you could
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 154.93 156.03 <NA> <unk> compress it and make
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 155.85 168.74 <NA> briquettes that could be used for fuel <unk> but this device was very slow <unk> so our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes they were able to triple the throughput of this device <unk> 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 168.74 175.88 <NA> so you could imagine they were very excited about it and they they took the briquettes back to mit so that they could test them <unk> 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 175.51 178.37 <NA> and one of the things that they found was
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 178.36 179.67 <NA> they didn 't burn
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 179.95 183.51 <NA> so it was a little discouraging to the students 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 184.16 190.2 <NA> and in fact if you look closely <unk> right here you can see it says us peace corps 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 190.13 199.96 <NA> as it turns out there actually wasn 't any waste paper in this village <unk> and while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 200.58 203.56 <NA> <unk> was eight hundred kilometers away <unk> and
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 203.07 208.48 <NA> so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 208.11 218.53 <NA> what we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level you see these all over haiti as well they 're small scale sugar mills and the waste <unk>
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 218.43 229.97 <NA> <unk> product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called bagasse it has no other use it has no nutritional value so they don 't feed it to the animals it just sits in a pile near the sugar
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 229.93 232.25 <NA> <unk> mill until eventually they burn it 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 232.48 241.16 <NA> what we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 241.15 243.2 <NA> something like charcoal <unk> 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 243.07 246.32 <NA> so over the next couple of years students
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 245.89 250.05 <NA> and i worked to develop a process <unk> so you start with the
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 250.97 265.98 <NA> <unk> and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five gallon oil drum <unk> after some time after setting it on fire you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln <unk> and then you end up with this carbonized material here <unk> 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 265.58 272.2 <NA> however you can 't burn this it 's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking <unk> 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 272.2 276.7 <NA> so we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 276.46 279.91 <NA> and conveniently one of my students was from ghana
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 279.95 286.96 <NA> and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called kokonte which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root <unk> 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 286.47 293.56 <NA> and so what we did was we looked and we found that cassava is indeed grown in haiti under the name of manioc
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 293.25 300.08 <NA> in fact it 's grown all over the world yucca <unk> tapioca manioc cassava it 's all the same thing a very starchy root
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 301 309.48 <NA> <unk> and you can make a very thick sticky porridge out of it which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes so we
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 309.48 317.09 <NA> did this we went down to haiti these are the graduates of the first ecole de <unk> charbon or charcoal institute and these that 's
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 318.34 321.75 <NA> right so i 'm actually an instructor at mit as well as
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 324.45 329.97 <NA> and these are the briquettes that we made now i 'm going to take you to a different continent
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 330.8 337.92 <NA> this is india and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in india it 's cow dung and
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 337.92 345.48 <NA> more than in haiti this produces really smoky fires and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 344.99 354.94 <NA> cow dung and biomass as a fuel <unk> kids and women are especially affected by it because they 're the ones who are around the cooking fires <unk> so we wanted to see
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 355.02 364.27 <NA> <unk> if we could introduce this charcoal making technology there well unfortunately they didn 't have sugarcane and they didn 't have cassava but that didn 't stop us 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 363.87 371.44 <NA> what we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass and there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area <unk> 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 371.44 378.13 <NA> and what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure which they used ordinarily for their fuel <unk> 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 378.48 379.49 <NA> and we did
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 379.92 390.05 <NA> side by side tests and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung and you can see that it 's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel and in fact it heats the water a lot <unk>
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 389.95 404.91 <NA> <unk> more quickly <unk> and so we were very happy <unk> thus far but one of the things that we found was when we did side by side comparisons with wood charcoal it didn 't burn as long and the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking so we
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 404.87 411.9 <NA> <unk> wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in haiti <unk> 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 411.83 415.17 <NA> so we went back to mit we
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 414.77 424.59 <NA> took out the instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces you needed in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 424.46 429.97 <NA> and at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this we also had community partners
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 429.93 431.18 <NA> <unk> in haiti
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 433.05 437.68 <NA> working to develop the process to improve it and make it more
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 437.58 443.41 <NA> more accessible to people in the villages there <unk> and after some time we developed
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 443.19 450.11 <NA> a <unk> low cost press that allows you to produce charcoal which actually now burns not only
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 452.89 462.5 <NA> <unk> than wood charcoal <unk> so now we 're in a situation where we have a product which is actually better than what you can buy in haiti in the marketplace which is a very
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 462.13 464.48 <NA> wonderful place to be 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 465.43 474.81 <NA> in haiti alone about thirty million trees are cut down every year there 's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 475.49 484.35 <NA> <unk> in addition the revenue generated from that charcoal is two hundred and sixty million dollars that 's an awful lot for a country like haiti
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 484.15 487.89 <NA> with a population of eight million and an average income
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 487.69 490.17 <NA> of less than four hundred dollars <unk> 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 490.19 503.79 <NA> so this is where we 're also moving ahead with our charcoal project and one of the things that i think is also interesting is i have a a friend up at uc berkeley who 's been doing risk analysis and he 's looked at the problem of
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 503.3 504.85 <NA> the health impacts of
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 504.78 514.99 <NA> <unk> burning wood versus charcoal and he 's found that worldwide you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel that 's remarkable but <unk>
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 514.89 521.83 <NA> <unk> up until now there weren 't ways to do it without cutting down trees but now we have a way that 's using an agricultural waste material
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 531.93 540.02 <NA> <unk> i think it 's the coolest thing and it 's even lower tech than what you just saw <unk> if you can imagine such a thing here it is so what is this 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 539.95 550.17 <NA> this is corncobs turned into charcoal and the beauty of this is that you don 't need to form briquettes it comes ready made this is my $ one hundred laptop right here
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 555.71 557.91 <NA> <unk> so we can pass these around 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 559.01 564.09 <NA> they 're fully functional field tested ready to roll out 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 567.02 574.93 <NA> and i think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology is that the technology transfer is
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 576.03 588.76 <NA> <unk> compared to the sugarcane charcoal where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder this comes pre briquetted and this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now which
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 588.36 592 <NA> is perhaps a sad commentary on my life 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 593.31 598.57 <NA> but once you see it like you guys in the front row all right <unk> yeah <unk> ok so anyway 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 602.08 607.44 <NA> <unk> and this is i think a perfect example of what robert wright was talking about in those <unk>
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 608.76 618.83 <NA> things so not only do you have health benefits you have environmental benefits <unk> but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also <unk>
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 618.73 625.08 <NA> <unk> have economic benefits people can make their own cooking fuel from waste products they can generate income from
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 625.58 633.07 <NA> <unk> they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren 't making their own 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 633.07 643.56 <NA> it 's really rare that you don 't have <unk> trade offs between health and economics or environment and economics <unk> so this is a project that i just find extremely exciting and i 'm
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 643.1 648.54 <NA> really really looking forward to see where it takes us 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 650.07 660.16 <NA> <unk> so when we talk about now the future we will create one of the things that i think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 659.7 663.16 <NA> and now i don 't actually mean the world that we live in 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 663.42 665.45 <NA> i mean the world
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 665 670.96 <NA> where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat <unk> 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 671.46 679.91 <NA> i mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand and where when you work ten hours a day
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 679.9 683.15 <NA> <unk> you 're still only earning sixty dollars in a month i
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 683.8 692.18 <NA> mean the world where women and children spend forty billion hours a year fetching water 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 692.02 700.58 <NA> that 's as if the entire workforce of the state of california worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 700.58 702.26 <NA> it 's a place
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 702.19 704.73 <NA> where for example if this were india

AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 738.75 748 <NA> these are the solutions that we need to find i have a few areas that i believe are especially important that we address 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 748 750.23 <NA> one of them is creating technologies
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 753.28 767.66 <NA> <unk> so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out and that they 're not doing it using the same traditional basket making poultry rearing etc <unk> but there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 767.35 775.02 <NA> the next thing i believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 776.54 787.58 <NA> <unk> and we need to rethink our development strategies <unk> so that we 're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers <unk> but rather to stop being poor farmers <unk> 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 787.59 790.74 <NA> and we need to think about how we can do that effectively 
AmySmith_2006 1 AmySmith_2006 791.06 798.69 <NA> we need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems
