DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 15.22 24.78 <NA> the astonishing molecular machines that create the living fabric of your body <unk> now molecules are really really tiny <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 26.12 27.13 <NA> <unk> i mean
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 26.77 28.23 <NA> really 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 28.16 33.6 <NA> they 're smaller than a wavelength of light so we have no way to directly observe them <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 33.29 38.22 <NA> but through science we do have a fairly good idea of what 's going on down at the molecular scale <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 38.3 48.07 <NA> so what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules <unk> but we don 't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules one way around this is to draw pictures and
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 47.89 54.97 <NA> this idea is actually nothing new scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process they
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 54.9 62.53 <NA> <unk> draw pictures of what they 're observing with their eyes through technology like telescopes and microscopes <unk> and also what they 're thinking about in their minds 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 62.04 68 <NA> i picked two well known examples because they 're very <unk> well known for expressing science through art <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 68 74.99 <NA> and i start with galileo <unk> who used the world 's first telescope to look at the moon <unk> and he transformed our understanding
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 76.66 85.25 <NA> <unk> century was the moon was a perfect heavenly sphere <unk> but what galileo saw was a rocky barren world which he expressed through his watercolor painting
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 84.94 95.65 <NA> another scientist with very big ideas the superstar of biology is charles darwin and with this famous entry in his notebook he begins in the top <unk> left hand corner with i think 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 95.65 104.97 <NA> and then sketches out the first tree of life <unk> which is his perception of how all the species all living things on earth are connected through evolutionary history
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 105.13 110.22 <NA> the origin of species through natural selection and divergence from an ancestral population
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 109.88 112.32 <NA> <unk> even as a scientist 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 111.86 122.28 <NA> i used to go to lectures by molecular biologists and find them completely incomprehensible with all the fancy technical language and jargon that they would use in describing their work until <unk>
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 122.18 127.83 <NA> <unk> i encountered the artworks of david goodsell who is a molecular biologist at the scripps institute 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 130.01 140.08 <NA> accurate and it 's all to scale <unk> and his work illuminated for me what the molecular world inside us is like <unk> so this is a transection through blood in the top left hand corner <unk>
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 140.03 146.63 <NA> you 've got this yellow green area the yellow green area is the fluid of blood which is mostly water but it 's also antibodies sugars <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 150.22 154.44 <NA> <unk> and those red molecules are hemoglobin they are actually red that 's what gives blood its color 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 154.26 160.03 <NA> and hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 159.87 168.43 <NA> i was very much inspired by this image many years ago and i wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world what would it look like <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 168.43 170.85 <NA> and that 's how i really began <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 170.64 174.96 <NA> so let 's begin this is dna in its classic double helix form
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 176.09 178.14 <NA> <unk> so it 's an accurate model of dna <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 177.65 188.19 <NA> if we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands you see these things that look like teeth those are the letters of genetic code the twenty five thousand genes you 've got written in your dna this is what they typically <unk>
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 188.09 199.93 <NA> <unk> talk about the genetic code this is what they 're talking about but i want to talk about a different aspect of dna science <unk> and that is the physical nature of dna it 's these two strands that run in opposite directions for
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 200 207.34 <NA> <unk> reasons i can 't go into right now but they physically run in opposite directions which creates a number of complications for your living cells 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 207.03 211 <NA> as you 're about to see most particularly when dna is being copied 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 210.66 220.45 <NA> and so what i 'm about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual dna replication machine that 's occurring right now inside your body at least two thousand and two
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 220.02 229.91 <NA> biology <unk> so dna 's entering the production line from the left hand side <unk> and it hits this collection these miniature biochemical machines that are pulling apart the dna strand and making an
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 229.9 237.08 <NA> <unk> exact copy <unk> so dna comes in and hits this blue doughnut shaped structure and it 's ripped apart into its two strands 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 236.89 249.42 <NA> one strand can be copied directly and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there but things aren 't so simple for the other strand because it must be copied backwards <unk> so it 's thrown out repeatedly in these loops and copied one section at a time <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 249.42 254.88 <NA> creating two new dna molecules now you have billions of this
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 254.81 260.13 <NA> <unk> machine right now working away inside you copying your dna with exquisite fidelity <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 260.18 267.78 <NA> it 's an accurate representation and it 's pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you i 've left out error correction and a bunch of other things 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 269.93 273 <NA> this was work from a number of years ago thank you 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 275 286.33 <NA> <unk> this is work from a number of years ago but what i 'll show you next is updated science it 's updated technology <unk> so again we begin with dna <unk> and it 's jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules which i 've stripped away so you can see something 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 286.33 296.23 <NA> dna is about two nanometers across which is really quite tiny <unk> but in each one of your cells each strand of dna is about thirty to forty million nanometers long 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 295.77 300.02 <NA> so to keep the dna organized and regulate access to the genetic code
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 300.19 303.62 <NA> <unk> it 's wrapped around these purple proteins or i 've labeled them purple here 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 303.34 308.45 <NA> it 's packaged up and bundled up all this field of view is a single strand of dna <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 307.99 313.79 <NA> this huge package of dna is called a chromosome and we 'll come back to chromosomes in a minute 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 313.9 323.24 <NA> we 're pulling out we 're zooming out out through a nuclear pore which is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the dna called the nucleus 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 323.14 325.97 <NA> all of this field of view is
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 325.84 329.22 <NA> about a semester 's worth of biology and i 've got seven minutes so
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 329.96 333.54 <NA> <unk> going to be able to do that today no i 'm being told no 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 333.92 340.89 <NA> this is the way a living cell looks down a light light microscope and it 's been filmed under time lapse which is why you can see it moving 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 340.89 345.58 <NA> the nuclear envelope breaks down these sausage shaped things are the chromosomes and we 'll focus on them <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 345.37 350.08 <NA> they go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 351 353.33 <NA> <unk> when the cell feels it 's ready to go 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 353.33 367.78 <NA> it rips apart the chromosome <unk> one set of dna goes to one side the other side gets the other set of dna identical copies of dna <unk> and then the cell splits down the middle and again you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 367.8 376.39 <NA> now we 're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes <unk> and look at its structure and describe it so again here we are at that equator moment 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 376.86 379.88 <NA> the chromosomes line up and if we isolate just one
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 379.78 389.39 <NA> <unk> chromosome we 're going to pull it out and have a look at its structure <unk> so this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have at least as far as we 've discovered so far inside of us <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 389.53 397.56 <NA> so this is a single chromosome <unk> and you have two strands of dna in each chromosome one is bundled up into one sausage the other strand
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 397.32 403.86 <NA> is bundled up into the other sausage <unk> these things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 405.28 414.92 <NA> <unk> that name 's not important but we 're going to focus on the region labeled red here and it 's the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes <unk> it is
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 414.76 424.9 <NA> obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes we have no idea really as to how it 's achieving that movement we 've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 424.9 429.91 <NA> and we 're still just beginning to discover what it 's about it is made up of about two
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 429.84 433.15 <NA> <unk> hundred different types of proteins thousands of proteins in total <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 433.23 440.44 <NA> it is a signal broadcasting system <unk> it broadcasts through chemical signals telling the rest of the cell
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 440.07 449.93 <NA> when it 's ready when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes <unk> it is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 451 455.9 <NA> <unk> involved with the growing of the microtubules <unk> and it 's able to transiently couple onto them <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 455.59 465.98 <NA> it 's also an attention sensing system it 's able to feel when the cell is ready when the chromosome is correctly positioned it 's turning green here because it it feels that everything is just right <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 465.55 472.76 <NA> and you 'll see there 's this one little last bit that 's still remaining red <unk> and it 's walked away down the microtubules <unk> 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 473.38 478.05 <NA> that is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal and it 's walked away i mean
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 479.96 487.17 <NA> <unk> 's molecular clockwork this is how you work at the molecular scale <unk> so with a little bit of molecular eye candy 
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 487.61 497.49 <NA> we 've got kinesins the orange ones they 're little molecular courier molecules walking one way <unk> and here are the dynein they 're carrying that broadcasting system and they 've got their long legs so they can step around <unk>
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 497.39 504.82 <NA> <unk> obstacles and so on <unk> so again this is all derived accurately from the science the problem is we can 't show it to you any other way
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 505.11 508.42 <NA> <unk> exploring at the frontier of science at
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 508.17 514.64 <NA> the frontier of human understanding is mind blowing discovering this stuff is
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 514.4 520.39 <NA> certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science <unk> but most medical researchers
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 520.17 525.77 <NA> discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals <unk> which are
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 525.61 526.64 <NA> to
DrewBerry_2011X 1 DrewBerry_2011X 526.42 533.51 <NA> eradicate disease to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty <unk> thank you
