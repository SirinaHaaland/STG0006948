DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 205.2 214.84 <NA> <unk> animals that are fixed on the bottom and actually most of the fish they are a little spot on the debris the piles of debris were coral reef fish 
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 214.38 220.4 <NA> essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down <unk> and these pictures are
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 220.22 222.16 <NA> extraordinary because
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 221.73 224.99 <NA> this transition is very rapid <unk> within
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 225.88 229.53 <NA> <unk> you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins 
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 229.53 236.93 <NA> the bottom is transformed from in this case a hard bottom or soft coral into a muddy
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 236.71 238.31 <NA> mess 
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 238.03 247.89 <NA> this is a dead turtle they were not eaten they were thrown away because they were dead and one time we caught a live one it was not drowned yet and then they wanted to kill it

DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 261.32 267.6 <NA> we transform the world <unk> but we don 't remember it we adjust our baseline
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 267.56 274.68 <NA> to the new level and we don 't recall what was there <unk> 
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 274.4 279.67 <NA> if you generalize this something like this happens you have on the y axis
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 280.02 282.43 <NA> <unk> some good thing biodiversity <unk> 
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 282.12 291.2 <NA> numbers of orca the greenness of your country the water supply <unk> and over time it changes it changes because
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 291.04 294.98 <NA> people do things or naturally every generation
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 294.8 300.19 <NA> will use the the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 300.15 304.01 <NA> as a standard and will extrapolate forward
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 304.99 310.82 <NA> <unk> difference then they perceive as a loss <unk> but they don 't perceive what happened before as a loss 
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 311.02 316.73 <NA> you can have a succession of changes at the end you want to sustain
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 316.9 324.95 <NA> miserable leftovers <unk> and that to a large extent is what we want to do now <unk> we want to sustain things
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 324.46 329.94 <NA> that are gone or things that are not the way they were now one should
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 329.87 330.92 <NA> <unk> think
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 330.83 338.73 <NA> this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies they killed
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 338.51 344.2 <NA> animals and they didn 't know they had done so after a few generations because
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 355.59 362.17 <NA> <unk> becomes rare so you don 't lose abundant animals you always lose rare animals 
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 362.34 366.64 <NA> and therefore they 're not perceived as a big loss <unk> 
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 366.33 370.24 <NA> over time we concentrate on large animals 
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 369.81 377.45 <NA> and in a sea that means the big fish they become rarer because we fish them over time we have a few fish left
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 377.26 378.89 <NA> and we think
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 378.68 379.97 <NA> this is the baseline
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 380.19 388.98 <NA> <unk> and the question is why do people accept this well because they don 't know
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 388.77 395.81 <NA> that it was different <unk> and in fact lots of people scientists will contest that it was really different <unk> 
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 395.81 399.35 <NA> and they will contest this because the evidence
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 399.07 400.32 <NA> presented
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 404.87 406.38 <NA> <unk> is not in
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 406.1 412.54 <NA> the way they would like the evidence presented for example the anecdote that some
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 412.3 414.15 <NA> present as
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 413.92 421.48 <NA> captain so and so observed lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 421.48 424.72 <NA> utilized by fishery scientists <unk> because it 's not 
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 426 435.76 <NA> <unk> so you have a situation where people don 't know the past even though we live in literate societies because they don 't trust
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 435.33 438.67 <NA> <unk> the the sources of the past <unk> 
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 438.21 448.06 <NA> and hence the enormous role that a marine protected area can play because with marine protected areas we actually
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 448.47 450.08 <NA> recreate
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 451.09 452.64 <NA> <unk> we recreate the past that
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 452.64 461.37 <NA> people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low that is for people who can see
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 462.91 468.74 <NA> a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 470.2 479.61 <NA> which enables them to reset their baseline <unk> how about the people who can 't do that because they have no access the people in the midwest for example
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 480.25 484.56 <NA> there i think that the arts and film
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 484.28 485.49 <NA> can
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 485.32 495.2 <NA> perhaps fill the gap <unk> and simulation this is a simulation of chesapeake bay there were gray whales in chesapeake bay a long time ago five hundred years
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 495.2 499.3 <NA> ago and you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 504.84 507.49 <NA> <unk> why people were so touched
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 507 511.33 <NA> by it never mind the pocahontas story <unk>
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 511.74 517.22 <NA> why so touched by the imagery because it evokes
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 517.04 518.39 <NA> something
DanielPauly_2010Z 1 DanielPauly_2010Z 518.15 526.43 <NA> that in a sense has been lost and so my recommendation it 's the only one i will provide is for cameron to do
