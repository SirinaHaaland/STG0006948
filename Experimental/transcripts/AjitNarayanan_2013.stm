AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 16.21 19.22 <NA> <unk> i make technologies to help them communicate 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 19.3 25.1 <NA> now many of the problems that children with autism face <unk> they have a common source and
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 24.64 29.28 <NA> that source is that they find it difficult to understand abstraction
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 29.96 37.9 <NA> <unk> symbolism and because of this they have a lot of difficulty with language <unk> let me tell you
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 37.66 45.9 <NA> a little bit about why this is <unk> you see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup all of us can see it all of us understand this
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 45.89 54.43 <NA> <unk> these are two other pictures of soup but you can see that these are more abstract these are not quite as concrete and when you get to language
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 54.93 56.65 <NA> <unk> see that it becomes a word
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 56.48 65.23 <NA> whose look the way it looks and the way it sounds has absolutely nothing to do with what it started with or what it represents which is the bowl of soup
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 65.43 75.11 <NA> <unk> so it 's essentially a completely abstract a completely arbitrary representation of something which is in the real world <unk> and this is something that children with autism have an incredible amount
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 77.14 81.81 <NA> <unk> now that 's why most of the people that work with children with autism speech therapists educators
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 81.63 90.87 <NA> what they do is they try to help children with autism communicate not with words but with pictures so if a child with autism wanted to say i want soup 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 90.87 100.05 <NA> that child would pick three different pictures i want and soup and they would put these together and then the therapist or the parent would understand that this is what the kid wants to say <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 99.81 103.79 <NA> and this has been incredibly effective for the last thirty forty years
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 103.36 104.91 <NA> people have been doing this
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 104.9 109.35 <NA> in fact a few years back i developed an app for the ipad
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 108.92 117.81 <NA> which does exactly this it 's called avaz and the way it works is that kids select different pictures these pictures are sequenced together to form sentences 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 117.32 125.49 <NA> and these sentences are spoken out so avaz is essentially converting pictures <unk> it 's a translator it converts pictures into speech
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 125.9 129.52 <NA> now this was very effective there are thousands of children using this
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 129.96 132.85 <NA> <unk> the world <unk> and i started thinking about
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 132.57 140.92 <NA> what it does and what it doesn 't do and i realized something interesting avaz helps children with autism learn words 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 141.15 144.26 <NA> what it doesn 't help them do is to learn
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 144.08 150.17 <NA> word patterns <unk> let me explain this in a little more detail <unk> take this sentence
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 153.16 163.34 <NA> <unk> it 's not just the words here that convey the meaning <unk> it 's also the way in which these words are arranged the way these words are modified and arranged <unk> and that 's why a sentence like <unk>
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 163.29 169.19 <NA> i want soup tonight is different from a sentence like soup want i tonight which is completely meaningless
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 175.82 183.63 <NA> <unk> and that 's the fact that you can modify words and you can arrange them to have different meanings to convey different ideas <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 183.35 186.84 <NA> now this is what we call grammar
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 186.41 195.78 <NA> <unk> and grammar is incredibly powerful because grammar is this one component of language which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 195.47 200.29 <NA> and allows us to convey an infinite amount of information
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 200.67 207.58 <NA> <unk> infinite amount of ideas <unk> it 's the way in which you can put things together in order to convey anything you want to and so after <unk>
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 208.76 217.9 <NA> i worried for a very long time about how i could give grammar to children with autism <unk> the solution came to me from a very interesting perspective <unk> i happened to
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 217.9 221.15 <NA> chance upon a child with autism conversing with
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 220.91 224.99 <NA> with her mom <unk> and this is what happened completely out of
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 229.54 239.72 <NA> <unk> what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to tease out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions so <unk>
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 239.67 247.28 <NA> she asked eat what do you want to eat ice cream you want to eat <unk> somebody else wants to eat you want to eat cream now you want to eat ice cream in the evening 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 257.18 266.43 <NA> and it struck me that maybe this is what i was looking for instead of arranging words in an order <unk> in sequence as a sentence <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 266.09 271.18 <NA> you arrange them in this map where they 're all linked together
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 271.02 274.96 <NA> not by placing them one one after the other but in questions in question answer
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 276.63 282.97 <NA> <unk> and so if you do this then what you 're conveying is not a sentence in english but what you 're conveying is really
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 282.63 292.03 <NA> a meaning the meaning of a sentence in english <unk> now meaning is really the underbelly in some sense of language it 's what comes after thought but before language 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 291.66 297.95 <NA> and the idea was that this particular representation might convey meaning in its raw form 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 297.95 304.82 <NA> so i was very excited by this you know hopping around all over the place trying to figure out if i can convert all possible sentences that i hear
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 304.99 314.72 <NA> <unk> this <unk> and i found that this is not enough why is this not enough this is not enough because if you wanted to convey something like negation <unk> you want to say i don 't want soup 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 314.26 318.77 <NA> then you can 't do that by asking a question you do that by changing the word want 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 318.79 324.63 <NA> again if you wanted to say i wanted soup yesterday you do that by converting the word want into
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 325.58 334.06 <NA> <unk> it 's a past tense <unk> so this is a flourish which i added to make the system complete <unk> this is a map of words joined together as questions and answers 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 334.06 339.93 <NA> and with these filters applied on top of them in order to modify them to represent certain nuances <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 339.53 347.05 <NA> let me show you this with a different example <unk> let 's take this sentence i told the carpenter i could not pay him it 's a fairly complicated sentence 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 347.05 352.81 <NA> the way that this particular system works you can start with any part of this sentence i 'm going to start with the word
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 355.13 358.81 <NA> this happened in the past so i 'm going to make that told 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 358.59 366.19 <NA> now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to ask questions <unk> so who told <unk> i told i told whom i told the carpenter <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 365.94 374.99 <NA> now we start with a different part of the sentence we start with the word pay and we add the ability filter to it to make it can pay then we make it 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 376.45 384.38 <NA> <unk> and we can make it couldn 't pay by making it the past tense <unk> so who couldn 't pay <unk> i couldn 't pay <unk> couldn 't pay whom <unk> i couldn 't pay the carpenter
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 384.38 389.19 <NA> <unk> and then you join these two together by asking this question what did i tell the carpenter 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 388.98 391.91 <NA> i told the carpenter i could not pay him <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 393.07 395.48 <NA> now think about this <unk> this is 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 398.47 400.2 <NA> this is a representation
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 405.47 408.22 <NA> <unk> and there are two or three interesting things about this first of all 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 408.01 409.87 <NA> i could have started anywhere
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 409.66 415.09 <NA> i didn 't have to start with the word tell i could have started anywhere in the sentence and i could have made this entire thing 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 414.91 423.28 <NA> the second thing is if i wasn 't an english speaker if i was speaking in some other language <unk> this map would actually hold true in any language <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 423.28 428.68 <NA> so long as the questions are standardized the map is actually independent of language
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 430.02 432.94 <NA> <unk> so i call this freespeech and
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 432.45 437.41 <NA> i was playing with this for many many months i was trying out so many different combinations of this 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 437.13 439.78 <NA> and then i noticed something very interesting about freespeech
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 439.58 447.06 <NA> i was trying to convert language <unk> convert sentences in english into sentences in freespeech and vice versa and back and forth <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 447.06 454.82 <NA> and i realized that this particular configuration this particular way of representing language <unk> it allowed me to actually create very concise
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 454.93 455.98 <NA> <unk> rules
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 455.85 470.66 <NA> that go between freespeech on one side and english on the other <unk> so i could actually write this set of rules that translates from this particular representation into english <unk> and so i developed this thing i developed this thing called the freespeech engine which takes any <unk>
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 471.61 479.61 <NA> <unk> the input and gives out perfectly grammatical english text and by putting these two pieces together the representation and the engine
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 479.93 481.06 <NA> <unk> was able to create
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 480.88 488.37 <NA> an app a technology for children with autism that not only gives them words but also gives them grammar
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 488.66 494.88 <NA> <unk> so i tried this out with kids with with autism and i found that there was an incredible amount of
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 496.04 497.4 <NA> identification they <unk>
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 498.41 504.82 <NA> <unk> were able to create sentences in freespeech which were much more complicated but much more effective than equivalent sentences in
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 504.78 509.03 <NA> <unk> english <unk> and i started thinking about why that might be the case <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 508.79 513.37 <NA> and i had an idea and i want to talk to you about this idea next 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 513.14 514.49 <NA> in about one thousand 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 514.49 524.99 <NA> nine hundred and ninety seven about fifteen years back <unk> there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language and they found something very interesting they found that when you learn a language as a as a
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 527.56 534.95 <NA> <unk> you learn it with a certain part of your brain <unk> and when you learn a language as an adult for example if i wanted to learn japanese right now
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 535.03 540.52 <NA> a completely different part of my brain is used <unk> now i don 't know why that 's the case but
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 540.53 547.08 <NA> my guess is that that 's because when you learn a language as an adult you almost invariably learn it through
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 546.84 554.94 <NA> your native language or through your first language <unk> so what 's interesting about freespeech is that when you create a
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 554.9 559.86 <NA> <unk> sentence or when you create language <unk> a child with autism creates language with freespeech 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 559.67 566.28 <NA> they 're not using this support language they 're not using this bridge language <unk> they 're directly constructing the sentence <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 566.39 573.51 <NA> and so this this gave me this idea is it possible to use freespeech not for children with autism
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 573.23 575.41 <NA> but to teach language
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 579.93 583.43 <NA> <unk> and so i tried a number of experiments <unk> the first thing i did was i built
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 583.22 593.3 <NA> a jigsaw puzzle in which these these questions and answers are coded in the form of of shapes in the form of colors <unk> and you have people putting these together and trying to understand how this works <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 593.25 604.66 <NA> <unk> and i built an app out of it a game out of it in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement a sound reinforcement of visual structures <unk> they 're able to learn language 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 604.84 612.89 <NA> <unk> this <unk> this has a lot of potential a lot of promise and the government of india recently licensed this technology from us and they 're going to try it out with millions of different children
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 612.72 615.11 <NA> trying to teach them english <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 614.98 624.84 <NA> and the dream <unk> the hope <unk> the vision really is that when they learn english this way they learn it with the same proficiency as their mother tongue
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 631.31 640.56 <NA> <unk> let 's talk about speech <unk> this is speech so speech is the primary mode of communication delivered between all of us <unk> now what 's interesting about speech is that speech is <unk>
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 642.26 650.08 <NA> <unk> one dimensional because it 's sound it 's also one dimensional because our mouths are built that way our mouths are built to create one dimensional sound
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 650.91 655.51 <NA> <unk> if you think about the brain the thoughts that we have in our heads
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 655.32 661.51 <NA> are not one dimensional i mean we have these rich <unk> complicated <unk> multi dimensional ideas <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 661.41 665.56 <NA> now it seems to me that language is really the brain 's invention
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 665.19 670.06 <NA> to convert this rich multi dimensional thought on one hand
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 670.05 679.37 <NA> into speech on the other hand <unk> now what 's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays and almost all of that is done in the language domain
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 680.01 689.25 <NA> <unk> take google for example google trawls all these countless billions of websites all of which are in english <unk> and when you want to use google you go into google search and you type in english <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 689.25 692.81 <NA> and it matches the english with the english <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 693.19 696.99 <NA> what if we could do this in freespeech instead 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 696.99 703.79 <NA> i have a suspicion that if we did this we 'd find that algorithms like searching like retrieval all of these things 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 703.45 704.97 <NA> are much simpler
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 705.31 711.06 <NA> and also more effective <unk> because they don 't process the data structure of speech <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 710.96 715.14 <NA> instead they 're processing the data structure of thought
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 716.42 724.93 <NA> <unk> the data structure of thought that 's a provocative idea but let 's look at this in a little more detail <unk> so this is the
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 726.81 728.53 <NA> <unk> we have the free speech representation
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 728.36 729.58 <NA> on one side 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 729.58 744.08 <NA> and we have the freespeech engine which generates english <unk> now if you think about it freespeech i told you is completely language independent it doesn 't have any specific information in it which is about english <unk> so everything that this system knows about english is actually encoded
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 743.87 745.39 <NA> into the engine 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 746.64 754.55 <NA> that 's a pretty pretty interesting concept in itself <unk> you 've encoded an entire human language into a software program
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 755.29 756.3 <NA> <unk> but
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 755.8 768.32 <NA> if you look at what 's inside the engine it 's actually not very complicated <unk> it 's not very complicated code and what 's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really <unk>
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 769.33 775.08 <NA> and that gives this interesting idea <unk> it might be very easy for us to actually create these engines
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 784.31 791.34 <NA> <unk> and that gives another interesting idea for example supposing i was a writer say for a newspaper or for a magazine 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 790.94 796.26 <NA> i could create content in one language freespeech 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 796.13 801.64 <NA> and the person who 's consuming that content the person who 's who 's reading that that particular information
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 801.46 804.94 <NA> could choose any engine <unk> and they could read it in
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 804.87 808.33 <NA> <unk> their own mother tongue <unk> in their native language i mean
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 810.66 815.53 <NA> this is an incredibly attractive idea especially for india <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 815.1 820.16 <NA> we have so many different languages there 's a song about india and there 's a description of of the country as
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 831.64 843.44 <NA> <unk> language is beautiful <unk> i think it 's the most beautiful of of human creations <unk> i think it 's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented it entertains <unk> it educates it enlightens <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 842.95 848.33 <NA> but what i like the most about language is that it empowers <unk> i want to leave you with this this
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 847.96 854.79 <NA> is a photograph of of my collaborators my earliest collaborators when i started working on language and autism and various other things
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 854.96 864.96 <NA> <unk> the girl 's name is pavna and that 's her mother kalpana and pavna 's an entrepreneur <unk> but her story is much more remarkable than mine because pavna is about
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 864.71 871.11 <NA> twenty three she has quadriplegic cerebral palsy so ever since she was born she could neither move
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 870.62 874.96 <NA> nor talk and everything that she 's accomplished so far <unk> 
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 877.5 883.93 <NA> <unk> starting a company <unk> collaborating with me to develop avaz all of these things she 's done with nothing more
AjitNarayanan_2013 1 AjitNarayanan_2013 884.28 886.9 <NA> than moving her eyes
