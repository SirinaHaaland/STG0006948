PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 30.89 40.62 <NA> the shake developed out of really a single minded pursuit of pointillism just years of making tiny tiny dots and eventually these dots went from
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 40.25 45.36 <NA> being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles because of the shake <unk> 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 45.23 54.82 <NA> so to compensate i 'd hold the pen tighter and this progressively made the shake worse so i 'd hold the pen tighter still and this became a vicious cycle that ended up

PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 60.36 66.52 <NA> spending all my life wanting to do art i left art school <unk> and then i left art completely 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 66.96 72.35 <NA> but after a few years i just couldn 't stay away from art and i decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 72.19 75.82 <NA> discovered i had permanent nerve damage <unk> and
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 75.42 79.97 <NA> he actually took one look at my squiggly line and said well why don 't you just embrace the shake
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 80.44 87.68 <NA> so i did <unk> i went home i grabbed a pencil and i just started letting my hand shake and shake <unk> i was making all these scribble pictures 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 87.34 93.17 <NA> and even though it wasn 't the kind of art that i was ultimately passionate about it felt great <unk> 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 92.83 101.15 <NA> and more importantly once i embraced the shake i realized i could still make art <unk> i just had to find a different approach to making the art that i wanted <unk> 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 100.9 104.91 <NA> now i still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism <unk> seeing these little
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 105.02 116.46 <NA> <unk> tiny dots come together to make this unified whole <unk> so i began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn 't affect the work like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas <unk> 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 117.53 120.27 <NA> or in a 3d structure consisting of <unk>
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 121.33 124.69 <NA> creating a 2d image by burning it with a
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 126.99 132.55 <NA> <unk> i discovered that if i worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials my hand really wouldn 't hurt <unk> 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 132.18 142.03 <NA> and after having gone from a single approach to art <unk> i ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 141.72 146.84 <NA> this was the first time i 'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 146.62 148.9 <NA> could actually drive creativity 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 150.55 158.75 <NA> <unk> i was finishing up school and i was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies i had this horrible little set of tools and

PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 170.65 175.02 <NA> so i got out of school <unk> i got a job i got a paycheck i got myself to the art
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 176.27 182.19 <NA> <unk> i just went nuts buying supplies <unk> and then when i got home i sat down and i set myself to task to
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 181.88 190.08 <NA> really try to create something just completely outside of the box <unk> but i sat there for hours <unk> and nothing came to mind 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 190.25 196.11 <NA> the same thing the next day and then the next quickly slipping into a creative slump <unk> 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 196.67 204.94 <NA> and i was in a dark place for a long time unable to create and it didn 't make any sense because i was finally able to support my art
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 204.95 207.49 <NA> and yet i was creatively blank <unk> 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 207.75 215.5 <NA> but as i searched around in the darkness i realized i was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that i never had before and
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 215.82 225.02 <NA> it was then that i thought back to my jittery hands embrace the shake and i realized if i ever wanted my creativity
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 225.55 229.37 <NA> <unk> i had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 229 231.08 <NA> and get back into it 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 231.49 236.45 <NA> i wondered could you become more creative then by looking for limitations 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 236.44 240.8 <NA> what if i could only create with a dollar 's worth of supplies <unk> 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 241.93 250.05 <NA> at this point i was spending a lot of my evenings in well i guess i still spend a lot of my evenings in starbucks but i know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 250.91 259.5 <NA> <unk> i decided to ask for fifty surprisingly they just handed them right over and then with some pencils i already had i made this project for only eighty cents 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 259.4 263.17 <NA> it really became a moment of clarification for me that
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 262.99 265.35 <NA> we need to first be limited
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 264.98 267.93 <NA> in order to become limitless <unk> 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 267.62 275.34 <NA> i took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas and wondered what if instead of painting on a canvas <unk> i could only paint on my chest <unk> 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 275.39 279.88 <NA> so i painted thirty images one layer at a time one on top of another with each

PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 283.47 288.76 <NA> or what if instead of painting with a brush i could only paint with karate chops 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 288.6 296.87 <NA> so i 'd dip my hands in paint and i just i just attacked the canvas and i actually hit so hard that i bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 305.1 309.83 <NA> i had to rely on other people to create the content for the art <unk>

PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 319.93 325.29 <NA> their stories became the art as i wrote them onto the revolving canvas
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 332.45 336.96 <NA> <unk> what if instead of making art to display <unk> i had to destroy it 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 336.92 341.97 <NA> this seemed like the ultimate limitation being an artist without art <unk> 
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 341.69 349.78 <NA> this destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that i called goodbye art <unk> where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 350.88 357.7 <NA> <unk> the beginning of goodbye art i focused on forced destruction like this image of jimi hendrix made with over seven thousand matches

PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 364.74 366.97 <NA> like spitting out food

PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 378.13 386.75 <NA> the last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn 't actually exist in the first place <unk> so i organized candles on a table <unk>
PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 386.7 392.04 <NA> i lit them and then blew them out then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles

PhilHansen_2013 1 PhilHansen_2013 435.84 443.53 <NA> but having committed to the process i continued on and something really surprising came out of this as i destroyed each project
