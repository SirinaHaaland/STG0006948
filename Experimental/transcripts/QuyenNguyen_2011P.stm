QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 14.14 24.59 <NA> <unk> one of the biggest myths in medicine and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 24.28 29.97 <NA> our society loves to romanticize the idea of the single solo inventor who
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 29.81 39.63 <NA> <unk> who working late in the lab one night <unk> makes an earthshaking discovery <unk> and voila <unk> overnight everything 's changed 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 39.41 44.04 <NA> that 's a very appealing picture <unk> however it 's just not true 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 44.04 49.96 <NA> in fact <unk> medicine today is a team sport <unk> and in many ways it always has
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 51.42 55.72 <NA> <unk> i 'd like to share with you a story about how i 've experienced this
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 55.26 58.81 <NA> very dramatically in my own work 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 58.95 65.62 <NA> i 'm a surgeon and we surgeons have always had this special relationship with light 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 65.31 75.17 <NA> when i make an incision inside a patient 's body it 's dark we need to shine light to see what we 're doing <unk> and this is why traditionally 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 75.13 83.42 <NA> <unk> surgeries have always started so early in the morning to take advantage of daylight hours and if you look at historical pictures of the early operating rooms 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 83.42 96.66 <NA> they have been on top of buildings for example this is the oldest operating room in the western world in london where the operating room is actually on top of a church with a skylight coming in 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 96.42 99.75 <NA> and then this is a picture of one of the
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 99.59 104.73 <NA> most famous hospitals in america this is mass general in boston and do you know where the
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 105.14 108.93 <NA> <unk> room is here it is on the top of the building
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 108.73 112.02 <NA> with plenty of windows to let light in 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 111.53 122.19 <NA> so nowadays in the operating room we no longer need to use sunlight <unk> and because we no longer need to use sunlight we have very specialized lights <unk>
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 122.14 129.97 <NA> that are made for the operating room <unk> we have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights lights that can allow
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 129.93 138.08 <NA> <unk> us to see what we currently don 't see and this is what i think is the magic of fluorescence <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 138.08 147.8 <NA> so let me back up a little bit when we are in medical school <unk> we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this where everything 's color coded 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 147.61 150.11 <NA> nerves are yellow <unk> arteries are red
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 150 151.46 <NA> <unk> veins are blue 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 151.87 156.24 <NA> that 's so easy anybody could become a surgeon right <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 156.24 161.93 <NA> however when we have a real patient on the table this is the same neck dissection
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 161.89 166.64 <NA> not so easy to tell the difference between different structures <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 166.33 176.3 <NA> we heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society what a pressing need it is for us to
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 176.02 179.94 <NA> not have one person die every minute
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 180.56 190.15 <NA> well if cancer can be caught early enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out <unk> excised with surgery <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 190.15 200.08 <NA> i don 't care if it has this gene or that gene or if it has this protein or that protein it 's in the jar it 's done it 's out <unk> you 're cured of cancer <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 199.84 204.67 <NA> this is how we excise cancers we do our best based upon our training
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 205.05 216.14 <NA> <unk> and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience <unk> we say <unk> you know what the cancer 's gone we 've made a good job <unk> we 've taken it out <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 216.14 219.91 <NA> that 's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient 's on the table <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 219.54 221.15 <NA> but then
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 220.99 225.32 <NA> we actually don 't know that it 's all out <unk> we actually have to take samples
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 225.28 228.8 <NA> <unk> from the surgical bed what 's left behind in the patient 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 228.34 238.88 <NA> and then send those bits to the pathology lab in the meanwhile the patient 's on the operating room table the nurses anesthesiologist the surgeon all the assistants are waiting around <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 238.78 253.19 <NA> and we wait <unk> the pathologist takes that sample freezes it cuts it looks in the microscope one by one and then calls back into the room and that may be twenty minutes later per piece so if you 've sent three specimens it 's an hour later 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 252.88 254.94 <NA> and very often they say
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 254.78 255.87 <NA> <unk> say 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 255.38 265.41 <NA> you know what points a and b are okay but point c you still have some residual cancer there please go cut that that piece out so we go back and we do that again <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 265.07 274.89 <NA> and again <unk> and this whole process okay you 're done <unk> we think the entire tumor is out but very often
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 274.49 279.64 <NA> several days later the patient 's gone home <unk> we get a phone call
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 279.93 287.3 <NA> <unk> i 'm sorry <unk> once we looked at the final pathology <unk> once we looked at the final specimen we actually found that there 's a
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 287.06 293.86 <NA> couple other spots where the margins are positive there 's still cancer in your patient 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 293.76 304.25 <NA> so now you 're faced with telling your patient first of all that they may need another surgery <unk> or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 305.29 315.77 <NA> so wouldn 't it be better if we could really tell if the surgeon could really tell whether or not there 's still cancer on the surgical field
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 315.43 321.92 <NA> <unk> i mean in many ways the way that we 're doing it we 're still operating in the dark <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 322 328.8 <NA> so in two thousand and four <unk> during my surgical residency i had the great fortune to meet
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 330.26 335.97 <NA> who went on to win the nobel prize for chemistry in two thousand and eight
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 335.57 344.74 <NA> <unk> roger and his team were working on a way to detect cancer and they had a very clever molecule that they had come up with 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 344.74 350.2 <NA> the molecule they had developed had three parts the main part of it is the blue
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 351.63 355.72 <NA> <unk> and it 's basically very sticky to every tissue in your body <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 355.29 367.43 <NA> so imagine that you make a solution full of this sticky material and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer <unk> everything 's going to get lit up nothing will be specific there 's no specificity there 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 367.43 379.34 <NA> so they added two additional components the first one is a polyanionic segment which basically acts as a non stick backing like the back of a sticker <unk> so when those two are together the molecule is neutral
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 378.97 379.97 <NA> and nothing
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 379.99 392.96 <NA> <unk> gets stuck down and the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors for example the kind of protease enzymes
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 392.56 397.97 <NA> that tumors make so here in this situation if you make a solution full of this
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 397.97 404.97 <NA> three part molecule along with the dye which is shown in green <unk> and you inject it into the vein of someone who
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 404.93 410.95 <NA> <unk> has cancer <unk> normal tissue can 't cut it the molecule passes through and gets excreted <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 410.71 419.56 <NA> however <unk> in the presence of the tumor now there are molecular scissors that can break this molecule apart right there at the cleavable site <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 419.56 425.23 <NA> and now boom the tumor labels itself and it gets fluorescent
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 425.79 435.25 <NA> <unk> so here 's an example of a nerve that has tumor surrounding it can you tell where the tumor is i couldn 't when i was working on this 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 435.42 437.03 <NA> but
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 436.84 450.2 <NA> here it is it 's fluorescent now it 's green see so every single one in the audience now can tell where the cancer is <unk> we can tell in the operating room in the field at a molecular level
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 450.13 456.5 <NA> <unk> where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 457.24 462 <NA> and the cool thing about fluorescence is that it 's not only
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 461.81 465.48 <NA> bright <unk> it actually can shine through tissue
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 467.05 474.93 <NA> <unk> the light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue so even if the tumor is not right on the surface you 'll still be
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 477.59 481.14 <NA> <unk> can see that the tumor is green <unk>
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 481.14 491.64 <NA> there 's actually normal muscle on top of it see that and i 'm peeling that muscle away <unk> but even before i peel that muscle away you saw that there was a tumor underneath <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 491.36 496.18 <NA> so that 's the beauty of having a tumor that 's labeled with
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 497.42 504.97 <NA> <unk> that you can not only see the margins right there on a molecular level but you can see it even if it 's not right on the top even if
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 504.99 510.77 <NA> <unk> it 's beyond your field of view <unk> and this works for metastatic lymph nodes also <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 510.77 518.32 <NA> sentinel lymph node dissection has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer melanoma women used to get
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 518.16 524.29 <NA> really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes but
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 524.29 528.43 <NA> when sentinel lymph node came into our treatment
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 528.06 529.43 <NA> protocol
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 530.02 542.7 <NA> <unk> surgeon basically looks for the single node that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer and then if that node has cancer <unk> the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 542.7 549.93 <NA> so what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer <unk> the woman would be saved from having unnecessary
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 551.36 561.48 <NA> <unk> but sentinel lymph node the way that we do it today is kind of like having a road map just to know where to go so if you 're driving on the freeway and you want to know where 's the next <unk>
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 561.38 569.37 <NA> <unk> gas station you have a map to tell you that that that gas station is down the road it doesn 't tell you whether or not the gas station has gas <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 575.52 580.28 <NA> <unk> it does have gas so that takes more time patients are still on the operating room table <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 580.04 583.83 <NA> anesthesiologists surgeons are waiting around that takes time <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 583.61 587.57 <NA> so with our technology <unk> we can tell right away <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 587.57 595.25 <NA> you see a lot of little roundish bumps there <unk> there some of these are swollen lymph nodes that look a little larger than others 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 595.01 599.9 <NA> who amongst us hasn 't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold <unk> that doesn 't mean that there 's
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 601.27 605.78 <NA> <unk> well with our technology <unk> the surgeon is able to tell immediately
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 605.29 608.09 <NA> which nodes have cancer <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 607.72 618.23 <NA> i won 't go into this very much but our technology <unk> besides being able to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence <unk> we can also use the same smart <unk>
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 618.18 629.97 <NA> three part molecule to tag gadolinium onto the system so you can do this noninvasively <unk> the patient has cancer <unk> you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer even before
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 630.08 633.96 <NA> <unk> you go in well you can see this on an mri <unk> so
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 633.68 642.9 <NA> in surgery <unk> it 's important to know what to cut out <unk> but equally important is to preserve things
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 642.7 646.32 <NA> that are important for function 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 646.1 654.94 <NA> so it 's very important to avoid inadvertent injury and what i 'm talking about are nerves nerves if they
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 654.96 659.47 <NA> <unk> are injured can cause paralysis can cause pain 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 660.06 666.98 <NA> in the setting of prostate cancer <unk> up to sixty percent of men after prostate cancer surgery
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 666.81 669.26 <NA> may have urinary incontinence
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 669.07 675.02 <NA> and erectile disfunction that 's a lot of people to have a lot of problems and this is even
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 677.8 691.29 <NA> <unk> which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem <unk> and they are trying to avoid the nerves <unk> but you know what these little nerves are so small in the context of prostate cancer <unk> that they are actually never seen 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 691.29 699.99 <NA> they are traced just by their their known anatomical path along vasculature <unk> and they 're known because somebody has decided
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 701.18 705.06 <NA> <unk> which means that we 're still learning about where they are 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 705.56 714.42 <NA> crazy to think that we 're having surgery we 're trying to excise cancer we don 't know where the cancer is we 're trying to preserve nerves we can 't see where they are 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 714.62 721.23 <NA> so i said wouldn 't it be great if we could find a way to see nerves with fluorescence 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 721.22 725.14 <NA> and at first this didn 't get a lot of support
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 726.33 732.59 <NA> <unk> we 've been doing it this way for all these years what 's the problem <unk> we haven 't had that many complications 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 732.59 741.82 <NA> but i went ahead anyway <unk> and roger helped me and he brought his whole team with him <unk> so there 's that teamwork
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 741.57 743.38 <NA> thing again <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 743.16 752.53 <NA> and we eventually discovered molecules that were specifically labeling nerves <unk> and when we made a solution of this tagged with the fluorescence and <unk>
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 753.54 754.91 <NA> <unk> body of a mouse
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 755.35 763.26 <NA> their nerves literally glowed you can see where they are here you 're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse <unk> 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 763.26 773.58 <NA> and you can see that that big fat portion you can see very easily but in fact at the tip of that where i 'm dissecting now there 's actually very fine arborizations
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 773.39 775.02 <NA> that can 't really be seen
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 775.22 784.09 <NA> <unk> looks like little medusa heads coming out <unk> we have been able to see nerves for facial expression for facial movement for breathing

QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 790.91 799.81 <NA> when we put these two probes together <unk> so here 's a tumor do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 801.18 802.45 <NA> <unk> now you do 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 802.86 812.77 <NA> what about the nerve that 's going into this tumor that white portion there is easy to see but what about the part that goes into the tumor do you know where it 's going 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 812.76 814.51 <NA> now you do 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 814.56 822.94 <NA> basically we 've come up with a way to stain tissue and color code the surgical field this was a bit of a breakthrough 
QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 822.72 825.71 <NA> i think that it 'll change

QuyenNguyen_2011P 1 QuyenNguyen_2011P 854.99 859.83 <NA> <unk> needs to happen now is further development of our technology
