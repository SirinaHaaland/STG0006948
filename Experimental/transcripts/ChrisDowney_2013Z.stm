ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 285.39 294.09 <NA> was the realization that actually <unk> cities are fantastic places for the blind <unk> and then i was also surprised

ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 297.5 304.76 <NA> as opposed to indifference or worse <unk> and then i started to realize that it seemed like the blind seemed to have a

ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 334.19 342.21 <NA> i was really struck by the symphony of subtle sounds all around me in the city that you can hear and work with to understand where you are

ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 379.87 385.95 <NA> <unk> that you 've been looking for all this really surprised me <unk> because i started to realize
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 385.71 394.34 <NA> that my unsighted experienced was so far more multi sensory than my sighted experience ever was 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 394.45 399.09 <NA> what struck me also was how much the city was changing around me
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 405.17 408.6 <NA> <unk> lose your sight though and it 's a whole other story <unk>

ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 429.36 432.91 <NA> some of it 's kind of wrong and not helpful <unk> 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 432.9 434.31 <NA> but it 's
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 434.31 443.74 <NA> <unk> all good in the grand scheme of things <unk> but one time i was in oakland walking along broadway <unk> and came to a corner i was waiting for an an audible pedestrian signal 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 443.25 447.74 <NA> and as it went off i was just about to step out into the street when all of a sudden my

ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 450 455.84 <NA> <unk> yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street speaking to me in mandarin it 's

ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 461.23 465.53 <NA> but he got me safely there what could i do <unk> 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 465.28 474.8 <NA> but believe me there are more polite ways to offer assistance <unk> we don 't know you 're there <unk> so it 's kind of nice to say hello first would you like some help 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 474.88 476.36 <NA> but
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 476.05 479.97 <NA> while in oakland <unk> i 've really been struck by how much the city
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 480.02 482.52 <NA> <unk> of oakland changed as i lost my sight <unk> 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 483.14 490.57 <NA> i liked it sighted <unk> it was fine it 's a perfectly great city but once i lost my sight and was walking
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 490.39 494.23 <NA> along broadway <unk> i was blessed every block of the way
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 505.44 511.12 <NA> <unk> and even without sight i don 't get that in san francisco <unk> and
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 510.99 519.13 <NA> i know it bothers some of my blind friends it 's not just me <unk> often it 's thought that that 's an emotion that comes up out of pity 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 519.45 525.05 <NA> i tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity out of our togetherness <unk> and i think it 's
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 525 533.93 <NA> pretty cool in fact if i 'm feeling down i just go to broadway in downtown oakland i go for a walk and i feel better like that in no time at all
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 535.42 545 <NA> <unk> but also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic <unk> social <unk> racial <unk> economic lines 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 544.72 550.17 <NA> disability is an <unk> equal opportunity provider <unk> everybody 's welcome
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 552.02 556.14 <NA> <unk> i 've heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 556.07 562.02 <NA> there are those with disabilities and there are those that haven 't quite found theirs yet <unk> 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 562.55 569.83 <NA> it 's a different way of thinking about it but i think it 's kind of beautiful <unk> because it is certainly far more inclusive than the
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 580.14 583.06 <NA> <unk> so my final takeaway for you is that
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 582.81 588.25 <NA> not only is the city good for the blind <unk> but the city needs us <unk> 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 588.87 599.66 <NA> and i 'm so sure of that that i want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 599.66 604.46 <NA> and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast it 's too late
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 606.4 614.54 <NA> so if you design a city with the blind in mind you 'll have a rich <unk> walkable network of sidewalks
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 614.2 618.26 <NA> with a dense array of options and choices all available
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 617.8 627.33 <NA> at the street level <unk> if you design a city with the blind in mind <unk> sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous the space between buildings will be
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 630.25 637.8 <NA> <unk> in fact <unk> cars <unk> who needs them <unk> if you 're blind you don 't drive 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 638.12 640.86 <NA> they don 't like it when you drive 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 641.45 651.03 <NA> laughter if you design a city with the blind in mind <unk> you design a city with a robust <unk> accessible well connected mass transit system
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 650.54 654.1 <NA> that connects all parts of the city and the region all around
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 655.65 663.16 <NA> <unk> if you design a city with the blind in in mind there 'll be jobs <unk> lots of jobs blind people want to work too they want to earn a living 
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 663.78 668.98 <NA> so in designing a city for the blind <unk> i hope you start to realize
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 668.67 670.54 <NA> that it actually
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 670.05 679.25 <NA> would be a more inclusive a more equitable a more just city for all and based on my prior sighted experience it sounds like a pretty cool city
ChrisDowney_2013Z 1 ChrisDowney_2013Z 679.84 684.6 <NA> <unk> whether you 're blind whether you have a disability or you haven 't quite found yours yet
