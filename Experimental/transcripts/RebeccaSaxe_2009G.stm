RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 12.58 15.59 <NA> <unk> today i 'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 15.25 23.76 <NA> and the problem i 'm going to talk about is not the familiar one from philosophy which is how can we know whether other people have minds 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 23.76 29.39 <NA> that is maybe you have a mind <unk> and everyone else is just a really convincing robot 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 29.96 32.44 <NA> <unk> 's a problem in philosophy but for today 's purposes
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 32.26 35.32 <NA> i 'm going to assume that many people in this audience have a mind <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 35.32 44.74 <NA> and that i don 't have to worry about this there is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us as parents and teachers and spouses and novelists 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 44.51 53.86 <NA> which is why is it so hard to know what somebody else wants or believes or perhaps more relevantly why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 54.87 58.21 <NA> <unk> novelists put this best like philip roth who said 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 57.98 62.61 <NA> and yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of other people <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 62.62 69.34 <NA> so ill equipped are we all to envision one another 's interior workings and invisible aims 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 69.06 79.46 <NA> so as a teacher and as a spouse this is of course a problem i confront every day <unk> but as a scientist i 'm interested in a different problem of other minds <unk> and that is the one i 'm going to introduce to you today
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 79.96 84.26 <NA> <unk> and that problem is how is it so easy to know other minds 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 84.04 86.24 <NA> so to start with an illustration 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 86.24 94.25 <NA> you need almost no information one snapshot of a stranger to guess what this woman is thinking or what this man is
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 94.51 100.97 <NA> <unk> and put another way the crux of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds our brain 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 100.51 104.94 <NA> is made up of pieces brain cells that we share with all other animals
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 104.87 108.27 <NA> <unk> with monkeys and mice and even sea slugs <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 107.81 114.25 <NA> and yet you put them together in a particular network <unk> and what you get is the capacity to write romeo and juliet 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 114.07 116.54 <NA> or to say as alan greenspan did 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 116.54 122.49 <NA> i know you think you understand what you thought i said <unk> but i 'm not sure you realize that what you heard is not what i meant 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 126.18 131.8 <NA> <unk> the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience is to stand with these ideas one in each hand <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 131.73 138.89 <NA> and to try to understand how you can put together simple units simple messages over space and time in a network <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 138.89 142.63 <NA> and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 142.98 152.29 <NA> so i 'm going to tell you three things about this today obviously the whole project here is huge and i 'm going to tell you just our first few steps
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 151.83 154.97 <NA> about the discovery of a special brain region for thinking about
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 154.9 162.17 <NA> <unk> other people 's thoughts some observations on the slow development of this system as we learn how to do this difficult job <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 161.8 170.42 <NA> and then finally to show that some of the differences between people in how we judge others can be explained by differences in this brain system <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 170.5 179.01 <NA> so first the first thing i want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain in your brains whose job it is to think about other people 's thoughts
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 180.67 191.73 <NA> it 's called the right temporo parietal junction it 's above and behind your right ear <unk> and this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures i showed you or when you read romeo and juliet or when you tried to understand alan greenspan 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 191.81 195.93 <NA> and you don 't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 195.68 204.97 <NA> so this brain region is called the right tpj and this picture shows the average activation in a group of what we call typical human adults they 're mit undergraduates
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 208.56 215.2 <NA> laughter the second thing i want to say about this brain system is that although we human adults are really good at understanding other <unk>
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 215.1 223.88 <NA> <unk> minds we weren 't always that way it takes children a long time to break into the system <unk> i 'm going to show you a little bit of that long extended process 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 229.99 238.88 <NA> <unk> have beliefs that are different from their own <unk> so i 'm going to show you a five year old who is getting a standard kind of puzzle that we call the false belief task rebecca saxe 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 238.54 240.62 <NA> this is the first pirate 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 240.43 244.26 <NA> his name is ivan and you know what pirates really like
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 254.78 256.02 <NA> <unk> sandwiches 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 255.83 258.75 <NA> and ivan puts his sandwich over here 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 258.29 266.04 <NA> on top of the pirate chest <unk> and ivan says you know what i need a drink with my lunch and so ivan goes to get a drink 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 266.72 269.19 <NA> and while ivan is away
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 268.79 270.22 <NA> the wind comes
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 271.36 274.9 <NA> and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass <unk> and
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 276.12 279.94 <NA> <unk> here comes the other pirate this pirate is called joshua
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 279.99 288.7 <NA> <unk> and joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches so joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says yum yum yum yum yum <unk> i love cheese sandwiches 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 288.45 291.95 <NA> and he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 304.93 312.89 <NA> <unk> ivan comes back and he says i want my cheese sandwich so which one do you think ivan is going to take child i think he is going to
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 312.46 316.82 <NA> take that one rs yeah you think he 's going to take that one all right let 's see oh yeah 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 316.42 319.01 <NA> you were right he took that one <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 318.58 329.37 <NA> so that 's a five year old who clearly understands that other people can have false beliefs and what the consequences are for their actions now i 'm going to show you a <unk> three year old who got the same puzzle
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 329.93 334.74 <NA> <unk> ivan says i want my cheese sandwich which sandwich is he going to take do you
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 334.58 343.63 <NA> think he 's going to take that one let 's see what happens <unk> let 's see what he does here comes ivan and he says i want my cheese sandwich and he takes this one
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 354.95 358.87 <NA> he predicts ivan will take the sandwich that 's really his <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 358.5 366.24 <NA> and second when he sees ivan taking the sandwich where he left his <unk> where we would say he 's taking that one because he thinks it 's his 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 366.24 375.08 <NA> the three year old comes up with another explanation he 's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn 't want it because now it 's dirty on the ground <unk> so that 's why he 's taking the other sandwich
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 375.46 389.52 <NA> <unk> now of course development doesn 't end at five <unk> and we can see the continuation of this process of learning to think about other people 's thoughts by upping the ante and asking children now not for an action prediction <unk> but for a moral judgment <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 389.52 392.33 <NA> so first i 'm going to show you the three year old again rs 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 391.9 399.27 <NA> so is ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua 's sandwich child yeah rs should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua 's sandwich child yeah 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 400.79 409.78 <NA> <unk> so it 's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of ivan to take joshua 's sandwich <unk> since he thinks ivan only took joshua 's sandwich to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 409.78 420.03 <NA> but now i 'm going to show you the five year old remember the <unk> five year old completely understood why ivan took joshua 's sandwich rs was ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua 's sandwich child 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 419.81 429.46 <NA> um yeah <unk> and so it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response rs should ivan get in trouble for taking joshua 's sandwich
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 430.2 436.54 <NA> <unk> because the wind should get in trouble he says the wind should get in trouble for switching the sandwiches 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 438.9 447.79 <NA> and now what we 've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what 's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about <unk>
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 447.69 454.97 <NA> <unk> other people 's thoughts <unk> so the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region the right tpj being used while children are thinking about
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 454.99 458.49 <NA> <unk> other people <unk> but it 's not quite like the adult brain 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 458.49 466.53 <NA> so whereas in the adults as i told you this brain region is almost completely specialized it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people 's thoughts
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 466.17 471.96 <NA> in children it 's much less so when they are age five to eight <unk> the age range of the children i just showed you 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 471.96 478.2 <NA> and actually if we even look at eight to 11 year olds getting into early adolescence they still don 't have quite an
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 480.29 493.89 <NA> and so what we can see is that over the course of childhood and even into adolescence <unk> both the cognitive system <unk> our mind 's ability to think about other minds <unk> and the brain system that supports it are continuing slowly to develop <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 494.03 500.02 <NA> but of course as you 're probably aware even in adulthood <unk> people differ from one another in how good they
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 500 503.71 <NA> <unk> are at thinking of other minds how often they do it and how accurately <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 503.25 512.14 <NA> and so what we wanted to know was could differences among adults in how they think about other people 's thoughts be explained in terms of differences in this brain region <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 511.77 519.13 <NA> so the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids and i 'm going to give that to you now <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 518.82 527.62 <NA> so grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory and they take a break for coffee and grace 's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 527.13 529.82 <NA> grace goes to make the coffee
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 529.96 534.8 <NA> <unk> finds by the coffee a pot containing a white powder which is sugar <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 534.49 543.14 <NA> but the powder is labeled deadly poison so grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison and she puts it in her friend 's coffee 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 542.92 549.99 <NA> and her friend drinks the coffee and is fine how many people think it was morally permissible for grace to put the powder in
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 555.59 560.85 <NA> <unk> so we ask people how much should grace be blamed in this case which we call a failed attempt to harm <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 560.36 570 <NA> and we can compare that to another case where everything in the real world is the same the powder is still sugar <unk> but what 's different is what grace thinks now she thinks the powder is sugar 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 569.51 577.35 <NA> and perhaps unsurprisingly if grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend 's coffee <unk> people say she deserves no blame at all 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 577.35 579.76 <NA> whereas if she thinks the powder was poison
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 579.84 586.84 <NA> <unk> even though it 's really sugar now people say she deserves a lot of blame even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 586.64 591.44 <NA> and in fact they say she deserves more blame in this case <unk> the failed attempt to harm <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 591.26 593.03 <NA> than in another case <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 592.85 601.47 <NA> which we call an accident where grace thought the powder was sugar because it was labeled sugar and by the coffee machine but actually the powder was poison <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 601.47 604.94 <NA> so even though when the powder was poison <unk> the friend drank
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 604.98 615.92 <NA> the coffee and died <unk> people say grace deserves less blame in that case when she innocently thought it was sugar <unk> than in the other case where she thought it was poison and no harm occurred 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 616.9 625.14 <NA> people though disagree a little bit about exactly how much blame grace should get in the accident case some people think she should deserve more blame
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 625.04 631.45 <NA> <unk> and other people less and what i 'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside the brains of people while they 're making that judgment <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 631.45 640.14 <NA> so what i 'm showing you from left to right is how much activity there was in this brain region <unk> and from top to bottom how much blame people said that grace deserved <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 639.8 649.71 <NA> and what you can see is on the left when there was very little activity in this brain region <unk> people paid little attention to her innocent belief and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 649.71 654.97 <NA> whereas on the right <unk> where there was a lot of activity <unk> people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 654.69 659.02 <NA> <unk> belief and said she deserved a lot less blame for causing the accident <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 659.04 667.48 <NA> so that 's good but of course what we 'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region <unk> and see if we could change people 's moral judgment <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 667.8 679.67 <NA> and we do have such a tool it 's called trans cranial magnetic stimulation or tms this is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebody 's skull into a small region of their brain
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 679.87 683.96 <NA> <unk> and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 683.47 693.96 <NA> so i 'm going to show you a demo of this first i 'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse i 'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine when you hear clicks we
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 693.96 695.69 <NA> 're turning the machine on 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 701.26 704.88 <NA> so now i 'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 705.01 710.49 <NA> to the part of my brain that controls my hand <unk> so there is no physical force just a magnetic pulse woman ready rebecca rs 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 716.33 725.2 <NA> okay so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain <unk> and we can use that same pulse 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 725.16 733.13 <NA> <unk> now applied to the rtpj to ask if we can change people 's moral judgments so these are the judgments i showed you before people 's normal moral judgments <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 733.13 746.38 <NA> and then we can apply tms to the rtpj and ask how people 's judgments change and the first thing is people can still do this task overall so their judgments of the case when everything was fine remain the same they say she deserves no blame 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 746.7 754.94 <NA> but in the case of a failed attempt to harm <unk> where grace thought that it was poison <unk> although it was really sugar <unk> people now say it was more okay
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 755.05 758.75 <NA> <unk> she deserves less blame for putting the powder in the coffee 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 758.32 764.48 <NA> and in the case of the accident where she thought that it was sugar <unk> but it was really poison and so she caused a death <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 764.48 768.35 <NA> people say that it was less okay she deserves more blame 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 769.72 772.31 <NA> so what i 've told you today is that
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 772.24 779.94 <NA> people come actually especially well equipped to think about other people 's thoughts we have a special brain system
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 780.1 788.53 <NA> that lets us think about what other people are thinking this system takes a long time to develop <unk> slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 788.53 796.41 <NA> and even in adulthood differences in this brain region can explain differences among adults in how we think about and judge other people <unk> 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 796.22 799.87 <NA> but i want to give the last word back to the novelists and to philip
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 800.58 802.16 <NA> <unk> who ended by saying 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 801.92 811.39 <NA> the fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway it 's getting them wrong that is living getting them wrong and wrong and wrong 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 811.39 814.7 <NA> and then on careful reconsideration getting them wrong again
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 829.69 835.88 <NA> <unk> magnetic pulses to change people 's moral judgments that sounds alarming 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 836.02 839.85 <NA> please tell me that you 're not taking phone calls from the pentagon
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 854.9 862.08 <NA> <unk> where this work leads i mean you 're clearly an incredible human being but someone could take this knowledge and in some
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 862.01 867.9 <NA> future not torture chamber do acts that people here might be worried about rs 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 867.68 875.02 <NA> yeah <unk> we worry about this so there 's a couple of things to say about tms one is that you can 't be tmsed without knowing
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 876.15 883.67 <NA> <unk> it 's not a surreptitious technology it 's quite hard actually to get those very small changes the changes i showed you are impressive
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 883.49 890.5 <NA> to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain but they 're small on the scale of the moral judgments that we actually make 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 890.5 900.02 <NA> and what we changed was not people 's moral judgments when they 're deciding what to do when they 're making action choices we changed their ability to judge other people 's actions <unk> and so
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 900 906.05 <NA> i think of what i 'm doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial but studying the jury ca 
RebeccaSaxe_2009G 1 RebeccaSaxe_2009G 905.71 914.4 <NA> is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education to perhaps bring up a generation of kids
