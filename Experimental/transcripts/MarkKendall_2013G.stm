MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 12.46 21.23 <NA> <unk> it 's a pleasure to be here in edinburgh <unk> scotland the birthplace of the needle and syringe <unk> less than a mile from here in this direction <unk>
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 22.96 29.97 <NA> <unk> a scotsman filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe his name was alexander wood <unk> and it was at the royal college of
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 30.1 31.53 <NA> physicians 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 31.58 34.47 <NA> this is the patent 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 34.1 44.46 <NA> what blows my mind when i look at it even today is that it looks almost identical to the needle in use today <unk> yet it 's one hundred and sixty years old <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 44.3 49.99 <NA> so we turn to the field of vaccines most vaccines are delivered with the needle and
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 53.76 61.3 <NA> <unk> and credit where it 's due on many levels vaccines are a successful technology <unk> after clean water
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 60.87 67.39 <NA> and sanitation vaccines are the one technology that has increased
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 66.9 75.05 <NA> our life span the most that 's a pretty hard act to beat <unk> but just like any other technology vaccines have
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 77.26 83 <NA> <unk> the needle and syringe is a key part within that narrative this old technology <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 83.32 91.04 <NA> so let 's start with the obvious many of us don 't like the needle and syringe <unk> i share that view <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 91.03 102.83 <NA> however <unk> twenty percent of the population have a thing called needle phobia <unk> that 's more than disliking the needle that is actively avoiding being vaccinated because of needle phobia <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 102.83 104.97 <NA> and that 's problematic in terms of the rollout
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 104.63 107.1 <NA> <unk> rollout of vaccines <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 106.85 111.63 <NA> now related to this is another key issue which is needlestick injuries <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 111.26 118.32 <NA> and the who has figures that suggest about one point three million deaths per year take place due to <unk>
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 119.35 123.39 <NA> with needlestick injuries these are early deaths that take place <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 123.29 129.97 <NA> now these are two things that you probably may have heard of but there are two other shortcomings of the needle and syringe you may not
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 129.9 138.82 <NA> <unk> have heard about one is it could be holding back the next generation of vaccines in terms of their immune responses and the second is that it could be
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 138.42 142.57 <NA> responsible for the problem of the cold chain that i 'll tell you about
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 142.23 149.62 <NA> as well <unk> i 'm going to tell you about some work that my team and i are doing in australia at the university of queensland
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 149.62 154.61 <NA> on a technology designed to tackle those four problems <unk> and that
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 155.23 161.9 <NA> <unk> is called the nanopatch now <unk> this is a specimen of
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 161.65 166.7 <NA> the nanopatch to the naked eye
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 166.21 173.48 <NA> it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp but under a microscope
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 173.83 174.96 <NA> what you see
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 175.04 184.54 <NA> <unk> thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye <unk> and there 's about four thousand projections on this particular square compared to to the needle and
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 184.33 190.35 <NA> i 've designed those projections to serve a key role which is to work with the skin 's immune system
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 189.89 195.7 <NA> <unk> so that 's a very important function tied in with the nanopatch now we make
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 196.72 199.81 <NA> with a technique called deep
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 201.66 209.44 <NA> <unk> and this particular technique is one that 's been borrowed from the semiconductor industry <unk> and therefore is low cost and can be rolled out in large numbers 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 208.98 212.87 <NA> now we dry coat vaccines to the projections
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 212.63 218.92 <NA> of of the nanopatch and apply it to the skin <unk> now the simplest form of application
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 220.35 225.26 <NA> is using our finger <unk> but our finger has some limitations
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 225.49 233.42 <NA> <unk> so we 've devised an applicator and it 's a very simple device you could call it a sophisticated finger it 's a spring operated device 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 233.77 238.07 <NA> what we do is when we apply the nanopatch to the skin as so 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 240.07 247.82 <NA> immediately a few things happen <unk> so firstly the projections on the nanopatch breach through the tough <unk>
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 247.72 252.89 <NA> <unk> outer layer and the vaccine is very quickly released within less than a minute in fact <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 254.81 261.48 <NA> <unk> off and discard it and indeed we can make a reuse of the applicator itself <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 263.51 270.63 <NA> so that gives you an idea of the nanopatch and immediately you can see some key advantages we 've talked about it being needle free
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 270.26 277.47 <NA> these are projections that you can 't even see and of course we get around the needle phobia issue as well <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 277.25 279.91 <NA> now if we take a step back and think about these
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 279.87 283.73 <NA> <unk> other two really important advantages one
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 283.55 289.01 <NA> is improved immune responses through delivery <unk> and the second is getting rid of
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 288.83 290.5 <NA> the cold chain <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 290.19 298.42 <NA> so let 's start with the first one this immunogenicity idea it takes a little while to get our heads around but i 'll try to explain it in simple terms so i 'll
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 298.42 303.22 <NA> take a step back and explain to you how vaccines work in a simple way <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 303.36 304.82 <NA> so vaccines work by
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 304.78 306.62 <NA> <unk> introducing into our body
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 306.31 308.57 <NA> a thing called an antigen
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 308.11 311.45 <NA> which is a safe form of a germ
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 311.17 321.12 <NA> <unk> now that safe germ that antigen tricks our body into mounting an immune response learning and remembering how to deal with intruders 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 321.12 324 <NA> when the real intruder comes along
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 323.78 329.94 <NA> the body quickly mounts an immune response to deal with that vaccine and neutralizes the infection <unk> so it does that well
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 330.13 338.7 <NA> <unk> now <unk> the way it 's done today with the needle and syringe most vaccines are delivered that way with this old technology and the needle but it could be argued
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 338.27 341.13 <NA> that the needle is holding back
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 340.91 348.06 <NA> our immune responses it 's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin <unk> to describe this idea 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 348.29 353.92 <NA> we need to take a journey through the skin <unk> starting with one of those projections
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 353.55 354.55 <NA> and applying the
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 355.05 356.2 <NA> <unk> to the skin 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 355.86 358.59 <NA> and we see this kind of data <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 358.43 368.71 <NA> now <unk> this is real data that thing that we can see there is one projection from the nanopatch that 's been applied to the skin and those colors are different layers now to give you an idea of scale <unk>
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 368.61 377.44 <NA> <unk> if the needle was shown here it would be too big it would be ten times bigger than the size of that screen going ten times deeper as well it 's off the grid entirely 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 379.81 389.69 <NA> <unk> skin <unk> that red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin but the brown layer and the magenta layer are jammed full of of immune cells <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 389.29 396.75 <NA> as one example in the brown layer there 's a certain type of cell called a langerhans cell every square millimeter of our body is jammed
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 396.57 403.74 <NA> full of those langerhans cells those immune cells and there 's others shown as well that we haven 't stained in this image <unk> but you can immediately see that the
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 404.99 407.23 <NA> <unk> that penetration indeed we target
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 406.99 414.27 <NA> thousands upon thousands of these particular cells just residing within a hair 's width of the surface of the skin <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 414.92 420.81 <NA> now <unk> as the the guy that 's invented this thing and designed it to do that i found that exciting <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 420.5 429.67 <NA> but so what so what if you 've targeted cells in the world of vaccines what does that mean the world of vaccines is getting better
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 429.99 438.91 <NA> <unk> getting more systematic <unk> however you still don 't really know if a vaccine is going to work until you roll your sleeves up and vaccinate and wait <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 438.91 441.73 <NA> it 's a gambler 's game even today <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 441.3 445.22 <NA> so we had to do that gamble <unk> we
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 445.04 454.82 <NA> obtained an influenza vaccine we applied it to our nanopatches and we applied the <unk> nanopatches to the skin and we waited and this is in the live animal we waited
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 454.81 464.3 <NA> <unk> month <unk> and this is what we found out this is a data slide showing the immune responses that we 've generated with a nanopatch compared to
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 463.99 473.03 <NA> the needle and syringe into muscle <unk> so on the horizontal axis we have the dose shown in nanograms on the vertical axis we have the immune response generated and <unk>
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 474.25 479.76 <NA> that that dashed line indicates the protection threshold if we 're above that line it
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 479.75 483.46 <NA> <unk> considered protective <unk> if we 're below that line it 's not 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 483.46 492.93 <NA> so the red line is mostly below that curve and indeed there 's only one point that is achieved with the needle that 's protective <unk> and that 's with a high dose of six thousand nanograms <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 492.5 497.68 <NA> but notice immediately the distinctly different curve that we achieve with the blue
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 497.44 503.2 <NA> line that 's what 's achieved with the nanopatch the delivered dose of the nanopatch is a completely different
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 505.14 514.57 <NA> that 's a real fresh opportunity <unk> suddenly we have a brand new lever in the world of vaccines we can push it one way <unk> where we can take a vaccine that works but <unk>
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 514.47 519.98 <NA> <unk> is too expensive and can get protection with a hundredth of the dose compared to the needle 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 529.93 532.07 <NA> <unk> that currently don 't work
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 531.58 535.22 <NA> and get them over that line and get them protective <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 534.82 548.69 <NA> and certainly in the world of vaccines that can be important let 's consider the big three <unk> hiv <unk> malaria <unk> tuberculosis they 're responsible for about seven million deaths per year and there is no adequate vaccination method for any of those 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 548.2 550.11 <NA> so potentially with this new lever
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 551.06 552.11 <NA> <unk> we can help
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 551.8 556.62 <NA> make that happen <unk> we can push that lever to help get those candidate vaccines
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 556.42 563.64 <NA> over the line now of course we 've worked within my lab with many other vaccines that have attained similar responses and similar curves
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 563.64 566.46 <NA> to this what we 've achieved with influenza i 'd
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 567.8 576.66 <NA> like to now switch to talk about another key shortcoming of today 's vaccines and that is the need to maintain the cold chain 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 576.62 579.04 <NA> as the name suggests the cold chain
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 579.93 587.08 <NA> <unk> requirements of keeping a vaccine right from production all the way through to when the vaccine is applied to keep it refrigerated 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 587.85 593.74 <NA> now that presents some logistical challenges but we have ways to do it <unk>
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 593.94 598.51 <NA> <unk> this is a slightly extreme case in point
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 598.86 601.52 <NA> but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 605.13 611.75 <NA> to get vaccines refrigerated and maintain the cold chain if the vaccine is too too warm
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 611.38 617.42 <NA> the vaccine breaks down but interestingly it can be too cold and the vaccine can break down as well <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 617.08 626.18 <NA> now <unk> the stakes are very high the who estimates that within africa up to half the vaccines used there
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 625.72 629.97 <NA> are considered to not be working properly because at some point the cold chain has fallen
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 629.93 637.83 <NA> <unk> over <unk> so it 's a big problem and it 's tied in with the needle and syringe because it 's a liquid form vaccine and when it 's liquid it needs the refrigeration 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 638.33 645.93 <NA> a key attribute of our nanopatch is that the vaccine is dry <unk> and when it 's dry it doesn 't need refrigeration
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 645.93 654.01 <NA> within my lab we 've shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at twenty three degrees celsius for more than a year without any loss in activity at all
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 654.9 656.95 <NA> <unk> that 's an important improvement we
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 663.42 665.98 <NA> 're delighted about it as well 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 665.82 673.09 <NA> and the thing about it is that we have well and truly proven the nanopatch within the laboratory setting <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 673.09 678.46 <NA> and as a scientist <unk> i love that and i love science <unk> however <unk>

MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 679.99 692.54 <NA> <unk> a biomedical engineer and also as a human being i 'm not going to be satisfied until we 've rolled this thing out taken it out of the lab and got it to people in large numbers and particularly the people that need it the most <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 693.1 699.96 <NA> so we 've commenced this particular journey <unk> and we 've commenced this journey in an unusual way we 've started with
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 700.07 703.8 <NA> <unk> papua new guinea <unk> now papua new guinea
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 703.61 705.21 <NA> is

MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 710.33 717.72 <NA> but it suffers from many of the key barriers existing within the world of today 's vaccines 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 717.32 729.64 <NA> there 's the logistics within this country there are only eight hundred refrigerators to keep vaccines chilled many of them are old like this one in port moresby <unk> many of them are breaking down and many are not in the highlands where
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 730.7 732.28 <NA> that 's a challenge <unk> 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 732.28 741.49 <NA> but also papua new guinea has the world 's highest incidence of hpv human papillomavirus the cervical cancer [ risk factor ] 
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 741.54 749.99 <NA> yet <unk> that vaccine is not available in large numbers because it 's too expensive <unk> so for those two reasons with the attributes of the nanopatch we 've got into the
MarkKendall_2013G 1 MarkKendall_2013G 751.99 756.03 <NA> <unk> taken it to papua new guinea and we 'll be following that up shortly
