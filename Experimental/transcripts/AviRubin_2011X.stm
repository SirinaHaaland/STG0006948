AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 29.12 37.65 <NA> what i did for a living <unk> apparently <unk> i was in charge of making sure that no one stole the computers from the university 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 38.51 45.16 <NA> and you know that 's a perfectly reasonable thing for her to think because i told her i was working in computer security <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 45.16 48.03 <NA> and it was interesting to get her perspective
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 48.26 54.97 <NA> <unk> but that 's not the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard anyone say about my work the most ridiculous thing i ever
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 54.93 62.92 <NA> <unk> heard is i was at a dinner party and a woman heard that i work in computer security <unk> and she asked me if
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 62.69 70.57 <NA> she said her computer had been infected by a virus <unk> and she was very concerned that she might get sick from it that she could get this virus 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 71.04 79.91 <NA> and i 'm not a doctor <unk> but i reassured her that it was very very unlikely that this would happen <unk> but if she felt more comfortable she
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 80.02 85.16 <NA> <unk> be free to use latex gloves when she was on the computer and there would be no harm whatsoever in that 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 85.39 91.52 <NA> i 'm going to get back to this notion of being able to get a virus from your computer in a serious way 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 91.24 104.7 <NA> what i 'm going to talk to you about today are some hacks some real world world cyberattacks that people in my community the academic research community have performed <unk> which i don 't think most people know about
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 104.9 107.55 <NA> <unk> think they 're very interesting and scary <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 107.39 120.09 <NA> and this talk is kind of a greatest hits of the academic security community 's hacks <unk> none of the work is my work it 's all work that my colleagues have done and i actually asked them for their slides and incorporated them into this talk 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 120.09 123.96 <NA> so the first one i 'm going to talk about are implanted medical devices 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 123.8 128.05 <NA> now medical devices have come a long way technologically you can see
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 130.08 137.32 <NA> <unk> was invented one thousand nine hundred and sixty the first internal pacemaker was implanted hopefully a little smaller than that one that you see there 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 136.98 146.32 <NA> and the technology has continued to move forward in two thousand and six we hit an important milestone from the perspective of
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 145.86 154.37 <NA> of computer security <unk> and why do i say that <unk> because that 's when implanted devices inside of people started to have networking capabilities
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 155.02 165.12 <NA> <unk> one thing that brings us close to home is we look at dick cheney 's device he had a device that pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart and as you can see at the bottom there 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 165.07 173.27 <NA> <unk> it was controlled by a computer controller and if you ever thought that software liability was very important get one of these inside of you 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 180.22 187.56 <NA> and this is a device that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm and these have saved many lives <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 187.1 196.6 <NA> well <unk> in order to not have to open up the person every time you want to reprogram their device or do some diagnostics on it <unk> they made the thing be able to communicate wirelessly <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 196.6 199.78 <NA> and what this research team did is they reverse engineered the wireless
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 200.58 209.62 <NA> <unk> and they built the device you see pictured here with a little antenna that could talk the protocol to the device and thus control it <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 209.73 220.28 <NA> in order to make their experience real they were unable to find any volunteers <unk> and so they went and they got some ground beef and some bacon and they wrapped it all up to about the size of a human being 's
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 220.07 229.94 <NA> area where the device would go and they stuck the device inside it to perform their experiment somewhat realistically <unk> they launched many many successful attacks one that
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 229.9 235.46 <NA> <unk> 'll highlight here is changing the patient 's name i don 't know why you would want to do that but i sure wouldn 't want that done to me <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 235.09 246.08 <NA> and they were able to change therapies including disabling the device and this is with a real commercial off the shelf device simply by performing reverse engineering and sending wireless signals to it 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 247.27 249.9 <NA> there was a piece on npr that some of
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 250.97 255.9 <NA> <unk> could actually have their performance disrupted simply by holding a pair of headphones onto them 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 256.19 265.71 <NA> now wireless and the internet can improve health care greatly there 's several examples up on the screen of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices inside <unk>

AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 281.91 289.21 <NA> let me shift gears and show you another target i 'm going to show you a few different targets like this and that 's my talk so we 'll look at automobiles 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 289.05 299.96 <NA> this is a car and it has a lot of components a lot of electronics in it today in fact <unk> it 's got many many different computers inside of it <unk> more pentiums than my lab did when i
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 301.99 304.31 <NA> <unk> they 're connected by a wired network <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 304.15 311.15 <NA> there 's also a wireless network in the car <unk> which can be reached from many different ways <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 311.15 321.9 <NA> so there 's bluetooth there 's the fm and xm radio <unk> there 's actually wi fi there 's sensors in the wheels that wirelessly communicate the tire pressure to a controller on board 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 321.67 324.99 <NA> the modern car is a sophisticated <unk>
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 326.78 333.57 <NA> <unk> and what happens if somebody wanted to attack this well that 's what the researchers that i 'm going to talk about today did <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 333.14 338.13 <NA> they basically stuck an attacker on the wired network and on the wireless network <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 338.36 340.38 <NA> now they have two
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 339.92 347.13 <NA> areas they can attack one is short range wireless where you can actually communicate with the device from nearby either through bluetooth or wi fi 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 347.12 353.53 <NA> and the other is long range where you can communicate with the car through the cellular network or through one of the radio stations 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 353.29 354.97 <NA> think about it when a car receives
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 354.96 356.56 <NA> <unk> a radio signal <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 356.33 365.23 <NA> it 's processed by software that software has to receive and decode the radio signal and then figure out what to do with it <unk> even if it 's just music that it needs to play on the radio <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 365.23 373.63 <NA> and that software that does that decoding if it has any bugs in it <unk> could create a vulnerability for somebody to hack the car <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 373.35 379.25 <NA> the way that the researchers did this work is they read the software in
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 380.16 393.53 <NA> computer chips that were in the car <unk> and then they used sophisticated reverse engineering tools to figure out what that software did <unk> and then they found vulnerabilities in that software <unk> and then they built exploits to exploit those 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 393.7 399.95 <NA> they actually carried out their attack in real life they bought two cars and i guess they have better budgets than i do 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 400.3 404.97 <NA> the first threat model was to see what someone could do if an attacker actually got
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 405.02 415.36 <NA> <unk> access to the internal network on the car <unk> okay so think of that as someone gets to go to your car <unk> they get to mess around with it <unk> and then they leave and now what kind of trouble are you in 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 415.36 424.93 <NA> the other threat model is that they contact you in real time over one of the wireless networks like the cellular or something like that never having actually gotten physical access to
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 426.75 436.08 <NA> <unk> this is what their setup looks like for the first model where you get to have access to the car <unk> they put a laptop <unk> and they connected to the diagnostic unit on the in car network 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 436.09 443.44 <NA> and they did all kinds of silly things like here 's a picture of the speedometer showing one hundred and forty miles an hour when the car 's in park
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 443.16 454.4 <NA> <unk> once you have control of the car 's computers you can do anything now you might say okay that 's silly well what if you make the car always say it 's going twenty miles an hour slower than it 's actually going you might produce a lot of speeding tickets
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 455.41 464.84 <NA> <unk> then they went out to an abandoned airstrip with two cars the target victim car and the chase car and they launched a bunch of other attacks 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 464.68 473.15 <NA> one of the things they were able to do from the chase car is apply the brakes on the other car <unk> simply by hacking the computer they were able to disable the brakes 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 472.66 475.65 <NA> they also were able to install malware
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 475.47 480 <NA> that wouldn 't kick in and wouldn 't trigger until the car was doing something like going over twenty
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 479.99 482.07 <NA> <unk> miles an hour or something like that 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 482.24 490.68 <NA> the results are astonishing and when they gave this talk even though they gave this talk at a conference to a bunch of computer security researchers everybody was gasping <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 490.19 499.78 <NA> they were able to take over a bunch of critical computers inside the car <unk> the brakes computer the lighting computer the engine <unk> the dash the radio <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 500.67 506.32 <NA> <unk> and they were able to perform these on real commercial cars that they purchased using the radio network <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 505.89 514.15 <NA> they were able to compromise every single one of the pieces of software that controlled every single one of the wireless capabilities of the car <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 513.81 522.04 <NA> all of these were implemented successfully <unk> how would you steal a car in this model well you compromise the car by
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 521.64 525.11 <NA> a buffer overflow of vulnerability in the software something like that
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 525.28 534.86 <NA> <unk> you use the gps in the car to locate it <unk> you remotely unlock the doors through the computer that controls that start the engine <unk> bypass anti theft and you 've got yourself a car <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 534.64 537.27 <NA> surveillance was really interesting <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 537.03 548.94 <NA> the authors of the study have a video where they show themselves taking over a car and then turning on the microphone in the car and listening in on the car while tracking it via gps on a map <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 548.94 552.71 <NA> and so that 's something that the drivers of the car would never know was happening am i
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 552.79 554.13 <NA> scaring you yet
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 555.65 562.72 <NA> <unk> got a few more of these interesting ones these are ones where i went to a conference and my mind was just blown and i said i have to share this with other people 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 562.72 571.71 <NA> this was fabian monrose 's lab at the university of north carolina <unk> and what they did was something intuitive once you see it <unk> but kind of surprising 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 571.49 574.9 <NA> they videotaped people on a bus and then they
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 575.67 580.09 <NA> <unk> the video what you see here in number one is a
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 580.11 584.84 <NA> reflection in somebody 's glasses of the smartphone that they 're typing in 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 584.6 595.39 <NA> they wrote software to stabilize even though they were on a bus and maybe someone 's holding their phone at an angle to stabilize the phone process it <unk> and you may know on your smartphone <unk>
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 595.34 604.22 <NA> when you type a password the keys pop out a little bit <unk> and they were able to use that to reconstruct what the person was typing and had a language model for detecting typing
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 605.43 615.68 <NA> what was interesting is by videotaping on a bus they were able to produce exactly what people on their smartphones were typing <unk> and then they had a surprising result which is that their software had not <unk>
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 615.58 624.99 <NA> <unk> only done it for their target but other people who accidentally happened to be in the picture they were able to produce what those people had been typing and that was kind of an accidental artifact of what their
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 632.3 643.98 <NA> <unk> radios are used by law enforcement and all kinds of government agencies and people in combat to communicate and there 's an encryption option on these phones this is what the phone looks like 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 643.98 646.75 <NA> it 's not really a phone it 's more of a two way radio <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 646.54 654.94 <NA> motorola makes the most widely used one <unk> and you can see that they 're used by secret service they 're used in combat it 's a very very common standard in the u s and elsewhere
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 655.14 661.01 <NA> so one question the researchers asked themselves is could you block this thing right could you
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 660.8 670.12 <NA> run a denial of service because these are first responders so would a terrorist organization want to black out the ability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 669.66 679.46 <NA> they found that there 's this girltech device used for texting that happens to operate at the same exact frequency as the p25 and they built what they called my first jammer
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 682.39 690.14 <NA> if you look closely at this device <unk> it 's got a switch for encryption or cleartext let me advance the slide <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 689.92 692.66 <NA> and now i 'll go back you see the difference 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 693.04 695.69 <NA> this is plain text 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 695.23 704.64 <NA> this is encrypted there 's one little dot that shows up on the screen and one little tiny turn of the switch <unk> and so the researchers asked themselves i wonder how many times very
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 704.99 711.93 <NA> <unk> secure important sensitive conversations are happening on these two way radios where they forget to encrypt and they don 't notice that they didn 't encrypt 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 711.77 725.23 <NA> so they bought a scanner these are perfectly legal and they run at the frequency of the p25 and what they did is they hopped around frequencies and they wrote software to listen in if they found encrypted communication
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 725.19 730.75 <NA> <unk> they stayed on that channel and they wrote down that 's a channel that these people communicate in these law enforcement agencies 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 730.75 737.77 <NA> and they went to twenty metropolitan areas and listened in on conversations that were happening at those frequencies <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 737.52 745.09 <NA> they found that in every metropolitan area <unk> they would capture over twenty minutes a day of cleartext communication <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 745.09 749.72 <NA> and what kind of things were people talking about well they found the names and information about confidential
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 750.73 760.82 <NA> <unk> they found information that was being recorded in wiretaps a bunch of crimes that were being discussed <unk> sensitive information it was mostly law enforcement and criminal 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 760.78 775.14 <NA> they went and reported this to the law enforcement agencies after anonymizing it and the vulnerability here is simply the user interface wasn 't good enough if you 're talking about something really secure and sensitive it should be really clear to you that this conversation is encrypted
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 775.52 780.63 <NA> <unk> that one 's pretty easy to fix the last one i thought was really really cool and i just had to show it to you it
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 780.62 785.37 <NA> 's probably not something that you 're going to lose sleep over like the cars or the defibrillators <unk> but
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 785.99 798.88 <NA> it 's stealing keystrokes <unk> now we 've all looked at smartphones upside down every security expert wants to hack a smartphone and we tend to look at the usb port the gps for tracking the camera the microphone <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 798.88 804.73 <NA> but no one up till this point had looked at the accelerometer the accelerometer is the thing that determines the vertical
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 804.69 807.19 <NA> <unk> orientation of the smartphone <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 806.91 812.83 <NA> and so they had a simple setup <unk> they put a smartphone next to a keyboard <unk> and they had people type <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 812.37 817.54 <NA> and then their goal was to use the vibrations that were created by typing
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 817.47 821.48 <NA> to measure the change in the accelerometer reading
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 821.48 829.67 <NA> to determine what the person had been typing <unk> now when they tried this on an iphone 3gs this is a graph of the perturbations that were
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 829.63 839.51 <NA> <unk> created by the typing and you can see that it 's very difficult to tell when somebody was typing or what they were typing <unk> but the iphone four greatly improved the accelerometer <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 839.29 844.04 <NA> and so the same measurement produced this graph 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 844.03 853.47 <NA> now that gave you a lot of information while someone was typing and what they did then is used advanced artificial intelligence techniques called machine learning
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 853.24 854.79 <NA> to have a training phase
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 854.96 860.13 <NA> <unk> so they got most likely grad students to type in a whole lot of things and
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 859.79 871.2 <NA> to learn to have the system use the machine learning tools that were available to learn what it is that the people were typing and to match that up with the measurements in the accelerometer <unk> 
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 871.19 879.97 <NA> and then there 's the attack phase where you get somebody to type something in you don 't know what it was but you use your model that you created in the training phase to figure out what they were typing
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 880.16 889.97 <NA> they had pretty good success this is an article from the usa today <unk> they typed in the illinois supreme court has ruled that rahm emanuel is eligible to run for mayor of chicago <unk>
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 891.17 899.84 <NA> and ordered him to stay on the ballot now the system is interesting because it produced illinois supreme and then it wasn 't sure the model produced a bunch of
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 900.64 910.76 <NA> <unk> and this is the beauty of of some of the a i techniques is that computers are good at some things humans are good at other things take the best of both and let the humans solve this one don 't waste computer cycles <unk>
AviRubin_2011X 1 AviRubin_2011X 910.71 919.76 <NA> a human 's not going to think it 's the supreme might it 's the supreme court <unk> right and so together we 're able to reproduce typing simply by measuring the accelerometer <unk>
