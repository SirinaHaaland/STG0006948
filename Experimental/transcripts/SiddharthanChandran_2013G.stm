SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 12.34 15.85 <NA> very pleased to be here today to talk to you all about
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 15.69 18.83 <NA> how we might repair the damaged brain <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 18.82 27.81 <NA> and i 'm particularly excited by this field because as a neurologist myself <unk> i believe that this offers one of the great ways that we might be able to offer hope
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 27.62 29.97 <NA> for patients who today live with devastating
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 30.34 33.21 <NA> and yet untreatable diseases of the brain <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 33.68 35.73 <NA> so here 's the problem <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 35.87 42.06 <NA> you can see here the picture of somebody 's brain with alzheimer 's disease next to a healthy brain <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 42.17 49.17 <NA> and what 's obvious is in the alzheimer 's brain <unk> ringed red there 's obvious damage atrophy scarring <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 49.37 54.85 <NA> and i could show you equivalent pictures from other disease <unk> multiple sclerosis motor neuron disease
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 54.99 60.58 <NA> <unk> parkinson 's disease <unk> even huntington 's disease <unk> and they would all tell a similar story <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 60.63 66.73 <NA> and collectively these brain disorders represent one of the major public health threats of our time <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 66.96 70.3 <NA> and the numbers here are really rather staggering 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 70.56 79.97 <NA> at any one time there are thirty five million people today living with one of these brain diseases <unk> and the annual cost globally is
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 79.96 87.44 <NA> <unk> seven hundred billion dollars i mean just think about that that 's greater than one percent of the global gdp <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 87.82 93.66 <NA> and it gets worse <unk> because all these numbers are rising because these are by and large
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 95.08 100.05 <NA> <unk> living longer <unk> so the question we really need to ask ourselves is why
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 100.46 104.35 <NA> <unk> given the devastating impact of these diseases to the individual 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 104.35 110.61 <NA> never mind the scale of the societal problem <unk> why are there no effective treatments <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 110.81 117.15 <NA> now in order to consider this i first need to give you a crash course in how the brain works
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 117.26 121.56 <NA> so in other words i need to tell you everything i learned at medical school 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 123.17 125.02 <NA> but believe me this isn 't going to take
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 128.1 133.24 <NA> <unk> so the brain is terribly simple it 's made up of four cells <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 133.02 141.46 <NA> and two of them are shown here <unk> there 's the nerve cell <unk> and then there 's the myelinating cell or the insulating cell <unk> it 's called oligodendrocyte 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 141.72 145.84 <NA> and when these four cells work together in health and harmony 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 145.65 154.97 <NA> they create an extraordinary symphony of electrical activity <unk> and it is this electrical activity that underpins our ability to think to emote
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 154.66 158.36 <NA> <unk> emote to remember to learn move feel and so on 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 158.41 166.76 <NA> but equally <unk> each of these individual four cells alone or together can go rogue or die <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 166.81 172.91 <NA> and when that happens you get damage <unk> you get damaged wiring you get disrupted connections <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 173.44 175.05 <NA> and that 's evident here
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 175 176.88 <NA> with the slower conduction 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 177.47 181.89 <NA> but ultimately this damage will manifest as disease clearly <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 182.36 189.78 <NA> and if the starting dying nerve cell is a motor nerve for example <unk> you 'll get motor neuron disease <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 189.8 195.27 <NA> so i 'd like to give you a real life illustration of what happens with motor neuron disease <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 195.71 204.97 <NA> so this is a patient of mine called john john i saw just last week in the clinic <unk> and i 've asked john to tell us something about what were his
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 204.93 208.34 <NA> <unk> problems that led to the initial diagnosis of motor neuron disease
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 229.81 235.44 <NA> <unk> further down in that journey <unk> and i 've now asked him to tell us something about his current predicament
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 254.96 256.98 <NA> <unk> what these two clips show
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 256.82 263.79 <NA> is not just the devastating consequence of the disease <unk> but they also tell us something about the shocking pace of the disease <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 263.33 266.88 <NA> because in just eighteen months eighteen months 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 266.93 271.2 <NA> a fit adult man has been rendered wheelchair and <unk>
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 272.87 279.85 <NA> and let 's face it john could be anybody 's father brother or friend so that 's what happens when the motor nerve dies
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 280.02 288.62 <NA> <unk> what happens when that myelin cell dies <unk> you get multiple sclerosis <unk> so the scan on your left
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 288.44 294.04 <NA> is an illustration of the brain <unk> and it 's a map of the connections of the brain <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 294.04 302.2 <NA> and superimposed upon which are areas of damage we call them lesions of demyelination but they 're damage <unk> and they 're white <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 301.92 304.43 <NA> so i know what you 're thinking here you 're thinking
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 304.81 308.39 <NA> <unk> god this bloke came up and said he 's going to talk about hope <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 308.17 316.67 <NA> and all he 's done is give a really rather bleak and depressing tale i 've told you these diseases are terrible they 're devastating numbers are rising 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 316.3 320.87 <NA> the costs are ridiculous and worst of all we have no treatment <unk> where 's the hope 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 320.74 323.3 <NA> well you know what i think there is hope <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 323.29 324.96 <NA> and there 's hope in this next
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 325.97 329.67 <NA> <unk> of this brain section of somebody else with m s because what it illustrates
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 329.44 334.44 <NA> is amazingly the brain can repair itself it just doesn 't do it well enough <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 334.55 343.62 <NA> and so again there are two things i want to show you first of all is the damage of this patient with <unk> m s and again it 's another one of these white masses <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 343.43 347.41 <NA> but crucially the area that 's ringed red
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 347.2 354.43 <NA> highlights an area that is pale blue but that area that is pale blue was once white <unk> so it was damaged it 's now repaired
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 355.47 357.55 <NA> just to be clear it
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 357.21 363.49 <NA> 's not because of doctors it 's in spite of doctors not because of doctors this is spontaneous repair 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 363.03 368.11 <NA> it 's amazing and it 's occurred because there are stem cells in the brain even 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 367.83 373.54 <NA> which can enable new myelin new insulation to be laid down over the damaged nerves <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 373.41 374.9 <NA> and this observation is
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 375 379.18 <NA> important for two reasons the first
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 378.96 385.76 <NA> is it challenges one of the orthodoxies that we learnt at medical school or at least i did <unk> admittedly last century
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 385.99 390.66 <NA> <unk> which is that the brain doesn 't repair itself <unk> unlike say the bone
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 390.47 399.96 <NA> or the liver but actually it does but it just doesn 't do it well enough <unk> and the second thing it does and it gives us a very clear direction of travel
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 401.57 411.12 <NA> <unk> you don 't need to be a rocket scientist to know what to do here <unk> you simply need to find ways of promoting the endogenous spontaneous repair that occurs anyway <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 411.83 417.75 <NA> so the question is <unk> why if we 've known that for some time as we have <unk> why
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 417.8 419.4 <NA> do we not
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 419 424.56 <NA> have those treatments <unk> and that in part reflects the complexity of drug development now
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 425.15 429.88 <NA> drug development you might think of as a rather expensive but risky bet
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 430.02 434.89 <NA> and the odds of this bet are roughly this they 're ten thousand to one against 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 434.43 439.9 <NA> because you need to screen about ten thousand compounds to find that one potential winner <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 439.44 446.02 <NA> and then you need to spend fifteen years and spend over a billion dollars <unk> and even then you may not have a winner <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 445.92 451.57 <NA> so the question for us is can you change the rules of the game and can you shorten the odds 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 451.95 454.97 <NA> and in order to do that you have to think where is the bottleneck
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 455.02 463.04 <NA> <unk> in this drug discovery and one of the bottlenecks is early in drug discovery all that screening occurs in animal models <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 463.48 473.25 <NA> but we know that the proper study of mankind is man to borrow from alexander pope <unk> so the question is can we study these diseases using human
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 473.04 475.08 <NA> material and of course
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 475.07 480.6 <NA> <unk> absolutely we can we can use stem cells <unk> and specifically we can use human stem cells <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 480.56 485.14 <NA> and human stem cells are these extraordinary but simple cells that can do two things 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 484.96 488.02 <NA> they can self renew or make more of themselves <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 488.02 496.08 <NA> but they can also become specialized to make bone liver <unk> or crucially nerve cells <unk> maybe even the motor nerve cell or the myelin cell <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 496.19 500.02 <NA> and the challenge has long been can we harness the power
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 500.1 502.5 <NA> <unk> the undoubted power of these stem cells
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 502.34 506.32 <NA> in order to realize their promise for regenerative neurology <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 505.86 518.68 <NA> and i think we can now <unk> and the reason we can is because there have been several major discoveries in the last ten twenty years one of them was here in edinburgh <unk> and it must be the only celebrity sheep dolly <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 519 524 <NA> so dolly was made in edinburgh <unk> and dolly was an example of the first
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 523.84 529.97 <NA> cloning of a mammal from an adult cell <unk> but i think the even more significant
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 529.96 533.37 <NA> <unk> breakthrough for the purposes of our discussion today
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 533.13 537.5 <NA> was made in two thousand and six by a japanese scientist called yamanaka <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 537.37 541.5 <NA> and what yamaka did in a fantastic form of scientific cookery 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 541.5 550.17 <NA> was he showed that four ingredients just four ingredients could effectively convert any cell adult cell <unk> into a master stem cell
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 550.97 553.89 <NA> <unk> and the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 553.43 561.75 <NA> because what it means that from anybody in this room but particularly patients you could now generate a bespoke personalized tissue repair kit 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 561.75 568.86 <NA> take a skin cell <unk> make it a master pluripotent cell <unk> so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their disease <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 568.52 571.59 <NA> both to study but potentially to treat 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 571.31 579.82 <NA> now the idea of that at medical school this is a recurring theme isn 't it me and medical school would have been ridiculous <unk> but it 's an absolute reality today
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 579.96 585.25 <NA> <unk> and i see this as the cornerstone of regeneration repair and hope <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 585.18 591.1 <NA> and whilst we 're on the theme of hope for those of you who might have failed at school there 's hope for you as well
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 591 596.8 <NA> <unk> because this is the school report of john gerdon [ i believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist on his present showing this is quite ridiculous ] so they didn 't think much of him then 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 596.34 601.54 <NA> but what you may not know is that he got the nobel prize for medicine just three months ago <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 602.01 604.28 <NA> so to return to the original problem
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 604.96 612.39 <NA> <unk> what is the opportunity of these stem cells or this disruptive technology for repairing the damaged brain <unk> which we call regenerative neurology <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 612.39 618.41 <NA> i think there are two ways you can think about this as a fantastic 21st century drug discovery tool 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 618.07 624.77 <NA> and or as a form of therapy so i want to tell you a little bit about both of those in the next few moments 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 625.12 628.5 <NA> drug discovery in a dish is how people often talk about this
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 629.78 637.23 <NA> you take a patient with a disease <unk> let 's say motor neuron disease <unk> you take a skin sample you do the pluripotent
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 637.22 640.11 <NA> reprogramming as i 've already told you 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 640.13 649.36 <NA> and you generate live motor nerve cells that 's straightforward because that 's what pluripotent cells can do but crucially you can then compare their behavior
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 650.25 656.89 <NA> <unk> but healthy counterparts ideally from an unaffected relative that way you 're matching for genetic variation <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 656.73 662.8 <NA> and that 's exactly what we did here this was a collaboration with colleagues in london chris shaw <unk> in the <unk>
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 663.84 665.06 <NA> <unk> and tom maniatis 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 665.06 674.92 <NA> and what you 're looking at and this is amazing these are living growing motor nerve cells from a patient with motor neuron disease it happens to be an inherited form i mean
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 675.07 678.65 <NA> <unk> just imagine that this would have been unimaginable ten years ago <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 678.34 687.72 <NA> so apart from seeing them grow and put out processes we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce <unk> but crucially we can then track their individual health
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 687.54 693.65 <NA> and compare the diseased motor nerve cells to the healthy ones <unk> and when you do all that
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 693.4 702.83 <NA> and put it together <unk> you realize that the diseased ones which is represented in the red line are two and a half times more likely to die
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 702.46 704.19 <NA> than the healthy counterpart
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 705.38 711.49 <NA> and the crucial point about this is that you then have a fantastic assay to discover drugs <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 711.25 717.64 <NA> because what would you ask of the drugs and you could do this through a high throughput automated screening system 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 717.64 724.8 <NA> you 'd ask the drugs give me one thing find me a drug that will bring the red line closer to the blue line <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 724.49 729.97 <NA> because that drug will be a high value candidate that you could probably take direct
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 729.99 739.3 <NA> <unk> to human trial and almost bypass that bottleneck that i 've told you about in drug discovery with the animal models if that makes sense it
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 738.9 740.77 <NA> 's fantastic <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 740.49 749.89 <NA> but i want to come back to how you might use stem cells directly to repair damage <unk> and again there are two ways to think about this <unk> and they 're not mutually exclusive 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 750.58 756.74 <NA> <unk> and i think in the long run the one that will give us the biggest dividend but it 's not thought of that way just yet 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 756.46 762.02 <NA> is to think about those stem cells that are already in your brain and i 've told you that 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 761.65 771.9 <NA> all of us have stem cells in the brain <unk> even the diseased brain <unk> and surely the smart way forward is to find ways that you can promote and activate those stem cells in your brain already
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 771.74 779.13 <NA> to react and respond appropriately to damage to repair it that will be the future there will be drugs that will do that
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 780.53 781.65 <NA> <unk> but the other way
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 781.45 790.95 <NA> is to effectively parachute in cells <unk> transplant them in to replace dying or lost cells <unk> even in the brain <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 790.67 799.87 <NA> and i want to tell you now an experiment it 's a clinical trial that we did which recently completed <unk> which is with colleagues in ucl david miller in
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 801.9 807.22 <NA> <unk> so this study was very simple we took patients with multiple sclerosis
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 807 815.47 <NA> and asked a simple question would stem cells from the bone marrow be protective of their nerves <unk> so what we did was we took this bone marrow <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 815.43 824.8 <NA> grew up the stem cells in the lab <unk> and then injected them back into the vein i 'm making this sound really simple <unk> it took five years off a lot of people 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 825.52 829.46 <NA> <unk> and it put gray hair on me and caused all kinds of issues <unk> but
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 829.15 831.74 <NA> conceptually it 's essentially simple 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 832.12 835.52 <NA> so we 've given them into the vein <unk> right <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 835.48 842.9 <NA> so in order to measure whether this was successful or not we measured the optic nerve as our outcome measure 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 842.41 850.1 <NA> and that 's a good thing to measure in m s because patients with <unk> m s sadly suffer with problems with vision loss of vision <unk> unclear vision 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 850.06 854.97 <NA> and so we measured the size of the optic nerve using the scans with david miller three
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 855.02 858.25 <NA> <unk> times twelve months six months and before the infusion
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 858.04 861.45 <NA> and you can see the gently declining red line <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 861.08 868.45 <NA> and that 's telling you that the optic nerve is shrinking which makes sense because their nerves are dying we then gave the stem cell infusion
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 868.09 871.68 <NA> and repeated the measurement twice three months and six months
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 871.68 879.76 <NA> and to our surprise almost the line 's gone up that suggests that the intervention has been protective
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 880.08 886.21 <NA> i don 't think myself that what 's happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 885.84 894.02 <NA> what i think they 've done is they 've promoted the endogenous stem cells or precursor cells to do their job wake up lay down new myelin <unk> 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 894.02 896.26 <NA> so this is a proof of concept i 'm
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 896.01 898.24 <NA> very excited about that 
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 898.5 904.94 <NA> so i just want to end with the theme i began on which was regeneration and hope <unk> so here i 've asked john
SiddharthanChandran_2013G 1 SiddharthanChandran_2013G 905.22 907.02 <NA> what his hopes are for the future
