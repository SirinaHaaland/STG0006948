MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 17.1 24.72 <NA> whatever life throws at us whether it 's cancer diabetes heart disease or even broken bones we want to try and get better 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 24.72 29.76 <NA> now i 'm head of a biomaterials lab and i 'm really fascinated by the way that
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 29.75 33.75 <NA> <unk> humans have used materials in really creative ways in the body
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 33.35 42.19 <NA> over time <unk> take for example <unk> this beautiful blue nacre shell this was actually used by the mayans as an artificial
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 41.95 43.95 <NA> tooth replacement 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 43.85 52.05 <NA> we 're not quite sure why they did it it 's hard it 's durable <unk> but it also had other very nice properties 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 52.28 54.76 <NA> in fact when they put it into the jawbone
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 55.02 57.49 <NA> <unk> could integrate into the jaw <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 57.54 70.54 <NA> and we know now with very sophisticated imaging technologies that part of that integration comes from the fact that this material is designed in a very specific way has a beautiful chemistry has a beautiful architecture <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 70.23 78.86 <NA> and i think in many ways we can sort of think of the use of the blue nacre shell and the mayans as the first real application of the bluetooth technology
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 80.65 81.98 <NA> but
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 81.94 85.98 <NA> if we if we move on and think throughout history how people have
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 85.77 94.97 <NA> used different materials in the body <unk> very often it 's been physicians that have been quite creative they 've taken things off the shelf <unk> one of my favorite examples
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 94.97 96.44 <NA> is that of
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 96.7 99.45 <NA> sir harold ridley who was a famous
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 100.64 102.99 <NA> <unk> at least became a famous ophthalmologist 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 102.99 113.91 <NA> and during world war ii what he would see would be pilots coming back from their missions and he noticed that within their eyes they had shards of small bits of material lodged within the eye <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 113.6 120.15 <NA> but the very interesting thing about it was that material actually wasn 't causing any inflammatory response <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 119.69 127.74 <NA> so he looked into this and he figured out that actually that material was little shards of plastic that were coming from the canopy of the spitfires <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 127.74 129.97 <NA> and this led him to propose that material
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 130.1 139.69 <NA> as a new material for intraocular lenses it 's called pmma and it 's now used in millions of people every year and helps in preventing cataracts <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 139.29 149.62 <NA> and that example i think is a really nice one because it helps remind us that in the early days people often chose materials because they were <unk> bioinert their very purpose <unk>
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 149.52 154.94 <NA> <unk> was to perform a mechanical function you 'd put them in the body and you wouldn 't get an adverse response
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 155.1 165.8 <NA> and what i want to show you is that in regenerative medicine we 've really shifted away from that idea of taking a bioinert material we 're actually actively looking for materials that will be bioactive <unk>
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 165.75 174.02 <NA> that will interact with the body and that furthermore we can put in the body they 'll have their function <unk> and then they 'll dissolve away over time
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 175.61 186.09 <NA> <unk> if we look at this schematic this is showing you what we think of as the typical tissue engineering approach <unk> we have cells there <unk> typically from the patient we can put those onto a material <unk>
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 186.04 198.57 <NA> and we can make that material very complex if we want to and we can then grow that up in the lab or we can put it straight back into the patient <unk> and this is an approach that 's used all over the world <unk> including in our lab <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 204.84 216.49 <NA> <unk> cells can be many different things and they want to be many different things and so we want to make sure that the environment we put them into has enough information so that they can become the right sort of specialist tissue <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 216.66 227.12 <NA> and if we think about the different types of tissues that people are looking at regenerating all over the world in all the different labs in the world there 's pretty much every tissue you can think of 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 227.12 229.97 <NA> and actually the structure of those tissues is quite different
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 230.04 235.79 <NA> and it 's going to really depend on whether your patient has any underlying disease other conditions 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 235.93 246.68 <NA> in terms of how you 're going to regenerate your tissue and you 're going to need to think about the materials you 're going to use really carefully <unk> their biochemistry their mechanics and many other properties as well 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 247.96 254.16 <NA> our tissues all have very different abilities to regenerate and here we see poor prometheus <unk> who made a rather
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 254.87 256.51 <NA> <unk> tricky career choice
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 256.27 259.06 <NA> and was punished by the greek gods 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 259.06 268 <NA> he was tied to a rock <unk> and an eagle would come every day to eat his liver but of course his liver would regenerate every day <unk> and so day after day he was punished
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 267.77 274.56 <NA> for eternity by by the gods <unk> and
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 274.58 279.91 <NA> liver will regenerate in this very nice way but actually if we think of other tissues like cartilage
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 279.96 288.34 <NA> <unk> example even the simplest nick and you 're going to find it really difficult to regenerate your cartilage <unk> so it 's going to be very different from tissue to tissue 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 288.24 300.22 <NA> now bone is somewhere in in between and this is one of the tissues that we work on a lot in our lab <unk> and bone is actually quite good at repairing it has to be we 've probably all had fractures at some point or other 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 300 304.94 <NA> and one of the ways that you can think about repairing your fracture is this procedure here
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 304.9 310.61 <NA> <unk> called an <unk> iliac crest harvest <unk> and what the surgeon might do is is take some bone from
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 310.15 312.8 <NA> your iliac crest which is just here <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 312.8 322.25 <NA> and then transplant that somewhere else in the body and it actually works really well because it 's your own bone and it 's well vascularized which means it 's got a really good blood supply <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 321.88 324.87 <NA> but the problem is there 's only so much you can take
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 325.1 326.55 <NA> <unk> and also
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 326.12 333.81 <NA> when you do that operation your patients might actually have significant pain in that defect site even two years after the operation <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 333.59 337.3 <NA> so what we were thinking is there 's a tremendous need
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 337.11 339.61 <NA> for bone repair of course but this
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 341.51 352.71 <NA> <unk> really has a lot of limitations to it and could we perhaps recreate the generation of bone within the body on demand and then be able to transplant it without these
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 352.25 354.04 <NA> very very painful
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 355.38 359.77 <NA> <unk> aftereffects that you would have with the iliac crest harvest <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 359.73 368.53 <NA> and so this is what we did <unk> and the way we did it was by coming back to this typical tissue engineering approach but actually thinking about it rather differently <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 368.13 379.94 <NA> and we simplified it a lot so we got rid of a lot of these steps we got rid of the need to harvest cells from the patient <unk> we got rid of the need to put in really fancy chemistries <unk> and we got rid of the need to culture these
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 379.87 382.07 <NA> <unk> scaffolds in the lab <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 381.76 387.44 <NA> and what we really focused on was our material system and making it quite simple
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 387.44 399.99 <NA> but because we used it in a really clever way we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone using this approach <unk> so we were using the body as really the catalyst to help us to make lots of new bone
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 401.15 410.33 <NA> <unk> and it 's an approach that we call the in vivo bioreactor and we were able to make enormous amounts of bone using this approach <unk> and i 'll talk you through this so what we do
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 410.34 419.74 <NA> is in humans we all have a layer of stem cells on the outside of our long bones that layer is called the periosteum and that layer is actually normally
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 419.55 429.91 <NA> very very tightly bound to the underlying bone <unk> and it 's got stem cells in it those stem cells are really important in the embryo when it develops <unk> and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture to help you
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 430.02 431.95 <NA> <unk> repairing the bone <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 431.88 441.97 <NA> so we take that periosteum layer and we developed a way to inject underneath it a liquid that then within thirty seconds would turn into quite a rigid gel <unk>
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 441.92 448.75 <NA> and can actually lift the periosteum away from the bone <unk> so it creates in essence an artificial cavity
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 454.87 460.46 <NA> <unk> cells <unk> and we go in through a pinhole incision so that no other cells from the body can get in 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 460.06 470.24 <NA> and what happens is that that artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells and they can form lots of new tissue <unk>
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 470.19 475.37 <NA> and then over time you can harvest that tissue and use it elsewhere in the body <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 480.55 492.4 <NA> essentially what we see is is very large amounts of bone so in this picture you can see the middle of the leg so the bone marrow then you can see the original bone and you can see where that original bone finishes 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 492.4 499.5 <NA> and just to the left of that is the new bone that 's grown within that bioreactor cavity and you can actually make it even larger <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 499.43 504.97 <NA> and that demarcation that you can see between the original bone and the new bone acts
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 504.93 514.81 <NA> <unk> as a very slight point of weakness <unk> so actually now the surgeon can come along can harvest away that new bone and the periosteum can grow back <unk> so you 're left with the leg
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 514.5 520.97 <NA> in the same sort of state as if you hadn 't operated on it in the first place so it 's very very low in terms of
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 522.08 524.78 <NA> compared to an iliac crest harvest
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 526.42 533.09 <NA> <unk> and you can grow different amounts of bone depending on how much gel you put in there so it really is an on demand sort of procedure 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 532.75 537.35 <NA> now at the time that we did this this received a lot of
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 537.31 544.79 <NA> attention in the press because it was a really nice way of generating new bone and we got many many contacts
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 544.33 549.93 <NA> from different people that were interested in using this and i 'm just going to tell you sometimes
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 556.22 566.82 <NA> <unk> most interesting let me put it that way contact that i had was actually from a team of american footballers that all wanted to have double thickness skulls made
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 567.05 569.34 <NA> on on their
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 569.03 578.41 <NA> head <unk> and so you you do get these kinds of contacts and of course being british and also growing up in france i tend to be very
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 578.41 579.97 <NA> blunt <unk> and so
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 579.96 588.91 <NA> <unk> i had to explain to them very nicely that in their particular case there probably wasn 't that much in there to protect in the first place 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 590.61 600.17 <NA> applause so this was our approach and it was simple materials but we thought about it carefully <unk> and actually we know that those cells in the in the body in the embryo as they develop
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 600.1 601.15 <NA> <unk> can form
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 600.87 603.2 <NA> a different kind of tissue cartilage <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 602.97 612.47 <NA> and so we developed a gel that was slightly different in nature and slightly different chemistry put it in there <unk> and we were able to get one hundred percent cartilage instead <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 612.47 616.49 <NA> and this approach works really well i think for pre planned procedures
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 616.45 622.1 <NA> <unk> but it 's something you do have to pre plan so for other kinds of operations 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 622.1 625.88 <NA> there 's definitely a need for other scaffold based approaches 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 626.14 629.91 <NA> and when you think about designing those other scaffolds
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 629.87 636.6 <NA> <unk> actually you need a really <unk> multi disciplinary team <unk> and so our team has chemists it has cell biologists surgeons 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 636.29 643.8 <NA> physicists even and those people all come together and we think really hard about designing the materials but we want to make them
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 643.46 650.05 <NA> have enough information that we can get the cells to do what we want but not be so complex as to make it difficult to
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 651.6 661.18 <NA> <unk> and so one of the things we think about a lot is is really trying to understand the structure of the tissues in the body <unk> and so if we think of bone <unk> obviously
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 660.75 662.92 <NA> my own favorite tissue 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 662.43 675.05 <NA> we zoom in we can see even if you don 't know anything about bone structure it 's beautifully organized really beautifully organized we 've lots of blood vessels in there <unk> and if we zoom in again we see that the cells are actually surrounded by a 3d
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 677.32 680.09 <NA> <unk> and they give a lot of information to the cells 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 679.9 691.61 <NA> and if we zoom in again actually in the case of bone the matrix around the cells is beautifully organized at the nano scale and it 's a hybrid material that 's part organic part inorganic <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 691.12 697.25 <NA> and that 's led to a whole field really that has looked at developing materials that have this hybrid
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 696.79 704.97 <NA> kind of structure <unk> and so i 'm showing here just two examples where we 've made some materials that have that sort of structure
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 704.99 708.24 <NA> <unk> and you can really tailor it you can see here a very squishy one
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 708.05 718.17 <NA> and now a material that 's also this hybrid sort of material but actually has remarkable toughness and it 's no longer brittle <unk> and an inorganic material would normally be really brittle <unk>
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 718.12 729.31 <NA> <unk> and you wouldn 't be able to have that sort of strength and toughness in it one other thing i want to quickly mention is that many of the scaffolds we make are porous and they have to be because you want blood vessels to grow in there <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 729.93 739.34 <NA> <unk> are actually oftentimes much bigger than the cells and so even though it 's 3d the cell might see it more as a slightly curved surface and that 's a little bit unnatural <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 739.34 753.34 <NA> and so one of the things you can think about doing is actually making scaffolds with slightly different dimensions that might be able to surround your cells in 3d and give them a little bit more information and there 's a lot of work going on in both of these areas 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 753.21 754.97 <NA> now finally i just want
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 754.96 764.52 <NA> <unk> to talk a little bit about applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease because this is a really big clinical problem and
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 764.28 771.15 <NA> one of the things that we know is that unfortunately if you have a heart attack then that tissue can start
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 771.15 774.93 <NA> to die <unk> and your outcome may not be very good
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 776 783.15 <NA> <unk> and it would be really great actually if we could stop that dead tissue either from dying or help it to regenerate <unk> 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 783.35 795.99 <NA> and there 's lots and lots of stem cell trials going on worldwide and they use many different types of cells but one common theme that seems to be coming out is that actually very often those cells will die once you 've implanted them 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 795.99 798.9 <NA> and you can either put them into the heart or into the
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 798.47 804.97 <NA> blood system but either way we don 't seem to be able to get quite the right number of cells getting to
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 804.93 809.41 <NA> <unk> the location we want them to and being able to deliver the sort of
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 809.31 813.04 <NA> beautiful cell regeneration that we would like
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 813.04 820.91 <NA> to have to get good good clinical outcomes <unk> and so some of the things that we 're thinking of and many other people
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 820.67 829.76 <NA> in the field are thinking of are actually developing materials for that but there 's a difference here we still need chemistry we still need mechanics we still need
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 830.11 834.45 <NA> <unk> really interesting topography and we still need really interesting ways to surround the cells 
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 834.45 842.09 <NA> but now the cells also would probably quite like a material that 's going to be able to be conductive <unk> because
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 841.78 849.96 <NA> the cells themselves will respond very well and will actually conduct signals between themselves you can see them now
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 851.51 854.47 <NA> <unk> on these materials and that 's a very very exciting
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 854.47 862.26 <NA> development that 's going on so just to wrap up i 'd like to actually say that
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 861.98 866.88 <NA> being able to work in this this sort of field all of us that work in this field that 's
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 866.39 870.73 <NA> not only super exciting science but also has the potential
MollyStevens_2013G 1 MollyStevens_2013G 870.73 879.1 <NA> to impact on patients however big or small they are is really a great privilege and so for that i 'd like to thank all
