DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 357.45 367.12 <NA> now it 's important to remember that you 're only hearing the human audible parts of dolphin sounds and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds and we use special equipment in the water to collect these sounds <unk> 
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 366.84 375.38 <NA> now researchers have actually measured whistle complexity using information theory <unk> and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages

DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 395.83 400.11 <NA> now one way to crack the code is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean

DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 414.65 418.26 <NA> now <unk> scientists have used keyboard interfaces

DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 438.87 443.63 <NA> and one of the reasons we thought we could do this is because the dolphins were starting to show us
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 443.45 449.96 <NA> a lot of mutual curiosity they were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations and our postures and they were also

DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 452.47 461.3 <NA> now dolphins are social mammals so they love to play <unk> and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed or sargassum in this case around 
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 461.71 467.27 <NA> and they 're very adept they like to drag it and drop it from appendage to appendage <unk>

DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 491.39 499.99 <NA> 'll often sink vertically in the water and they 'll have a little sargassum on their flipper and they 'll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes on the bottom
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 501 509.87 <NA> <unk> have a little seaweed keep away game but when we don 't dive down and get it they 'll bring it to the surface and they 'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 509.69 514.06 <NA> and drop it for us like they do their calves <unk> and then we 'll pick it up and have a game <unk> 
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 513.93 522.95 <NA> and so we started thinking well wouldn 't it be neat to build some technology that would allow the dolphins to request these things in real time their favorite toys 
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 522.95 529.7 <NA> so the original vision was to have a keyboard hanging from the boat attached to a computer and the divers and dolphins would activate the
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 530.05 539.33 <NA> <unk> on the keypad and happily exchange information and request toys from each other but we quickly found out that dolphins simply were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 539.98 553.95 <NA> <unk> they 've got better things to do in the wild they might do it in captivity but in the wild so we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water and we labeled four objects they like to play with the scarf rope sargassum and also had a bow ride which is a fun activity for a
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 555.02 564.75 <NA> <unk> and that 's the scarf whistle which is also associated with a visual symbol <unk> and these are artificially created whistles they 're outside the dolphin 's normal repertoire <unk>

DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 592.2 597.1 <NA> 've just played the rope key and that 's the request for the toy from the human 
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 597.18 604.73 <NA> so i 've got the rope i 'm diving down and i 'm basically trying to get the dolphin 's attention because they 're kind of like little kids you have to keep their
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 606.1 609.26 <NA> i 'm going to drop the rope see if they come over

DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 626.98 629.22 <NA> might actually understand what that means
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 632.42 634.47 <NA> that 's the rope whistle

DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 643.28 644.88 <NA> this is only once
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 644.88 649.63 <NA> we don 't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles <unk> okay so here 's a second
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 649.42 654 <NA> second toy in the water this is a scarf toy and i 'm trying to lead the dolphin over to the keyboard
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 653.63 654.76 <NA> to show her
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 654.96 660.97 <NA> the visual and the acoustic signal <unk> now this dolphin we call her the scarf thief 
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 661.26 666.58 <NA> because over the years she 's absconded with about twelve scarves in
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 666.93 670.54 <NA> fact we think she has a boutique somewhere in the bahamas <unk> 
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 671.04 679.97 <NA> so i 'm reaching over she 's got the scarf on her right side <unk> and we try to not touch the animals too much we really don 't want to over habituate them <unk> and i 'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 680.2 684.2 <NA> and the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 684 690.98 <NA> to request the scarf so i try to give her the scarf whoop almost lost it
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 691.39 700.26 <NA> <unk> but this this is the moment where everything becomes possible the dolphin 's at the keyboard you 've got full attention <unk> and this sometimes went on for hours

DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 710.1 714.4 <NA> and because of this we really decided we needed some more sophisticated technology 
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 714.21 722.64 <NA> so we joined forces with georgia tech with thad starner 's wearable computing group to build us an underwater wearable computer that we 're calling chat [ chat cetacean hearing and telemetry ]
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 722.69 725.11 <NA> now instead of pushing a keyboard through the water

DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 741.27 750.26 <NA> the computer can localize who requested the toy if there 's a word match and the real power of the system is in the real time sound recognition
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 750.22 753.59 <NA> <unk> so we can respond to the dolphins quickly and accurately 
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 753.19 761.19 <NA> and we 're at prototype stage but this is how we hope it will play out so diver a and diver b both have a wearable computer
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 760.83 768.8 <NA> and the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle the diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water but also as a word through bone conduction 
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 768.31 776.7 <NA> so diver a plays the scarf whistle or diver b plays the sargassum whistle to request a toy from whoever has it what we hope will happen
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 776.52 779.97 <NA> is that the dolphin mimics the whistle <unk> and if diver a has the
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 779.93 782.08 <NA> <unk> sargassum if that 's the sound that was
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 781.84 790.38 <NA> played and requested then the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin and they 'll swim away happily into the sunset playing

DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 809.19 822.79 <NA> but as we decode their natural sounds we 're also planning to put those back into the computerized system for example <unk> right now we can put their own signature whistles in the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin 
DeniseHerzing_2013 1 DeniseHerzing_2013 822.39 825.16 <NA> likewise we can create
