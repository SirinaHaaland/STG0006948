CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 883.23 889.33 <NA> if we don 't have crop diversity because i challenge you to think of
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 889.29 893.65 <NA> an effective <unk> efficient <unk> sustainable
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 893.22 900.14 <NA> solution to climate change if we don 't have crop diversity because quite literally
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 901.06 907.79 <NA> <unk> agriculture doesn 't adapt to climate change <unk> neither will we and if crops don 't adapt
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 907.36 912.56 <NA> to climate change <unk> neither will agriculture <unk> neither will we 
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 912.37 924.44 <NA> so this is not something pretty and nice to do there are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist just for the existence value of it it is i agree a nice thing to do <unk> 
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 927.2 929.04 <NA> <unk> a very real sense
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 929.24 935.33 <NA> i believe that we as an international community should get organized to complete the task <unk> 
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 935.34 942.3 <NA> the svalbard global seed vault is a wonderful gift that norway and others have given us <unk> but it 's not the complete answer 
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 941.81 949.95 <NA> we need to collect the remaining diversity that 's out there <unk> we need to put it into good seed banks that can offer
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 949.85 954.67 <NA> those seeds to researchers in the future <unk> we need to catalog it it 's a library of life
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 955.05 963.37 <NA> <unk> now i would say we don 't have a card catalog for it and we need to support it financially my big idea would be that
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 963.17 971.2 <NA> while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university 
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 970.71 974.32 <NA> we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 975.31 977.55 <NA> <unk> thirty million dollars in an endowment
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 977.34 985.94 <NA> would take care of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever <unk> so we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms 
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 985.93 988.79 <NA> and my final thought is that
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 989.26 997.58 <NA> we of course <unk> by conserving wheat rice potatoes and the other crops we may 
CaryFowler_2009G 1 CaryFowler_2009G 997.58 1000.05 <NA> quite simply end up saving
