PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 41.23 48.18 <NA> is this view that national borders really don 't matter very much anymore
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 47.75 54.97 <NA> cross border integration is close to complete and we live in one world and what 's interesting
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 55.14 58.84 <NA> <unk> about this view is again it 's a view that 's held by <unk>
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 60.08 65.77 <NA> like tom friedman from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted <unk> but it 's also held by <unk>

PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 76.09 80.63 <NA> the other thing i would add is that this is not a new view <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 80.47 89.64 <NA> i 'm a little bit of an amateur historian <unk> so i 've spent some time going back trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 89.64 93.36 <NA> and the best earliest quote that i could find
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 93.2 97.02 <NA> was one from david livingstone writing in the
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 98.46 99.66 <NA> about how the

PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 109.04 114.36 <NA> now clearly <unk> david livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 113.93 123.33 <NA> <unk> but it does seem useful to ask ourselves just how global are we before we think about where we go from here <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 123.14 125.05 <NA> so the best way
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 125 126.19 <NA> i 've found
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 126.02 134.48 <NA> of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat <unk> may not even be close to flat 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 134.48 140.15 <NA> is with some data <unk> so one of the things i 've been doing over the last few years
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 139.79 147.86 <NA> is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders <unk>

PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 165.44 174.05 <NA> one kind of flow of people one kind of flow of capital and of course trade in products and services <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 173.59 174.84 <NA> so let 's start
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 181.7 186.91 <NA> <unk> in the world last year what percentage do you think
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 186.73 193.41 <NA> were accounted for by cross border phone calls pick a percentage in your own mind the
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 194.36 198.48 <NA> answer turns out to be two percent <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 197.99 204.94 <NA> if you include internet telephony you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 205.01 209.5 <NA> <unk> but it 's nowhere near what people tend to estimate <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 209.49 214.06 <NA> or let 's turn to people moving across borders 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 214.05 219.38 <NA> one particular thing we might look at in terms of long term flows of people 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 219.38 224.9 <NA> is what percentage of the world 's population is accounted for by
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 231.52 236.75 <NA> turns out to be a little bit higher it 's actually about three percent <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 236.47 244.79 <NA> or think of investment take all the real investment that went on in the world in two thousand and ten 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 244.78 246.96 <NA> what percentage of that
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 246.79 250.14 <NA> was accounted for by foreign direct investment
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 255.44 261.69 <NA> <unk> and then finally <unk> the one statistic that i suspect many of the people in this room have seen the <unk>
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 262.94 270.33 <NA> <unk> ratio if you look at the official statistics they typically indicate a little bit above thirty percent <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 269.84 275.02 <NA> however <unk> there 's a big problem with the official statistics
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 275.34 285.61 <NA> <unk> in that if for instance a japanese component supplier ships something to china to be put into an ipod and then the ipod gets shipped <unk>

PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 305.25 311.45 <NA> what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of gdp <unk> without the <unk>
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 312.91 321.17 <NA> and it 's actually probably a bit under twenty percent <unk> rather than the thirty percent plus numbers that we 're talking about 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 321.01 329.34 <NA> so it 's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that i talk about in my book
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 329.81 334.02 <NA> <unk> point zero that we 're very very far from the <unk>

PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 363.78 368.11 <NA> on what they actually guess these numbers to be 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 368.04 376.01 <NA> let me share with you the results of a survey that harvard business review was kind enough to run of its readership
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 375.77 379.97 <NA> as to what people 's guesses along these dimensions
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 380.25 381.86 <NA> actually were 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 382.39 388.55 <NA> so a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 388.3 393.32 <NA> first of all there is a suggestion of some error okay 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 395.71 404.28 <NA> second these are pretty large errors for four quantities whose average value is less than ten percent
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 404.9 413.61 <NA> <unk> people guessing three four times that level even though i 'm an economist i find that a pretty large error <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 413.63 415.44 <NA> and third 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 415.24 419.73 <NA> this is not just confined to the readers of the harvard business review 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 419.53 424.3 <NA> i 've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 424.3 429.94 <NA> and in all cases except one where a group actually underestimated
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 431.55 435.77 <NA> <unk> ratio people have this tendency towards overestimation 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 435.56 441.84 <NA> and so i thought it important to give a name to this and that 's what i refer to as globaloney <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 441.84 448.03 <NA> the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 447.87 449.78 <NA> especially because i
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 450 463.16 <NA> i suspect some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims i think it 's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney a
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 462.97 466.1 <NA> couple of different reasons come to mind <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 465.91 472.29 <NA> first of all there 's a real dearth of data in the debate let me give you an example <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 472.29 478.79 <NA> when i first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called foreign policy 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 478.45 479.97 <NA> one of the people who wrote
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 480.05 483.96 <NA> <unk> in not entirely in agreement was tom friedman <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 483.89 489.78 <NA> and since my article was titled why the world isn 't flat that wasn 't too surprising 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 490.7 495.51 <NA> what was very surprising to me was tom 's critique <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 495.51 499.68 <NA> which was ghemawat 's data are narrow 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 499.85 504.94 <NA> and this caused me to scratch my head because as i went back through his
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 505.92 513.55 <NA> <unk> book <unk> i couldn 't find a single figure <unk> chart table <unk> reference or footnote <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 513.48 520.06 <NA> so my point is i haven 't presented a lot of data here to convince you that i 'm right 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 520.06 528.17 <NA> but i would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 530.02 534.74 <NA> <unk> insights that we 've been bombarded with actually are correct <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 534.34 542.18 <NA> so dearth of data in the debate is one reason a second reason has to do with peer pressure <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 542.2 551.24 <NA> i remember <unk> i decided to write my why the world isn 't flat article because i was being interviewed on tv in mumbai <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 551.02 554.79 <NA> and the interviewer 's first question to me was

PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 556.61 560.91 <NA> why do you still believe that the world is round 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 560.57 566.4 <NA> and i started laughing <unk> because i hadn 't come across that formulation before 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 565.94 575.17 <NA> laughter and as i was laughing i was thinking i really need a more coherent response especially on national tv i 'd better write something about
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 576.18 579.02 <NA> <unk> but what i can 't quite capture for you
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 578.78 581.78 <NA> was the pity and disbelief
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 581.57 585.13 <NA> with which the interviewer asked her question <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 584.88 589.22 <NA> the perspective was here is this poor professor <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 589.22 599.72 <NA> he 's clearly been in a cave for the last twenty thousand years <unk> he really has no idea as to what 's actually going on in the world

PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 665.79 671.83 <NA> and i got this question often enough that i thought i 'd better do some research on facebook <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 671.34 676.81 <NA> because in some sense it 's the ideal kind of technology to think about

PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 697.48 699.81 <NA> the answer is probably
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 705.86 714.39 <NA> <unk> so we don 't live in an entirely local or national world but very very far from the ninety five percent level that you would expect <unk> 
PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 713.9 720.76 <NA> and the reason 's very simple we don 't <unk> or i hope we don 't <unk> form friendships at random

PankajGhemawat_2012G 1 PankajGhemawat_2012G 813.9 828.01 <NA> avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization
