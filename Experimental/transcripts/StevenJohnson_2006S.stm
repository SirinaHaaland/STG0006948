StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 31.01 37.51 <NA> to one thousand eight hundred and fifty four in london for the next few minutes and tell the story
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 37.27 41.2 <NA> in brief of this of this outbreak <unk> which in many ways <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 41.2 49.93 <NA> i think helped create the world that we live in today and particularly the kind of city that we live in today this period in one thousand eight hundred and fifty four in the middle part of the 19th
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 50.19 52.99 <NA> <unk> in london 's history is incredibly interesting
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 52.98 56.83 <NA> for a number of reasons but i think the most important one is that
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 56.4 59.77 <NA> london was this city of two point five million people 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 59.31 69.35 <NA> and it was the largest city on the on the face of the planet at that point but it was also the largest city that had ever been built <unk> and so the victorians were trying to
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 69.18 74.99 <NA> live through and and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living this scale of living that we
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 80.01 82.04 <NA> in many ways at this point in the <unk>
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 83.19 85.19 <NA> a complete disaster 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 85.24 92.06 <NA> they were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis with an elizabethan public infrastructure 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 91.93 96.05 <NA> so people for instance just to gross you out for a second
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 96.52 100.11 <NA> had cesspools of human waste in their basement
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 100.58 104.67 <NA> <unk> a foot to two feet deep <unk> and they would just kind of
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 104.5 110.22 <NA> throw the buckets down there and hope that it would somehow go away and of course it never really would go away
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 111.15 120.31 <NA> and all of this stuff basically had accumulated to the point where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in it was an amazingly smelly city
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 120.07 129.49 <NA> <unk> not just because of the cesspools but also the the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people not just the horses but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk that they would
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 129.96 135.97 <NA> <unk> up there and keep them in the attic until until literally their milk ran out and they died and then they would drag them off
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 135.57 145 <NA> to the bone boilers down the street so you would just walk around london at this point and just be overwhelmed with this
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 144.54 154.07 <NA> with this stench <unk> and what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 154.84 163.97 <NA> <unk> everybody that was creating these diseases that would wipe through the city every three or four years and cholera was really the great killer of this period it arrived in london in <unk>
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 165.09 168.77 <NA> and every four or five years another epidemic would take
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 168.37 173.27 <NA> ten thousand twenty thousand people in london and and throughout the <unk> u k 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 172.78 178.7 <NA> and so the authorities became convinced that this this smell was this problem we had to get rid of the smell
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 178.48 179.91 <NA> <unk> and so in fact
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 179.98 185.94 <NA> they concocted a couple of early you know founding public health interventions in the system of the city 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 185.51 192.22 <NA> one of which was called the nuisances act which they got everybody as far as they could to empty out their cesspools
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 191.86 192.86 <NA> and
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 192.7 202.41 <NA> just pour all that waste into the river because if we get it out of the streets it 'll smell much better <unk> and oh right we drink from the river
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 202.43 204.85 <NA> <unk> so what ended up happening actually
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 205.04 214.85 <NA> is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera because as we now know cholera is actually in the water it 's a waterborne disease not something that 's in the air it 's not something you smell
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 214.67 221.09 <NA> or inhale it 's something you ingest <unk> and so one of the founding moments of public health in in the 19th century
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 221.09 228.68 <NA> effectively poisoned the water supply of london much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing so
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 230.05 237.11 <NA> <unk> was the state of london in one thousand eight hundred and fifty four and in the middle of all this carnage and
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 236.74 245.21 <NA> offensive conditions <unk> and in the midst of all this scientific confusion about what was actually killing people it was a very

StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 250.43 258.08 <NA> <unk> who was a local doctor in soho in london who had been arguing for about four or five years that cholera was in fact a waterborne disease
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 258.09 265.03 <NA> <unk> and had basically convinced nobody of this the public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 264.79 265.96 <NA> and
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 265.77 279.91 <NA> he 'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies but nothing had really stuck and part of what 's so interesting about this story to me is is that in some ways it 's a great case study in how cultural change happens how a good idea eventually comes
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 279.92 288.51 <NA> to win out over over much worse ideas <unk> and snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored <unk> and then on one day <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 288.51 290.29 <NA> august 28th of <unk>
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 291.72 297.76 <NA> a young child a five month old girl whose first name we don 't know we know her only as baby lewis

StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 305.13 306.71 <NA> this is the map that
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 306.31 314.83 <NA> becomes the central focus in the second half of my book it 's in the middle of soho in this working class neighborhood this little girl becomes sick
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 314.61 323.25 <NA> and it turns out that the cesspool that they still continue to have despite the nuisances act <unk> bordered on an extremely popular
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 323.25 329.91 <NA> water pump local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of soho that all the residents from soho and the surrounding
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 329.87 334.63 <NA> <unk> neighborhoods would go to and so this little girl inadvertently ended up
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 334.63 341.4 <NA> contaminating the water in this popular pump <unk> and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 341.33 351.01 <NA> of england erupted about two or three days later <unk> literally ten percent of the neighborhood died in in seven days and much more would have died if people hadn 't fled after the
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 355.22 364.12 <NA> terrifying event you had these scenes of entire families dying over the course of forty eight hours of cholera <unk> alone in their one room apartments
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 363.63 369.89 <NA> in their little flats <unk> just an extraordinary terrifying scene snow
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 369.89 379.7 <NA> lived near there <unk> heard about the outbreak and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast because he thought an outbreak that concentrated could actually
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 379.69 382.52 <NA> <unk> potentially end up convincing people
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 382.52 392.57 <NA> that in fact the real menace of cholera was was in the water supply and and not in the air he suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 392.2 400.17 <NA> involve a single point source one single thing that that everybody was going to because it didn 't have the traditional slower path
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 400.4 408.82 <NA> <unk> of infections that you might expect <unk> and so he went right in there and and started interviewing people he eventually enlisted the the help
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 408.64 412.25 <NA> of of this amazing other figure who 's kind of the other protagonist of the book
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 412.09 419.7 <NA> this guy henry whitehead who was a local minister who was not at all a man of science <unk> but was incredibly socially connected he knew everybody in the neighborhood <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 419.69 426.84 <NA> and he managed to track down whitehead did many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump or who hadn 't drunk water from the pump <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 426.59 429.42 <NA> and eventually snow made
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 428.97 429.97 <NA> a map
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 430.19 431.51 <NA> of the outbreak
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 431.3 437.78 <NA> he found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick people who hadn 't drunk from the pump were not getting sick 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 437.57 447.97 <NA> and he thought about representing that as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods people who hadn 't you know percentages of people who hadn 't but eventually he hit upon the idea that what he needed was something that you could <unk>
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 447.87 454.94 <NA> <unk> see something that would take in a sense a higher level view of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood <unk> and so he created this
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 455.01 458.18 <NA> this map <unk> which basically
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 457.9 463.49 <NA> ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods as black bars at each address 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 463.09 470.45 <NA> and you can see in this map the pump right at the center of it and you can see that one of the residences down the way had about fifteen people dead 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 470.29 476.63 <NA> and the map is actually a little bit bigger as you get further and further away from the pump the deaths begin to
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 476.14 479.07 <NA> grow less and less frequent <unk> and so you can see this
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 480.38 484.98 <NA> <unk> something poisonous emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 484.52 491.79 <NA> and so with the help of this map and with the help of more evangelizing that he did over the next few years and that whitehead did 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 491.79 498.72 <NA> eventually actually the authorities slowly started to come around it took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story but by <unk>
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 500.7 508.54 <NA> <unk> when the next big cholera outbreak came to london the authorities had been convinced in in part because of this story in part because of this map
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 508.5 517.04 <NA> that in fact the water was the problem <unk> and they had already started building the sewers in london and they immediately went to this outbreak and they told everybody to start boiling their water 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 517.04 522.31 <NA> and that was the last time that london has seen a cholera outbreak since 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 522.24 524.96 <NA> so part of this story i think well it 's a terrifying
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 525.22 530.84 <NA> <unk> a very dark story and it 's a story that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 530.41 540.86 <NA> <unk> it 's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic which is to say that it 's possible to solve these problems if we listen to reason if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps <unk>
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 540.81 548.24 <NA> if we listen to people like snow and whitehead if we listen to the locals who understand what 's going on in in these kinds of situations <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2006S 1 StevenJohnson_2006S 550.67 554.83 <NA> <unk> the idea of large scale metropolitan living a sustainable one
