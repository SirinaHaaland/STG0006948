CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 29.89 35.45 <NA> now when humans think about sex male and female forms are generally what come to mind

CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 58.07 68.41 <NA> <unk> now invariably you 're probably thinking about what belongs to our own species these very familiar structures but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal <unk>

CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 112.69 121.36 <NA> and the tapir has a prehensile penis it actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands <unk> 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 121.15 125.08 <NA> and it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 125.04 129.71 <NA> <unk> and deposit sperm directly into the female 's uterus not to mention
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 129.71 136.52 <NA> it 's a pretty good size the biggest penis in the animal kingdom however is not that of the tapir the biggest

CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 169.36 178.8 <NA> but of course that doesn 't exactly happen and that 's because we can 't just take form into account we have to think about function as well <unk> and when it comes to sex
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 179.78 187.63 <NA> <unk> relates to the contributions made by the gametes or the sperm and the eggs <unk> and these contributions are far from equal 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 187.63 195.03 <NA> eggs are very expensive to make so it makes sense for females to be very choosy about who she shares them with 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 194.9 198.15 <NA> sperm on the other hand is abundant
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 197.72 201.57 <NA> and cheap <unk> so it makes more sense for males to have a <unk>

CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 218.55 228.28 <NA> then it makes more sense for her to spend her time doing other biologically relevant things <unk> avoiding predators taking care of offspring <unk> gathering and ingesting food

CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 245.29 254.94 <NA> males have a spiked barbed penis that they literally stab into the female and they don 't stab it anywhere near her vagina they stab

CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 260.99 268.23 <NA> if a female gets too many stab wounds or if a stab wound happens to become infected she can actually die from it <unk> 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 268.34 274.66 <NA> now if you 've ever been out for a nice peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 274.66 279.97 <NA> you 've undoubtedly been alarmed <unk> because it looks like gang rape <unk> and quite frankly that
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 279.96 285.44 <NA> <unk> 's exactly what it is a group of males will grab a female hold her down and

CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 298.8 304.91 <NA> now the female actually gets the last laugh though because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 304.87 309.74 <NA> <unk> allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries now 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 309.97 319.34 <NA> i like to share stories like this with my audiences because yeah we humans we tend to think sex sex is fun sex is good there 's romance and there 's orgasm <unk>
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 319.29 325.14 <NA> but orgasm didn 't actually evolve until about sixty five million years ago with the advent of mammals but
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 329.93 332.01 <NA> <unk> pleasing one 's partner
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 331.7 337.23 <NA> earwig males have either really large penile appendages or really small ones it
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 337.06 347.15 <NA> 's a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different those that have long penile appendages are not bigger or stronger or otherwise any different at all 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 347.15 354.91 <NA> so going back to our biological minds then we might think that females should choose to have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 355.02 360.89 <NA> <unk> because she can use her time for other things avoiding predators taking care of young <unk> finding and ingesting food <unk> 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 360.89 369.25 <NA> but biologists have repeatedly observed that females choose to have sex with the males that have the long appendages <unk> 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 369.36 374.75 <NA> why do they do this well according to the biological literature during
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 375.4 385.46 <NA> <unk> the genitalia of certain males may elicit more favorable female responses through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction with the female reproductive tract mm hm 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 388.81 397.14 <NA> these are mexican guppies and what you see on their upper maxilla is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments and these filaments basically form
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 397.09 405 <NA> <unk> a fish mustache if you will <unk> now males have been observed to prod the female 's genital opening prior to copulating
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 405.02 409.16 <NA> <unk> with her <unk> and in what i have lovingly termed the magnum p i hypothesis 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 409.17 416.13 <NA> females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found with males that have these fish mustaches a
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 416.72 425.5 <NA> little guppy porn for you right there so we 've seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 425.32 429.97 <NA> winning a female partner we 've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 430.07 441.61 <NA> are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex we 've also seen a titillation strategy where males are actually pleasing their female partners into choosing them as a sex partner <unk> 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 441.18 446.48 <NA> now unfortunately in the animal kingdom it 's the coercion strategy that we see
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 446.27 450.05 <NA> time and time again <unk> it 's very common in many
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 450.49 456.02 <NA> <unk> from invertebrates to avian species mammals and of course <unk> even in primates <unk> 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 455.68 466.01 <NA> now interestingly there are a few mammalian species in which females have evolved specialized genitalia that doesn 't allow for sexual coercion to take place 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 466.78 475.17 <NA> female elephants and female hyenas have a penile clitoris or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 475.79 482.46 <NA> <unk> much like a penis <unk> and in fact it 's very difficult to sex these animals by merely looking at their external morphology <unk> 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 482.33 491.7 <NA> so before a male can insert his penis into a female 's vagina she has to take this penile clitoris and basically inside out it in her own body <unk> 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 491.69 499.23 <NA> i mean imagine putting a penis into another penis it 's simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action <unk> 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 499.04 504.97 <NA> now even more interesting is the fact that elephant and hyena societies are entirely matriarchal
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 505.25 512.21 <NA> <unk> they 're run by females groups of females sisters <unk> aunts and offspring <unk> and when young males
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 512 515.5 <NA> attain sexual maturity <unk> they 're turfed out of the group 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 515.13 524.78 <NA> in hyena societies adult males are actually the lowest on the social scale they can take part in a kill only after everybody else 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 526.33 532.88 <NA> <unk> so it seems that when you take the penis power away from a male you take away all the social power he has 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 533.8 545.39 <NA> so what are my <unk> take home messages from my talk today well sex is just so much more than insert part a into slot b and hope that the offspring run around everywhere <unk> 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 545.14 550.73 <NA> the sexual strategies and reproductive structures that we see in the animal kingdom basically
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 551.11 554.88 <NA> dictate how males and females will react to each other
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 555.02 559.47 <NA> <unk> which then dictates how populations and societies form and evolve <unk> 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 558.98 567.24 <NA> so it may not be surprising to any of you that animals including ourselves spend a good amount of time thinking about sex <unk> 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 566.87 576.39 <NA> but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it <unk> 
CarinBondar_2013G 1 CarinBondar_2013G 575.96 578.2 <NA> so thank you and happy daydreaming
