GarrettLisi_2008 1 GarrettLisi_2008 1204.93 1213.67 <NA> <unk> it would be ca the size of the e8 shape how does that relate to the electron i feel like i need that for my picture is it bigger is it smaller gl as far as we know electrons are point particles
GarrettLisi_2008 1 GarrettLisi_2008 1213.39 1220.36 <NA> so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales <unk> so the way these things are explained in quantum field theory
GarrettLisi_2008 1 GarrettLisi_2008 1220.17 1228.46 <NA> is all possibilities are expanding and developing at once and this is why i use the analogy to coral and

GarrettLisi_2008 1 GarrettLisi_2008 1229.87 1231.11 <NA> <unk> way 
GarrettLisi_2008 1 GarrettLisi_2008 1231.49 1238.67 <NA> the way that e8 comes in is it will be as a shape that 's attached at each point in the space time 
GarrettLisi_2008 1 GarrettLisi_2008 1238.81 1247.22 <NA> and as i said the way the shape twists the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface
GarrettLisi_2008 1 GarrettLisi_2008 1246.88 1249.99 <NA> is what the elementary particles are themselves
GarrettLisi_2008 1 GarrettLisi_2008 1261.8 1262.85 <NA> <unk> it doesn 't really matter
GarrettLisi_2008 1 GarrettLisi_2008 1262.74 1272.11 <NA> it 's evoking a kind of sense of wonder and i certainly want to understand more of this but thank you so much for coming that was absolutely fascinating
