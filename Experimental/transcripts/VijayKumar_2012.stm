VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 17.23 23 <NA> <unk> good morning i 'm here today to talk about autonomous flying
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 22.57 29.79 <NA> beach balls no agile aerial robots like this one i 'd like to tell you a little bit about the
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 29.72 38.32 <NA> <unk> challenges in building these and some of the terrific opportunities for applying this technology <unk> so these robots are related to
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 38.08 40.83 <NA> unmanned aerial vehicles 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 40.4 49.38 <NA> however the vehicles you see here are big <unk> they weigh thousands of pounds are not by any means agile <unk> they 're not even autonomous 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 50.43 53.68 <NA> <unk> many of these vehicles are operated by flight crews
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 53.51 58.3 <NA> that can include multiple pilots <unk> operators of sensors 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 58.17 60.58 <NA> and mission coordinators 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 60.18 67.58 <NA> what we 're interested in is developing robots like this and here are two other pictures of robots that you can buy off the shelf <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 67.58 70.75 <NA> so these are helicopters with four rotors <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 70.71 79.94 <NA> and they 're roughly a meter or so in scale <unk> and weigh several pounds <unk> and so we retrofit these with sensors and processors
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 79.98 87.53 <NA> and these robots can fly indoors <unk> without gps <unk> the robot i 'm holding in my hand is this one 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 87.31 93.02 <NA> and it 's been created by two students <unk> alex and daniel <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 92.71 101.84 <NA> so this weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound <unk> it consumes about fifteen watts of power and as you can see it 's about eight inches in diameter <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 102.55 104.97 <NA> so let me give you just a very quick
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 105.13 112.77 <NA> tutorial on how these robots work <unk> so it has four rotors if you spin these rotors at the same speed the robot hovers <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 112.7 116.67 <NA> if you increase the speed of each of these rotors 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 116.36 124.69 <NA> then the robot flies up <unk> it accelerates up of course if the robot were tilted <unk> inclined to the horizontal then it would accelerate in this
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 126.54 129.74 <NA> <unk> to get it to tilt there 's one of two ways of doing it 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 129.74 137.2 <NA> so in this picture you see that rotor four is spinning faster and rotor two is spinning slower and when that happens 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 136.71 140.95 <NA> there 's a moment that causes this robot to roll <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 140.79 150.16 <NA> and the other way around if you increase the speed of rotor three and decrease the speed of rotor one then the robot pitches forward <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 150.06 154.7 <NA> and then finally <unk> if you spin opposite pairs of rotors
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 155.23 158.94 <NA> <unk> than the other pair <unk> then the robot yaws about the vertical axis <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 158.73 165.78 <NA> so an on board processor essentially looks at what motions need to be executed and combines these motions <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 165.78 172.82 <NA> and figures out what commands to send to the motors six hundred times a second <unk> that 's basically how this thing operates <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 172.45 179.34 <NA> so one of the advantages of this design is when you scale things down the robot naturally becomes agile
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 179.87 186.15 <NA> <unk> so here r is the characteristic length of the robot it 's actually half the diameter <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 185.84 191.34 <NA> and there are lots of physical parameters that change as you reduce r 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 191.18 199.96 <NA> the one that 's most important is the inertia or the resistance to motion <unk> so it turns out the inertia <unk> which governs angular
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 200.76 208.42 <NA> <unk> scales as a fifth power of r so the smaller you make r <unk> the more dramatically the inertia reduces <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 208.2 211.49 <NA> so as a result the angular acceleration <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 211.49 220.21 <NA> denoted by the greek letter alpha here <unk> goes as one over r it 's inversely proportional to r the smaller you make it the more quickly you can turn <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 220.47 225.04 <NA> so this should be clear in these videos on the bottom right you see a robot
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 224.85 225.92 <NA> performing a
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 229.84 231.95 <NA> <unk> flips a little more time <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 232.54 244.13 <NA> so here the processes on board are getting feedback from accelerometers and gyros on board and calculating like i said before commands at six hundred times a second to stabilize this robot <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 244.13 252.5 <NA> so on the left you see daniel throwing this robot up into the air <unk> and it shows you how robust the control is no matter how you throw it the robot recovers
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 252.01 253.83 <NA> and comes back to him
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 255.56 265.41 <NA> <unk> so why build robots like this well robots like this have many applications you can send them inside buildings like this as first responders
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 265.07 274.84 <NA> to look for intruders <unk> maybe look for biochemical leaks <unk> gaseous leaks <unk> you can also use them for applications like
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 282.21 291.25 <NA> <unk> tell you a little bit more about this the robots can be used for transporting cargo <unk> so one of the problems with these small robots
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 290.94 296.92 <NA> is their <unk> payload carrying capacity <unk> so you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 297.03 304.88 <NA> this is a picture of a recent experiment we did actually not so recent anymore in sendai <unk> shortly after the earthquake so
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 304.78 314.45 <NA> <unk> robots like this could be sent into collapsed buildings to assess the damage after natural disasters or sent into reactor buildings to map radiation levels
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 315.79 325.16 <NA> so one fundamental problem that the robots have to solve if they are to be autonomous is essentially figuring out how to get from point a to point <unk> b 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 325.15 329.73 <NA> so this gets a little challenging because the dynamics of this robot are quite
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 329.69 337.98 <NA> <unk> complicated in fact they live in a <unk> 12 dimensional space <unk> so we use a little trick we take this curved 12 dimensional space <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 337.67 350.05 <NA> and transform it into a flat four dimensional space and that four dimensional space consists of x y z and then the yaw angle <unk> and so what the robot does is it plans what we call
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 352.86 358.24 <NA> <unk> so to remind you of physics you have position derivative velocity <unk> then acceleration <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 357.87 360.4 <NA> and then comes jerk <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 360.03 365.32 <NA> and then comes snap <unk> so this robot minimizes snap <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 365.32 372.97 <NA> so what that effectively does is produce a smooth and graceful motion <unk> and it does that avoiding obstacles <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 372.54 378.62 <NA> so these minimum snap trajectories in this flat space are then transformed back into this complicated
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 379.96 383.3 <NA> <unk> which the robot must do for control and then execution <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 383.05 393.23 <NA> so let me show you some examples of what these minimum snap trajectories look like <unk> and in the first video you 'll see the robot going from point a to point b through an intermediate point <unk>
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 400.07 407.91 <NA> <unk> the robot is obviously capable of executing any curve trajectory so these are circular trajectories where the robot pulls about two g 's 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 409.1 410.98 <NA> here you have overhead
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 410.8 419.4 <NA> motion capture cameras on the top that tell the robot where it is one hundred times a second <unk> it also tells the robot where these obstacles are <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 419.39 429.46 <NA> and the obstacles can be moving and here you 'll see daniel throw this hoop into the air <unk> while the robot is calculating the position of the hoop and trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 430.23 437.89 <NA> so as an academic we 're always trained to be able to jump through hoops to raise funding for our labs <unk> and we get our robots to do that 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 444.66 449.99 <NA> so another thing the robot can do is it remembers pieces of trajectory that it
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 452.11 460.67 <NA> <unk> so here you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum and then changes its orientation and then recovers <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 460.21 467.63 <NA> so it has to do this because this gap in the window is only slightly larger than the width of the robot <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 467.26 475.08 <NA> so just like a diver stands on a springboard and then jumps off it to gain momentum <unk> and then does this pirouette this two and a half
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 475 485.85 <NA> somersault through and then gracefully recovers this robot is basically doing that so it knows how to combine little bits and pieces of trajectories to do these fairly difficult tasks <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 486.29 492.36 <NA> so i want change gears so one of the disadvantages of these small robots is its size <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 491.96 498.45 <NA> and i told you earlier that we may want to employ lots and lots of robots to overcome the limitations of size <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 498.23 500.41 <NA> so one difficulty
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 500.22 504.94 <NA> is how do you coordinate lots of these robots <unk> and so here we looked to nature
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 504.98 507.17 <NA> so i want to show you a clip of
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 506.99 512.12 <NA> aphaenogaster desert ants in professor stephen pratt 's lab <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 512.12 519.29 <NA> carrying an object so this is actually a piece of fig actually you take any object coated with fig juice and the ants will carry it back to the nest
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 518.81 523.13 <NA> <unk> so these ants don 't have any central coordinator 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 523.13 529.97 <NA> they sense their neighbors there 's no explicit communication <unk> but because they sense the neighbors and because they sense the object
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 530.28 533.99 <NA> <unk> they have implicit coordination across the group <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 533.68 540.96 <NA> so this is the kind of coordination we want our robots to have so when we have a robot
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 540.77 549.96 <NA> which is surrounded by neighbors and let 's look at robot i and robot j what we want the robots to do is to monitor the separation between them as they fly
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 551.21 561.39 <NA> <unk> and then you want to make sure that this separation is within acceptable levels <unk> so again the robots monitor this error and calculate the control commands one <unk>
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 561.29 569.59 <NA> <unk> hundred times a second <unk> which then translates into motor commands six hundred times a second <unk> so this also has to be done in a decentralized way 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 580.07 584.75 <NA> their actions only on local information what they sense from their neighbors 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 584.75 592.96 <NA> and then finally we insist that the robots be agnostic to who their neighbors are <unk> so this is what we call anonymity <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 593.49 595.99 <NA> so what i want to show you next
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 595.68 604.97 <NA> is a video of twenty of these little robots flying in formation <unk> they 're monitoring their neighbors
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 604.75 613.61 <NA> <unk> neighbors ' positions they 're maintaining formation the formations can change <unk> they can be planar formations they can be three dimensional formations 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 613.6 619 <NA> as you can see here <unk> they collapse from a three dimensional formation into planar formation <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 619 624.08 <NA> and to fly through obstacles they can adapt the formations on the fly <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 624.28 628.26 <NA> so again these robots come really close together as you can see in this
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 629.84 632.1 <NA> <unk> come within inches of each other 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 631.67 638.88 <NA> and despite the aerodynamic interactions with these propeller blades <unk> they 're able to maintain stable flight 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 645.44 653.77 <NA> so once you know how to fly in formation you can actually pick up objects cooperatively so this just shows that we can double triple
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 655.02 658.79 <NA> <unk> robots ' strength by just getting them to team with neighbors as you can see here 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 658.79 665.65 <NA> one of the disadvantages of doing that is as you scale things up so if you have lots of robots carrying the same thing <unk>
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 666.77 671.71 <NA> increasing the inertia <unk> and therefore you pay a price <unk> they 're not as agile <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 671.28 679.73 <NA> but you do gain in terms of payload carrying capacity <unk> another application i want to show you again this is in our lab this is work done by quentin lindsey
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 679.93 686.36 <NA> <unk> a graduate student <unk> so his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 685.87 687.75 <NA> cubic structures
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 687.54 693.18 <NA> from truss like elements <unk> so his algorithm tells the robot
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 693.18 700.02 <NA> what part to pick up when and where to place it so in this video you see and it 's sped up ten fourteen
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 700.73 711.24 <NA> <unk> you see three different structures being built by these robots and again everything is autonomous <unk> and all quentin has to do is to give them a blueprint of the design that he wants to build 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 713.15 721.38 <NA> so all these experiments you 've seen thus far all these demonstrations have been done with the help of motion capture systems
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 721.16 723.7 <NA> <unk> so what happens when you leave
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 723.54 729.97 <NA> your lab and you go outside into the real world and what if there 's no gps <unk> so this
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 729.99 736.6 <NA> <unk> robot is actually equipped with a camera and a laser rangefinder laser scanner <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 736.44 750.05 <NA> and it uses these sensors to build a map of the environment what that map consists of are features like doorways <unk> windows <unk> people <unk> furniture and it then figures out where its position
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 750 758.57 <NA> with respect to the features so there is no global coordinate system <unk> the coordinate system is defined based on the robot where it is and what it 's looking at 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 758.83 762.68 <NA> and it navigates with respect to those features <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 762.55 768.38 <NA> so i want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by frank shen and professor nathan michael 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 768.38 774.98 <NA> that shows this robot entering a building for the very first time <unk> and creating this map on the fly <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 774.82 779.94 <NA> so the robot then figures out what the features are it builds the map it figures out
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 779.93 782.58 <NA> <unk> where it is with respect to the features <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 782.38 790.32 <NA> and then estimates its position one hundred times a second <unk> allowing us to use the control algorithms that i described to you earlier <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 790.32 795 <NA> so this robot is actually being commanded remotely by frank 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 794.57 798.66 <NA> but the robot can also figure out where to go on its own <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 798.65 804.85 <NA> so suppose i were to send this into a building and i had no idea what this building looked like i can ask this robot to go in
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 804.84 806.38 <NA> <unk> create a map <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 806.37 809.71 <NA> and then come back and tell me what the building looks like <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 809.22 819.73 <NA> so here the robot is not only solving the problem of how to go from point a to point b in this map <unk> but it 's figuring out what the best point b is at every time <unk>
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 819.68 827.17 <NA> <unk> so essentially it knows where to go to look for places that have the least information and that 's how it populates this map <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 829.63 831.11 <NA> <unk> application <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 831.28 834.39 <NA> and there are many applications of this technology <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 834.15 841 <NA> i 'm a professor and we 're passionate about education robots like this can really change the way we do k 12 education <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 841 844.77 <NA> but we 're in southern california <unk> close to los angeles <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 844.53 848.42 <NA> so i have to conclude with something focused on entertainment 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 848.68 854.97 <NA> i want to conclude with a music video i want to introduce the creators <unk> alex and daniel <unk> who created this video
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 862.13 867.39 <NA> so before i play this video i want to tell you that they created it in the last three days 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 866.9 869.29 <NA> after getting a call from chris <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 869.29 877.35 <NA> and the robots that play in the video are completely autonomous <unk> you will see nine robots play six different instruments <unk> 
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 877.07 879.97 <NA> and of course it 's made exclusively for ted two thousand and twelve
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 879.69 882.02 <NA> <unk> twelve let 's watch
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 911.11 916.17 <NA> <unk> live
VijayKumar_2012 1 VijayKumar_2012 981.25 982.8 <NA> <unk> watch
