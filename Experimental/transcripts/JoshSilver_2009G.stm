JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 40.4 49.41 <NA> but it looks like i 'm guessing that it 'll be about sixty percent of the room because that 's roughly the fraction
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 49.76 54.94 <NA> of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 55.77 59.38 <NA> the world health organization

JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 79.9 81.05 <NA> <unk> eyewear
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 80.68 85.1 <NA> is around half of any population <unk> 
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 85.06 89.3 <NA> and the problem of poor vision

JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 95.17 99.81 <NA> and it 's an economic problem <unk> and it 's a quality of life
JoshSilver_2009G 1 JoshSilver_2009G 102.41 111.73 <NA> <unk> not very expensive they 're quite plentiful the problem is there aren 't enough eye care professionals
