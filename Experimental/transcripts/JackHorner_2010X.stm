JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 245.83 252.08 <NA> a light went on in somebody 's head dr peter dodson at the university of

JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 313.57 320.82 <NA> so this was a problem and peter dodson pointed this out using some duck billed dinosaurs
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 320.82 329.76 <NA> then called hypacrosaurus and he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it

JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 341.57 350.05 <NA> <unk> sixty five percent had no crest at all so this was interesting so this is this is where people

JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 356.43 361.18 <NA> gone on with that then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have

JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 367.05 371.62 <NA> they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different 
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 371.64 379.82 <NA> now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur or any animal is a young one or an older one

JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 447.5 454.94 <NA> what i want to do is show you these in north america in the northern plains of the united states and the southern

JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 548.71 554.19 <NA> people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are pachycephalosaurus has a big

JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 594.57 603.79 <NA> but they did look at these three and they said these are three different dinosaurs and dracorex is probably the most primitive of them and the other one is
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 603.72 604.97 <NA> more primitive than the
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 604.93 608.24 <NA> <unk> other it 's unclear to me how they
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 608.05 615.08 <NA> actually sorted these three of them out but if you line them up if you just take those three skulls and just line them up 
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 615.08 621.99 <NA> they line up like this dracorex is the littlest one <unk> stygimoloch is the middle size one <unk> 
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 621.76 625.19 <NA> pachycephalosaurus is the largest one and one would think

JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 630.28 634.23 <NA> laughter but it didn 't give them a clue because 
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 634.7 639.84 <NA> well we know why <unk> scientists like to name things so
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 640.16 647.76 <NA> if we cut open dracorex i cut open our dracorex and look it was spongy inside <unk> 
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 647.78 650.05 <NA> really spongy inside <unk> i mean

JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 653.66 665.41 <NA> so it is going to get bigger if you cut open stygimoloch it is doing the same thing the dome that little dome is growing really fast it 's inflating very fast 
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 665.04 666.95 <NA> what 's interesting is
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 666.77 676.46 <NA> the spike on the back of the dracorex was growing very fast as well the spikes on the back of the stygimoloch are actually resorbing <unk> which means they 're getting smaller
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 676.22 679.97 <NA> as that dome is getting bigger and if we look at pachycephalosaurus
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 680.43 683.96 <NA> <unk> pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 683.83 685.05 <NA> and
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 684.87 689.9 <NA> its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing <unk> so
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 689.9 698.42 <NA> just with these three dinosaurs as a scientist we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 697.96 699.87 <NA> of the same animal <unk>
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 719.3 724.5 <NA> <unk> of course means we have ten primary dinosaurs to deal with

JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 804.84 814.18 <NA> <unk> do on the pachycephalosaurs <unk> and then because the juveniles are in my collection i cut them open 
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 814.53 823.81 <NA> and look inside <unk> and the little one is really spongy <unk> and the middle size one is really spongy but what was interesting was
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 823.65 829.58 <NA> the adult triceratops was also spongy and this is a skull that is two meters long
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 830.14 837.35 <NA> <unk> it 's a big skull <unk> but there 's another dinosaur that is found in this formation
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 837.1 843.65 <NA> that looks like a triceratops <unk> except it 's bigger and it 's called torosaurus 
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 843.46 849.96 <NA> and torosaurus when we cut into it has mature bone <unk> but it 's got these big holes in its
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 851.57 858.21 <NA> <unk> a triceratops and a torosaurus can 't possibly be the same animal because one of them 's bigger than the other one 
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 862.04 864.48 <NA> and it has holes in its frill and
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 864.53 871.03 <NA> i said well do we have any juvenile torosauruses and they said well no but
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 870.85 875.05 <NA> it has holes in its frill so one of my graduate students
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 876.93 885.59 <NA> <unk> looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in triceratops and 
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 885.59 890.51 <NA> of course it 's open in torosaurus so he found the transitional ones
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 890.33 899.45 <NA> between triceratops and torosaurus <unk> which was pretty cool <unk> so now we know that torosaurus is actually a grown up
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 902.38 911.69 <NA> <unk> when we name dinosaurs <unk> when we name anything the original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out so
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 911.41 920.16 <NA> torosaurus is extinct <unk> triceratops if you 've heard the news a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong they thought
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 920.16 923.73 <NA> torosaurus should be kept and triceratops thrown out but that 's not going to
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 943.55 945.36 <NA> <unk> here 's another one <unk> so
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 945.35 954.97 <NA> we look at the bone histology the bone histology tells us that edmontosaurus is a juvenile or at least a subadult and the other one is
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 954.75 959.5 <NA> <unk> is is an adult and we have an ontogeny and
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 959.76 962.62 <NA> we get rid of anatotitan 
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 962.88 970.7 <NA> so we can just keep doing this and the last one is t rex so there 's these two dinosaurs
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 984.07 993.78 <NA> <unk> they had a good question they were looking at them and they said one 's got seventeen teeth and the biggest one 's got twelve teeth and that doesn 't make any sense at all because we don 't know of any dinosaurs that
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 993.78 996.66 <NA> gain teeth as they get older so
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 996.44 999.44 <NA> it must be true they must be different 
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1000.64 1008.42 <NA> <unk> so we cut into them and sure enough nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1007.93 1011.42 <NA> the bigger one has more mature bone it
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1011.08 1018.29 <NA> looks like it could still get bigger and at the museum of the rockies where we work <unk> i have four t rexes so
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1017.95 1022.88 <NA> i can cut a whole bunch of them <unk> but i didn 't have to cut any of them really because
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1022.39 1029.91 <NA> i just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had twelve teeth and the next smallest one
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1029.87 1038.76 <NA> <unk> had thirteen and the next smallest had fourteen and of course nano has seventeen and we just went out and looked at other people 's collections and we found one that
JackHorner_2010X 1 JackHorner_2010X 1038.6 1045.21 <NA> has sort of fifteen teeth <unk> so again <unk> real easy to say that
