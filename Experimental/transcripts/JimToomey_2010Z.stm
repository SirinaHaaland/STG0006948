JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 30.71 39.21 <NA> and if you spend enough time doodling sooner or later something happens all your career options run out so you have to
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 39.11 44.91 <NA> make a living cartooning actually i fell in love with the ocean when i was a little boy when i was about eight or nine
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 44.57 49.56 <NA> and i was particularly fascinated with sharks this is some of my early work
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 50.21 52.96 <NA> eventually my mom took the red crayon away so
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 54.9 60.58 <NA> <unk> but i 'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 60.15 70 <NA> and it 's become the foundation of my work because i feel like if if in a day i can see the ocean differently then i can evoke that same kind of change in others especially kids
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 69.6 77.86 <NA> before that day this is how i saw the ocean it 's just a big blue surface and this is how we 've seen the ocean since the beginning of time
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 77.52 78.8 <NA> it 's a mystery
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 79.99 81.68 <NA> <unk> 's been a lot of folklore
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 81.88 92.31 <NA> developed around the ocean mostly negative and that prompted people to make maps like this with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land but when you get to the waters edge
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 92.31 97.46 <NA> the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint and this is the way i saw the ocean at school
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 97.36 99.84 <NA> as if to say all geography and science

JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 103.34 109.45 <NA> but that day i flew low over the islands it was a family trip to the caribbean and i flew in a small plane low over the islands
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 109.45 112.68 <NA> this is what i saw i saw hills and valleys
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 113 115.53 <NA> i saw forests and meadows
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 115.52 124.93 <NA> i saw grottoes and secret gardens and places i 'd love to hide as a kid if i could only breathe underwater and best of all i saw the animals i saw a manta ray that
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 125.16 132.85 <NA> <unk> big as the plane i was flying in and i flew over a lagoon with a shark in it and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 132.78 139.9 <NA> so from that day on i was an ordinary kid walking around on dry land but my head was down there underwater
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 139.44 143.95 <NA> up until that day these were the animals that were most common in my life
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 144.06 146.56 <NA> these were the ones i 'd like to draw

JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 161.47 167.87 <NA> i 'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier and the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 167.86 172.4 <NA> and this enormous humpback whale was like something out of a science fiction movie
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 172.42 179.49 <NA> whenever i talk to kids i always like to tell them the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive it 's not a dinosaur it 's a whale

JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 188.3 196.56 <NA> so if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like that 's what a dinosaur looks like so you have living dinosaurs
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 196.46 204.91 <NA> and space aliens animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions it 's just incredible no hollywood designer could come up

JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 236.11 241.82 <NA> try a little drawing so i 'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 243.43 249.63 <NA> i love to draw the deep sea fish because they are so ugly but beautiful in their own way

JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 356.22 359.14 <NA> i 'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 363.84 366.28 <NA> and then i 'm going to attempt

JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 467.5 475.77 <NA> i have a hermit crab named hawthorne who doesn 't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab so he kind of wishes he were a great white shark
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 485 488.76 <NA> and then i 'll introduce you to one more character
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 489.05 494.43 <NA> this guy ernest who is basically a juvenile delinquent in a fish body
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 496.22 504.07 <NA> so with characters you can make stories sometimes making a story is as easy as putting two characters in a room
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 505.05 509.71 <NA> <unk> and seeing what happens so imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 511.02 518.47 <NA> or sometimes i take them to places that people have never heard of because they 're underwater for instance i took them skiing in the mid atlantic range which is this
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 518.07 520.93 <NA> range of mountains in the middle of the atlantic
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 520.83 529.85 <NA> i 've taken them to the sea of japan where they met giant jellyfish i 've taken them camping in the kelp forests of california this next one here i did a story
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 529.87 536.45 <NA> <unk> on the census of marine life and that was a lot of fun because as most of you know it 's a real project we 've heard about
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 536.89 542.36 <NA> but it was a chance for me to introduce readers to a lot of crazy undersea characters
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 542.11 546.65 <NA> so we start off the story with ernest who volunteers as a census taker
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 546.49 549.71 <NA> he goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 549.88 555 <NA> then he meets the yeti crab the famous vampire squid elusive hard to
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 554.96 564.81 <NA> <unk> find and the dumbo octopus which looks so much like a cartoon in real life that really didn 't have to change a thing when i drew it i did another story on marine debris
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 564.8 570.06 <NA> i was speaking to a lot of my friends in the conservation business and they
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 569.57 574.84 <NA> i asked them so what 's what 's one issue you would like everyone to know more about and they they
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 575.79 579.13 <NA> <unk> this one friend of mine said i 've got one word for you plastic
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 579.66 584.56 <NA> and i told him well i need something a little sexier than that plastic just is not going to do it
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 584.16 591.91 <NA> we sort of worked things out he wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride which doesn 't really work in voice balloons very well i couldn 't fit them in
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 591.45 595.04 <NA> so what i did was i made an adventure strip basically
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 595.04 604.46 <NA> this bottle travels a long way what i 'm trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn 't really go away it just continues to wash downstream and a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 605.59 611.36 <NA> which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it especially if they can 't stand each other like these two
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 611.86 613.37 <NA> so
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 613.42 615.71 <NA> i sent them to boise idaho
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 615.76 622.67 <NA> where they dropped a plastic bottle into the boise sewer system and it ended up in the boise river
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 623.05 624.87 <NA> and then on to the columbia river
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 625.64 629.23 <NA> <unk> and then to the mouth of the columbia and to the pacific ocean
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 629.23 637.05 <NA> and then on to this place called the great pacific garbage patch which is this giant pacific gyre in the north pacific where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 638.27 640.92 <NA> and then back onto the lagoon
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 641.03 646.41 <NA> so that was basically a buddy story with a plastic bottle following along so
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 646.01 652.53 <NA> a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway but we we really talked about marine debris and plastic
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 652.19 654.82 <NA> in the course of that one the third
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 654.75 662.26 <NA> <unk> storyline i did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult it was on shark finning and i felt really strongly about this issue
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 661.95 665.35 <NA> and i felt like since my main character was a shark
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 665.4 672.67 <NA> the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this now finning is the act of taking a shark
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 672.18 679.82 <NA> cutting the valuable fins off and throwing the live animal back in the water it 's cruel it 's wasteful there 's nothing funny or entertaining
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 680.11 682.55 <NA> <unk> it but i really wanted to take this issue on
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 682.3 691.01 <NA> i had to kill my main character who is a shark we start with sherman in a chinese restaurant who gets a fortune that he 's about to get caught by a trawler
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 690.7 692.36 <NA> which he does
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 693.28 701.19 <NA> and then he dies he gets finned and then he gets thrown overboard ostensibly he 's dead now and so i killed a character that 's been in the newspaper for fifteen years
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 701.19 703.46 <NA> so i got a lot of reader feedback on that one
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 703.06 704.91 <NA> meanwhile the other characters are
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 704.87 712.02 <NA> <unk> talking about shark fin soup i do three or four strips after that where we explore the finning issue and the shark fin soup issue
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 711.68 724.35 <NA> sherman 's up in shark heaven this is what i love about comic strips you know you really don 't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief because if you start with a talking shark readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 724.13 726.12 <NA> you can kind of do anything
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 725.96 729.94 <NA> it becomes a near death experience for sherman meanwhile
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 729.9 736.6 <NA> <unk> ernest finds his fins on the internet there was a real website based in china that actually sold shark fins so i
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 736.26 740.38 <NA> kind of exposed that and he clicks the buy now button
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 740.91 745.15 <NA> and voila next day air they show up and they surgically reattach them
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 744.75 754.4 <NA> i ended that series with a kind of a mail in petition that encouraged our national marine fishery service to force other countries to have a stronger stance with shark management

JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 758.44 765.56 <NA> like to end with a little metaphor here i 've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent mission blue and this is what i came up with
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 765.19 769.55 <NA> imagine you 're in an enormous room and it 's as dark as a cave
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 769.45 775.08 <NA> and you can have anything in that room anything you want but you can 't see anything you 've been given one tool

JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 776.6 784.86 <NA> so you wander around in the darkness and you bump into something and it feels like it 's made of stone it 's big it 's heavy you can 't carry it away so you bang it with your hammer
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 784.58 788.04 <NA> and you break off a piece and you take the piece out into the daylight
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 788.3 791.4 <NA> and you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 791.18 800.05 <NA> so you say to yourself well that 's worth something so you go back into the room and you break this thing to pieces and you haul it away and you find other things and you break that
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 800 809.17 <NA> <unk> up and you haul those away and you 're getting all kinds of cool stuff and you hear other people doing the same thing so you get this sense of urgency like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 808.92 811.03 <NA> and then some yells stop
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 811.14 816.64 <NA> and they turn up the lights and you realize where you are you 're in the louvre
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 818.13 821.65 <NA> and you 've taken all this complexity and beauty
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 822.39 829.52 <NA> and you 've turned it into a cheap commodity and that 's what we 're doing with the ocean and part of what mission blue is about
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 830.32 832.55 <NA> is yelling stop
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 832.96 838.25 <NA> so that each of us explorer scientist cartoonist singer chef
JimToomey_2010Z 1 JimToomey_2010Z 838.09 845.64 <NA> can turn up the lights in their own way and that 's what i hope my comic strip does in a small way that 's why i like what i do thanks for listening
