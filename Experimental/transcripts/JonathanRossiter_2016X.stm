JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 25.15 29.55 <NA> we 'll go to google and this is what we get now <unk> you can see
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 29.98 35.25 <NA> lots of different types of robots <unk> but they 're predominantly humanoid in structure <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 34.88 41.62 <NA> and they look pretty conventional because they 've got plastic they 've got metal they 've got motors and gears and so on 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 41.62 45.18 <NA> some of them look quite friendly <unk> and you could go up and you could hug them <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 44.9 49.69 <NA> some of them not so friendly <unk> they look like they 're straight out of terminator in fact they may well be straight out of
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 51.33 56.44 <NA> <unk> you can do lots of really cool things with these robots you can do really exciting stuff 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 55.95 61.26 <NA> but i 'd like to look at different kinds of robots i want to make different kinds of robots 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 61.27 66.68 <NA> and i take inspiration from the things that don 't look like us <unk> but look like these 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 66.45 79.55 <NA> so these are natural biological organisms and they do some really cool things that we can 't and current robots can 't either <unk> they do all sorts of great things like moving around on the floor they go into our gardens and they eat our crops
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 79.78 89.63 <NA> <unk> they climb trees they go in water they come out of water <unk> they trap insects and digest them <unk> so they do really interesting things they live they breathe <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 89.23 100.62 <NA> they die <unk> they eat things from the environment our current robots don 't really do that <unk> now wouldn 't it be great if you could use some of those characteristics in future robots
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 100.44 103.35 <NA> so that you could solve some really interesting problems
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 103.12 104.97 <NA> i 'm going to look at a couple of problems now
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 104.96 111.04 <NA> <unk> in the environment where we can use the skills and the technologies derived from these animals
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 110.86 117.81 <NA> and from the plants and we can use them to solve those problems <unk> let 's have a look at two environmental problems they
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 117.5 128.31 <NA> 're both of our making this is man interacting with the environment and doing some rather unpleasant things the first one is to do with the pressure of population <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 128.31 129.94 <NA> such is the pressure of population around
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 129.93 140.74 <NA> <unk> world that agriculture and farming is required to produce more and more crops <unk> now to do that <unk> farmers put more and more chemicals onto the land <unk> they put on fertilizers nitrates <unk>

JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 155.55 157.23 <NA> and then when it rains 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 157.23 166.41 <NA> these chemicals go into the water table and in the water table <unk> then they go into streams into lakes into rivers and into the sea 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 166.22 174.51 <NA> now if you put all of these chemicals these nitrates <unk> into those kinds of environments there are organisms in those environments that will be affected by that
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 174.32 179.97 <NA> algae for example algae loves nitrates it loves fertilizer so it will take in all
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 179.93 187.42 <NA> <unk> these chemicals and if the conditions are right it will mass produce it will produce masses and masses of new algae <unk> that 's called a bloom <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 187.42 198.06 <NA> the trouble is that when algae reproduces like this <unk> it starves the water of oxygen as soon as you do that the other organisms in the water can 't survive <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 197.57 200.08 <NA> so what do we do
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 200.1 207.73 <NA> <unk> we try to produce a robot that will eat the algae <unk> consume it and make it safe <unk> so that 's the first problem <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 207.48 212.68 <NA> the second problem is also of our making <unk> and it 's to do with oil pollution <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 212.31 223.21 <NA> now oil comes out of the engines that we use the boats that we use sometimes tankers flush their oil tanks into the sea so oil is released into the sea that way wouldn
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 222.78 229.91 <NA> 't it be nice if we could treat that in some way using robots that could eat the pollution the oil fields have
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 229.87 239.99 <NA> <unk> produced <unk> so that 's what we do we make robots that will eat pollution to actually make the robot we take inspiration from two organisms
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 239.77 245.55 <NA> on the right there you see the basking shark the basking shark is a massive shark it
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 246.91 253.71 <NA> <unk> can swim with it as you can see and the basking shark opens its mouth and it swims through the water <unk> collecting plankton
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 255.02 261.03 <NA> <unk> it does that it digests the food <unk> and then it uses that energy in its body to keep moving 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 260.9 267.75 <NA> so could we make a robot like that like the basking shark that chugs through the water and eats up pollution <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 267.68 276.43 <NA> well <unk> let 's see if we can do that but also we take the inspiration from other organisms i 've got a picture here of a water boatman and the water boatman is really cute 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 276.43 278.53 <NA> when it 's swimming in the water it uses its
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 279.87 287.08 <NA> <unk> push itself forward <unk> so we take those two organisms and we combine them together to make a new kind of robot 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 286.8 295.6 <NA> in fact because we 're using the water boatman as inspiration <unk> and our robot sits on top of the water and it rows <unk> we call it the <unk>
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 296.97 304.43 <NA> <unk> so a row bot is a robot that rows ok so what does it look like here 's some pictures of the
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 304.93 314.9 <NA> <unk> see it doesn 't look anything like the robots we saw right at the beginning google is wrong robots don 't look like that <unk> they look like this <unk> so i 've got the row bot here i
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 314.62 319.76 <NA> 'll just hold it up for you it gives you a sense of the scale <unk> and it doesn 't look anything like the others <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 319.45 324.96 <NA> ok <unk> so it 's made out of plastic and we 'll have a look now at the components that make up the <unk> row bot what
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 328.76 339.09 <NA> <unk> is made up of three parts and those three parts are really like the parts of any organism <unk> it 's got a brain <unk> it 's got a body and it 's got a stomach <unk>
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 339.04 348.22 <NA> <unk> it needs the stomach to create the energy any row bot will have those three components <unk> and any organism will have those three components <unk> so let 's go through them one at a time <unk>
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 355.11 359.98 <NA> <unk> it 's got flippers on the side here paddles that help it move <unk> just like the water boatman <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 359.75 367.61 <NA> it 's got a plastic body but it 's got a soft rubber mouth mouth here and a mouth here it 's got two mouths <unk> why does it have two mouths <unk>
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 367.61 375.08 <NA> one is to let the food go in and the other is to let the food go out <unk> so you can see really it 's got a mouth and a derriere
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 376.33 384.93 <NA> <unk> something where the stuff comes out which is just like a real organism <unk> so it 's starting to look like that basking shark <unk> so that 's the body <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 384.93 395.24 <NA> the second component might be the stomach we need to get the energy into the robot and we need to treat the pollution so the pollution goes in and it will do something <unk>
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 394.78 404.67 <NA> it 's got a cell in the middle here called a microbial fuel cell i 'll put this down and i 'll lift up the fuel cell here <unk> so instead of having batteries instead of having
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 405.23 408.37 <NA> <unk> power system <unk> it 's got one of these this is its stomach <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 408.16 418.59 <NA> and it really is a stomach because you can put energy in this side in the form of pollution <unk> and it creates electricity <unk> so what is it it 's called a microbial fuel cell <unk> it 's a little bit like <unk>
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 418.49 428.83 <NA> <unk> a chemical fuel cell which you might have come across in school or you might 've seen in the news chemical fuel cells take hydrogen and oxygen <unk> and they can combine them together and you get electricity

JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 434 443.2 <NA> this is slightly newer this is a microbial fuel cell <unk> it 's the same principle it 's got oxygen on one side but instead of having hydrogen on the other it 's got some soup <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 443.2 448.97 <NA> and inside that soup there are living microbes <unk> now <unk> if you take some organic material
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 448.74 449.87 <NA> could be some
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 453.19 457.88 <NA> <unk> the microbes will eat that food and they will turn it into electricity 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 457.93 466.28 <NA> not only that but if you select the right kind of microbes <unk> you can use the microbial fuel cell to treat some of the pollution <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 465.91 472.29 <NA> if you choose the right microbes <unk> the microbes will eat the algae <unk> if you use other kinds of

JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 476.93 486.18 <NA> <unk> so you can see how this stomach could be used to not only treat the pollution but also to generate electricity from the pollution <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 485.93 491.14 <NA> so the robot will move through the environment taking food into its stomach 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 491.14 502.57 <NA> digest the food create electricity use that electricity to move through the environment and keep doing this ok <unk> so let 's see what happens when we run the row bot when it does some rowing <unk>
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 502.33 504.34 <NA> here we 've got a couple of videos the first thing
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 505.14 511.3 <NA> <unk> you can see here is the mouth open the front mouth and the bottom mouth open <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 510.81 525.95 <NA> and it will stay opened enough then the robot will start to row forward <unk> it moves through the water so that food goes in as the waste products go out <unk> once it 's moved enough it stops and then it closes the mouth slowly closes the mouths
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 525.76 529.13 <NA> and then it will sit there and it will digest the food
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 530.01 538.58 <NA> of course these microbial fuel cells they contain microbes what you really want is lots of energy coming out of those microbes as quickly as possible 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 538.09 544.1 <NA> but we can 't force the microbes and they generate a small amount of electricity per second they generate <unk>
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 546.15 554.97 <NA> let 's put that into context your mobile phone for example one of these modern ones if you use it it takes about one watt <unk> so that 's a thousand or a million
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 554.93 559.86 <NA> <unk> times as much energy that that uses compared to the microbial fuel cell
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 559.52 572.56 <NA> how can we cope with that <unk> well <unk> when the row bot has done its digestion when it 's taken the food in it will sit there and it will wait until it has consumed all that food that could take some hours <unk> it could take some days <unk>
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 572.56 575.02 <NA> a typical cycle for the
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 575.01 576.4 <NA> <unk> looks like this <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 575.97 581.77 <NA> you open your mouth you move <unk> you close your mouth and you sit there for a while waiting <unk>

JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 586.33 594.94 <NA> but you know what that looks like a real organism doesn 't it it looks like the kind of thing we do saturday night we go out open our mouths <unk> fill our stomachs 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 594.48 597.88 <NA> sit in front of the telly and digest <unk>

JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 611.65 619.52 <NA> <unk> saying this is how much pollution i 've eaten recently or this is the kind of stuff that i 've encountered or this is where i am <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 625.01 634.45 <NA> <unk> if you think about the oil slicks that we saw before or those massive algal blooms what you really want to do is put your row bot out there and it eats up all of those pollutions <unk> and
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 634.21 645.6 <NA> then you have to go collect them <unk> why because these row bots at the moment <unk> this row bot i 've got here it contains motors <unk> it contains wires it contains components which themselves are not biodegradable 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 645.6 650.05 <NA> current row bots contain things like toxic batteries you can 't leave those in the environment
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 650.34 657.97 <NA> <unk> so you need to track them <unk> and then when they 've finished their job of work you need to collect them that limits the number of row bots you can use 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 657.54 666.88 <NA> if on the other hand you have robot a little bit like a biological organism <unk> when it comes to the end of its life it dies and it degrades to nothing <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 666.87 674.99 <NA> so wouldn 't it be nice if these robots <unk> instead of being like this made out of plastic were made out of other materials <unk> which when you throw them out there they biodegrade
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 676.12 685.56 <NA> <unk> that changes the way in which we use robots <unk> instead of putting ten or one hundred out into the environment having to track them <unk> and then when they die <unk> collect them 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 685.32 691.94 <NA> you could put a thousand a million a billion robots into the environment just spread them around 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 691.93 699.81 <NA> you know that at the end of their lives they 're going to degrade to nothing you don 't need to worry about them <unk> so that changes the way in which you think about robots and the way you
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 701.48 706.98 <NA> <unk> then the question is can you do this well yes we have shown that you can do this you can make robots which are biodegradable <unk>
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 706.98 714.54 <NA> what 's really interesting is you can use household materials to make these biodegradable robots i 'll show you some you might be surprised 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 714.44 724.63 <NA> you can make a robot out of jelly <unk> instead of having a motor <unk> which we have at the moment <unk> you can make things called artificial muscles artificial muscles are smart
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 725.43 731.24 <NA> <unk> you apply electricity to them <unk> and they contract or they bend or they twist they look like real muscles <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 731.24 739.45 <NA> so instead of having a motor you have these artificial muscles and you can make artificial muscles out of jelly if you take some jelly and some salts and <unk>
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 740.81 747.64 <NA> you can make an artificial muscle we 've also shown you can make the microbial fuel cell 's stomach out of paper <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 747.18 754.22 <NA> so you could make the whole robot out of biodegradable materials <unk> you throw them out there and they degrade to nothing
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 755.53 760.44 <NA> <unk> well <unk> this is really really exciting it 's going to totally change the way in which we think about robots <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 760.23 774.42 <NA> but also it allows you to be really creative in the way in which you think about what you can do with these robots i 'll give you an example <unk> if you can use jelly to make a robot now we eat jelly right so why not make something like this 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 804.9 814.39 <NA> <unk> thinks <unk> it twists it bends it does something <unk> it could go further down into your intestines <unk> find out whether you 've got some ulcer or cancer <unk> maybe do an injection something like that 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 814.05 819.61 <NA> you know that once it 's done its job of work <unk> it could be consumed by your stomach <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 819.15 826.3 <NA> or if you don 't want that <unk> it could go straight through you into the toilet <unk> and be degraded safely in the environment <unk> 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 826.29 829.79 <NA> so this changes the way again in which we think about robots
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 830.26 837.48 <NA> so we started off looking at robots that would eat pollution <unk> and then we 're looking at robots which we can eat 
JonathanRossiter_2016X 1 JonathanRossiter_2016X 837.48 842.24 <NA> i hope this gives you some idea of the kinds of things we can do with future robots <unk>
