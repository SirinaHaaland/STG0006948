KateOrff_2010W 1 KateOrff_2010W 261.41 275.11 <NA> so our concept is really this back to the future concept harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern and the idea has two core stages one is to develop a new artificial ecology a reef out in the harbor
KateOrff_2010W 1 KateOrff_2010W 275.64 284.65 <NA> <unk> that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the gowanus because if you have cleaner water and slower water you can imagine a new way of living with that water
KateOrff_2010W 1 KateOrff_2010W 284.28 289.63 <NA> so the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way i think 
KateOrff_2010W 1 KateOrff_2010W 290.64 299.95 <NA> here we are back to our hero the oyster <unk> and again it 's this incredibly exciting animal <unk> it accepts algae and detritus in one end and through this

KateOrff_2010W 1 KateOrff_2010W 336.74 347.59 <NA> finally oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures they really become nature 's wave attenuators <unk>

KateOrff_2010W 1 KateOrff_2010W 391 400.02 <NA> and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive how does the reef work well <unk> it 's very very
KateOrff_2010W 1 KateOrff_2010W 401.18 408.61 <NA> <unk> core concept here is that climate change isn 't something that the answers won 't land down from the moon

KateOrff_2010W 1 KateOrff_2010W 422.39 429.82 <NA> what is fuzzy rope you ask <unk> it 's just that it 's this very inexpensive thing available practically at your hardware
