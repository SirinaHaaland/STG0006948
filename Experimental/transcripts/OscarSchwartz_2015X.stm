OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 12.85 17.57 <NA> <unk> i have a question <unk> can a computer write poetry 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 18.43 21.38 <NA> this is a provocative question <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 21.19 28.37 <NA> you think about it for a minute <unk> and you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like what is a computer <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 28.21 29.94 <NA> what is poetry
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 30.2 32.58 <NA> what is creativity <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 33.11 39.87 <NA> but these are questions that people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer not in a single ted talk 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 39.87 42.48 <NA> so we 're going to have to try a different approach <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 42.05 45.18 <NA> so up here <unk> we have two poems 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 45.32 49.99 <NA> one of them is written by a human <unk> and the other one 's written by a computer
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 71.76 75.23 <NA> <unk> hands up if you think poem one was written by a human
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 78.01 82.49 <NA> <unk> most of you hands up if you think poem two was written by a human <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 82.63 89.36 <NA> very brave of you because the first one was written by the human poet william blake 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 89.29 99.84 <NA> the second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language from my facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically according to
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 100.76 109.75 <NA> <unk> describe a little bit later on so let 's try another test <unk> again you haven 't got ages to read this so just trust your gut
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 130.71 136.84 <NA> <unk> time 's up <unk> so if you think the first poem was written by a human put your hand up
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 137.37 143.08 <NA> <unk> ok <unk> and if you think the second poem was written by a human put your hand up <unk>
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 143.28 151.03 <NA> we have more or less a fifty fifty split here it was much harder the answer is 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 150.84 154.31 <NA> the first poem was generated by an algorithm called
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 154.9 156.02 <NA> <unk> was created back in the <unk>
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 157.36 164.21 <NA> and the second poem was written by a guy called frank o 'hara who happens to be one of my favorite human poets 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 167.56 174.84 <NA> so what we 've just done now is a turing test for poetry <unk> the turing test was first proposed by this guy alan
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 176.51 179.98 <NA> <unk> in order to answer the question can computers think 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 179.74 189.9 <NA> alan turing believed that if a computer was able to have a to have a text based conversation with a human <unk> with such proficiency such that the human couldn 't tell whether they are talking <unk>
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 189.8 195.22 <NA> <unk> to a computer or a human <unk> then the computer can be said to have intelligence <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 204.95 212.41 <NA> but basically <unk> it 's the game we just played you 're presented with a poem you don 't know whether it was written by a human or a computer and you have to guess 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 212.01 219.52 <NA> so thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online so we have results <unk> and what are the results <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 219.21 225.11 <NA> well turing said that if a computer could fool a human thirty percent of the time that it was a human
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 225.58 235.76 <NA> <unk> then it passes the turing test for intelligence <unk> we have poems on the bot or not database that have fooled sixty five percent of human readers into thinking it was written by a human <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 235.42 239.09 <NA> so i think we have an answer to our question <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 238.99 246.62 <NA> according to the logic of the turing test <unk> can a computer write poetry <unk> well yes absolutely it can 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 247.24 254.76 <NA> but if you 're feeling a little bit uncomfortable with this answer that 's ok if you 're having a bunch of gut reactions to it that 's also
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 254.78 257.97 <NA> <unk> ok because this isn 't the end of the story <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 258.05 265.27 <NA> let 's play our third and final test <unk> again you 're going to have to read and tell me which you think is human
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 286.44 290.8 <NA> <unk> so hands up if you think poem one was written by a human <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 291.48 297.7 <NA> hands up if you think poem two was written by a human <unk> whoa that 's a lot more people
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 297.24 303.86 <NA> <unk> so you 'd be surprised to find that poem one was written by the very human poet
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 303.63 304.94 <NA> gertrude stein
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 305.07 309.75 <NA> <unk> and poem two was generated by an algorithm called <unk>
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 311.01 316.79 <NA> now before we go on let me describe very quickly and simply how <unk> rkcp works 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 316.36 325.32 <NA> so rkcp is an algorithm designed by ray kurzweil who 's a director of engineering at google and a firm believer in artificial intelligence
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 328.07 329.61 <NA> <unk> a source text 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 329.33 343.47 <NA> it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text <unk> so in the poem we just saw before poem two the one that you all thought was human 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 343.47 354.7 <NA> it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called emily dickinson it looked at the way she used language learned the model and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 356.19 362.08 <NA> but the important thing to know about rkcp is that it doesn 't know the meaning of the words it 's using 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 361.83 373.27 <NA> the language is just raw material <unk> it could be chinese it could be in swedish it could be the collected language from your facebook feed for one day it 's just raw material <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 372.87 379.97 <NA> and nevertheless <unk> it 's able to create a poem that seems more human than gertrude stein 's poem and gertrude
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 379.93 388.97 <NA> <unk> stein is a human <unk> so what we 've done here is more or less a reverse turing test <unk> so
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 388.87 398.91 <NA> gertrude stein <unk> who 's a human is able to write a poem that fools a majority of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 398.91 404.94 <NA> therefore <unk> according to the logic of the reverse turing test gertrude stein is a computer
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 406.79 410.85 <NA> feeling confused i think that 's fair enough 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 410.99 418.59 <NA> so far we 've had humans that write like humans <unk> we have computers that write like computers <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 418.28 425.43 <NA> we have computers that write like humans <unk> but we also have perhaps most confusingly 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 424.97 428.13 <NA> humans that write like computers <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 428.39 429.97 <NA> so what do we take from all
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 429.96 439.66 <NA> <unk> this do we take that william blake is somehow more of a human than gertrude stein <unk> or that gertrude stein is more of a computer than william blake 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 440.16 452.2 <NA> these are questions i 've been asking myself for around two years now and i don 't have any answers but what i do have are a bunch of insights about our relationship with technology <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 452.46 454.97 <NA> so my first insight is that
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 454.81 463.65 <NA> <unk> that for some reason we associate poetry with being human <unk> so that when we ask can a computer write poetry 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 463.65 474.11 <NA> we 're also asking what does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries around this category how do we say who or what can be part of this category 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 473.83 479.97 <NA> this is an essentially philosophical question <unk> i believe and it can 't be answered with a yes or no test
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 479.93 481.74 <NA> <unk> like the turing test <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 481.28 491.46 <NA> i also believe that alan turing understood this and that when he devised his test back in one thousand nine hundred and fifty he was doing it as a philosophical provocation <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 492.59 499.87 <NA> so my second insight is that when we take the turing test for poetry <unk> we 're not really testing the
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 504.99 508.3 <NA> <unk> they 're pretty simple and have existed more or less <unk>
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 510.48 513.97 <NA> what we are doing with the turing test for poetry rather 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 513.97 519.19 <NA> is collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 519.75 525.26 <NA> so what i 've figured out we 've seen this when earlier today
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 526.36 530.06 <NA> <unk> that william blake is more of a human than gertrude stein 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 529.63 537.32 <NA> of course this doesn 't mean that william blake was actually more human or that gertrude stein was more of a computer <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 537.01 542.72 <NA> it simply means that the category of the human is unstable 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 542.95 545.55 <NA> this has led me to understand
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 545.34 554.73 <NA> that the human is not a cold hard fact <unk> rather it is something that 's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 556.16 558.45 <NA> so my final insight
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 558.22 566.58 <NA> is that the computer more or less <unk> works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 566.45 574.93 <NA> we show it emily dickinson it gives emily dickinson back to us <unk> we show it william blake that 's what it reflects back
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 575.82 580.78 <NA> <unk> we show it gertrude stein <unk> what we get back is gertrude stein <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 580.53 588.82 <NA> more than any other bit of technology the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 589.53 595.6 <NA> so i 'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence recently <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 596.19 604.97 <NA> and much of the conversation is can we build it can we build an intelligent computer
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 605.28 613.64 <NA> can we build a creative computer what we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human like computer <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 613.42 619.27 <NA> but what we 've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact that it
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 619.27 624.59 <NA> 's an ever shifting concatenating idea and one that changes over time <unk> 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 624.16 629.97 <NA> so that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 630.04 639.57 <NA> <unk> we shouldn 't only be asking ourselves can we build it but we should also be asking ourselves what idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us 
OscarSchwartz_2015X 1 OscarSchwartz_2015X 639.57 647.77 <NA> this is an essentially philosophical idea and it 's one that can 't be answered with software alone <unk> but i think requires a moment of
