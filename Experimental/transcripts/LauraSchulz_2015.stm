LauraSchulz_2015 1 LauraSchulz_2015 469.71 475.11 <NA> than when the evidence is clearly cherry picked and this leads to a fun prediction
LauraSchulz_2015 1 LauraSchulz_2015 475.85 480.74 <NA> <unk> suppose you pulled just one blue ball out of the mostly yellow box you [ probably

LauraSchulz_2015 1 LauraSchulz_2015 569.75 579.97 <NA> so in this next experiment <unk> we 're going to give babies just a tiny bit of statistical data supporting one hypothesis over the other and we 're going to see if babies can use that
LauraSchulz_2015 1 LauraSchulz_2015 580.22 584.68 <NA> to make different decisions about what to do here 's the setup
LauraSchulz_2015 1 LauraSchulz_2015 585.48 588.91 <NA> hyowon is going to try to make the toy go and succeed

LauraSchulz_2015 1 LauraSchulz_2015 601.84 608.99 <NA> <unk> but the important point here is it provides a little bit of evidence that the problem isn 't with the toy it 's with the person <unk> 
LauraSchulz_2015 1 LauraSchulz_2015 608.53 612.53 <NA> some people can make this toy go and some can 't <unk>

LauraSchulz_2015 1 LauraSchulz_2015 625 629.8 <NA> can pull the cloth towards him and change the toy <unk> so let 's see what the baby does

LauraSchulz_2015 1 LauraSchulz_2015 691.75 698.66 <NA> so again the really important question is what happens when we change the statistical data ever so slightly 
LauraSchulz_2015 1 LauraSchulz_2015 698.38 699.96 <NA> this time babies are going to
LauraSchulz_2015 1 LauraSchulz_2015 700.46 709.89 <NA> <unk> the toy work and fail in exactly the same order but we 're changing the distribution of evidence this time hyowon is going to succeed once and fail once and so am i
