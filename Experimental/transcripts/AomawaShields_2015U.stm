AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 21.24 24.99 <NA> or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 25.76 32.61 <NA> <unk> but i know that it 's there and understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 32.87 41.49 <NA> on our planet where there 's water there 's life <unk> so we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 41.93 53.71 <NA> at this distance shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 54.96 60.91 <NA> <unk> astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 60.45 67.36 <NA> what i do picks up where their job ends i model the possible climates of exoplanets <unk> 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 66.87 75.14 <NA> and here 's why that 's important <unk> there are many factors besides distance from its star that control whether a planet can support life
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 76.24 78.17 <NA> <unk> take the planet venus 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 78.16 86.3 <NA> it 's named after the roman goddess of love and beauty because of its benign ethereal appearance in the sky <unk> 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 85.96 89.9 <NA> but spacecraft measurements revealed a different story

AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 98.62 99.75 <NA> its thick
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 100.52 110.1 <NA> <unk> not its distance from the sun is the reason <unk> it causes a greenhouse effect on steroids <unk> trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet 's surface 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 109.67 115.11 <NA> the reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 115.22 124.32 <NA> from these lessons from our own solar system we 've learned that a planet 's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 124.46 129.94 <NA> we don 't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 130.16 138.64 <NA> dim compared to their stars and so far away from us for example one of the closest planets that could support surface water
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 138.44 145.96 <NA> it 's called gliese six hundred and sixty seven cc such a glamorous name right <unk> nice phone number for a name
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 145.96 154.97 <NA> it 's twenty three light years away <unk> so that 's more than one hundred trillion miles trying to measure the atmospheric composition
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 155.02 163.82 <NA> <unk> of an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard it 's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car 's headlight ok
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 163.81 171.65 <NA> now imagine that car is one hundred trillion miles away <unk> and you want to know the precise color of that fly 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 172.12 179.94 <NA> so i use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need to have a suitable climate for water and life
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 180.86 183.67 <NA> here 's an artist 's concept of the planet
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 185.47 187.38 <NA> with the earth for reference it 's
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 187.01 192.12 <NA> one thousand two hundred light years away <unk> and just forty percent larger than earth <unk> 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 192.11 200.2 <NA> our nsf funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 200.43 205.66 <NA> <unk> so i 'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 205.98 215.53 <NA> ice on a planet 's surface is also important for climate ice absorbs longer redder wavelengths of light and reflects shorter bluer light 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 215.37 224.93 <NA> that 's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue the redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice <unk> only the blue light makes it all the way to the
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 225.88 230.45 <NA> <unk> then it gets reflected back to up to our eyes and we see blue ice 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 230.08 240.86 <NA> my models show that planets orbiting cooler stars could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars <unk> there 's another contradiction that ice absorbs the longer wavelength <unk>
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 240.76 245.69 <NA> <unk> light from cooler stars and that light that energy <unk> heats the ice <unk> 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 255.89 262.34 <NA> and it 's no surprise that this is my specialty i 'm an african american female astronomer
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 262.12 269.09 <NA> and a classically trained actor who loves to wear makeup and read fashion magazines so
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 269.09 273.66 <NA> i am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 277.49 279.97 <NA> and how they can inform our search for
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 279.99 282.46 <NA> <unk> the next planet where life exists <unk> 
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 282.12 288.35 <NA> my organization <unk> rising stargirls teaches astronomy to middle school girls of color <unk>

AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 292.23 303.52 <NA> that 's another contradiction science and art don 't often go together <unk> but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what they learn and maybe one day
AomawaShields_2015U 1 AomawaShields_2015U 303.12 304.61 <NA> join the ranks of
