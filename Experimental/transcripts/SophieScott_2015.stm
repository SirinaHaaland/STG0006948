SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 13.18 15.69 <NA> <unk> i 'm going to talk to you today about laughter <unk> 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 15.69 25.08 <NA> and i just want to start by thinking about the first time i can ever remember noticing laughter this is when i was a little girl i would 've been about six <unk> and i came across my parents
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 27.32 34.39 <NA> <unk> they were laughing <unk> they were laughing very very hard they were lying on the floor laughing <unk> they were screaming with laughter <unk> 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 34.39 41.85 <NA> i did not know what they were laughing at but i wanted in i wanted to be part of that and i kind of sat around at the edge going hoo hoo 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 43.28 45.16 <NA> now incidentally 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 45.16 54.97 <NA> what they were laughing at was a song which people used to sing <unk> which was based around signs in toilets on trains telling you what you could and
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 54.96 63.46 <NA> <unk> could not do in toilets on trains <unk> and the thing you have to remember about the english is of course we do have an immensely sophisticated sense of humor at the
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 64.83 69.77 <NA> time though i didn 't understand anything of that i just cared about the laughter and actually 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 69.77 78.77 <NA> as a neuroscientist i 've come to care about it again <unk> and it is a really weird thing to do what i 'm going to do now is just play some examples of real human beings laughing
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 80.01 90.39 <NA> the sound people make and how odd that can be and in fact how primitive laughter is as a sound it 's much more like an animal call than it is like speech <unk> so here we 've got some laughter for you the first one is pretty joyful
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 109.25 115.21 <NA> <unk> i need him to breathe there 's a point in there where i 'm just like you 've got to get some air in there mate because he just sounds like he 's breathing out
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 134.43 141.5 <NA> <unk> and finally we have this is a human female laughing <unk> and laughter can take us to some pretty odd places in terms of making noises
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 165.1 174.78 <NA> <unk> kind of with her i have no idea now to understand laughter <unk> you have to look at a part of the body that psychologists and neuroscientists don 't normally spend much time looking at which is the
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 176.06 184.11 <NA> <unk> seem terribly exciting but actually you 're all using your ribcage all the time what you 're all doing at the moment with your ribcage and don 't stop doing it is breathing <unk> 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 183.65 187.56 <NA> so you use the intercostal muscles the muscles between your ribs 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 187.56 194.86 <NA> to bring air in and out of your lungs just by expanding and contracting your ribcage and if i was to put a strap around the outside of your chest called a breath belt and
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 194.66 196.72 <NA> just look at that movement you see a
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 196.51 199.87 <NA> rather gentle sinusoidal movement so that 's breathing you 're all doing
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 200.13 201.49 <NA> <unk> don 't stop 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 201.18 203.65 <NA> as soon as you start talking <unk> 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 203.19 216.88 <NA> you start using your breathing completely differently <unk> so what i 'm doing now is you see something much more like this in talking you use very fine movements of the ribcage to squeeze the air out and in fact we 're the only animals that can do this it 's why we can talk at all 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 216.48 220.78 <NA> now <unk> both talking and breathing has a mortal enemy <unk> 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 220.78 229.97 <NA> and that enemy is laughter because what happens when you laugh is those same muscles start to contract very regularly and you get this very marked
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 230.1 236.26 <NA> sort of zig zagging and that 's just squeezing the air out of you it literally is that basic a way of making a sound you could be
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 236.27 246.15 <NA> stamping on somebody it 's having the same effect you 're just squeezing air out and each of those contractions ha gives you a sound <unk> and as the contractions run together <unk> you can get these spasms and that 's when you start getting
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 255.23 262.83 <NA> <unk> in terms of the science of laughter there isn 't very much but it does turn out that pretty much everything we think we know about laughter is wrong <unk> 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 262.83 275.02 <NA> so it 's not at all unusual for example to hear people to say humans are the only animals that laugh nietzsche thought that humans are the only animals that laugh in fact you find laughter throughout the mammals it 's been well described and well observed in primates
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 275 280.43 <NA> but you also see it in rats and wherever you find it humans primates rats
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 280.25 285.7 <NA> you find it associated with things like tickling that 's the same for humans 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 286.65 291.04 <NA> you find it associated with play <unk> and all mammals play <unk> 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 290.88 299.36 <NA> and wherever you find it it 's associated with interactions so robert provine who has done a lot of work on this has pointed out
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 300.85 306.08 <NA> <unk> times more likely to laugh if you are with somebody else than if you 're on your own 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 306.08 320.67 <NA> and where you find most laughter is in social interactions like conversation so if you ask human beings when do you laugh they 'll talk about comedy and they 'll talk about humor and they 'll talk about jokes if you look at when they laugh they 're laughing with their friends 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 320.49 325.08 <NA> and when we laugh with people we 're hardly ever actually laughing at jokes <unk> you are laughing to show
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 325.34 338.11 <NA> <unk> you understand them that you agree with them that you 're part of the same group as them you 're laughing to show that you like them you might even love them <unk> you 're doing all that at the same time as talking to them and the laughter is doing a lot of that emotional work for you <unk> 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 337.87 346.53 <NA> something that robert provine has pointed out as you can see here and the reason why we were laughing when we heard those funny laughs at the start and why i was laughing when i found my parents laughing <unk> 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 346.53 354.91 <NA> is that it 's an enormously behaviorally contagious effect <unk> you can catch laughter from somebody else and you are more likely to catch laughter off somebody else if you
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 354.87 364.51 <NA> <unk> know them <unk> so it 's still modulated by this social context <unk> you have to put humor to one side and think about the social meaning of laughter because that 's where its origins lie <unk> 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 364.77 372.11 <NA> now something i 've got very interested in is different kinds of laughter <unk> and we have some neurobiological evidence
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 371.92 379.97 <NA> about how human beings vocalize that suggests there might be two kinds of laughs that we have so it seems possible that
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 379.93 386.4 <NA> <unk> the neurobiology for helpless <unk> involuntary laughter <unk> like my parents lying on the floor screaming about a silly song 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 386.4 399.99 <NA> might have a different basis to it than some of that more polite social laughter that you encounter which isn 't horrible laughter <unk> but it it 's behavior somebody is doing as part of their communicative act to you <unk> part of their interaction with you they are choosing to do this
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 400.46 415.02 <NA> <unk> in our evolution we have developed two different ways of vocalizing involuntary vocalizations are part of an older system than the more voluntary vocalizations like the speech i 'm doing now <unk> so we might imagine that laughter might actually have two different roots <unk> so i 've been looking at this in more detail 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 414.68 424.99 <NA> to do this <unk> we 've had to make recordings of people laughing and we 've had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh <unk> and we got those same people to produce more posed social laughter so imagine your
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 426 428.08 <NA> <unk> laughing because you like your friend but not
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 428.01 429.98 <NA> really because the joke 's all that 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 429.98 439.07 <NA> so i 'm going to play you a couple of those i want you to tell me if you think this laughter is real laughter or if you think it 's posed so is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 462.46 464.75 <NA> <unk> was helpless laughter and in fact 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 464.71 471.68 <NA> to record that all they had to do was record me watching one of my friends listening to something i knew she wanted to laugh at and i just started doing this
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 471.68 478.32 <NA> what you find is that people are good at telling the difference between real and posed laughter they seem to be different things to us
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 479.87 490.29 <NA> <unk> similar with chimpanzees chimpanzees laugh differently if they 're being tickled than if they 're playing with each other and we might be seeing something like that here <unk> involuntary laughter tickling laughter <unk> being different from social laughter <unk>
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 490.24 504.91 <NA> <unk> they 're acoustically very different the real laughs are longer <unk> they 're higher in pitch when you start laughing hard <unk> you start squeezing air out from your lungs under much higher pressures than you could ever produce voluntarily for example i could never pitch my voice that high to sing
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 504.95 518.15 <NA> also you start to get these sort of contractions and weird whistling sounds all of which mean that real laughter is extremely easy or feels extremely easy to spot <unk> in contrast <unk> posed laughter 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 518.15 524.87 <NA> we might think it sounds a bit fake actually it 's not it 's actually an important social cue we use it a lot we 're choosing to laugh in a lot of
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 526.21 532.82 <NA> <unk> seems to be its own thing so for example <unk> you find <unk> nasality in posed laughter that kind of ha ha ha ha ha sound
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 532.39 542.54 <NA> that you never get you could not do if you were laughing involuntarily so they do seem to be genuinely these two different sorts of things we took it into the scanner to see how brains respond when you hear laughter 
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 542.05 543.66 <NA> and when you do this
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 543.66 554.31 <NA> this is a really boring experiment we just played people real and posed laughs we didn 't tell them it was a study on laughter <unk> we put other sounds in there to distract them <unk> and all they 're doing is lying listening to sounds we don 't
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 555.25 565.56 <NA> nonetheless when you hear real laughter and when you hear posed laughter the brains are responding completely differently significantly differently <unk> what you see in the regions in blue <unk> which lies <unk>
SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 565.46 575.11 <NA> <unk> in auditory cortex are the brain areas that respond more to the real laughs <unk> and what seems to be the case when you hear somebody laughing involuntarily <unk> you hear sounds you would never hear in any other

SophieScott_2015 1 SophieScott_2015 709.1 720.46 <NA> but i 'm coming to see that actually there 's even more to laughter than it 's an important social emotion we should look at because it turns out people are phenomenally nuanced in terms of how we use laughter there
