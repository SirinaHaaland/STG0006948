MeronGribetz_2016 1 MeronGribetz_2016 390.48 402.42 <NA> your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them you could put your holographic tesla that you 're shopping for or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show 
MeronGribetz_2016 1 MeronGribetz_2016 404.93 409.59 <NA> <unk> get it back the second interface guideline we call touch to see 
MeronGribetz_2016 1 MeronGribetz_2016 409.49 420 <NA> what do babies do when they see something that grabs their interest they try and reach out and touch it and that 's exactly how the natural machine should work as well <unk> 
MeronGribetz_2016 1 MeronGribetz_2016 419.9 429.46 <NA> turns out the visual system gets a fundamental boost from a sense we call proprioception that 's the sense of our body parts in space so by touching our work directly
MeronGribetz_2016 1 MeronGribetz_2016 429.96 434.23 <NA> <unk> to control it better we 're also going to understand it much more deeply 
MeronGribetz_2016 1 MeronGribetz_2016 434.13 436.15 <NA> hence touch to see 
MeronGribetz_2016 1 MeronGribetz_2016 435.81 440.76 <NA> but it 's not enough to experience things ourselves we 're inherently these social primates <unk> 
MeronGribetz_2016 1 MeronGribetz_2016 440.76 446.17 <NA> and this leads me to our third guideline the holographic campfire from our first story
