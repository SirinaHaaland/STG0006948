JeffHawkins_2003 1 JeffHawkins_2003 964.24 974.75 <NA> when we look at a face we typically go from eye to eye to nose to mouth when your eye moves from eye to eye if there was something else there like a nose <unk> you 'd see a nose where an eye is supposed to be and go

JeffHawkins_2003 1 JeffHawkins_2003 1004.99 1009.29 <NA> <unk> is the recipe for brain theory first of all we have to have the right framework <unk> 
JeffHawkins_2003 1 JeffHawkins_2003 1008.89 1016.79 <NA> and the framework is a memory framework not a computational or behavior framework it 's a memory framework how do you store and recall these sequences of patterns it
JeffHawkins_2003 1 JeffHawkins_2003 1016.72 1029.61 <NA> 's spatiotemporal patterns <unk> then <unk> if in that framework you take a bunch of theoreticians biologists generally are not good theoreticians not always but generally there 's not a good history of theory in biology <unk> i 've found the best people to work with are physicists
JeffHawkins_2003 1 JeffHawkins_2003 1030.31 1039.39 <NA> and mathematicians who tend to think algorithmically <unk> then they have to learn the anatomy and the physiology you have to make these theories very realistic in

JeffHawkins_2003 1 JeffHawkins_2003 1062 1069.88 <NA> what will brain theory look like first of all it 's going to be about memory not like computer memory not at all like computer memory it 's very very different
JeffHawkins_2003 1 JeffHawkins_2003 1069.88 1079.97 <NA> it 's a memory of very high dimensional patterns like the things that come from your eyes <unk> it 's also memory of sequences you cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence a song must be heard

JeffHawkins_2003 1 JeffHawkins_2003 1091.77 1100.02 <NA> and prediction of future inputs is the desired output and as i said the theory must be biologically accurate <unk> it must be testable and you must be able to build it if you don 't build it you don

JeffHawkins_2003 1 JeffHawkins_2003 1111.98 1119.92 <NA> no doubt that it 's going to happen in my mind first of all we 're going to build this stuff out of silicon the same techniques we use to build
JeffHawkins_2003 1 JeffHawkins_2003 1119.74 1125.29 <NA> silicon computer memories we can use here but they 're very different types of memories <unk> and we 'll attach these memories to sensors
JeffHawkins_2003 1 JeffHawkins_2003 1129.42 1139.37 <NA> <unk> learn about their environment now it 's very unlikely the first things you 'll see are like robots not that robots aren 't useful people can build robots <unk> but the robotics part is the hardest part that 's old brain
JeffHawkins_2003 1 JeffHawkins_2003 1139.37 1146.81 <NA> that 's really hard the new brain is easier than the old brain so first we 'll do things that don 't require a lot of robotics so you 're not going to see
JeffHawkins_2003 1 JeffHawkins_2003 1148.5 1154.37 <NA> <unk> see things more like intelligent cars that really understand what traffic is what driving is and have learned that
