BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 12.7 24.93 <NA> <unk> i 'm an artist and i cut books this is one of my first book works it 's called alternate route to knowledge <unk> i wanted to create a stack of books so that somebody could come into the gallery and think they 're just looking at a regular stack of books but then as they
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 26.39 32.05 <NA> <unk> see this rough hole carved into it and wonder what was happening wonder why and think about the material of the book 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 32.05 39.03 <NA> so i 'm interested in the texture but i 'm more interested in the text and the images that we find within books 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 39.29 49.26 <NA> in most of my work what i do is i seal the edges of a book with a thick varnish so it 's creating sort of a skin on the outside of the book so it becomes a solid material but then the pages inside <unk>
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 49.16 54.97 <NA> <unk> are still loose <unk> and then i carve into the surface of the book and i 'm not moving or adding anything i 'm just
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 54.93 62.98 <NA> <unk> carving around whatever i find interesting so everything you see within the finished piece is exactly where it was in the book before i began <unk> 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 64.35 72.76 <NA> i think of my work as sort of a remix in a way because i 'm working with somebody else 's material in the same way that a d j might be working with somebody else 's music 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 72.36 75.29 <NA> this was a book of raphael paintings
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 77.74 84.95 <NA> <unk> taking his work and remixing it carving into it i 'm sort of making it into something that 's more new and more contemporary <unk> 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 85.54 94.94 <NA> i 'm thinking also about breaking out of the box of the traditional book and pushing that linear format and try to push the structure of the book itself
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 95.65 98.78 <NA> so that the book can become fully sculptural 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 100.93 104.37 <NA> i 'm using clamps and ropes and all sorts of materials
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 105.1 112.44 <NA> in order to hold things in place before i varnish so that i can push the form before i begin so that something like this
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 113.27 119.97 <NA> can become a piece like this <unk> which is just made from a single dictionary or something like this
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 122.09 124.41 <NA> can become a piece like this 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 126.29 129.94 <NA> or something like this <unk> which who knows what that 's going to be or
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 129.9 134.35 <NA> <unk> why that 's in my studio <unk> will become a piece like this <unk> 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 136.68 147.79 <NA> so i think one of the reasons people are disturbed by destroying books people don 't want to rip books and nobody really wants to throw away a book is that we think about books as living things we think about them as a body <unk> 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 147.79 149.96 <NA> and they 're created to relate to our
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 150.28 158.21 <NA> <unk> as far as scale but they also have the potential to continue to grow and to continue to become new things so books really are alive <unk> 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 158.17 160.73 <NA> so i think of the book as a body <unk> 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 160.99 165.86 <NA> and i think of the book as a technology <unk> i think of the book as a tool <unk> 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 167.71 170.57 <NA> and i also think of the book as a machine 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 172.21 179.97 <NA> i also think of the book as a landscape this is a full set of encyclopedias that 's been connected and sanded together <unk> and as i
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 179.93 188.64 <NA> <unk> carve through it i 'm deciding what i want to choose so with encyclopedias i could have chosen anything <unk> but i specifically chose images of landscapes <unk> 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 189.44 199.29 <NA> and with the material itself <unk> i 'm using sandpaper and sanding the edges so not only the images suggest landscape but the material itself suggests a landscape as well <unk> 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 201.08 204.79 <NA> so one of the things i do is when i 'm carving through the book
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 205.02 214.87 <NA> <unk> i 'm thinking about images but i 'm also thinking about text and i think about them in a very similar way <unk> because what 's interesting is that when we 're reading text when we 're reading a book 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 214.87 229.82 <NA> it puts images in our head <unk> so we 're sort of filling that piece we 're sort of creating images when we 're reading text and when we 're looking at an image we actually use language in order to understand what we 're looking at so there 's sort of a yin yang that happens
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 229.93 234.35 <NA> <unk> of a flip flop so i 'm creating a piece that the the viewer is
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 234.43 236.63 <NA> completing themselves <unk> 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 236.71 248.06 <NA> and i think of my work as almost an archaeology i 'm excavating and i 'm trying to maximize the potential and discover as much as i possibly can and exposing it within my own work 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 249.82 254.97 <NA> but at the same time <unk> i 'm thinking about this idea of erasure <unk> and what 's happening
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 255.08 260.61 <NA> <unk> now that most of our information is intangible <unk> and this idea of loss <unk> 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 260.69 266.32 <NA> and this idea that not only is the format constantly shifting within computers but
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 266.13 270.45 <NA> the information itself <unk> now that we don 't have a physical backup
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 270.02 273.75 <NA> has to be constantly updated in order to not lose it 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 276 286.15 <NA> <unk> i have several dictionaries in my own studio <unk> and i do use a computer every day and if i need to look up a word i 'll go on the computer because i can go directly and instantly to what <unk>
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 286.05 296.8 <NA> <unk> i 'm looking up i think that the book was never really the right format for nonlinear information which is why we 're seeing reference books becoming the first to be endangered or extinct <unk> 
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 301.11 304.91 <NA> so i don 't think that the book will ever really die people think
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 304.84 306.38 <NA> <unk> that now
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 306.49 311.24 <NA> now that we have digital technology the book is going to die and we are seeing
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 311.26 316.88 <NA> things shifting and things evolving i think that the book will evolve and just like
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 316.78 329.97 <NA> people said painting would die when photography and printmaking became everyday materials but what it really allowed painting to do was it allowed painting to quit its day job it allowed painting to not have to have that
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 329.99 331.35 <NA> <unk> everyday
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 331.31 338.64 <NA> chore of telling the story <unk> and painting became free and was allowed to tell its own story and that 's when we saw
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 338.41 349.23 <NA> modernism emerge and we saw painting go into different branches <unk> and i think that 's what 's happening with books now now that most of our technology most of our information most of our personal and cultural records
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 349.23 354.97 <NA> are in digital form i think it 's really allowing the book to become something new <unk> so i think it 's a very exciting
BrianDettmer_2014Y 1 BrianDettmer_2014Y 355.22 360.53 <NA> time for an artist like me <unk> and it 's very exciting to see what will happen with the book in the future <unk> thank you
