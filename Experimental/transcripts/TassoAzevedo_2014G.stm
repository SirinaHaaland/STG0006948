TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 362.06 372.49 <NA> and then linked this to the end users so supermarkets <unk> the slaughterhouses and so on that buy products from illegal clear cut areas they also can be liable for <unk>
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 372.44 377.77 <NA> the deforestation so making all these connections to help to push the problem down

TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 411.38 412.41 <NA> so
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 412.18 418.17 <NA> if we compare it with the average deforestation that we had in the last decade

TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 437.55 445.99 <NA> one may think that when you do these kinds of actions to decrease to push down deforestation you will have an economic impact
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 446.22 454.76 <NA> because you will not have economic activity or something like that but it 's interesting to know that it 's quite the opposite <unk> in fact in the period
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 454.99 464.72 <NA> <unk> have the deepest decline of deforestation <unk> the economy grew on average double from the previous decade when deforestation was actually going up <unk> 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 464.32 472.28 <NA> so it 's a good lesson for us <unk> maybe this is completely disconnected <unk> as we just learned by having deforestation come down 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 472.51 474.81 <NA> now this is all good news

TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 517.14 525.08 <NA> so we can 't be satisfied not even close to satisfied so the next step <unk> i think is to fight
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 525.07 528.66 <NA> <unk> to have zero loss of forest cover in brazil
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 528.48 531.84 <NA> and to have that as a goal for two thousand and twenty 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 531.84 539.63 <NA> that 's our next step now i 've always been interested in the relationship between climate change and forests first because
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 539.23 546.29 <NA> fifteen percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation <unk> so it 's a big part of the problem <unk> 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 545.83 552.96 <NA> but also forests can be a big part of the solution since that 's the best way we know to sink
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 555.16 566.37 <NA> carbon now there is another relationship of climate and forests that really stuck me in two thousand and eight and made me change my career from forests to working with climate change <unk> 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 566.39 571.32 <NA> i went to visit canada in british columbia <unk> together with
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 571.31 574.99 <NA> the chiefs of the forest services of other countries that we have a
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 581.82 592.06 <NA> <unk> when we were there we we learned about this pine beetle that is literally eating the forests in canada <unk> what we see here those
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 591.6 599.87 <NA> brown trees these are really dead trees they are standing dead trees because of the larvae of the
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 602.47 611.21 <NA> <unk> that this beetle is controlled by the cold weather in the winter for many years now they don 't have the sufficient cold weather to actually
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 610.81 617.04 <NA> control the population of this beetle and it became a disease that is
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 617.04 626.63 <NA> really killing billions of trees <unk> so i came back with this notion that the forest is actually one of the earliest and most
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 626.17 629.43 <NA> affected victims of climate change
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 629.87 633.64 <NA> <unk> so i was thinking if i succeed
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 633.46 636.55 <NA> in working with all my colleagues to actually
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 636.37 642.91 <NA> help to stop deforestation maybe we will lose the battle later on for climate change <unk>
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 642.91 649.5 <NA> by floods <unk> heat <unk> fires and so on <unk> so i decided to leave the forest service
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 658.5 663.67 <NA> <unk> the challenge of climate change is pretty straightforward <unk> the goal is very clear we
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 663.36 669.88 <NA> want to limit the increase of the average temperature of the planet to two degrees <unk> 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 669.66 674.93 <NA> there are several reasons for that i will not get into that now <unk> but in order to get to
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 684.43 692.03 <NA> <unk> on climate change <unk> defines that we have a budget of emissions of one thousand billion tons of <unk>
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 693.06 696.2 <NA> from now until the end of the century <unk> 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 695.89 703.89 <NA> so if we divide this by the number of years what we have is an average budget of eleven billion tons of
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 704.98 712.86 <NA> <unk> now what is one ton of co2 it 's more or less what one small car <unk> running twenty kilometers
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 712.43 715.86 <NA> a day <unk> will emit in one year <unk>

TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 723.23 728.4 <NA> so eleven billion tons is twice that now
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 728 729.94 <NA> the emissions today
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 729.9 736.03 <NA> <unk> are fifty billion tons <unk> and it 's growing it 's growing and maybe it will be <unk>

TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 752.79 754.94 <NA> and so what we need to do
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 755.07 756.09 <NA> is to
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 755.85 763.14 <NA> be much more efficient in a way that we can go from seven tons of carbon per capita per person 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 763.14 766.97 <NA> per year <unk> into something like one 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 766.78 768.69 <NA> you have to choose
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 768.5 774.93 <NA> you take the the airplane or you have a car <unk> so the question is can we make it <unk> and
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 775 778.59 <NA> 's the exactly the same question i got when i was
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 778.43 785.37 <NA> developing a plan to combat deforestation it 's such a big problem <unk> so complex can we really do it <unk> 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 785.3 786.88 <NA> i think so 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 786.88 798.63 <NA> think of this deforestation means sixty percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in brazil in the last decade <unk> now it 's a little bit less than thirty percent in the world
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 798.17 799.87 <NA> sixty percent is
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 801.24 802.96 <NA> <unk> so if we can tackle
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 802.79 809.53 <NA> directly the energy the same way we could tackle deforestation maybe we can have a chance <unk> 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 809.22 819.25 <NA> so there are five things that i think we should we should do first we need to disconnect development from carbon emissions we don 't need to <unk>
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 820.41 829.94 <NA> <unk> all the forests to actually get more jobs and agriculture and have more economy that 's what we proved when we decreased deforestation and the economy continued to grow same thing
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 829.93 833.87 <NA> <unk> could happen in the in the energy sector <unk> 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 833.8 842.84 <NA> second we have to move the incentives to the right place today five hundred billion dollars a year goes into subsidies for fossil fuels 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 842.53 847.74 <NA> why don 't we put a price on carbon and transfer this to the renewable energy <unk> 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 847.74 854.97 <NA> third <unk> we need to measure and make it transparent where when and who is emitting greenhouse gases so
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 855.43 863.55 <NA> have actions specifically for each one of those opportunities <unk> fourth <unk> we need to leapfrog the routes of development <unk> 
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 863.21 875.2 <NA> which means you don 't need to go to the landline telephone before you get to the mobile phones same way we don 't need to go to fossil fuels to the one billion people who don 't have access to energy before we get to the clean energy
TassoAzevedo_2014G 1 TassoAzevedo_2014G 875.94 883.12 <NA> <unk> and fifth and last we need to share responsibility between governments <unk> business and civil society
