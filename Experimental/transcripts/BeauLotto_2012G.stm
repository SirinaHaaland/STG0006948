BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 42.44 48.91 <NA> <unk> are you reading there are no words there <unk> i said read what you 're seeing <unk> right <unk> it literally says
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 55.2 59.69 <NA> 's because perception is grounded in our experience <unk> right <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 59.69 70.39 <NA> the brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it which means we never see what 's there we never see information we only ever see what was useful to see in the past all
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 70.38 74.96 <NA> right which means when it comes to perception we 're all like this frog
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 103.04 109.41 <NA> <unk> when things don 't go our way we get a little bit annoyed right <unk> but we 're talking about perception here right <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 109.7 120.3 <NA> and perception underpins everything we think we know we believe our hopes our dreams the clothes we wear falling in love everything begins with perception 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 120.05 129.49 <NA> now if perception is grounded in our history it means we 're only ever responding according to what we 've done before but actually it 's a tremendous problem
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 130.02 132.85 <NA> <unk> because how can we ever see differently <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 133.38 134.92 <NA> now <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 134.46 143.5 <NA> i want to tell you a story about seeing differently <unk> and all new perceptions begin in the same way they begin with a question 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 143.76 154 <NA> the problem with questions is they create uncertainty now uncertainty is a very bad thing it 's evolutionarily a bad thing if you 're not sure that 's a predator it 's too late 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 155.35 158.57 <NA> <unk> even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty right
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 158.11 169.49 <NA> if you go down below on a boat <unk> your inner ears are you telling you you 're moving your eyes because it 's moving in register with the boat say i 'm standing still your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information and it gets ill 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 169.63 174.99 <NA> the question why is one of the most dangerous things you can do because it takes you
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 176.63 186.6 <NA> <unk> and yet the irony is the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space <unk> so how can we ever do anything new well fortunately <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 186.68 194.1 <NA> evolution has given us an answer <unk> right <unk> and it enables us to address even the most difficult
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 193.64 199.84 <NA> of questions the best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty they 're the ones that question the things we
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 202.26 207.71 <NA> <unk> easy to ask questions about how did life begin or what extends beyond the universe <unk> but to question what you think to be true already
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 207.53 212.83 <NA> is really stepping into that space <unk> so what is evolution 's answer
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 212.66 216.37 <NA> to the problem of uncertainty <unk> it 's play <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 216.66 223.69 <NA> now play is not simply a process experts in play will tell you that actually it 's a way of being 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 223.32 228.58 <NA> play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 228.27 229.88 <NA> uncertainty is what makes
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 229.81 236.12 <NA> <unk> play fun <unk> right <unk> it 's adaptable to change <unk> right it opens possibility <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 235.93 245.78 <NA> and it 's cooperative it 's actually how we do our social bonding and it 's intrinsically motivated what that means is that we play to play play is its own reward 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 245.77 253.92 <NA> now if you look at these five ways of being these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 255.08 264.53 <NA> <unk> is not defined by the method section of a paper it 's actually a way of being which is here and this is true for anything that is creative so
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 264.37 269.64 <NA> if you add rules to play you have a game that 's actually what an experiment is 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 269.63 274.62 <NA> so armed with these two ideas that science is a way of being
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 283.59 285.26 <NA> <unk> because they 're experts in play <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 285.26 294.82 <NA> so i took my bee arena down to a small school in devon <unk> and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 294.51 298.45 <NA> but through the process of science to see themselves differently
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 298.23 299.62 <NA> <unk> right <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 299.43 304.82 <NA> the first step was to ask a question <unk> now <unk> i should say that we didn 't get
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 304.78 313.31 <NA> <unk> funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn 't make a useful contribution to science and the teachers said kids couldn 't do it 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 313.09 315.08 <NA> so we did it anyway right 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 315.1 324.54 <NA> of course <unk> so here are some of the questions i put them in small print so you wouldn 't bother reading it point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 324.3 329.97 <NA> were actually the basis of science publication the last five to fifteen years <unk> right <unk> so they were asking
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 329.96 333.6 <NA> <unk> questions that were significant to expert scientists 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 333.29 343.8 <NA> now here <unk> i want to share the stage with someone quite special <unk> right <unk> she was one of the young people who was involved in this study and she 's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 343.58 349.83 <NA> right <unk> she will now once she comes onto stage will be the youngest person to ever speak at ted 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 351.27 360.19 <NA> <unk> and asking questions is about courage <unk> now she is the personification of courage because she 's going to stand up here and talk to you all so amy would you please come up 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 370.2 375.02 <NA> so amy 's going to help me tell the story of what we call the blackawton bees project <unk> and first she 's going to
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 379.84 388.79 <NA> <unk> easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think <unk> because we look alike <unk> but we wondered if there 's a possible link
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 388.59 397.67 <NA> with other animals it 'd be amazing if humans and bees thought similar <unk> since they seem so different from us <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 397.6 404.97 <NA> so we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way really we wanted to know if bees
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 405.16 412.21 <NA> can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions <unk> so
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 412 414.12 <NA> what if bees can think like us well it
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 413.92 419.16 <NA> 'd be amazing since we 're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 419.16 424.81 <NA> but it actually makes a lot of sense they should because bees like us can recognize a good flower
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 436.2 448.24 <NA> <unk> was to design an experiment <unk> which is a game <unk> so the kids went off and they designed this experiment and so well game and so amy can you tell us what the game was and the puzzle that you set the bees ao the
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 447.99 449.72 <NA> puzzle we came up with was
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 454.96 459.26 <NA> <unk> to a certain color flower only when it 's in a certain pattern 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 459.1 468.68 <NA> they were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 468.25 474.74 <NA> now there 's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle <unk> the interesting question is which what
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 474.43 479.73 <NA> was really exciting about this project was we and beau had no idea whether it would work
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 479.99 484.14 <NA> <unk> completely new and no one had done it before including adults bl 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 485.69 487.76 <NA> including the teachers <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 487.76 499.96 <NA> and that was really hard for the teachers it 's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he 's doing because that 's what we do in the lab but for a teacher not to know what 's going to happen at the end of the day so much of the credit goes to dave strudwick who was the collaborator on
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 501.9 510.82 <NA> <unk> i 'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read read about it but the next step is observation <unk> so here are some of the students
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 510.45 513.98 <NA> doing the observations they 're recording the data of where the bees fly
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 538.57 541.88 <NA> <unk> so we 've got our observations we 've got our data they do the simple
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 541.68 549.44 <NA> mathematics averaging etc etc <unk> and now we want to share that 's the next step so we 're going to write this up and try to submit this for publication <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 549.01 552.21 <NA> right <unk> so we have to write it up so we go of course to the pub
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 554.99 557.34 <NA> <unk> the one on the left is mine <unk> okay 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 557.14 567.39 <NA> now i tell them a paper has four different sections an introduction a methods a results a discussion the introduction says <unk> what 's the question and why methods what did you do results what was the <unk>
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 567.29 572.89 <NA> <unk> observation <unk> and the discussion is who cares <unk> right <unk> that 's a science paper basically 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 575.85 582.76 <NA> <unk> i put it into a narrative <unk> which means that this paper is written in kidspeak it 's not written by me it 's written by amy
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 582.53 585.31 <NA> and the other students in the class 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 584.97 589.54 <NA> as a consequence this science paper begins once upon a time 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 592.26 600.08 <NA> the results section it says training phase the puzzle duh duh duuuuuhhh right and the methods it says then we put the bees
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 603.43 606.77 <NA> <unk> this is a science paper we 're going to try to get it published <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 606.43 612.44 <NA> so here 's the title page <unk> we have a number of authors there all the ones in bold are eight to ten years old 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 612.07 617.9 <NA> the first author is blackawton primary school because if it were ever referenced it would be blackawton et al 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 617.5 625.02 <NA> and not one individual so we submit it to a public access journal <unk> and it says this it said many things but it said this i 'm afraid the
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 634.67 636.03 <NA> <unk> get it reviewed <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 635.54 644.63 <NA> so i sent it to dale purves who is at the national academy of science one of the leading neuroscientists in the world <unk> and he says this is the most original science paper i have ever read 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 644.63 654 <NA> and it certainly deserves wide exposure larry maloney expert in vision says the paper is magnificent the work would be publishable if done by adults 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 654.9 657.91 <NA> <unk> do we send it back to the editor they say no <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 657.6 666.4 <NA> so we asked larry and natalie hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists right <unk> putting in the references 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 665.94 668.59 <NA> and we submit it to biology letters <unk> 
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 668.25 672.95 <NA> and there <unk> it was reviewed by five independent referees <unk> and it was published
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 682.66 688.07 <NA> <unk> it took four months to do the science <unk> two years to get it published

BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 861.17 866.65 <NA> this project was really exciting for me because it brought the process of discovery to life and it
BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 866.65 872.46 <NA> showed me that anyone and i mean anyone has the potential to discover something new and that

BeauLotto_2012G 1 BeauLotto_2012G 886.58 895.33 <NA> surprisingly easy once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle <unk> i then realized that science isn 't just a boring subject <unk>
