SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 31.64 42.18 <NA> and all of that goes back to a decision that roy had to make about three years ago so you see roy price is a senior executive with amazon studios that 's the tv production <unk>

SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 66 79.97 <NA> that roy can 't just choose any show he has to find shows that are really really great <unk> so in other words <unk> he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here so this curve here is the rating
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 79.99 90.23 <NA> <unk> distribution of about two thousand five hundred tv shows on the website imdb and the rating goes from one to ten <unk> and the height here shows you how many shows <unk>

SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 125.74 129.94 <NA> getting on the left end of the curve because i think you would have to have some serious brainpower
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 129.95 132.47 <NA> to undercut toddlers and tiaras so
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 132.29 146.42 <NA> what he 's worried about is this this middle bulge here the bulge of average tv you know those shows that aren 't really good or really bad they don 't really get you excited so he needs to make sure that he 's really on the right end of this <unk>
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 146.42 150.08 <NA> so the pressure is on and of course
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 150.04 163.26 <NA> <unk> it 's also the first time that amazon is even doing something like this so roy price does not want to take any chances he wants to engineer success he needs a guaranteed success <unk> and so what he does is he holds a competition <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 163.26 173.07 <NA> so he takes a bunch of ideas for tv shows and from those ideas through an evaluation they select eight candidates for tv shows 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 172.83 179.94 <NA> and then he just makes the first episode of each one of these shows and puts them online for free for everyone to watch <unk> and so
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 179.99 183.69 <NA> <unk> when amazon is giving out free stuff you 're going to take it right so
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 183.98 188.1 <NA> millions of viewers are watching those episodes <unk>

SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 197.56 205 <NA> they record when somebody presses play when somebody presses pause what parts they skip what parts they watch again <unk> so they collect millions
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 204.99 215.41 <NA> <unk> of data points <unk> because they want to have those data points to then decide which show they should make and sure enough so they collect all the data they do all the data crunching <unk> and an answer emerges <unk>
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 215.36 221.74 <NA> <unk> and the answer is amazon should do a sitcom about four republican us senators 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 229.84 239.13 <NA> <unk> seems like not too many of you here remember that show actually because it didn 't turn out that great it 's actually just an average show actually literally in fact because
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 239.13 249.62 <NA> the average of this curve here is at seven point four and alpha house lands at seven point five so a slightly above average show but certainly not what roy price and his team were aiming for 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 251.87 254.59 <NA> <unk> about the same time <unk> at another company 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 254.38 267.61 <NA> another executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis and his name is ted <unk> ted sarandos who is the chief content officer of netflix and just like roy he 's on a constant mission to find that great tv show <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 267.61 279.94 <NA> and he uses data as well to do that except he does it a little bit differently so instead of holding a competition what he did and his team of course was they looked at all the data they already had about netflix viewers you know the ratings
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 279.99 283.78 <NA> <unk> give their shows the viewing histories what shows people like and so on 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 283.58 293.83 <NA> and then they use that data to discover all of these little bits and pieces about the audience what kinds of shows they like what kind of producers what kind of actors and once they had all of these pieces <unk>
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 293.73 303.8 <NA> <unk> together they took a leap of faith <unk> and they decided to license not a sitcom about four senators but a drama series about a single senator
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 305.22 306.95 <NA> <unk> you guys know the show 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 307.21 313.94 <NA> laughter yes house of cards and netflix of course nailed it with that show at least for the first two seasons 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 317.23 323.96 <NA> house of cards gets a nine point one rating on this curve so it 's exactly where they wanted it to be 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 323.59 328.17 <NA> now the question of course is what happened here so you have two very competitive
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 329.8 332.07 <NA> of these millions of data points <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 331.58 337.24 <NA> and then it works beautifully for one of them and it doesn 't work for the other one so why <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 337.24 350.05 <NA> because logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time i mean if you 're collecting millions of data points on a decision you 're going to make then you should be able to make a pretty good decision you have two hundred years of statistics to rely
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 350.52 356.77 <NA> <unk> amplifying it with very powerful computers the least you could expect is good tv right 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 357.42 361.12 <NA> and if data analysis does not work that way 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 361.11 372.37 <NA> then it actually gets a little scary <unk> because we live in a time where we 're turning to data more and more to make very serious decisions that go far beyond tv 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 372.3 374.27 <NA> does anyone here know the company
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 379.93 388.04 <NA> <unk> systems is a software company <unk> and i hope that nobody here in this room ever comes into contact with that software <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 387.58 390.26 <NA> because if you do it means you 're in prison 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 391 399.27 <NA> if someone here in the us is in prison <unk> and they apply for parole then it 's very likely that data analysis software from that company
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 399.08 404.97 <NA> will be used in determining whether to grant that parole <unk> so it 's the same principle as amazon
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 404.93 414.63 <NA> <unk> and netflix but now instead of deciding whether a tv show is going to be good or bad <unk> you 're deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad <unk> and
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 414.44 418.27 <NA> mediocre tv twenty two minutes that can be pretty

SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 421.91 429.97 <NA> and unfortunately there is actually some evidence that this data analysis despite having lots of data does not always produce optimum results
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 430.34 440.32 <NA> <unk> and that 's not because a company like multi health systems doesn 't know what to do with data even the most data savvy companies get it wrong <unk> yes <unk> even google gets it wrong sometimes

SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 515.07 528.68 <NA> and over the years i 've noticed a sort of pattern or kind of rule if you will about the difference between successful <unk> decision making with data and unsuccessful decision making and i find this a pattern worth sharing <unk> and it goes something like this
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 530.41 540.53 <NA> <unk> so whenever you 're solving a complex problem you 're doing essentially two things the first one is you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces so that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces and <unk>
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 540.43 547.25 <NA> <unk> then of course you do the second part you put all of these bits and pieces back together again to come to your conclusion <unk> and
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 550.04 556.83 <NA> <unk> taking apart and putting back together again and now the crucial thing is that
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 556.63 561.13 <NA> data and data analysis is only good for the first part 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 561.13 568.08 <NA> data and data analysis no matter how powerful can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 567.65 577.38 <NA> it 's not suited to put those pieces back together again and then to come to a conclusion <unk> there 's another tool that can do that and we all have it and that tool is the brain 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 577.07 579.94 <NA> if there 's one thing a brain is good at it 's taking bits

SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 588.23 594.7 <NA> and that 's why i believe that netflix was so successful because they used data and brains where they belong in the process <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 594.27 601.36 <NA> they use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience that they otherwise wouldn 't have been able to understand at that depth <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 601.36 604.97 <NA> but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces and put them back
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 604.93 610.68 <NA> <unk> together again and make a show like house of cards that was nowhere in the data ted sarandos and his team
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 610.44 618.41 <NA> made that decision to license that show <unk> which also meant by the way that they were taking a pretty big personal risk with that decision <unk> 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 617.92 624.99 <NA> and amazon on the other hand they did it the wrong way around they used data all the way to drive their decision making first when they held their competition of
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 625 628.83 <NA> <unk> tv ideas then when they selected alpha house

SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 630.24 641.64 <NA> which of course was a very safe decision for them because they could always point at the data saying this is what the data tells us but it didn 't lead to the exceptional results that that they were hoping for 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 641.66 648.51 <NA> so data is of course a massively useful tool to make better decisions <unk> but i believe
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 648.05 654.88 <NA> that things go wrong when data is starting to drive those decisions <unk> no matter how powerful data is just
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 654.87 660.58 <NA> <unk> tool and to keep that in mind i find this device here quite useful many of you will 
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 660.84 665.92 <NA> before there was data this was the <unk> decision making device to use laughter
SebastianWernicke_2015X 1 SebastianWernicke_2015X 666.69 674.93 <NA> many of you will know this this toy here is called the magic eight ball and it 's really amazing because if you have a decision to make a yes or no question all you have to do is you shake the
