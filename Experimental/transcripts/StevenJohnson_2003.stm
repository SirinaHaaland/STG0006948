StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 30.05 31.59 <NA> i live
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 31.64 41.46 <NA> right there in the west village so the plume was luckily blowing west away from us we had a <unk>

StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 54.96 63.01 <NA> <unk> the thoughts that i had dealing with these two separate emergences of a of a book and a baby <unk> and having this event happen so close
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 62.76 70.6 <NA> that my first thought when i was still kind of in the apartment looking out at it all or walking out on the street and looking out on it just in front of our building was
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 70.6 76.64 <NA> that i 'd made a terrible miscalculation in the book that i 'd just written because so much of that book was a celebration of the
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 79.75 89.81 <NA> <unk> potential of density of largely urban density of connecting people and putting them together in one place and putting them on sidewalks together and having them share ideas and share physical space together 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 89.41 91.83 <NA> and it seemed to me looking at that
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 91.66 101.13 <NA> that tower burning and then falling those towers burning and falling that in fact one of the lessons here was that density kills <unk> and that of all the technologies that were exploited
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 100.9 103.55 <NA> to to make that carnage
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 103.09 104.46 <NA> come into being
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 105.05 114 <NA> <unk> probably the single group of technologies that that cost the most lives were those that enable fifty thousand people to live
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 113.6 117.21 <NA> in two buildings one hundred and ten stories above the ground
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 117.2 125.14 <NA> <unk> if they hadn 't been crowded you compare the loss of life at the pentagon to the to the twin towers and you can see that very powerfully <unk> and so i started
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 125.61 130.21 <NA> <unk> you know density density i 'm not sure if you know this was the right call
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 130.35 138.8 <NA> <unk> and i kind of ruminated on that for a couple of days <unk> and then about two days later the wind started to change a little bit and you could
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 138.62 144.28 <NA> you could sense that the air was not healthy <unk> and so even though there were no cars still
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 143.82 152.14 <NA> in the west village where we lived my wife sent me out to buy a you know a large air filter at the bed bath and beyond

StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 155.2 161.99 <NA> <unk> and so i went out and obviously i 'm physically a very strong person as you can tell so i
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 161.95 169.92 <NA> wasn 't worried about carrying this thing twenty blocks and i walked out and this really miraculous thing happened to me as i was walking north
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 169.69 174.93 <NA> to buy this air filter <unk> which was that the streets were completely alive
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 176.24 181.12 <NA> <unk> there was an incredible it was you know a beautiful day as it was for about a week after <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 180.88 190.44 <NA> and the west village had never seemed more lively i walked up along hudson street where jane jacobs had lived and written her great book that so influenced what i was writing in emergence
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 190.44 193.87 <NA> past the white horse tavern that great old bar where
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 193.68 199.81 <NA> dylan thomas drank himself to death and the bleecker street playground was filled with kids and all the people who lived in the
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 200.82 209.23 <NA> <unk> owned restaurants and bars in the neighborhood were all out there had them all open people were out there were no cars so it seemed even better in some ways <unk> and
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 209.06 215.47 <NA> it was a beautiful urban day <unk> and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 215.28 222.79 <NA> the city was there all the things that make a great city successful and all the things that make a great city stimulating they were all on display there
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 222.3 224.81 <NA> on those streets <unk> and i
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 225.82 235.25 <NA> <unk> this is the power of a city i mean the power of the city we talked about cities as being centralized in space but what makes them so strong most of the time is they 're decentralized in function 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 235.08 245.42 <NA> they don 't have a center executive branch that you can take out and cause the whole thing to fail <unk> if they did it probably was right there at ground zero i mean you know the emergency bunker was right there was destroyed by the <unk>
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 245.37 254.28 <NA> by the attacks and obviously the the damage done to the building and the lives but nonetheless just twenty blocks north two days later <unk> the city had never looked more
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 254.87 260.49 <NA> <unk> alive if you 'd gone into the minds of the people well you would have seen a lot of trauma and you would have seen a lot of heartache 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 260.49 265.65 <NA> and you would have seen a lot of things that would take a long time to recover but the system itself of this city
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 265.16 271.32 <NA> was thriving <unk> so i took heart in seeing that so
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 271.52 275.17 <NA> i wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 275.52 279.01 <NA> <unk> so well and how some of those reasons kind of map on
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 278.58 292.09 <NA> to where the web is going right now the question that i found myself asking to people when i was talking about the book afterwards is when you 've talked about emergent behavior when you 've talked about collective intelligence <unk> the best way to get people to kind of wrap their heads around that is to ask 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 292.08 294.13 <NA> who builds a neighborhood <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 293.67 304.94 <NA> who decides that soho should have this personality and that the latin quarter should have this personality well there are some kind of executive decisions but mostly the answer is everybody and nobody everybody contributes a little bit
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 305.56 314.36 <NA> no single person is really the the ultimate actor behind the personality of a neighborhood <unk> same thing to the question of who was keeping the streets alive
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 313.93 321.23 <NA> post 9 eleven in my neighborhood well it was the whole city the whole system kind of working on it and everybody contributing a small little part <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 321.19 325.11 <NA> and this is increasingly what we 're starting to see on the web
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 325.04 333.99 <NA> <unk> in a bunch of interesting ways most of which weren 't around actually except in very experimental things when i was writing emergence and when the book came out so it 's been a very
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 333.8 345.36 <NA> optimistic time i think and i want to just talk about a few of those things <unk> i think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that 's starting to emerge online right now and the old one
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 344.99 349.98 <NA> looked like this this is not the future
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 349.76 354.88 <NA> king of england although it looks like it it 's some guy it 's a geocities homepage of some guy that i found
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 354.81 365.02 <NA> <unk> online who 's interested if you look at the bottom in soccer and jesus and garth brooks and clint beckham and my hometown those are his links <unk> but nothing really says this model of interactivity which was so <unk>
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 364.92 370.37 <NA> <unk> exciting and captures the the real the web zeitgeist of one thousand nine hundred and ninety five than 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 379.93 390.19 <NA> <unk> put up a picture of your dog and link to it and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link <unk> and you know i don 't want to belittle that that in a sense to
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 390.2 391.29 <NA> reference
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 390.81 396.33 <NA> what jeff was talking about yesterday that was in a sense the kind of interface electricity that powered a lot of the
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 396.33 404.97 <NA> the explosion of interest in the web that you could put up a link and somebody could click on it and it could take you anywhere you wanted to go <unk> but it 's still a very one to one kind of relationship there 's one person
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 404.9 409.83 <NA> <unk> putting up the link and there 's another person on the other end trying to decide whether to click on it or not 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 410.09 415.62 <NA> the new model is much more like this and we 've already seen a couple of references to this 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 415.22 424.96 <NA> this is what happens when you search steven johnson on google about two months ago <unk> i had the great breakthrough one of my great kind
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 425 429.7 <NA> <unk> shining achievements which is that my website finally became a top result for steven johnson
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 429.87 438.13 <NA> <unk> there 's some theoretical physicist at mit named steven johnson who has dropped two spots i 'm happy to say 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 438.9 440.38 <NA> and you know 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 440.7 450.08 <NA> i mean i 'll look at a couple of things like this but google is obviously the greatest technology ever invented for navel gazing <unk> it 's just that there are so many other people in your navel when you
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 454.84 462.08 <NA> <unk> creating this page obviously and we all know this but it 's worth just thinking about it is not some person deciding that i am the the number one
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 461.88 464.24 <NA> answer for steven johnson <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 464.02 473.24 <NA> but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it and google just sitting there and running the numbers
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 473.5 479.94 <NA> <unk> so there 's this collective decision making that 's going on this page is effectively collectively authored by the web
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 480.32 489.36 <NA> and google is just helping us kind of to put the authorship in one kind of coherent place <unk> now they 're more innovative well google 's pretty innovative but there are some new
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 488.87 498.27 <NA> twists on this there 's this incredibly interesting new site technorati that 's filled with lots of little widgets that are expanding on these and these are
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 497.9 500.02 <NA> looking in the in the blog world and the
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 501.42 503.32 <NA> <unk> he 's analyzed basically
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 502.83 508.45 <NA> all the weblogs out there that he 's tracking and he 's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 508.45 516.16 <NA> and so you have kind of an authority a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 516 522.46 <NA> <unk> and so at any given time on any given page on the web actually you can say what does the weblog community think about this page
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 522 529.37 <NA> and you can get a list this is what they think about my site it 's ranked by blog authority you can also rank it by the latest posts
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 529.92 539.09 <NA> so when i was talking in emergence i talked about the limitations of the one way linking architecture that basically you could link to somebody else but they wouldn 't necessarily know that you were pointing to them 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 539.11 549.66 <NA> and that was one of the reasons why the web wasn 't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two way linking you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things well something like technorati
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 550.76 555.94 <NA> <unk> what 's interesting here is that this is a quote from dave weinberger where he talks about everything being
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 555.7 560.73 <NA> purposive in the web there 's nothing artificial he has this line where he says you know you 're going to
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 560.24 569.34 <NA> put up a link there if you see a link somebody decided to put it there and he says the link to one site didn 't just grow on the the other page like a tree fungus 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 568.88 572.59 <NA> and in fact i think that 's not entirely true anymore
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 572.4 575.44 <NA> i could put up a feed of all those links
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 575.23 579.94 <NA> generated by technorati on the right hand side of my page and they would change as the overall
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 580.08 589.42 <NA> <unk> ecology of the web changes that little list there would change i wouldn 't really be directly in control of it so it 's much closer in a way to a data fungus in a sense wrapped around that page than
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 589.38 592.99 <NA> it is to a deliberate link that i 've placed there <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 593.31 600.49 <NA> now what you 're having here is basically a global brain that you 're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it 's thinking
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 600.24 604.94 <NA> <unk> and there are all these interesting tools google does the google zeitgeist
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 604.95 611.3 <NA> which looks at search requests to test what 's going on what people are interested in and they publish it with lots of fun graphs <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 611.3 621.98 <NA> and i 'm saying a lot of nice things about google so i 'll be i 'll be saying one little critical thing there 's a problem with the google zeitgeist which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching for britney spears pictures <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 621.49 629.88 <NA> which is not necessarily news the columbia blows up suddenly there are a lot of searches on columbia well you know we should expect to see that
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 630.02 639.9 <NA> <unk> 's not necessarily something we didn 't know already <unk> so the key thing in terms of these new tools that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 640.07 644.23 <NA> the question is are you finding out something new and one of the things that i
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 644.23 650.49 <NA> experimented with is this thing called google share which is basically <unk> you take an abstract term <unk> and
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 650.03 654.94 <NA> you search google for that term <unk> and then you search the results that you get
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 654.87 656.74 <NA> <unk> back for somebody 's name <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 656.73 665.02 <NA> so basically the number of pages that mention this term <unk> that also mention this page the percentage of those pages is that person 's google share of that term <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 664.65 672.55 <NA> so you can do kind of interesting contests like for instance this is a google share of the ted conference <unk> so
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 672.78 679.97 <NA> richard saul wurman has about a fifteen percent google share of the ted conference our good friend chris
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 680.04 684.53 <NA> has about a six percent but with a bullet i might add 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 685.03 692.27 <NA> but the interesting thing is you can broaden the search a little bit and it turns out actually that forty two percent is the the mola mola fish i had no idea no that 's not true 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 696.52 699.93 <NA> i made that up because i just wanted to put up a slide of the mola
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 702.59 709.83 <NA> <unk> i also did and i don 't want to start a little fight in the next panel but i did a google share analysis of evolution and natural selection
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 709.67 716.79 <NA> <unk> so right here now this is a big category you have smaller percentages so this is zero point seven percent
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 716.93 725.02 <NA> dan dennett who 'll be speaking shortly right below him zero point five percent steven pinker <unk> so dennett 's in
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 725 732.28 <NA> <unk> lead a little bit there <unk> but what 's interesting is you can then broaden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of of what else is out there so
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 732 741.64 <NA> gary bauer is not too far behind has slightly different theories about about evolution and natural selection <unk> and right behind him is
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 741.24 743.41 <NA> l ron hubbard so 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 744.51 749.87 <NA> you can see we 're in the ascot which is always good and by the way chris that would 've been a really good panel <unk> i think
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 755.08 758.36 <NA> <unk> hubbard apparently started to reach but besides that i think it would be good next year
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 758.14 766.49 <NA> <unk> another quick thing this is a slightly different thing but this analysis some of you may have seen it just came out this is bursty words looking at the
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 766.36 769.64 <NA> historical record of state of the union addresses <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 769.6 778.25 <NA> so these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere so they 're kind of <unk> you know memes that start taking off that didn 't have a lot of historical precedent before <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 778.25 779.94 <NA> so the first one is
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 779.87 789.39 <NA> <unk> these are the bursty words around 1860s slaves emancipation slavery rebellion kansas <unk> that 's britney spears i mean you know <unk> ok interesting they 're talking about slavery in one thousand eight hundred and sixty 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 789.11 798.54 <NA> one thousand nine hundred and thirty five relief depression recovery banks and ok i didn 't learn anything new there as well that 's pretty obvious one thousand nine hundred and eighty five right at the center of the reagan years
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 798.51 799.51 <NA> that 's
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 808.65 813.61 <NA> <unk> all have a lot of syllables so you know you can actually download it 's hard to remember those
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 814.11 822.47 <NA> but seriously actually what you can see there in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise is reagan reinventing the political language of the country
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 822.31 829.49 <NA> and and shifting to a much more intimate much more folksy much more telegenic contracting all those verbs you know twenty years before it was still
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 830.11 835.58 <NA> <unk> what you can do but with reagan it 's that 's where there 's nancy and i that kind of language <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 835.99 840.59 <NA> and so something we kind of knew but you didn 't actually notice syntactically what he was doing i 'll
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 840.58 854.06 <NA> go very quickly the question now and this is the really interesting question is what kind of higher level shape is emerging right now in the overall web ecosystem and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs because they are really kind of
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 853.57 854.88 <NA> at the cutting edge
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 854.9 864.92 <NA> <unk> think what happens there will also happen in the wider system now there was a very interesting article by clay shirky that got a lot of attention about a month ago <unk> and this is basically the distribution of links
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 864.76 868.14 <NA> on the web to all these various different blogs
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 867.92 879.88 <NA> <unk> it follows a power law so that there are a few extremely well linked to popular blogs and a long tail of blogs with very few links <unk> so twenty percent of the blogs get eighty
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 879.81 881.86 <NA> <unk> percent of the of the links
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 881.85 890.62 <NA> <unk> now this is a very interesting thing it 's caused a lot of controversy because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man one modem democracy where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 890.49 899.84 <NA> <unk> and so the question is why is this happening it 's not being imposed by fiat from above it 's an emergent property of the blogosphere right now <unk> 
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 900.22 910.55 <NA> <unk> what 's great about it is that people are working on within seconds of clay publishing this piece people started working on changing the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape <unk>
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 910.45 924.93 <NA> <unk> would start appearing and basically the shape appears largely because of a kind of a first mover advantage if you 're the first site there everybody links to you if you 're the second site there <unk> most people link to you and so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future and then you get this kind of
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 925.64 930.55 <NA> <unk> and so what dave sifry at technorati started working on literally as shirky started
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 930.55 940.89 <NA> after he published his piece was something that basically just gave a new kind of priority to newcomers <unk> and he started looking at interesting newcomers that don 't have a lot of links that suddenly get
StevenJohnson_2003 1 StevenJohnson_2003 940.43 941.95 <NA> a bunch of links in the last
