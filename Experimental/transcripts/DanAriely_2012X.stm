DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 314.86 318.59 <NA> then we asked them do you want to build another one for $ two point seven

DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 337.02 343.74 <NA> so this was an endless cycle of them building and us destroying in front of their eyes <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 344.15 350.11 <NA> now what happens when you compare these two conditions <unk> the first thing that happened was that people

DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 356.75 366.38 <NA> and by the way we should point out that this was not big meaning people were not curing cancer or building bridges people were building bionicles for a few a few cents 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 366.18 377.71 <NA> and not only that everybody knew that the bionicles would be destroyed quite soon so there was not a real opportunity for big meaning <unk> but even the small meaning made a difference 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 378 379.88 <NA> now we had another version of this
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 379.81 391.98 <NA> <unk> experiment in this other version of the experiment we didn 't put people in this situation <unk> we just described to them the situation much as i am describing to you now <unk> and we asked them to predict what the result would be

DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 401.69 405.58 <NA> <unk> in the meaningful condition people would probably build one more bionicle 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 405.58 412.92 <NA> so people understand that meaning is important they just don 't understand the magnitude of the importance the extent to which it 's important 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 413.18 416.19 <NA> there was one other piece of data we looked at 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 416.03 424.99 <NA> if you think about it <unk> there are some people who love legos and some people who don 't <unk> and you would speculate that the people who love legos would build more legos even for less
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 425.4 434.95 <NA> <unk> because after all they get more internal joy from it and the people who love legos less would build less legos because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 434.49 442.87 <NA> and that 's actually what we found in the meaningful condition <unk> there was a very nice correlation between the love of legos <unk> and the amount of legos people built

DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 880.23 887.68 <NA> <unk> i think a little bit like the ikea effect by getting people to work harder they actually got them to love what they 're doing to a higher degree <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 887.61 890.8 <NA> so how do we look at this question experimentally <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 890.55 893.08 <NA> we asked people to build some origami <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 893.08 902.15 <NA> we gave them instructions on how to create origami and we gave them a sheet of paper <unk> and these were all novices <unk> and they built something that was really quite ugly
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 901.96 904.1 <NA> nothing like a frog or a crane
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 905.05 913.49 <NA> <unk> but then we told them look this origami really belongs to us you worked for us but i 'll tell you what we 'll sell it to you how much do you want to pay for it 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 913.15 915.99 <NA> and we measured how much they were willing to pay for it <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 915.99 925.16 <NA> and we had two types of people we had the people who built it <unk> and the people who did not build it and just looked at it as external observers 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 924.7 929.91 <NA> and what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 930.98 936.6 <NA> and they were willing to pay five times more for them than the people who just evaluated them externally <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 936.41 945.78 <NA> now you could say if you were a builder do you think [ you 'd say ] oh <unk> i love this origami <unk> but i know that nobody else would love it 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 945.98 949.96 <NA> or i love this origami <unk> and everybody
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 950.31 954.09 <NA> <unk> love it as well which one of those two is correct 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 954.1 964 <NA> turns out the builders not only loved the origami more they thought that everybody would see the world in their view they thought everybody else would love it more as well 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 964.08 969.04 <NA> in the next version we tried to do the ikea effect <unk> we tried to make it more difficult <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 968.61 974.72 <NA> so for some people we gave the same task for some people we made it harder by hiding the
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 976 982.85 <NA> <unk> at the top of the sheet we had little diagrams of how you fold origami for some people we just eliminated that 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 982.6 987.78 <NA> so now this was tougher what happened well in an objective
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 987.33 990.23 <NA> way <unk> the origami now was uglier it
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 989.95 992 <NA> was more difficult <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 991.57 1000.29 <NA> now when we looked at the easy origami <unk> we saw the same thing builders loved it more evaluators loved it less when you looked at the hard instructions
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1000.49 1002.06 <NA> <unk> the effect was
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1001.84 1008.24 <NA> larger why because now the builders loved it even more 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1008.23 1013.19 <NA> they put all this extra effort into it and evaluators <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1012.79 1018.65 <NA> they loved it even less <unk> because in reality it was even uglier than the first version 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1019.6 1024.99 <NA> of course this tells you something about how we evaluate things now
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1028.01 1030.57 <NA> <unk> how much would you sell your kids for 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1031.25 1038.91 <NA> your memories and associations and so on most people would say for a lot a lot of money on good days 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1039.77 1050.07 <NA> laughter but imagine this was slightly different imagine if you did not have your kids and one day you went to the park and you met some kids they were just like your kids and you played with them for a few hours <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1050.06 1054.94 <NA> and when you were about to leave the parents said hey <unk> by the way <unk> just before you leave if you 're interested

DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1061.29 1067.52 <NA> most people say not that much <unk> and this is because our kids
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1067.34 1079.79 <NA> are so valuable not just because of who they are but because of us <unk> because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection by the way if you think ikea instructions
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1080.02 1083.72 <NA> <unk> good what about the instructions that come with kids those are really tough 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1083.74 1086.21 <NA> laughter by the way <unk> these are my kids <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1086.21 1097.23 <NA> which of course are wonderful and and so on which comes to tell you one more thing which is much like our builders when they look at the creature of their creation <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1096.99 1099.99 <NA> we don 't see that other people don 't see things our
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1102.44 1104.46 <NA> <unk> let me say one last comment 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1104.69 1108.39 <NA> if you think about adam smith versus karl marx <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1108.5 1112.62 <NA> adam smith had a very important notion of efficiency <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1112.19 1115.35 <NA> he gave an example of a pin factory 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1114.92 1122.61 <NA> he said pins have twelve different steps <unk> and if one person does all twelve steps <unk> production is very low <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1122.61 1129.94 <NA> but if you get one person to do step one and one person to do step two and step three and so on <unk> production can increase tremendously
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1130.01 1135.88 <NA> and indeed this is a great example and the reason for the industrial revolution and efficiency 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1135.75 1141.18 <NA> karl marx on the other hand said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1141.18 1151.87 <NA> in how people think about the connection to what they are doing <unk> and if you do all twelve steps you care about the pin <unk> but if you do one step every time maybe you don 't care as much <unk>
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1152.04 1154.97 <NA> i think that in the industrial revolution
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1155.07 1158.22 <NA> adam smith was more correct than karl marx <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1157.98 1161.15 <NA> but the reality is that we 've switched <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1160.92 1163.2 <NA> and now we 're in the knowledge economy <unk>
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1162.99 1166.06 <NA> you can ask yourself what happens in a knowledge economy
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1166.06 1174.96 <NA> is efficiency still more important than meaning <unk> i think the answer is no <unk> i think that as we move to situations in which people have
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1174.72 1179.91 <NA> to decide on their own about how much effort attention caring how connected they feel to
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1180.07 1186 <NA> <unk> are they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on all of a sudden
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1185.75 1188.61 <NA> marx has more things to say to us <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1188.3 1193.59 <NA> so when we think about labor we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing <unk> 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1193.59 1199.72 <NA> but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it meaning creation challenges ownership 
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1201.93 1212.05 <NA> <unk> the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them how do we create our own meaning pride motivation and how do we do it in our workplace and for the <unk>
DanAriely_2012X 1 DanAriely_2012X 1211.95 1217.55 <NA> <unk> employees i think we could get people to be both more productive and happier <unk> thank you very much
