JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 313.21 321.24 <NA> and so i lived in kigali for about two and a half years <unk> doing these two things and it was an extraordinary time in my life and it taught me
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 321.05 325.14 <NA> three lessons that i think are so important for us today
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 325.1 330.51 <NA> <unk> and certainly in the work that i do the first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth

JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 337.18 343.41 <NA> but as human beings we also want to see each other and we want to be heard by each other and we should never forget that 
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 343.34 346.81 <NA> the second is that traditional charity and aid
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 346.6 349.99 <NA> are never going to solve the problems of poverty i think andrew pretty well covered
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 350.25 359.32 <NA> <unk> so i will move to the third point <unk> which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty <unk> yes we ran this as a business <unk> 
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 358.95 363.77 <NA> but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 363.44 369.55 <NA> that came into the training and the management support the strategic advice and maybe most important of all 
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 369.18 373.69 <NA> the access to new contacts networks and new markets <unk> 
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 373.69 379.82 <NA> and so <unk> on a micro level there 's a real role for this combination of investment and
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 379.78 383.42 <NA> <unk> philanthropy <unk> and on a macro level some of the speakers have
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 383.02 390.65 <NA> inferred that even health should be privatized but having had a father with heart disease and realizing that

JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 837.25 841.35 <NA> establishment another six dollars to distribute it so
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 841.17 848.6 <NA> the market price in a free market would be about twelve dollars per net most people can 't afford that so let 's give it away free and we said well <unk> there 's another option 
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 848.6 852.83 <NA> let 's use the market as the best listening device we have 
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 852.46 854.97 <NA> and understand at what price people would pay
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 854.93 863.23 <NA> <unk> for this so they get the dignity of choice we can start building local distribution and actually it can cost the public sector much less 
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 862.99 866.74 <NA> and so we came in with a second round of patient capital to a to z

JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 876.21 879.97 <NA> but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 879.78 888.25 <NA> <unk> net and make a decision to buy it and when you listen to them they 'll also have a lot to say about what they like and what they don 't like and that
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 888.05 895.78 <NA> some of the channels we thought would work didn 't work but because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed because of the patient capital <unk> 
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 895.78 904.88 <NA> we 've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector to distribute and a dollar to buy the net <unk> so then from a policy perspective when you start with the market
JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 904.89 909.53 <NA> we have a choice <unk> we can continue going along at twelve dollars a net

JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 1 JacquelineNovogratz_2007G 912.34 921.38 <NA> or we could at least experiment with some of it to charge one dollar a net costing the public sector another six dollars a net
