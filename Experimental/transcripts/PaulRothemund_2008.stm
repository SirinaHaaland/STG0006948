PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 529.38 535.55 <NA> well actually this all looks like <unk> nano artwork but it turns out that <unk> nano artwork is just what you need to make <unk> nano circuits 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 535.55 545.94 <NA> so you can put circuit components on the staples like a light bulb and a light switch let the thing assemble and you 'll get some kind of a circuit and then you can maybe wash the dna away and have the circuit left over so 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 545.73 549.96 <NA> this is what some colleagues of mine at caltech did they took a dna origami <unk> organized some carbon
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 550.49 561.09 <NA> <unk> made a little switch you see here wired it up tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch now this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer <unk> so
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 560.63 570.72 <NA> we have a long way to go but this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one tenth the size of those in a normal computer <unk> so it 's very <unk>
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 570.62 579.04 <NA> <unk> promising for making small computers now <unk> i want to get back to that compiler the dna origami is a proof that that compiler actually works 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 579.99 586.33 <NA> <unk> start with something in the computer you get a high level description of the computer program a high level description of the origami
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 586.17 599.79 <NA> <unk> you can compile it to molecules send it to a synthesizer and it actually works and it turns out that a company has made a nice program that 's much better than my code which was kind of ugly and will allow us to do this in a nice visual computer aided design way <unk> 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 599.79 604.97 <NA> so now you can say all right why isn 't dna origami the end of the story <unk> you have your molecular compiler you can do whatever
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 604.93 609.11 <NA> <unk> you want the fact is that it does not scale <unk> so
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 608.62 622.76 <NA> if you want to build a human from dna origami the problem is you need a long strand that 's ten trillion trillion bases long that 's three light years <unk> ' worth of dna so we 're not going to do this we 're going to turn to another technology 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 622.3 624.96 <NA> called algorithmic self assembly of tiles it
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 627.77 638.62 <NA> <unk> has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a dna origami <unk> you zoom in there are just four dna strands and they have little single stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles if they match <unk> 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 638.62 649.87 <NA> and we like to draw these tiles as little squares <unk> and if you look at their sticky ends these little dna bits you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern so these tiles would make a complicated self assembling
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 650.61 656.98 <NA> <unk> and the point of this <unk> if you didn 't catch that is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 656.82 665.41 <NA> patterns <unk> and a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs specifically counting 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 665.41 675.2 <NA> so you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard so you can read off binary numbers five
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 676.6 689.63 <NA> <unk> and in order to get these kinds of computations started right you need some kind of input a kind of seed you can use dna origami for that you can encode the number thirty two in the right hand side of a dna origami and when you add those tiles that count 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 689.63 691.71 <NA> they will start to count
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 691.52 703.89 <NA> they will read that thirty two and they 'll stop at thirty two so what we 've done is we 've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going <unk> it knows when to stop growing because it can count it knows how big it
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 705.11 709.75 <NA> <unk> that sort of first question i was talking about it doesn 't tell us how babies do it however <unk> 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 709.54 719.97 <NA> so now <unk> we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than dna origami could otherwise <unk> here 's the dna origami and what we can do is we can write thirty two on both edges <unk>
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 719.87 725.4 <NA> <unk> of the dna origami <unk> and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles <unk> 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 730.04 744.59 <NA> the counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing so what we 've done is is we 've succeeded in making something something much bigger than a dna origami by combining dna origami with tiles and the neat thing about it is is that it 's also reprogrammable <unk> 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 744.59 750.02 <NA> you can just change a couple of the dna strands in this binary representation and you 'll get
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 751.66 756.8 <NA> <unk> and if you do that the origami 's the same size <unk> but the resulting square that you get
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 756.34 758.57 <NA> is three times bigger 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 758.41 768.23 <NA> so this sort of recapitulates what i was telling you about development <unk> you have a very sensitive computer program where small changes single tiny little mutations <unk>
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 768.18 773.81 <NA> can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger <unk> 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 779.9 781.65 <NA> <unk> developmental process
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 781.25 791.97 <NA> is something that also has bearing on craig venter 's question so you can ask how many dna strands are required to build a square of a given size <unk> if we wanted to make a square of size ten <unk>
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 791.92 804.91 <NA> one hundred or one thousand if we used dna origami alone we would require a number of dna strands that 's the square of the size of that square so we 'd need one hundred ten thousand or a million dna strands that 's really not affordable
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 804.92 810.7 <NA> but if we use a little computation we use origami <unk> plus some tiles that count
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 810.47 815.26 <NA> then we can get away with using one hundred two hundred or three hundred dna strands 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 814.98 821.9 <NA> and so we can exponentially reduce the number of dna strands we use if we use counting if we use a little bit of computation <unk> 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 821.9 829.97 <NA> and so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something to reduce the size of the genome
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 829.75 831.56 <NA> <unk> genome that you 're building 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 831.22 845.58 <NA> and finally i 'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers <unk> if you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory <unk> 
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 845.58 850.02 <NA> so if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles rather than to the
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 849.81 854.61 <NA> the staple strands you affix them to the tiles then they 'll self assemble the somewhat complicated circuits the

PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 894.18 904.88 <NA> so it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago and that 's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things so i think we made a lot of progress we 've got ideas about how to fix these errors <unk> and i
PaulRothemund_2008 1 PaulRothemund_2008 905.02 910.46 <NA> <unk> in the next five or ten years we 'll make the kind of squares that i described and maybe even get to some of those
