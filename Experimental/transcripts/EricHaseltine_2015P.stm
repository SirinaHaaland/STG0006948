EricHaseltine_2015P 1 EricHaseltine_2015P 361.14 364.9 <NA> no <unk> he wanted movies the
EricHaseltine_2015P 1 EricHaseltine_2015P 364.41 372.49 <NA> problem was that even the genius microscopes that he invented were just too slow <unk> so what did he do <unk> he came up with a <unk>

EricHaseltine_2015P 1 EricHaseltine_2015P 424.37 429.73 <NA> to infect cells also you see those little squiggly wormlike things moving around those are
EricHaseltine_2015P 1 EricHaseltine_2015P 429.72 437.83 <NA> <unk> actin molecules unfortunately viruses also climb down those things to get into the cell nucleus to replicate themselves and make you sick 
EricHaseltine_2015P 1 EricHaseltine_2015P 437.79 446.27 <NA> now that we can look at movies of what 's actually going on deep inside a cell <unk> we have a much better chance of curing viral diseases
EricHaseltine_2015P 1 EricHaseltine_2015P 446.11 450.14 <NA> like aids <unk> so when you look at a movie like this it 's very

EricHaseltine_2015P 1 EricHaseltine_2015P 498.17 504.94 <NA> it 's just like no it 's exactly like oxygen binding to iron and making it rust so you age because
EricHaseltine_2015P 1 EricHaseltine_2015P 504.99 506.2 <NA> <unk> rust out
EricHaseltine_2015P 1 EricHaseltine_2015P 506.94 513.31 <NA> oh <unk> and scientists also know there is something called immortality 
EricHaseltine_2015P 1 EricHaseltine_2015P 512.91 518.99 <NA> in cancer cells <unk> so if you stop aging all of you
EricHaseltine_2015P 1 EricHaseltine_2015P 518.54 526.06 <NA> are going to turn into giant walking malignant tumors these are cherished beliefs <unk> but could de grey be on to something
