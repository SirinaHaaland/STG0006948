StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 84.69 97.61 <NA> i believe science is pursued and the way it seems to be perceived <unk> so this difference first came to me in some ways in my dual role at columbia university where i 'm both a professor and run a laboratory
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 97.61 104.61 <NA> in neuroscience where we try to figure out how the brain works we do this by studying the sense of smell the sense of olfaction

StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 134.43 142.25 <NA> so what was the difference well the course i was and am teaching is called cellular and molecular neuroscience

StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 246.03 254.55 <NA> nonetheless this is what i think we were leaving out of our courses and leaving out of of the interaction that we have with the public as scientists the

StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 267.72 275.02 <NA> something i can finally excel at perhaps for example <unk> so i did start teaching this course on ignorance and it 's been quite interesting and i

StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 292.09 304.55 <NA> because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations and i clearly don 't mean any of those so i don 't mean stupidity i don 't mean a callow callow indifference to fact or reason or data <unk> the ignorant are clearly unenlightened

StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 325.82 338.23 <NA> <unk> the kind of ignorance that 's maybe best summed up in a statement by james clerk maxwell perhaps the greatest physicist between newton and einstein who said thoroughly conscious ignorance is the prelude to every real advance in science i think it
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 338.23 341.62 <NA> 's a wonderful idea thoroughly conscious

StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 342.35 354.94 <NA> so that 's the kind of ignorance that i want to talk about today but of course the first thing we have to clear up is what are we going to do with all those facts so it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate <unk> we all have this sense that science is this mountain of
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 354.9 359.12 <NA> <unk> facts this accumulation model of science as many have called it 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 359.12 373.7 <NA> and it seems impregnable it seems impossible how can you ever know all of this and indeed <unk> the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate in two thousand and six there were one point three million papers published there 's about a two and a half percent yearly growth rate and so
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 373.52 374.9 <NA> last year we saw over
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 375.16 385.7 <NA> <unk> a half million papers being published divide that by the number of minutes in a year and you wind up with three new papers per minute <unk> so i 've been up here a little over ten minutes i 've already lost three papers <unk>
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 385.65 399.81 <NA> i have to get out of here actually i have to go read <unk> so what do we do about this well the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect if you will <unk> we just don 't worry about it in a way the facts are
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 400.28 412.6 <NA> <unk> you have to know a lot of stuff to be a scientist that 's true <unk> but knowing a lot of stuff doesn 't make you a scientist you need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer or an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter <unk> 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 412.6 419.52 <NA> but in science <unk> knowing a lot of stuff is not the point knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 419.9 426.48 <NA> to more ignorance <unk> so knowledge is a big subject <unk> but i would say ignorance is a bigger one <unk> 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 426.05 429.85 <NA> so this leads us to maybe think about a little bit about some of the models of
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 429.81 440.14 <NA> <unk> science that we tend to use and i 'd like to disabuse you of some of them so one of them a popular one is that scientists are patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together to reveal some grand scheme <unk>
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 440.04 446.95 <NA> <unk> or another this is clearly not true for one with puzzles <unk> the manufacturer has guaranteed that there 's a solution 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 455.05 469.95 <NA> <unk> so i think the puzzle model doesn 't work another popular model is that science is busy unraveling things the way you unravel the peels of an onion so peel by peel you take away the layers of the onion to get at some fundamental kernel of truth i don 't think that 's the way it works either 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 469.95 474.99 <NA> another one a kind of popular one is the iceberg idea that we only see the tip of the iceberg but
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 475 482.44 <NA> <unk> underneath is where most of the iceberg is hidden but all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts that we can somehow or another
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 482.26 492.75 <NA> get completed we can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is or we could just wait for it to melt i suppose these days but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg right <unk> 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 492.75 504.91 <NA> or make it manageable but i don 't think that 's the case i think what really happens in science is a model more like the magic well where no matter how many buckets you take out there 's always another bucket of water to be had or my particularly favorite one
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 504.75 511.76 <NA> <unk> one with the effect and everything <unk> the ripples on a pond so if you think of knowledge being this ever expanding ripple on a pond <unk> 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 511.55 522.04 <NA> the important thing to realize is that our ignorance the circumference of this knowledge also grows with knowledge <unk> so the knowledge generates ignorance <unk> this is really <unk>
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 521.94 529.97 <NA> <unk> well said i thought by george bernard shaw this is actually part of a toast that he delivered to celebrate einstein at a dinner celebrating einstein 's work
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 530.13 532.16 <NA> in which he claims that science just
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 531.99 539.6 <NA> creates more questions than it answers [ science is always wrong it never solves a problem without creating ten more ] i find that kind of glorious <unk> and i think he 's precisely right <unk> plus it 's a kind of job security 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 539.65 554.37 <NA> as it turns out he kind of cribbed that from the philosopher immanuel kant who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea of question propagation that every answer begets more questions i love that term question propagation this idea of questions
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 555.29 565.98 <NA> <unk> out there <unk> so i 'd say the model we want to take is not that we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together and then we gain we gain knowledge it 's rather kind of the other way around really 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 565.98 574.9 <NA> what do we use this knowledge for what are we using this collection of facts for we 're using it to make better ignorance to come up with if you will

StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 588.36 594.79 <NA> 's what the argument is about it 's the ignorance it 's the what we don 't know <unk> it 's what makes a good question <unk> 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 594.78 602.66 <NA> so how do we think about these questions i 'm going to show you a graph that that shows up quite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 602.42 603.77 <NA> this graph asks
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 604.78 616.46 <NA> <unk> relationship between what you know and how much you know about it <unk> so what you know you can know anywhere from nothing to everything of course and how much you know about it can be anywhere from a little to a lot
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 616.03 617.6 <NA> <unk> so
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 617.23 625.08 <NA> let 's put a point on the graph there 's an undergraduate doesn 't know much but they have a lot of interest they 're interested in almost everything <unk> now
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 625.04 637.26 <NA> <unk> you look at a master 's student a little further along in their education and you see they know a bit more but it 's been narrowed somewhat and finally you get your ph d where it turns out you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 638.87 642.93 <NA> what 's really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 642.83 650.02 <NA> because of course when it dips below the zero axis there it gets into a negative area that 's where you find people
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 652.35 665.6 <NA> <unk> the important thing here is that this can all be changed this whole view can be changed by just changing the label on the x axis so instead of how much you know about it we could say what can you ask about it 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 665.6 671.27 <NA> so yes you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 671.09 679.97 <NA> is not just to know a lot of stuff that just makes you a geek <unk> right <unk> knowing a lot of stuff the purpose is to be able to ask lots of questions to be able to frame thoughtful interesting

StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 690.15 697.67 <NA> straightforward so for example we could say well what is it that the brain does well one thing the brain does it moves us around we walk around on two legs
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 704.99 711.42 <NA> <unk> not that interesting so instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at how about the visual system
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 711.56 721.56 <NA> there it is the visual system i mean we love our visual systems we do all kinds of cool stuff indeed there are over twelve thousand neuroscientists who work on the visual system <unk>

StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 810.59 820.93 <NA> what 's the process by which that could happen here 's another example two very simple molecules again in this kind of chemical notation it might be easier to visualize them this way so the gray circles are carbon <unk>

StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 1010.27 1016.32 <NA> so we always will get what we screen for and part of what we screen for is in our testing methods well 
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 1016.32 1028.11 <NA> we hear a lot about testing and evaluation and we have to think carefully when we 're testing whether we 're evaluating or whether we 're weeding <unk> whether we 're weeding people out whether we 're making some cut
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 1029.57 1041.91 <NA> <unk> evaluation is one thing you hear a lot about evaluation in the literature these days in the educational literature but evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts to an opportunity for trial and error it amounts to
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 1041.48 1046.71 <NA> a chance to work over a longer period of time with with this kind of feedback

StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 1075 1085.07 <NA> i 'll ask someone <unk> i 'll phone someone <unk> i 'll find out because that 's what we want people to do and that 's how you evaluate them and maybe for the advanced placement classes it could be here 's the <unk>
StuartFirestein_2013 1 StuartFirestein_2013 1084.97 1094.41 <NA> <unk> answer what 's the next question that 's the one i like in particular so let me end with a quote from william butler yeats who said education is not about filling buckets
