RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 960.96 970.72 <NA> that 's an average some people need more some people need less and what you need to do is listen to your body do you need that much or do you need more simple as that 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 970.72 974.38 <NA> old people need less sleep not true 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 974.22 979.97 <NA> the sleep demands of the aged do not go down essentially sleep fragments and becomes less

RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 983.23 993.44 <NA> and the fourth myth is early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy <unk> wealthy and wise well that 's wrong at so many different levels 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 994.93 1003.91 <NA> laughter there is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early gives you more wealth at all there 's no difference in socioeconomic status 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1003.6 1004.94 <NA> in my experience
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1004.99 1012.23 <NA> <unk> only difference between morning people and evening people is that those people that get up in the morning early are just horribly smug 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1016.18 1017.31 <NA> ok <unk> 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1017.31 1027.09 <NA> so for the last few minutes what i want to do is change gears and talk about some really new breaking areas of neuroscience which is the association between
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1026.85 1029.85 <NA> mental health mental illness and sleep disruption
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1029.86 1037.42 <NA> we 've known for one hundred and thirty years that in severe mental illness there is always always sleep disruption
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1037.42 1049.99 <NA> but it 's been largely ignored in the <unk> 1970s when people started to think about this again they said yes well of course you have sleep disruption in schizophrenia <unk> because they 're on antipsychotics <unk> it 's the antipsychotics causing
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1051.42 1054.07 <NA> <unk> the fact that for a hundred years previously 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1054.09 1062.72 <NA> sleep disruption had been reported before antipsychotics <unk> so what 's going on several groups are studying
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1062.27 1072.53 <NA> conditions like depression schizophrenia and bipolar and what 's going on in terms of sleep disruption we have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1072.48 1078.7 <NA> <unk> and the data were quite extraordinary in those individuals with schizophrenia <unk> 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1079.96 1090.77 <NA> <unk> they were awake during the night phase and then they were asleep during the day <unk> other groups showed no 24 hour patterns whatsoever their sleep was absolutely smashed <unk> and some
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1090.46 1098.13 <NA> had no ability to regulate their sleep by the light dark cycle they were getting up later and later and later and later each night <unk> it was smashed <unk> 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1098.13 1100.46 <NA> so what 's going on 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1100.15 1103.61 <NA> and the really exciting news is that
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1103.27 1104.94 <NA> mental illness and
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1104.93 1107.52 <NA> <unk> sleep are not simply associated <unk> 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1107.52 1118.17 <NA> but they are physically linked within the brain <unk> the neural networks that predispose you to normal sleep give you normal sleep and those that give you normal mental health are overlapping <unk> 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1117.86 1121.99 <NA> and what 's the evidence for that <unk> well <unk> genes
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1121.83 1124.87 <NA> that have been shown to be very important in the generation of normal
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1125.85 1130.93 <NA> <unk> when mutated when changed also predispose individuals to mental health problems 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1130.93 1136.4 <NA> and last year we published a study which showed that a gene that 's been linked to schizophrenia <unk>
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1136.19 1145.81 <NA> when mutated also smashes the sleep <unk> so we have evidence of a genuine mechanistic overlap between these two important systems <unk> 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1145.32 1154.91 <NA> other work flowed from these studies <unk> the first was that sleep disruption actually precedes certain types of mental illness
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1154.9 1167.33 <NA> <unk> and we 've shown that in those young individuals who are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clinical diagnosis of of bipolar 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1166.93 1170.42 <NA> the other bit of data was that
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1171.99 1174.9 <NA> sleep disruption may actually exacerbate make
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1176.33 1181.62 <NA> <unk> mental illness state my colleague dan freeman has used a range of agents which have stabilized sleep
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1181.61 1190.2 <NA> and reduced levels of paranoia in those individuals by fifty percent so what have we got <unk> we 've got <unk> in
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1189.83 1193.68 <NA> these connections some really exciting things 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1193.25 1203.04 <NA> in terms of the neuroscience by understanding these two systems we 're really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain <unk> 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1202.67 1204.97 <NA> the second area is that
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1205.04 1213.94 <NA> if we can use sleep and sleep disruption as an early warning signal then we have the chance of going in if we know these individuals are vulnerable
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1213.94 1225.23 <NA> early intervention then becomes possible <unk> and the third which i think is the most exciting is that we can think of the sleep centers within the brain as a new therapeutic target <unk> stabilize sleep in those individuals
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1225.19 1235.82 <NA> <unk> who are vulnerable we can certainly make them healthier <unk> but also alleviate some of the appalling symptoms of mental illness <unk> so let me just finish what i started by saying is 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1235.82 1242.76 <NA> take sleep seriously our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a pre industrial age when we were almost
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1242.59 1248.34 <NA> wrapped in a duvet we used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep and this isn 't
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1248.13 1254.82 <NA> some sort of crystal waving nonsense this is a pragmatic response to good health <unk> if you have good sleep

RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1265.16 1271.92 <NA> <unk> of anger your impulsivity and your tendency to drink and take drugs <unk> and we finished by saying
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1280.08 1286.84 <NA> <unk> illness and indeed is providing us new ways to treat these incredibly debilitating conditions <unk> 
RussellFoster_2013G 1 RussellFoster_2013G 1287.16 1295.97 <NA> jim butcher <unk> the fantasy writer said sleep is god go worship and i can only recommend that you do the same <unk> thank you
