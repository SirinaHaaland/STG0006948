NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 12.58 24.08 <NA> <unk> last ten years i 've been spending my time trying to figure out how and why human beings assemble themselves into social networks and the kind of social network i 'm talking about is not the recent online variety <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 24.08 25.2 <NA> but rather the kind
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 25 35.13 <NA> kind of social networks that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years <unk> ever since we emerged from the african savannah so i form friendships and co worker and sibling <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 35.03 44.32 <NA> <unk> and relative relationships with other people who in turn have similar relationships with other people and this spreads on out endlessly into a distance and you get a network that looks like this 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 54.96 65.68 <NA> <unk> and my colleague james fowler and i have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical social biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 65.4 70.36 <NA> and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate how they affect our lives <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 69.9 79.94 <NA> but recently we 've been wondering whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight to actually find ways to improve the world to do something better to actually fix things
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 79.9 81.98 <NA> <unk> not just understand things 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 82.24 88.43 <NA> so one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 88 93.6 <NA> and the current state of the art in predicting an epidemic if you 're the cdc or some other national body
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 93.41 104.97 <NA> is to sit in the middle where you are and collect data from physicians and laboratories in the field that report the prevalence or the incidence of certain conditions so so and so patients have been diagnosed with something
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 104.96 116.52 <NA> <unk> or other patients have been diagnosed and all these data are fed into a central repository with some delay <unk> and if everything goes smoothly one to two weeks from now you 'll know where the epidemic was today
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 117.14 125.02 <NA> and actually about a year or so ago there was this promulgation of the idea of google flu trends with respect to the flu where
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 125.19 134.56 <NA> <unk> by looking at people 's searching behavior today <unk> we could know where the flu what the status of the epidemic was today what 's the prevalence of the <unk> <unk> of the epidemic today <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 134.1 145.33 <NA> but what i 'd like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just rapid warning about an epidemic <unk> but also actually early detection of an epidemic and 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 144.84 149.93 <NA> in fact this idea can be used not just to predict epidemics of germs <unk> but
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 150 153.47 <NA> <unk> to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 153.43 163.61 <NA> for example anything that spreads by a form of social contagion could be understood in this way from abstract ideas on the left like patriotism <unk> or altruism <unk> or <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 163.51 174.87 <NA> <unk> religion to practices like dieting behavior or book purchasing or drinking or bicycle helmet [ and ] other safety practices <unk> or products that people might buy purchases of electronic
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 175.58 184.91 <NA> <unk> anything in which there 's kind of an interpersonal spread a kind of a diffusion of innovation could be understood and predicted by the mechanism i 'm going to show you now 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 184.91 187.41 <NA> so as all of you probably know 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 187.07 189.84 <NA> the classic way of thinking about this is the <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 190.91 199.78 <NA> <unk> the adoption curve <unk> so here on the y axis we have the percent of the people affected <unk> and on the x axis we have time and at the very beginning not too many people are
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 200.46 203.72 <NA> <unk> and you get this classic sigmoidal or s shaped curve <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 203.72 216.77 <NA> and the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning let 's say one or two people are infected or affected by the thing and then they affect or infect two people who in turn affect four eight sixteen and so forth <unk> and you get the epidemic growth
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 216.59 229.94 <NA> phase of the curve <unk> and eventually you saturate the population there are fewer and fewer people who are still available that you might infect and then you get the plateau of the curve <unk> and you get this classic sigmoidal curve <unk> and this holds for germs
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 230.31 234.86 <NA> <unk> ideas product adoption behaviors <unk> and the like 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 234.52 246.23 <NA> but things don 't just diffuse in human populations at random they actually diffuse through networks <unk> because as i said we live our lives in networks and these networks have a particular kind of a structure 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 246.22 249.87 <NA> now if you look at a network like this this is one hundred and five people and the
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 250 258.01 <NA> <unk> lines represent the dots are the people and the lines represent friendship relationships you might see that people occupy different locations within the network 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 257.77 266.45 <NA> and there are different kinds of relationships between the people you could have friendship relationships sibling relationships <unk> spousal relationships co worker relationships <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 266.45 269.32 <NA> neighbor relationships and the like 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 269.09 276.88 <NA> and different sorts of things spread across different sorts of ties <unk> for instance sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 276.64 279.94 <NA> or <unk> for instance people 's smoking behavior might be influenced by their
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 279.87 287.03 <NA> <unk> friends <unk> or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers or by their neighbors <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 287.03 300.05 <NA> but not all positions in the network are the same so if you look at this you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections <unk> some people have one connection some have two some have six some have ten connections <unk> and this is
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 300.94 304.43 <NA> <unk> of a node or the number of connections that a node has 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 304 316.99 <NA> but in addition there 's something else <unk> so if you look at nodes a and b they both have six connections <unk> but if you can see this image [ of the network ] from a bird 's eye view you can appreciate that there 's something very different about nodes a and <unk> b 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 316.99 324.99 <NA> so let me ask you this i can cultivate this intuition by asking a question who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network <unk> a or
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 326.72 334.59 <NA> <unk> it 's obvious <unk> b is located on the edge of the network now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 334.49 344.43 <NA> a and you have an immediate appreciation that a is going to be more likely to get the thing that 's spreading and to get it sooner by virtue of their structural location <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 344.38 350.28 <NA> within the network <unk> a in fact is more central <unk> and this can be formalized mathematically <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 355.02 365.14 <NA> <unk> we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network <unk> including node a monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network and somehow get an early <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 365.04 379.64 <NA> <unk> detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network <unk> so if you saw them contract a germ or a piece of information you would know that soon enough everybody was about to contract this germ or this piece of information <unk> and this would be much better
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 379.81 385.46 <NA> <unk> monitoring six randomly chosen people <unk> without reference to the structure of the population and
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 385.39 395.48 <NA> in fact if you could do that what you would see is something like this on the left hand panel again we have the s shaped curve of adoption in the dotted red line we show what the adoption would be in the <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 395.38 403.08 <NA> <unk> random people and in the left hand line <unk> shifted to the left <unk> we show what the adoption would be in the central individuals within the network <unk> on the
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 404.72 415.02 <NA> <unk> contagion and on the x axis is the time and on the right hand side we show the same data <unk> but here with daily incidence and what we show here is like here very few people are affected more and more and more and up to here <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 414.97 429.18 <NA> and here 's the peak of the epidemic <unk> but shifted to the left is what 's occurring in the central individuals <unk> and this difference in time between the two is the early detection the early warning we can get about an impending epidemic in the human population
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 429.93 434.99 <NA> <unk> however is that mapping human social networks is not always possible 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 434.99 442.51 <NA> it can be expensive not feasible <unk> unethical or frankly <unk> just not possible to do such a thing 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 442.32 448.96 <NA> so how can we figure out who the central people are in a network without actually mapping the network <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 448.74 454.76 <NA> what we came up with was an idea to exploit an old fact or a known fact about social networks
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 454.9 461 <NA> <unk> which goes like this do you know that your friends have more friends than you do 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 461.14 464.87 <NA> your friends have more friends than you do and
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 464.5 475.14 <NA> this is known as the friendship paradox imagine a very popular person in the social network like a party host who has hundreds of friends and a misanthrope who has just one friend <unk> and you pick someone
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 475.1 486.27 <NA> <unk> at random from the population <unk> they were much more likely to know the party host and if they nominate the party host as their friend that party host has a hundred friends <unk> therefore has more friends than they do <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 485.9 496.5 <NA> and this in essence is what 's known as the friendship paradox the friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree <unk> and are more central than the random people themselves <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 496.45 501.67 <NA> <unk> and you can get an intuitive appreciation for this if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 505.05 510.28 <NA> <unk> person who by construction must have at least two and typically more friends 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 509.85 523.09 <NA> and that happens at every peripheral node <unk> and in fact it happens throughout the network as you move in everyone you pick when they nominate a random when a random person nominates a friend of theirs you move closer to the center of the network <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 522.75 529.43 <NA> so <unk> we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 529.9 539.76 <NA> <unk> now with this idea we can take a random sample of people have them nominate their friends those friends would be more central and we could do this without having to map the network <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 539.76 545.37 <NA> and we tested this idea with an outbreak of h1n1 flu at harvard college
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 545.16 550.17 <NA> in the fall and winter of two thousand and nine just a few months ago <unk> we took one thousand three hundred randomly selected
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 551.12 561.45 <NA> <unk> we had them nominate their friends and we followed both the random students and their friends daily in time to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic <unk> and we did this passively by looking <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 561.35 566.71 <NA> <unk> at whether or not they 'd gone to university health services and also we had them [ actively ] email us a couple of times a week 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 575.4 585.25 <NA> <unk> and the difference in the two is sixteen days by monitoring the friends group we could get sixteen days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 584.79 586.1 <NA> now 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 585.86 596.24 <NA> in addition to that if you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic or to predict the adoption of a product for example what you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 596.24 604.88 <NA> also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends and follow both the randoms and the friends among the friends the first evidence you saw of a blip
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 604.84 610.4 <NA> <unk> above zero in adoption of the innovation for example would be evidence of an impending epidemic 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 610.4 620.67 <NA> or you could see the first time the two curves diverged as shown on the left when did the randoms when did the friends take off and leave the randoms and [ when did ]
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 620.43 624.99 <NA> their curve start shifting and that as indicated by the white line <unk> occurred
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 626.21 635.16 <NA> <unk> before the peak of the epidemic so this would be a technique whereby we could get more than a month and a half warning about a flu epidemic in a particular population 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 634.91 645 <NA> i should say that how far advanced a notice one might get about something depends on a host of factors it could depend on the nature of the pathogen different pathogens <unk> using <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 644.9 652.09 <NA> <unk> this technique you 'd get different warning or other phenomena that are spreading <unk> or frankly on the structure of the human network <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 654.9 666.74 <NA> <unk> could also actually map the network of the students so this is a map of seven hundred and fourteen students and their friendship ties <unk> and in a minute now i 'm going to put this map into motion we 're going to take daily cuts through the network for one hundred and twenty days 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 666.74 675.67 <NA> the red dots are going to be cases of the flu <unk> and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu <unk> and the size of the dots is going to be proportional to <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 675.3 679.85 <NA> how many of their friends have the flu <unk> so bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 679.86 690.2 <NA> and if you look at this image here we are now in september the 13th you 're going to see a few cases light up you 're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle here we are on october the 19th the slope <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 690.1 699.96 <NA> <unk> of the epidemic curve is approaching now in november bang bang bang bang bang you 're going to see lots of blooming in the middle and then you 're going to see a sort of leveling off fewer and fewer cases towards the end of december <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 705.2 708.42 <NA> <unk> individuals first before they affect others 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 708.14 715.39 <NA> now as i 've been suggesting this method is not restricted to germs but actually to anything that spreads in populations 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 715.39 724.75 <NA> information spreads in populations <unk> norms can spread in populations behaviors can spread in populations <unk> and by behaviors i can mean things like criminal behavior <unk> or voting
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 725.43 735.82 <NA> <unk> or health care behavior like smoking or vaccination <unk> or product adoption or other kinds of behaviors that relate to interpersonal influence <unk> if i 'm likely to do something that affects others around <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 735.72 741.91 <NA> <unk> me this technique can get early warning or early detection about the adoption within the population <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 753.22 764.57 <NA> <unk> the same insights can also be exploited with respect to networks can also be exploited in other ways <unk> for example in the use of targeting specific people for interventions <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 764.08 768.36 <NA> so for example most of you are probably familiar with the notion of herd immunity <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 768.36 774.87 <NA> so if we have a population of a thousand people and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen we don 't have to immunize
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 775 785.19 <NA> <unk> every single person <unk> if we immunize nine hundred and sixty of them it 's as as if we had immunized a hundred [ percent ] of them <unk> because even if one or two of the non immune people gets infected there 's no one for them to <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 785.09 790.62 <NA> <unk> infect they are surrounded by immunized people so ninety six percent is as good as one hundred percent well
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 800.58 802.18 <NA> <unk> and the answer is no <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 802.5 811.73 <NA> but if you took this thirty percent these three hundred people and had them nominate their friends and took the same number of vaccine doses and vaccinated the friends of
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 811.68 822.44 <NA> <unk> the three hundred the three hundred friends you can get the same level of herd immunity as if you had vaccinated ninety six percent of the population at a much greater efficiency with a strict budget constraint 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 829.92 844.07 <NA> in villages we could target to whom to give the interventions to foster these kinds of spreads or frankly for advertising with all kinds of products if we could understand how to target it could affect the efficiency of what we 're trying to achieve <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 844.21 854.88 <NA> and in fact we can use data from all kinds of sources nowadays [ to do this ] this is a map of eight million phone users in a european country every dot is a person and every line represents a volume of
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 854.84 864.96 <NA> <unk> calls between the people and we can use such data that 's being passively obtained to map these whole countries and understand who is located where within the network without actually <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 864.86 874.84 <NA> <unk> having to query them at all we can get this kind of a structural insight and other sources of information as you 're no doubt aware are available about such features from email interactions online
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 875.85 881.38 <NA> <unk> online social networks and so forth <unk> and in fact we are in the era of what i would call <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 882.45 887.54 <NA> <unk> data collection efforts they 're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 887.3 897.07 <NA> to create sensor networks to follow the population <unk> understand what 's happening in the population <unk> and intervene in the population for the better <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 896.73 904.94 <NA> because these new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom but where everyone is and what they 're thinking based on what they 're uploading
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 904.9 916.07 <NA> <unk> on the internet <unk> and what they 're buying based on their purchases <unk> and all this administrative data can be pulled together and processed to understand human behavior in a way we never could before <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 915.91 925.17 <NA> so for example we could use truckers ' purchases of fuel <unk> so the truckers are just going about their business and they 're buying fuel <unk> and we see a blip up in the truckers
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 925.13 928.42 <NA> <unk> purchases of fuel <unk> and we know that a recession is about to end <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 928.21 936.25 <NA> or we can monitor the velocity with which people are moving with their phones on a highway and the phone company can see as the velocity
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 936.25 946.15 <NA> is slowing down that there 's a traffic jam <unk> and they can feed that information back to their subscribers but only to their subscribers on the same highway located behind the traffic jam <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 945.92 954.82 <NA> or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors passively and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within [ networks of ] doctors or again we can monitor
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 954.75 961 <NA> <unk> purchasing behavior in people and watch how these types of phenomena can diffuse within human populations <unk> 
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 961.11 973.88 <NA> and there are three ways i think that these massive passive data can be used one is fully passive like i just <unk> described as in for instance the trucker example where we don 't actually intervene in the population in any way one is
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 975.16 985.31 <NA> <unk> like the flu example i gave where we get some people to nominate their friends and then passively monitor their friends do they have the flu or not and then get warning or another example <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 985.21 995.42 <NA> <unk> would be if you 're a phone company you figure out who 's central in the in the network and you ask those people look will you just text us your fever every day just text us your temperature and collect vast <unk>
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 995.32 1004.46 <NA> <unk> amounts of information about people 's temperature <unk> but from centrally located individuals and be able on a large scale to monitor an impending epidemic with very minimal input from people
NicholasChristakis_2010S 1 NicholasChristakis_2010S 1004.99 1020.06 <NA> <unk> can be more fully active as i know subsequent speakers will also talk about today where people might globally participate in wikis <unk> or photographing or monitoring elections and upload information in a way that allows us to pool information in order to understand social processes and social phenomena
