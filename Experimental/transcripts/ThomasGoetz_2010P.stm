ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 14.86 15.92 <NA> <unk> we can tap
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 15.91 24.56 <NA> a really underutilized resource in health care <unk> which is the patient <unk> or as i like to use the the scientific term people
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 25.16 29.44 <NA> <unk> because we are all patients we are all people even doctors are patients at some point 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 29.44 36.69 <NA> so i want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have have failed to engage with very well in this country
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 36.41 44.17 <NA> and in fact worldwide if you want to get at the big part i mean from a public health level where my training is you 're looking at
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 44.17 49.93 <NA> behavioral issues <unk> you 're looking at things where people are actually given information and they 're not following through with
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 51.27 54.31 <NA> <unk> it 's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 54.11 59.15 <NA> obesity many forms of heart disease even some forms of cancer when you think of smoking 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 58.91 66.09 <NA> those are all behaviors where people know what they 're supposed to do they know what they 're supposed to be doing but they 're not doing it <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 66.09 72.13 <NA> now behavior change is something that that is a long standing problem in in medicine it goes all the way back to aristotle
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 71.79 78.32 <NA> <unk> and doctors hate it right i mean they complain about it all the time we talk about it in terms of engagement or
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 79.9 87.65 <NA> <unk> when people don 't take their pills when people don 't follow doctors ' orders these are behavior problems but for as much as clinical medicine
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 87.73 94.11 <NA> agonizes over behavior change there 's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 94.11 101.82 <NA> so the crux of it comes down to this notion of <unk> decision making giving information to people in a form that doesn 't just
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 104.93 111.87 <NA> <unk> actually leads them to make better decisions better choices in their lives one part of medicine though has faced
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 111.71 115.86 <NA> the problem of behavior change pretty well and that 's dentistry 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 115.46 125.05 <NA> dentistry might seem and i think it is many dentists would have to acknowledge it 's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine not a lot of cool sexy stuff happening in dentistry <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 125.05 126.13 <NA> but
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 125.97 129.94 <NA> they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it it 's
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 129.99 138.73 <NA> <unk> one great preventive health success we have in our health care system people brush and floss their teeth <unk> they don 't do it as much as they should <unk> but they do it <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 138.73 141.05 <NA> so i 'm going to talk about one experiment that
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 140.84 144.4 <NA> a few dentists in connecticut cooked up
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 143.94 150.86 <NA> about thirty years ago so this is an old experiment but it 's a really good one because it was very simple <unk> so it 's an easy story to tell 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 150.86 154.97 <NA> so these connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 154.93 160.34 <NA> <unk> their teeth and floss their teeth more often <unk> and they were going to use one variable <unk> they wanted to scare them <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 160.34 167.79 <NA> they wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didn 't brush and floss their teeth <unk> they had a big
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 167.56 175.11 <NA> patient population they divided them up into two groups they had a low fear population where they basically gave them a 13 minute presentation
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 175.04 182.06 <NA> <unk> all based in science but told them that if you didn 't brush and floss your teeth you could get gum disease if you get gum disease <unk> you will lose your teeth
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 181.84 184.44 <NA> but you 'll get dentures and it won 't be that bad so
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 184.13 192.64 <NA> that was the low fear group the high fear group <unk> they laid it on really thick <unk> they showed bloody gums they showed puss
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 192.19 196.95 <NA> oozing out from between their teeth they told them that their teeth were going to fall out 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 196.52 204.37 <NA> they said that they could have infections that would spread from their their jaws to other parts of their bodies and ultimately yes they would lose their teeth they would get dentures
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 204.99 207.01 <NA> <unk> if you got dentures <unk> you weren 't going to be able to eat <unk>
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 208.35 215.96 <NA> <unk> to eat apples you weren 't going to be able to eat steak you 'll eat mush for the rest of your life <unk> so go brush and floss your teeth <unk>
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 215.96 224.89 <NA> that was the message that was the experiment now they measured one other variable they wanted to capture one other variable <unk> which was the patients ' sense of efficacy <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 224.55 229.88 <NA> this was the notion of whether the patients felt that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 229.81 239.51 <NA> <unk> teeth so they asked them at the beginning do you think you 'll actually be able to stick with this program and the people who said yeah yeah i 'm pretty good about that they were characterized as high efficacy <unk> and the people who said 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 239.02 246.41 <NA> eh i never get around to brushing and flossing as much as i should they were characterized as low efficacy <unk> so the upshot
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 246.19 254.91 <NA> was this the upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all the people who
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 254.87 256.68 <NA> <unk> brushed and flossed their teeth
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 256.28 265.11 <NA> were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen it 's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 264.71 270.39 <NA> <unk> so fear showed up as as not really the driver it was the sense of efficacy <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 270.14 274.99 <NA> so i want to isolate this because it was a great observation
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 277.62 285.98 <NA> <unk> and it 's one that 's laid fallow in research it was a notion that really came out of albert bandura 's work <unk> who studied whether
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 285.98 292.3 <NA> people could get a sense of empowerment the notion of efficacy basically boils down to one that
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 291.87 304.61 <NA> if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior in health care terms <unk> you could characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards better health that they can actually see their way towards getting better health
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 305.01 308.03 <NA> 's a very important notion it 's an amazing notion 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 307.87 311.6 <NA> we don 't really know how to manipulate it though that well <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 311.35 317.6 <NA> except <unk> maybe we do <unk> so fear doesn 't work right fear doesn 't work <unk> and this is a great
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 317.47 327.44 <NA> example of how we haven 't learned that lesson at all this is a campaign from the american diabetes association this is still the way we 're communicating messages about health
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 327.44 329.88 <NA> i mean <unk> i showed my three year old this slide last night
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 329.93 339.84 <NA> <unk> 's like papa why is an ambulance in these people 's homes and i had to explain <unk> they 're trying to scare people <unk> and i don 't know if it works <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 339.59 347.31 <NA> now here 's what does work personalized information works <unk> again bandura recognized this years ago decades ago <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 346.85 350.05 <NA> when you give people specific information about their health
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 351.06 359.32 <NA> <unk> and where they want to get to where they might get to that path that notion of a path that tends to work for behavior change <unk> so let me just spool it out a little bit <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 359.19 364 <NA> so you start with personalized data personalized information that comes from an individual <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 364.56 374.29 <NA> and then you need to connect it to their lives <unk> you need to connect it to their lives <unk> hopefully not in a fear based way but one that they understand okay i know where i sit i know where i 'm situated <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 374.28 379.76 <NA> and that doesn 't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers this overload of health information that
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 380.08 389.15 <NA> <unk> 're inundated with but it actually hits home it 's not just hitting us in our heads it 's hitting us in our hearts there 's an emotional connection to information because it 's from us 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 388.87 401.48 <NA> that information then needs to be connected to choices needs to be connected to a range of options <unk> directions that we might go to trade offs benefits finally we need to be presented with a clear point of action <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 401.29 404.7 <NA> we need to connect the information always with the action
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 404.93 412.53 <NA> <unk> and then that action feeds back into different information and it creates of course a feedback loop <unk> now this is a very <unk>
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 413.93 417.55 <NA> <unk> notion for behavior change but the problem is that things
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 418.58 425.23 <NA> <unk> corner there personalized data it 's been pretty hard to come by it 's a difficult and expensive commodity <unk> until
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 426.54 436.2 <NA> <unk> so i 'm going to give you an example a very simple example of how this works so we 've all seen these these are the your speed limit signs you 've seen them all around especially these days as radars are cheaper <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 436.21 449.32 <NA> and here 's how they work in the feedback loop <unk> so you start with the personalized data where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point is twenty five and of course you 're going faster than that we always are we 're always going above the speed limit <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 448.98 454.97 <NA> the choice in this case is pretty simple we either keep going fast or we slow down we should probably slow down
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 455.16 460.35 <NA> and that point of action is probably now we should take our foot off the pedal right now 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 460.11 468.99 <NA> and generally we do these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down they reduce speeds by about five to ten percent <unk> they last for about five miles 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 468.99 478.35 <NA> in which case we put our foot back on the pedal <unk> but it works and it even has some health repercussions your blood pressure might drop a little bit maybe there 's fewer accidents so there 's public health benefits but by and large
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 479.92 489.16 <NA> feedback loop that 's so nifty and too rare <unk> because in health care most health care the data is very removed from the action <unk> it 's very difficult to
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 488.92 491.25 <NA> line things up so neatly <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 490.79 499.95 <NA> but we have an opportunity so i want to talk about i want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country how we actually get information <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 500.37 508.69 <NA> <unk> this is a pharmaceutical ad <unk> actually it 's a spoof it 's not a real pharmaceutical ad <unk> nobody 's had the brilliant idea of calling
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 508.2 511.12 <NA> their drug havidol quite yet <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 511.08 518.15 <NA> but it looks completely right right so it 's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 518.15 522.28 <NA> and it just sounds perfect and then we turn the page of the magazine and <unk>
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 523.73 529.82 <NA> we see this now this is the page the fda requires pharmaceutical companies to put into their ads
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 529.96 535.31 <NA> <unk> to follow their ads and to me this is one of the most cynical exercises in medicine 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 534.94 545.4 <NA> because we know who among us would actually say that people read this and who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of <unk>
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 545.4 549.86 <NA> it this is a bankrupt effort at communicating health information <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 549.46 552.05 <NA> there is no good faith in this <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 552.19 554.97 <NA> so this is a different approach this is an approach
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 555.19 559.6 <NA> that has been developed by a couple researchers at dartmouth
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 559.36 569.28 <NA> medical school lisa schwartz and steven woloshin <unk> and they created this thing called the drug facts box they took inspiration from of all things cap 'n crunch 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 568.79 572.37 <NA> they went to the nutritional information box
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 571.88 574.9 <NA> and saw that what works for cereal works for our
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 576.09 585.52 <NA> <unk> helps people understand what 's in their food <unk> god forbid we should use that same standard that we make cap 'n crunch live by and bring it to drug companies <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 585.45 597.01 <NA> so let me just walk through this quickly <unk> it says very clearly what the drug is for specifically who it is good for so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 597.01 600.13 <NA> you can understand exactly what the benefits are 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 600.37 601.41 <NA> <unk> this kind of
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 600.93 606.59 <NA> vague promise that it 's going to work no matter what but you get the statistics for how effective it is 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 606.31 616.74 <NA> and finally you understand what those choices are you can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects every time you take a drug <unk> you 're walking into a possible side effect 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 616.74 620.63 <NA> so it spells those out in very clean terms <unk> and that works <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 620.2 625.08 <NA> so i love this i love that drug facts box and so i was thinking about what 's an opportunity
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 625.55 628.83 <NA> <unk> i could have to help people understand
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 628.49 631.66 <NA> information what 's another latent
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 631.42 639.36 <NA> body of information that 's out there that people are really not putting to use <unk> and so i came up with this lab test results 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 639.2 644.43 <NA> blood test results are this great source of information they 're packed with information <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 644.15 654.28 <NA> they 're just not for us they 're not for people <unk> they 're not for patients <unk> they go right to doctors and god forbid i think many doctors if you really asked them they don 't really understand all this stuff either
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 655.4 658.48 <NA> <unk> this is the worst presented information <unk>
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 657.99 669.68 <NA> you ask tufte <unk> and he would say yes this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible what we did at wired was we we went and i got our graphic design department to re imagine
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 669.68 674.93 <NA> these lab reports <unk> so that 's what i want to walk you through so this is the general blood work before <unk> and this is the
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 675.46 677.09 <NA> <unk> this is what we came up with 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 676.87 690.02 <NA> the after takes what was four pages that previous slide was was actually the first of four pages of data that 's just the general blood work it goes on and on and on all these values all these numbers you don 't know this is our one page summary
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 692.61 701.37 <NA> we use the notion of color <unk> it 's an amazing notion that color could be used <unk> so on the top level you have your your overall results <unk> the things that might jump out at you from the
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 701.37 704.01 <NA> fine print <unk> then you can drill down and
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 704.99 709.8 <NA> <unk> how actually we put your level in context and we use color to illustrate
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 709.31 715.45 <NA> exactly where your value falls in this case this patient is is slightly at risk of diabetes because of their
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 715.24 721.49 <NA> glucose level likewise you can go over your lipids and again understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 721.49 728.47 <NA> break down into the hdl and the ldl if you so choose but again always using color and personalized proximity to that
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 729.98 735.88 <NA> all those other values all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing <unk> we summarize 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 735.88 741.1 <NA> we tell you that you 're okay you 're normal but you don 't have to wade through it you don 't have to go through the junk <unk> 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 741.06 750.22 <NA> and then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 750.15 754.88 <NA> and then we go a further step we tell them what they can do <unk> we give them some insight into what
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 754.81 757.73 <NA> <unk> choices they can make what actions they can take 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 758.11 760.79 <NA> so that 's our general blood work test 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 760.87 765.92 <NA> then we went to crp test <unk> in this case it 's a sin of omission 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 765.49 773.16 <NA> they have this huge amount of space and they don 't use it for anything so we do now the crp test is often done following a cholesterol test 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 773.16 779.19 <NA> or in conjunction with a cholesterol test so we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 779.99 785.25 <NA> <unk> the way the doctor is going to evaluate it so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 784.76 790.89 <NA> it 's a protein that shows up when your your blood vessels might be inflamed which might be a risk for heart disease
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 790.85 795.42 <NA> <unk> what you 're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 794.93 804.97 <NA> <unk> then we use the information that 's already in the lab report <unk> we use the the person 's age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks so we start to use the
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 805.04 812.8 <NA> the the data we have to run a very simple calculation that 's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is 
ThomasGoetz_2010P 1 ThomasGoetz_2010P 812.82 821.06 <NA> the last one i 'll show you is a psa test here 's the before <unk> and here 's the after now a lot of our effort on this one
