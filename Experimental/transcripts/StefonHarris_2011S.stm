StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 400.19 408.26 <NA> <unk> there are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand we had no idea what key we were going to play in in the middle we sort of
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 408.1 418.78 <NA> made our way into a song called titi boom but that could have happened maybe maybe not everyone 's listening we 're responding you have no time for projected ideas <unk> 
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 418.78 421.72 <NA> so the idea of a mistake <unk> 
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 421.51 425.2 <NA> from the perspective of a jazz musician it 's easier to
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 425.04 426.55 <NA> talk about someone else 's mistake
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 429.9 439.15 <NA> <unk> perceive a mistake when i 'm on the bandstand first of all we don 't really see it as a mistake <unk> the only mistake lies in that i 'm not able to perceive what it is that someone else did

StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 440.59 449.99 <NA> is an opportunity in jazz <unk> so it 's hard to even describe what a funny note would be so for example if i played a color like we were playing on a palette that
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 454.03 456.86 <NA> <unk> if christian played a note like play an f

StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 475 489.57 <NA> <unk> to most people 's ears they would perceive that as a mistake so i 'm going to show you we 're going to play just for a second and we 're going to play on this palette and at some point christian will introduce this note and we won 't react to it he 'll introduce it for a second and then i 'll stop i 'll talk for a second
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 489.11 491.56 <NA> we 'll see what happens when we play with this palette
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 516.72 524.8 <NA> <unk> so someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake <unk> the only way that i would say it was a mistake is in that we didn 't react to it 
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 524.8 529.7 <NA> it was an opportunity that was missed <unk> so it 's unpredictable we 'll paint this palette again
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 530.08 535.41 <NA> <unk> it i don 't know how we 'll react to it but something will change we 'll all accept his ideas <unk> or not

StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 579.75 582.53 <NA> <unk> okay
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 606.12 616.41 <NA> he played this note i ended up creating a melody out of it the texture changed in the drums this time it got a little bit more rhythmic a little bit more intense in response to how i responded to it 
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 616.36 624.59 <NA> <unk> so there is no mistake the only mistake is if i 'm not aware if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 629.93 635.25 <NA> <unk> jazz this bandstand is absolutely amazing it 's a very purifying experience 
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 635.25 649.81 <NA> and i know that i speak for all of us when i tell you that we don 't take it for granted we know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing <unk> so how does this all relate to behavioral finance <unk> well we 're jazz musicians so stereotypically we don 't have a great relationship to finance 
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 653.07 660.58 <NA> <unk> i just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it and the other dynamic of it is is that we don 't micromanage in jazz 
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 660.58 666.4 <NA> you have some people who do but what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 665.91 674.9 <NA> if i come up and i dictate to the band that i want to play like this and i want the music to go this way and i just jump right in ready just play some
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 689.71 700.11 <NA> <unk> 's kind of chaotic because i 'm bullying my ideas i 'm telling them you come with me over this way if i really want the music to go there the best way for me to do it is to listen this is a science of listening it has
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 700 710.22 <NA> far more to do with what i can perceive than what it is that i can do <unk> so if i want the music to get to a certain level of intensity the first step for me is to be patient to listen to what 's going <unk>
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 710.12 718.87 <NA> <unk> on and pull from something that 's going on around me when you do that you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more and gradually it builds watch
StefonHarris_2011S 1 StefonHarris_2011S 761.74 773.97 <NA> <unk> totally different experience when i 'm pulling ideas it 's much more organic it 's much more nuanced it 's not about bullying my vision or anything like that it 's about being here in the moment <unk> accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow
