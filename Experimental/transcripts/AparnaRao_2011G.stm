AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 13.66 23.72 <NA> <unk> i 'm going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects done in collaboration with danish artist soren pors we call ourselves pors and rao <unk> and we live and work in india 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 23.38 29.97 <NA> i 'd like to begin with my very first object which i call the uncle phone and it was inspired by my uncle
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 30.02 39.24 <NA> <unk> 's peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him almost like i were an extension of his body to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water a pack of cigarettes <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 39.24 46.06 <NA> and as i grew up it became worse and worse and i started to think of it as a form of control but of course i could never say anything because
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 45.87 54.13 <NA> the uncle is a respected figure in the indian family <unk> and the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 54.99 57.73 <NA> <unk> the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 57.36 61.88 <NA> and so as a response and as a gift to my uncle i made him the uncle phone 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 61.88 69.07 <NA> it 's so long that it requires two people to use it it 's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that 's designed for one person but
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 69.03 74.12 <NA> the problem is that when i left home and went to college i started missing his commands 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 74.12 79.97 <NA> and so i made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 79.96 81.05 <NA> <unk> an email <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 80.56 87.38 <NA> so what he had to do was take a piece of paper roll it into the carriage <unk> type his email or command and pull the paper out 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 87.38 92.06 <NA> this device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 91.6 99.06 <NA> so here you can see we embedded a lot of electronics that understands all of the mechanical actions and converts it to digital <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 99.06 104.97 <NA> so my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface and of course the object had to be very grand and have a sense
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 104.99 110.41 <NA> <unk> of ritualism the way my uncle likes it the next work is a sound sensitive installation
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 110.17 112.78 <NA> that we affectionately call the pygmies 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 112.57 119.34 <NA> and we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy sensitive and sweet creatures 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 119.34 125.08 <NA> so how it works is we have these panels which we have on the wall and behind them we have these little creatures which hide
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 125.4 132.92 <NA> <unk> and as soon as it 's silent they sort of creep out and if it 's even more silent they stretch their necks out and at the slightest sound they hide back again <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 132.68 142.72 <NA> so we had these panels on three walls of a room <unk> and we had over five hundred of these little pygmies hiding behind them so this is how it works this is a video prototype <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 142.49 148.75 <NA> so when it 's quiet it 's sort of coming out from behind the panels and they hear like humans do or real creatures do 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 148.75 153.89 <NA> so they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile and they don 't react to background sounds
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 155.04 156.89 <NA> moment that they don 't react to 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 159.13 162.77 <NA> but they react to foreground sounds you 'll hear that in a second 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 167.17 172.16 <NA> so we worked very hard to make them as lifelike as possible <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 173.41 175.02 <NA> so each pygmy has
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 176.3 178.77 <NA> <unk> mood swings personalities and so on <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 178.34 182.68 <NA> so this is a very early prototype of course it got much better after that 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 182.68 188.37 <NA> and we made them react to people but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 188.51 198.48 <NA> this is a video installation called the missing person and we were quite intrigued with playing with the notion of invisibility how would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 198.47 204.49 <NA> so we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 204.96 215.26 <NA> <unk> using a camera that could look at people in the room <unk> track them and replace one person with the background rendering them invisible <unk> so i 'm just going to show you a very early prototype <unk>
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 215.21 223.96 <NA> on the right side you can see my colleague soren who 's actually in the space and on the left side you 'll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 225.97 227.13 <NA> <unk> he goes invisible <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 226.89 231.9 <NA> and you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing it 's a very early video <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 231.72 236.79 <NA> so we haven 't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that but that got refined pretty soon later <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 236.79 249.87 <NA> so how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space <unk> and we had one monitor one on each wall <unk> and as people walked into the room they would see themselves in the monitor except with one difference one person was constantly invisible
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 255.29 261.39 <NA> almost like a sheet of paper like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 260.93 267.76 <NA> and from the front this object appeared to be very strong and robust and from the side it almost seemed very weak 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 267.76 279.58 <NA> so people would walking into the room and they 'd almost ignore it thinking it was some crap laying around but as soon as they passed by it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion <unk> and it would get exhausted and it would collapse every time
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 280.26 282.97 <NA> laughter so this work is
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 282.77 288.83 <NA> a caricature of an upside down man his head is so heavy full of heavy thoughts that it 's sort of fallen into his hat 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 288.62 291.72 <NA> and his body 's grown out of him almost like a plant <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 291.72 300.35 <NA> well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement and it 's kind of constrained
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 300.64 307.37 <NA> <unk> by that circle because if that circle weren 't there and the floor was very even it would start to wander about in the space and there 's no
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 307.3 312.58 <NA> wires so i 'll just show you an instance so when people enter the room it activates this object 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 312.42 320.18 <NA> and it very slowly over a few minutes sort of painfully goes up <unk> and then it gains momentum and it looks like it 's almost about to fall 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 320.18 324.93 <NA> and this is an important moment because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 325.19 331.5 <NA> <unk> or save the subject but it doesn 't really need it because it again sort of manages to pull itself up <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 331.01 340.5 <NA> so this work was a real technical challenge for us and we worked very hard like most of our works over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 340.5 345.34 <NA> and it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 345.15 346.51 <NA> because if
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 346.3 354.94 <NA> we made it in a way that it would topple over then it would damage itself and if it didn 't fall enough it wouldn 't instill that fatalism or that sense of wanting to go and help
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 354.99 367.63 <NA> <unk> it <unk> so i 'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario it 's much faster that 's my colleague he 's let it go now he 's getting nervous so he 's going to go catch it but he doesn 't need to <unk> because it manages to lift itself up on its own
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 367.32 374.41 <NA> so this is a work that we were very intrigued with working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 373.95 379.97 <NA> tiny different sizes of fiber optics which twinkle like the night sky and it 's at the scale of the night
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 379.96 386.01 <NA> <unk> sky <unk> so we wrapped this around a blob like form which is in the shape of a teddy bear which was hanging from the ceiling <unk> 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 386.01 391.68 <NA> and the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 391.35 395.76 <NA> into the familiar form of a teddy bear which is very comforting and intimate 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 395.76 404.94 <NA> and the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 404.93 405.98 <NA> <unk> sky
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 406.28 419.61 <NA> so this is the last work and a work in progress <unk> and it 's called space filler well imagine a small cube that 's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room and as you approached it it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that 's
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 419.27 427.83 <NA> twice its height and [ eight ] times its volume and so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 427.83 429.88 <NA> almost like it were trying to conceal a
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 429.84 434.3 <NA> <unk> secret within its seams or something <unk> so we work with a lot of technology but
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 435.59 442.9 <NA> we don 't really love technology because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years <unk> but we use it because we 're interested in the way that it
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 442.7 448.48 <NA> can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 448.26 450.72 <NA> and once a creature pops into our minds 
AparnaRao_2011G 1 AparnaRao_2011G 450.72 458.51 <NA> it 's almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move thank you
