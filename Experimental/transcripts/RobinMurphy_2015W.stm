RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 30.59 38.56 <NA> if you can reduce the initial response by one day you can reduce the overall recovery
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 38.32 43.38 <NA> by a thousand days or three years see how that works 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 43.37 49.96 <NA> if the initial responders can get in save lives <unk> mitigate whatever flooding danger there is that means the

RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 60.27 68.5 <NA> <unk> then means you can restore the economy and maybe even make it better and more resilient to the next disaster

RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 81.58 89.18 <NA> and that 's why i do disaster robotics because robots can make a disaster go away faster 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 89.8 93 <NA> now you 've already seen a couple of these these are the
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 94.02 99.79 <NA> these are two types of of uavs a rotorcraft or hummingbird a fixed wing a hawk 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 99.79 104.94 <NA> and they 're used extensively since two thousand and five hurricane katrina let me show
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 104.93 115.47 <NA> <unk> you how this hummingbird <unk> this rotorcraft works <unk> fantastic for structural engineers being able to see damage from angles you can 't get from binoculars on the ground <unk>
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 115.37 120.39 <NA> <unk> or from a satellite image or anything flying at a higher angle 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 126.24 136.42 <NA> <unk> this hawk now this hawk can be used for geospatial surveys that 's where you 're pulling imagery together and getting 3d reconstruction we used both of <unk>
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 136.32 146.77 <NA> <unk> these at the oso mudslides up in washington state <unk> because the big problem was geospatial and hydrological understanding of the disaster not the search and rescue the search <unk>
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 146.67 154.97 <NA> <unk> and rescue teams had it under control and knew what they were doing the bigger problem was that river and mudslide might wipe them out and flood the responders
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 155.25 166.82 <NA> and not only was it challenging to the responders and property damage <unk> it 's also putting at risk the future of salmon fishing along that part of washington state <unk> so they needed to understand what was going on 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 166.36 179.16 <NA> in seven hours going from arlington driving from the incident command post to the site <unk> flying the uavs processing the data <unk> driving back to arlington command post seven hours
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 180.11 186.6 <NA> <unk> them in seven hours data that they could take only two to three days to get any other way
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 186.4 190.56 <NA> and at higher resolution <unk> it 's a game changer <unk> 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 191.27 196.5 <NA> and don 't just think about the uavs i mean they are sexy but remember 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 196.01 204.97 <NA> eighty percent of the world 's population lives by water and that means our critical infrastructure is underwater the parts that we can 't get to like the bridges and things
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 204.93 208.5 <NA> <unk> like that <unk> and that 's why we have unmanned marine vehicles 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 208.51 215.83 <NA> one type of which you 've already met which is sarbot a square dolphin it goes underwater and uses sonar <unk> 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 215.34 225.29 <NA> well <unk> why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very very important they get overlooked think about the japanese tsunami
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 225.13 226.79 <NA> four hundred miles of
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 230.08 233.89 <NA> <unk> the amount of coastland devastated by hurricane katrina in the united states 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 233.89 247.04 <NA> you 're talking about your bridges your pipelines <unk> your ports wiped out and if you don 't have a port you don 't have a way to get in enough relief supplies to support a population that was a huge problem at the haiti earthquake <unk> 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 247.03 254.85 <NA> so we need marine vehicles now let 's look at a viewpoint from the sarbot of what they were seeing we were working on a
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 254.75 261.48 <NA> <unk> fishing port <unk> we were able to reopen that fishing port using her sonar in four hours 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 261.48 274.87 <NA> that fishing port was told it was going to be six months before they could get a manual team of divers in and it was going to take the divers two weeks they were going to miss the fall fishing season which was the major economy for that part which is kind of like their
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 278.88 281.74 <NA> <unk> all the robots i 've shown you have been small <unk> 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 281.4 291.82 <NA> and that 's because robots don 't do things that people do they go places people can 't go and a great example of that is bujold unmanned ground <unk>
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 291.72 295.6 <NA> <unk> vehicles are particularly small <unk> so bujold 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 301.99 312.09 <NA> <unk> was used extensively at the world trade center to go through towers one two and four you 're climbing into the rubble rappelling down going deep in spaces 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 312.04 323.88 <NA> <unk> and just to see the world trade center from bujold 's viewpoint <unk> look at this you 're talking about a disaster where you can 't fit a person or a dog and it 's on fire <unk> 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 329.96 334.8 <NA> <unk> so hot on one of the robots <unk> the tracks began to melt and come off 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 334.64 340.38 <NA> robots don 't replace people or dogs or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 340.38 348 <NA> they do things new they assist the responders the experts in new and innovative ways <unk> 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 347.81 353.71 <NA> the biggest problem is not making the robots smaller though it 's not making them more
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 354.93 364.22 <NA> <unk> it 's not making more sensors <unk> the biggest problem is the data <unk> the informatics because these people need to get the right data at the right time <unk> 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 364.22 375.05 <NA> so wouldn 't it be great if we could have experts immediately access the robots without having to waste any time of driving to the site so whoever 's there use their robots over
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 376.03 386.18 <NA> <unk> let 's think about that let 's think about a chemical train derailment in a rural county what are the odds that the experts your chemical engineer your railroad transportation engineers <unk>
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 386.13 399.72 <NA> have been trained on whatever uav that particular county happens to have probably like none <unk> so we 're using these kinds of interfaces to allow people to use the robots without knowing what robot they 're using 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 404.63 410.14 <NA> <unk> robots give you what they give the experts is data <unk> 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 410.14 419.29 <NA> the problem becomes who gets what data when one thing to do is to ship all the information to everybody and let them sort it out 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 418.84 423.09 <NA> well <unk> the problem with that is it overwhelms the networks <unk> 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 423.09 429.97 <NA> and worse yet it overwhelms the cognitive abilities of each of the people trying to get that one nugget
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 430.1 435.73 <NA> of information they need to make the decision that 's going to make the difference <unk> 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 435.36 440.36 <NA> so we need to think about those kinds of challenges so it 's the data
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 441.42 450.02 <NA> <unk> going back to the world trade center we tried to solve that problem by just recording the data from <unk> bujold only when she was deep in the rubble because that 's what the
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 450.1 451.85 <NA> <unk> team said they wanted 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 451.99 465.14 <NA> what we didn 't know at the time was that the civil engineers would have loved needed the data as we recorded the box beams the serial numbers <unk> the locations as we went into the rubble <unk> 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 464.83 471.21 <NA> we lost valuable data so the challenge is getting all the data and getting it to the right people 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 471.21 475.14 <NA> now <unk> here 's another reason we 've learned that some
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 475 486.03 <NA> some buildings things like schools hospitals city halls get inspected four times by different agencies throughout the response phases 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 485.63 491.68 <NA> now we 're looking if we can get the data from the robots to share not only can we do things like
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 491.26 500.15 <NA> compress that sequence of phases to shorten the response time but now we can begin to do the response in parallel 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 500.15 503.55 <NA> everybody can see the data we can shorten it that way 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 503.48 504.85 <NA> so really
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 504.96 512.29 <NA> <unk> disaster robotics is a misnomer it 's not about the robots <unk> it 's about the data applause
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 515.28 524.36 <NA> so my challenge to you the next time you hear about a disaster <unk> look for the robots they may be underground <unk> they may be underwater 
RobinMurphy_2015W 1 RobinMurphy_2015W 524.36 531.56 <NA> they may be in the sky <unk> but they should be there <unk> look for the robots <unk> because robots are coming to the rescue
