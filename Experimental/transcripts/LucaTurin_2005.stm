LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 30.05 34.94 <NA> <unk> and its been split up in successive bits and a chord so what youre smelling now
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 34.95 40.74 <NA> is the top note <unk> and then will come what they call the heart <unk> the lush heart note i will show it to you

LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 54.96 60.7 <NA> <unk> that the complete fragrance now what you are smelling is a combination of
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 60.42 61.99 <NA> i asked how many
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 61.76 71.08 <NA> molecules there were in there and nobody would tell me so i put it through a <unk> g c a gas chromatograph that i have in my in my office <unk> and its about four hundred 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 71.58 74.95 <NA> so what youre smelling is several hundred molecules
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 75.63 79.97 <NA> floating through the air hitting your nose and do not
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 79.93 87.71 <NA> <unk> get the impression that this is very subjective you are all smelling pretty much the same thing ok smell has this reputation of being
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 87.76 89.21 <NA> somewhat
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 89.01 97.07 <NA> different for each person its not really true and perfumery shows you that cant be true <unk> because if it were like that it wouldnt be an art <unk> ok <unk> now

LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 100.28 104.71 <NA> <unk> let me tell you the history of an idea everything that youre smelling in here
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 106.61 112.65 <NA> is made up of atoms that come from what i call the upper east side of the periodic table a nice safe neighborhood

LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 129.72 139.21 <NA> <unk> fragrance are made of the top note that you smelled at the very beginning the cut grass green what we call in perfumery theyre weird terms
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 138.78 143.69 <NA> and this would be called a green note because it smells of something green like cut grass this is
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 144.95 154.76 <NA> and i had to learn chemistry on the fly in the last three years a very expensive high school chemistry education
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 155.65 158.36 <NA> <unk> this has six carbon atoms so
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 158.16 171.08 <NA> hexa hexene 1 ol it has one double bond it has an alcohol on the end so its ol and thats why they call it cis 3 hexene 1 ol once you figure this out you can really impress people at parties this smells of cut grass <unk> 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 171.08 173.84 <NA> now this is the skeleton of the molecule
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 173.62 174.93 <NA> if you dress it up
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 175 182.71 <NA> with atoms hydrogen atoms thats what it looks like when you have it on your computer but actually its sort of more like this in the sense that the atoms have a certain
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 182.5 189.31 <NA> sphere that you cannot penetrate they repel <unk> ok <unk> now <unk> why does this thing smell
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 189.31 193.08 <NA> of cut grass <unk> ok <unk> why doesnt it smell of
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 193.01 194.67 <NA> potatoes or
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 194.44 201.12 <NA> violets well there are really two theories but the first theory is it must be the shape 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 200.87 204.91 <NA> and thats a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 204.84 208.21 <NA> <unk> works by shape <unk> enzymes that chew things up
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 207.75 215.35 <NA> antibodies its all you know the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing in this case a smell
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 215.31 224.99 <NA> <unk> and i will try and explain to you whats wrong with this notion and the other theory is that we smell molecular vibrations <unk> now this is a totally insane idea and when i first came
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 225 233.82 <NA> <unk> across it in the early ' 90s i thought my predecessor malcolm dyson and bob wright had really taken leave of their senses and ill explain to you why this was the case <unk> 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 233.82 236.49 <NA> however i came to realize gradually that they may be right
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 236.33 242.66 <NA> and i have to convince all my colleagues that this is so but im working on it <unk> heres how shape works
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 242.77 245.79 <NA> in in normal receptors 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 245.79 254.85 <NA> you have a molecule coming in it gets into the protein which is schematic here and it causes this thing to switch to turn to
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 254.81 257.34 <NA> <unk> move in some way by binding
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 257.06 265.77 <NA> in certain parts <unk> and the attraction the forces between the molecule and the protein cause the motion this is a shape based idea <unk> 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 265.91 272.49 <NA> now <unk> whats wrong with shape is summarized in this slide the way
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 272.87 274.99 <NA> i expect everybody to memorize these compounds
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 276.54 282.37 <NA> <unk> one page of work from a chemists workbook ok <unk> working for a fragrance company 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 281.88 289.87 <NA> hes making forty five molecules and hes looking for a sandalwood something that smells of sandalwood because theres a lot of money in sandalwoods and
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 289.38 299.96 <NA> of these forty five molecules only four thousand six hundred and twenty nine actually smells of sandalwood and he puts an exclamation mark ok <unk> this is an awful lot of work this actually
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 302.34 316.02 <NA> two hundred thousand dollars roughly if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits <unk> so this is a profoundly inefficient process and my definition of a theory is its not just something that you teach people its labor saving a theory
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 315.86 321 <NA> is something that enables you to do less work i love the idea of doing less work <unk> so
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 320.76 324.84 <NA> let me explain to you why a very simple fact that tells you
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 337.4 345.7 <NA> <unk> and this smells of rotten eggs <unk> ok <unk> now <unk> you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 345.7 349.96 <NA> if it does you put the glass down you go to a different bar <unk> this is
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 358.56 367.87 <NA> <unk> at no concentration even pure you know <unk> if you smelt pure ethanol it doesnt smell of rotten eggs <unk> conversely there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 367.44 370.03 <NA> will smell like vodka 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 370.23 379.97 <NA> its very hard to explain this by molecular recognition now i showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste for biology and he says thats easy the things are a different color
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 379.72 381.23 <NA> <unk> color 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 385.84 389.04 <NA> we have to go a little beyond that now
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 388.86 392.87 <NA> let me explain why vibrational theory has some sort of interest in it
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 392.86 404.97 <NA> <unk> these molecules as you saw in the beginning the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other in fact molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them so this is the sound
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 405.13 409.89 <NA> of the o h stretch translated into the audible range 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 412.73 417.68 <NA> s h quite a different frequency now this is kind of interesting because
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 417.68 424.6 <NA> it tells you that you should be looking for a particular fact which is this <unk> nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 430.02 431.21 <NA> <unk> that frequency
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 430.97 433.4 <NA> except s h if you look on this 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 433.4 445.52 <NA> imagine a piano keyboard the s h stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard that has been so to speak damaged <unk> and there are no neighboring notes nothing is close to it you have a unique smell a unique vibration <unk> 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 445.29 446.42 <NA> so
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 446.24 454.94 <NA> i went searching when i started in this game to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility to this whole crazy story i went searching for a type of molecule
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 455.04 457.76 <NA> any molecule that would have that vibration
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 457.93 459.29 <NA> and that the
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 459.07 460.65 <NA> obvious prediction
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 460.47 468.2 <NA> was that it should absolutely smell of sulfur if it didnt the whole idea was toast <unk> and i might as well move on to other things <unk> 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 468.31 471.38 <NA> now <unk> after
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 470.89 477.74 <NA> searching high and low for several months <unk> i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a borane
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 477.46 479.7 <NA> which has exactly the same vibration
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 479.99 485.04 <NA> <unk> now the good news is boranes you can get hold of the bad news is theyre rocket fuels
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 485.12 493.71 <NA> most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air <unk> and when you call up the companies they only give you minimum ten tons <unk> ok 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 493.94 495.3 <NA> so
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 495.08 500.05 <NA> this was not what they call a laboratory scale experiment <unk> and they wouldnt have liked it at my
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 509.61 516.93 <NA> <unk> and it really does have the same if you calculate if you measure the vibrational frequencies they are the same as as <unk> s h now does it smell of sulfur 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 516.93 527.51 <NA> well <unk> if you go back in the literature theres a man who knew more about boranes than anyone alive then or since alfred stock he synthesized all of them 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 527.27 529.1 <NA> and in an enormous
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 529.95 531.83 <NA> paper in german
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 531.4 532.89 <NA> he says 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 532.89 542.96 <NA> at one point my wife is german and she translated it for me and at one point he says ganz widerlich geruch an absolutely repulsive smell which is good
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 542.83 548.76 <NA> <unk> reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide so this fact that boranes smell of sulfur had been known since
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 557.15 563.85 <NA> <unk> fly in the ointment is this that if we smell molecular vibrations <unk> we must have a spectroscope in our nose <unk> 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 563.57 566.91 <NA> now this is a spectroscope <unk> ok <unk> 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 566.54 578.26 <NA> on my laboratory bench <unk> and its fair to say that if you look up somebodys nose youre unlikely to see anything resembling this and this is the main objection to the theory ok great we smell vibrations how
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 580.08 586.16 <NA> when people ask this kind of question they neglect something which is that physicists are really clever <unk> unlike biologists <unk>
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 589.32 600.53 <NA> this is a joke im a biologist ok so its a joke against myself bob jacklovich and john lamb at ford motor company in the days when ford motor was spending vast amounts of money on fundamental research discovered
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 600.53 604.52 <NA> a a way to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 604.75 613.97 <NA> <unk> nano scale in other words no mirrors no lasers no prisms no nonsense just a tiny device and he built this device <unk> and this device uses electron tunneling <unk> 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 613.51 618.41 <NA> now <unk> i could do the the dance of electron tunneling but ive done a video instead which
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 618.41 624.78 <NA> is much more interesting heres how it works electrons are fuzzy creatures <unk> and they can jump across
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 625.64 633.36 <NA> <unk> but only at equal energy if the energy differs they cant jump <unk> unlike us they wont fall off the cliff
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 633.5 635.04 <NA> <unk> ok <unk> 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 634.88 636.3 <NA> now <unk> 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 635.96 646.5 <NA> if something absorbs the energy the electron can travel so here you have a system you have something and theres plenty of that stuff in biology some substance giving an electron 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 646.25 652.83 <NA> and the electron tries to jump and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 652.49 654.76 <NA> does the reaction happen ok
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 655.02 663.28 <NA> <unk> is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built and every single part of this mechanism is actually
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 662.79 665.44 <NA> plausible in biology 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 665.1 674.99 <NA> in other words ive taken off the shelf components and ive made a spectroscope whats nice about this idea <unk> <unk> if you have a philosophical bent of mind is that then it tells you that the nose
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 692.65 698.06 <NA> <unk> and then a magnificent thing happened i left academia and joined the real world
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 697.57 702.92 <NA> of business and a company was created around my ideas
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 702.52 704.7 <NA> to make new molecules
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 704.75 713.97 <NA> <unk> using my method along the lines of lets put someone elses money where your mouth is and one of the first things that happened was
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 713.54 716.49 <NA> we started going around to fragrance companies asking
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 716.49 724.78 <NA> for what they needed because of course <unk> if you could calculate smell you dont need chemists you need a computer a mac will do it if you know how to
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 727.95 736.97 <NA> <unk> you can try a thousand molecules you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend <unk> and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one <unk> and so thats a direct path
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 736.79 746.71 <NA> to making new odorants and one of the first things that happened was we went to see some perfumers in france and heres where i do my charles fleischer impression and one of them says 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 746.37 754.04 <NA> you cannot make a coumarin he says to me i bet you cannot make a coumarin now coumarin is a very common thing
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 754.99 762.84 <NA> <unk> material in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from south america <unk> and it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical <unk> 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 762.84 769.82 <NA> ok <unk> its the molecule that has made mens fragrances smell the way they do since one thousand eight hundred and eighty one to be exact <unk> 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 769.72 774.84 <NA> and the problem is its a carcinogen so nobody likes particularly
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 780.47 786.09 <NA> <unk> there are some reckless people but its not worth it <unk> ok <unk> so they asked us to make a new coumarin <unk> 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 785.63 794.62 <NA> and so we started doing calculations and the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin and you smooth it out so that you have a nice
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 794.43 804.16 <NA> picture of what the sort of chord so to speak of coumarin is <unk> and then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 804.96 810.2 <NA> <unk> unrelated that have the same vibrations <unk> and we actually in this case im
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 810.2 814.9 <NA> sorry to say it happened it was serendipitous <unk> because
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 815.16 818.38 <NA> i got a phone call from our chief chemist and he said look 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 818.43 825.17 <NA> ive just found this such a beautiful reaction that even if this compound doesnt smell of coumarin i want to do it its just such a nifty
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 825.67 836.95 <NA> <unk> one step i mean chemists have weird weird minds one step ninety percent yield you know <unk> and you get this lovely crystalline compound let us try it and i said first of all let me do the calculation
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 836.79 845.06 <NA> on that compound <unk> bottom right which is related to coumarin but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 845.02 850.05 <NA> calculate the vibrations <unk> the purple spectrum is that new fellow <unk> the white
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 850 856.92 <NA> one is the old one and the prediction is it should smell of coumarin <unk> they made it <unk> and
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 859.16 865.56 <NA> it smelled exactly like coumarin <unk> and this is our new
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 865.43 875.11 <NA> baby called tonkene <unk> you see when youre a scientist youre always selling ideas <unk> and people are very resistant to ideas and rightly so why should new ideas be
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 876.51 878.05 <NA> <unk> when you put a little <unk>
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 879.09 882.05 <NA> <unk> vial on the table in front of perfumers
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 881.87 888.85 <NA> and it smells like coumarin and it isnt coumarin <unk> and youve found it in three weeks this focuses everybodys mind wonderfully 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 895.5 899.99 <NA> and people often ask me is your theory accepted and i said well
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 900 901.37 <NA> by whom i mean
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 901.21 908.51 <NA> most you know theres three attitudes <unk> youre right and i dont know why which is the most rational one at this point 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 908.65 910.91 <NA> youre right and i dont care
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 910.81 919.88 <NA> how you do it in a sense you bring me the molecules you know and youre completely wrong and im sure youre completely wrong <unk> ok <unk> now <unk> were dealing with people who only want results
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 919.88 924.87 <NA> and this is the commercial world and they tell us that even if we do it by astrology theyre happy
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 926.81 935.76 <NA> <unk> were not actually doing it by astrology <unk> but for the last three years ive had what i consider to be the best job in the entire universe which is to put my
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 935.56 937.28 <NA> hobby which is you know 
LucaTurin_2005 1 LucaTurin_2005 937.29 945.76 <NA> fragrance and all the magnificent things plus a little bit of biophysics a small amount of <unk> self taught chemistry at the service of something that actually works
