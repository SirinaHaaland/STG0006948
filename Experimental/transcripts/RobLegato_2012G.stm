RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 12.97 23.45 <NA> <unk> i worked on a film called apollo thirteen and when i worked on this film i discovered something about how our brains work and how our brains work is that when we 're sort of infused with either enthusiasm or awe <unk>
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 23.4 29.97 <NA> or fondness or whatever it changes and alters our perception of things it changes what we see it changes what we remember
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 30.07 33.6 <NA> and as an experiment because i dauntingly
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 33.17 37.74 <NA> create a task for myself of recreating a saturn v launch
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 37.25 43.93 <NA> for this particular movie <unk> because i i put it out there i felt a little nervous about it so i need to do an experiment and bring a
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 43.93 49.81 <NA> group of people like this in a projection room and play this stock footage and when i played this stock
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 50.76 52.81 <NA> <unk> simply wanted to find out
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 52.47 58.99 <NA> what people remembered what was memorable about it <unk> what should i actually try to replicate what should i try to
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 58.5 65.77 <NA> emulate to some degree <unk> so this is the footage that i was showing everybody <unk> and what i discovered
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 65.77 74.99 <NA> is because of the nature of the footage and the fact that we 're doing this film there was an emotion that was built into it and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us and all these various
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 75.76 84.35 <NA> <unk> when i showed it and i asked <unk> immediately after the screening was over what they thought of it <unk> what was your memorable shots they changed them they were
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 83.89 93.57 <NA> had camera moves on them <unk> they had all kinds of things shots were combined <unk> and i was just really curious <unk> i mean what the hell were you looking at just a few minutes ago and how come
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 93.57 98.18 <NA> how 'd you come up with this sort of description <unk> and what i discovered is 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 98.2 104.76 <NA> what i should do is not actually replicate what they saw is replicate what they remembered so this is our
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 105.19 119.95 <NA> of the of the launch based on basically taking notes <unk> asking people what they thought <unk> and then the combination of all the different shots and all the different things put together created their sort of collective consciousness of what they remembered it looked like but not what it really looked like so this is what we
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 119.95 122.16 <NA> created for apollo thirteen launch
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 126.36 134.53 <NA> <unk> so literally what you 're seeing now is the confluence of a bunch of different people a bunch of different memories including my own of taking a little bit of liberty
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 134.53 149.51 <NA> with the subject matter i basically shot everything with short lenses which means that you 're very close to the action <unk> but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots which gives you a sense of distance so i was basically was setting up something that would remind you of something you haven 't really quite seen before
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 151.9 155.82 <NA> <unk> and then i 'm going to show you exactly what it is that you were reacting to when you were reacting to
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 179.87 187.41 <NA> <unk> so now i 'm in a parking lot basically it 's a tin can and i 'm basically recreating the launch with fire extinguishers <unk> fire
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 187.41 196.41 <NA> i have wax that i threw in front of the lens to look like ice <unk> and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that i just showed you what you were
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 196.01 200.17 <NA> reacting to what you 're emoting to is something that 's a total falsehood
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 200.31 202.44 <NA> <unk> and i found that really kind of fascinating 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 202.44 212.23 <NA> and in this particular case this is the climax of the movie <unk> and you know the weight of achieving it was simply take a model throw it out of a helicopter and shoot it 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 211.77 224.93 <NA> and that 's simply what i did <unk> that 's me shooting and i 'm a fairly mediocre operator so i got that nice sense of verisimilitude of a kind of <unk> you know <unk> following the rocket all the way down and giving that little sort of edge i was desperately trying to
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 226.45 232.49 <NA> <unk> so then i come up to the next thing we had a nasa consultant who was actually an astronaut who was actually on some of the missions of
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 232.29 237.21 <NA> apollo fifteen <unk> and he was there to basically double check my science 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 237.21 240.83 <NA> and <unk> i guess somebody thought they needed to do that 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 242.23 245.06 <NA> i don 't know why <unk> but they thought they did 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 244.78 254.55 <NA> so we were he 's a hero he 's an astronaut and we 're all sort of excited and you know i gave myself the liberty of saying you know some of the shots i did
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 255.02 256.74 <NA> <unk> 't really suck that bad <unk> 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 256.43 271 <NA> and so maybe you know <unk> we were feeling kind of a little good about it so i brought him in here and he needed to really check and see what we were doing and basically give us our a plus report card <unk> and so i showed him some shots we were working on and
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 270.76 274.27 <NA> waiting for the reaction that you hope for <unk> which is what i got
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 287.4 289.18 <NA> <unk> it 's what you dream about 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 292.02 296.2 <NA> so what i got from him is he turned to me and said 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 296.13 304.88 <NA> you would never ever design a rocket like that you would never have a rocket go up while the gantry arms are going out can you imagine the tragedy that could possibly happen with that you would
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 304.81 307.49 <NA> <unk> never ever design a rocket like that 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 307.48 309.54 <NA> and he was looking at me it 's like yeah i don 't
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 309.54 315.38 <NA> know if you noticed but i 'm the guy out in the parking lot recreating one of america 's finest moments with fire extinguishers 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 317.32 323.06 <NA> laughter and i 'm not going to argue with you you 're an astronaut a hero and i 'm from new jersey <unk> so 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 325 336.81 <NA> i 'm just going to show you some footage i 'm just going to show you some footage and tell me what you think <unk> and then i did kind of get the reaction i was hoping for <unk> so i showed him this and this is actual footage that he was on this is apollo fifteen this was his mission <unk> 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 336.81 339.06 <NA> so i showed him this <unk> 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 338.99 342.84 <NA> and the reaction i got was interesting 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 344.84 350.26 <NA> so <unk> and what happened was i mean what i sort of intuned in that is that he remembered
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 350.19 362.5 <NA> <unk> it differently he remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry system perfectly safe rocket launch <unk> because he 's sitting in a rocket that has like a hundred thousand pounds of thrust built by the lowest bidder he was hoping it was going to work out okay 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 365.43 367.88 <NA> so he twisted his memory around now
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 367.88 375.23 <NA> <unk> ron howard ran into buzz aldrin who was not on the movie so he had he had no idea that we were faking any of this footage and he just responded
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 384.13 393.95 <NA> <unk> i saw some shots i 'd never seen before did you guys <unk> what vault did you find that stuff in and i said well no vault buzz we
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 393.49 399.69 <NA> generated all that from scratch and he said huh that 's pretty good can we use it
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 410.99 413.64 <NA> <unk> if you don 't know the story <unk> doesn 't end well 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 416.57 425.76 <NA> jim cameron actually photographed the real titanic so he basically set up or basically shattered the suspension of disbelief because what he photographed was the real thing a
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 425.66 429.7 <NA> mir sub going down or actually two mir subs going down to the real wreck
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 429.96 438.37 <NA> <unk> and he created this very haunting footage <unk> it 's really beautiful and it conjures up all these various different emotions but he couldn 't photograph everything 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 438.37 449.92 <NA> and to tell the story i had to fill in the gaps which is now rather daunting because now i have to recreate back to back what really happened and i had <unk> i 'm the only one who could really blow it at that point <unk> 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 451.59 454.76 <NA> so this is the footage he photographed <unk> and it was
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 458.53 468.77 <NA> <unk> going to just let it run so you kind of absorb this sort of thing <unk> and i 'll describe my sort of reactions when i was looking at it for the very first time i got the feeling that <unk>
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 468.72 474.99 <NA> my brain wanted to basically see it come back to life i automatically wanted to see this this
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 475.46 480.18 <NA> <unk> this magnificent ship basically in all its glory and conversely i wanted to see it
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 479.78 487.63 <NA> not in all its glory basically go back to what it looks like <unk> so i conjured up an effect that i 'm later going to show you
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 487.45 490.8 <NA> what i tried to do which is kind of the heart of the movie for me 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 490.73 499.96 <NA> and so that 's why i wanted to do the movie that 's why i wanted to create the sort of things i created <unk> and i 'll show you you know another thing that i found interesting is what we
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 501.39 507.29 <NA> <unk> when you take a look at it so here 's the behind the scenes a couple of little shots here so when you saw my footage 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 507.29 517.24 <NA> you were seeing this basically a bunch of guys flipping a ship upside down <unk> and the little mir subs are actually about the size of small footballs and shot in smoke
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 516.93 522.88 <NA> <unk> jim went three miles went down and i went about three miles away from the studio and photographed this in a garage
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 522.99 529.97 <NA> <unk> and so but what you 're emoting to or what you 're looking at had the same feeling the same haunting quality that
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 529.99 533.54 <NA> <unk> jim 's footage had so i found it so fascinating that
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 533.53 544.29 <NA> our brains sort of once you believe something 's real you transfer everything that you feel about it this quality you have <unk> and it 's totally artificial it 's totally make believe 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 544.29 552.89 <NA> yet it 's not to you <unk> and i found that that was a very interesting thing to explore and use <unk> and it caused me to create the next effect that i 'll show you which is
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 552.7 554.91 <NA> this sort of magic transition
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 554.99 556.71 <NA> <unk> all i was really attempting to do
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 556.54 567.12 <NA> is basically have the audience cue the effect so it became a seamless experience for them that i wasn 't showing you my sort of interpretation i was showing you what you wanted to see 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 567.23 570.21 <NA> and the very next shot right after this
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 573.87 574.87 <NA> so you can
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 576.45 580.6 <NA> <unk> if there 's two subs in the same shot i shot it because where 's the camera coming from 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 580.17 586.75 <NA> and when jim shot it it was only one sub because he was photographing from the other and i don 't remember if i did this or jim did this i 'll give it to jim because
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 586.29 589.18 <NA> he could use the pat on the back 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 594.69 604.01 <NA> okay <unk> so now the titanic transition so this is what i was referring to where i wanted to basically magically transplant from one state of the titanic to the other
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 604.96 606.2 <NA> <unk> shot once 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 610.3 613.43 <NA> and what i was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you gloria stuart 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 621.79 624.93 <NA> that was the last time titanic ever saw
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 627.29 637.6 <NA> <unk> what i did is basically i had another screening room experience where i was basically tracking where where i was looking or where we were looking and of course you 're looking at the two people on the on the bow of the ship <unk> 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 637.55 647.73 <NA> <unk> and then at some point i 'm changing the periphery of the shot i 'm changing it 's becoming the rusted wreck <unk> and then i would run it every day and then i would find exactly the moment that <unk>
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 647.68 654.97 <NA> i stopped looking at them and start noticing the rest of it and the moment my eye shifted we just marked it to the frame the moment my eye shifted
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 655.1 662.83 <NA> <unk> i immediately started to change them so now somehow you missed where it started and where it stopped <unk> and so i 'll just show it one more time and
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 663.9 668.84 <NA> it 's literally done by using what our brains naturally do for <unk> us which is
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 668.84 674.78 <NA> as soon as you you shift your attention something changes and then i left the little scarf going <unk> because it really wanted to be a ghostly
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 686.62 689.51 <NA> <unk> last time i ever saw daylight it was a long film to work on 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 691.27 700.1 <NA> now hugo was another interesting movie because the movie itself is about film illusions it 's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 700.1 704.67 <NA> motion picture and one of the things i had to do is we
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 705.14 708.07 <NA> <unk> sasha baron cohen is a very clever very smart guy 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 707.89 716.09 <NA> comedian wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of the buster keaton sort of slapstick things <unk> and he wanted his his leg brace to get caught on a moving train 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 716.09 722.47 <NA> very dangerous very impossible to do and particularly on our stage because there literally is no way to actually
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 722.24 729.94 <NA> move this train <unk> because it fits so snugly into our set so let me show you the scene <unk> and then i basically used the trick
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 729.95 740.36 <NA> that was identified by sergei eisenstein which is <unk> if you have a camera that 's moving with a moving object what is not moving appears to be moving and what is moving appears to be stopped <unk> 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 740.36 744.82 <NA> so what you 're actually seeing now is the train is not moving at all <unk> 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 744.45 747.79 <NA> and what is actually moving is the floor <unk> 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 751.53 756.8 <NA> video of what you 're looking at there which is our little test so that 's actually what you 're seeing 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 756.4 770.45 <NA> and i thought it was sort of an interesting thing because it was <unk> part of the homage of the of the movie itself is is coming up with this sort of genius trick which i can 't take credit for i 'd love to but i can 't because it was invented like in one thousand nine hundred and ten or something like that 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 770.45 771.5 <NA> is
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 771.13 774.9 <NA> i told marty and it 's kind of one of those mind things that it 's
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 775 778.14 <NA> <unk> really hard to really get until you actually see it work and i said you
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 777.71 781.59 <NA> know what i was going to do and he said so let me see if i can get this straight 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 781.59 783.96 <NA> the thing with the wheels <unk> that doesn 't move 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 787.58 792.81 <NA> and the thing without the wheels that moves precisely 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 793.82 799.11 <NA> brings me to the next and final marty 's not going to see this is he 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 800.9 803.44 <NA> this isn 't viewed outside of
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 805.74 808.34 <NA> <unk> the next illustration is something that
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 808.16 818.44 <NA> <unk> there 's like all one shot theory it 's a very elegant way of telling a story especially if you 're following somebody on a journey <unk> and that journey basically tells something about their personality in a very concise <unk>
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 818.34 823.24 <NA> <unk> way <unk> and what we wanted to do based on the shot in goodfellas which is one of the great shots ever
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 829.93 838.1 <NA> <unk> treated in a special way <unk> he was the master of his of his universe and we wanted hugo to feel the same way so we created this shot that 's hugo music
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 845.23 854.97 <NA> and we felt that if we could basically move the camera with him we would feel what it feels like to be this boy who is basically the master of his universe <unk> and his universe
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 855.14 858.59 <NA> <unk> is <unk> you know behind the scenes in the bowels of this particular
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 858.37 869 <NA> train station that only he can actually navigate through and do it this way <unk> and we had to make it feel that this is his normal everyday sort of life so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important <unk> 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 869 873.48 <NA> and of course in shooting in 3d which is basically it 's a huge camera
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 873.23 874.9 <NA> that 's hanging off of a giant
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 875.73 885.64 <NA> <unk> so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got when you saw the goodfellas shot so what you 're now going to see
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 885.64 896.05 <NA> is how we actually did it it 's actually five separate sets shot at five different times with two different boys the one on the left is where the shot ends and the shot on the right is where it
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 895.89 904.79 <NA> takes takes over <unk> and now we switch boys so it went from asa butterfield who 's the star of the show to
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 905.38 910.22 <NA> his stand in i wouldn 't say his stunt double there 's a crazy rig that we built for this 
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 911.47 913.47 <NA> and so this is and now this is
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 913.29 916.13 <NA> set number three we 're into
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 916.48 925.05 <NA> <unk> and then we 're going to go into basically the very last moment of the shot is is actually the steadycam shot everything else was shot on cranes and various things
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 925.49 933.54 <NA> <unk> it literally was done over five different sets two different boys different times and it all had to feel like it was all one shot <unk> and what was
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 933.38 935.79 <NA> sort of great for me
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 935.69 940.5 <NA> was it was probably the best reviewed shot i 've ever worked on and you know
RobLegato_2012G 1 RobLegato_2012G 940.19 947.01 <NA> i was kind of proud of it when i was done <unk> which is <unk> you should never really be proud of stuff i guess so i
