EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 289.85 299.63 <NA> that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they 're embedded <unk> and also it would allow us to have the ultra precise control we need
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 305.26 315.11 <NA> <unk> going to do that well there are many molecules that exist in nature <unk> which are able to convert light into electricity you can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 314.68 324.29 <NA> if we can install these molecules in neurons somehow then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light and their neighbors which don 't have the molecule would not 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 324.07 329.67 <NA> there 's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen <unk> and that 's the ability to get light into the brain <unk> and to do that
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 330.01 339.19 <NA> brain doesn 't feel pain you can put taking advantage of all the effort that 's gone into the internet and communications and so on optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 339.19 344.01 <NA> in animal models for example in pre clinical studies these neurons and to see what they do <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 344.36 350.05 <NA> so how do we do this <unk> around two thousand and four in collaboration with gerhard nagel and karl deisseroth
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 350.82 354.06 <NA> <unk> vision came to fruition <unk> there 's a certain alga
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 353.9 359.17 <NA> that swims in the wild <unk> and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 359.1 364.27 <NA> and it senses light with a little eye spot which works not unlike how our eye works <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 363.87 369.49 <NA> in its membrane or its boundary <unk> it contains little proteins
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 369.39 375.16 <NA> that indeed can convert light into electricity so these molecules are called channelrhodopsins 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 374.88 379.85 <NA> and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that i told you about when blue light hits it
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 380.08 388.01 <NA> <unk> it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye spot and that allows this eye spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 387.97 396.77 <NA> so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons and because it 's a protein it 's encoded for in the dna of this organism 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 396.76 401.66 <NA> so all we 've got to do is take that dna put it into a gene therapy vector like a virus <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 401.56 403.26 <NA> and put it into neurons
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 404.93 413.07 <NA> <unk> so it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy and lots of viruses were coming along so this turned out to be very simple to do and early in the morning
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 412.84 417.09 <NA> one day in the summer of two thousand and four we gave it a try and it worked on the first try 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 417.23 424.87 <NA> you take this dna and you put it into a neuron the neuron uses its natural protein making machinery to fabricate these little
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 425.1 428.77 <NA> <unk> proteins and install them all over the cell like putting solar panels on a roof <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 429.09 433.45 <NA> and the next thing you know you have a neuron which can be activated with light so
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 433.47 435.25 <NA> this is very powerful 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 435.25 447.77 <NA> one of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors <unk> <unk> and you can do that you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others <unk> and there 's other genetic tricks you can play
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 447.53 449.75 <NA> in order to get light activated
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 450.85 453.65 <NA> <unk> this field has now come to be known as optogenetics <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 453.4 458.36 <NA> and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do you can take a complex network 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 458.11 462.83 <NA> use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 462.52 470.15 <NA> and then when you shine light on the entire network just that cell type will be activated <unk> so for example lets sort of consider that basket cell i told you about earlier
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 469.84 479.97 <NA> the one that 's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory <unk> if we can deliver that gene to these cells and they 're not going to be altered by the expression of the gene of course and then
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 479.93 489.36 <NA> <unk> flash blue light over the entire brain network just these cells are going to be driven <unk> and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so they don 't seem to be averse against that 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 488.87 498.9 <NA> not only can you use this to study what these cells do what their power is in computing in the brain <unk> but you can also use this to try to figure out well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells if indeed they 're atrophied 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 498.77 501.31 <NA> now i want to tell you a couple of short stories
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 501.13 503.65 <NA> about how we 're using this <unk> both at the scientific
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 504.93 508.03 <NA> <unk> levels one of the questions we 've confronted
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 507.6 521.05 <NA> is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward <unk> because if you could find those those would be some of the signals that could drive learning <unk> the brain will do more of whatever got that reward <unk> and also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 520.65 524.78 <NA> so if we could figure out what cells they are we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 525.19 530.9 <NA> <unk> or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 530.98 535.22 <NA> so to do that we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the fiorella group 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 535.22 541.97 <NA> where one side of this little box if the animal goes there the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 541.57 545.63 <NA> so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 545.53 554.82 <NA> and so that 's what happens this animal 's going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that and he 'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times these are the dopamine neurons
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 554.99 561.93 <NA> <unk> of you may have heard about in some of the pleasure centers in the brain <unk> now we 've shown that a brief activation of these is enough indeed to drive learning <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 561.62 564.12 <NA> now we can generalize the idea <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 563.66 574.05 <NA> instead of one point in the brain <unk> we can devise devices that span the brain that can deliver light into three dimensional patterns arrays of optical fibers each coupled to its own independent miniature light source <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 573.56 574.87 <NA> and then we can try to do
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 575.22 586.24 <NA> <unk> in vivo that have only been done to date in a dish like high throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 586.02 592.75 <NA> and one story i want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post traumatic stress disorder a form of uncontrolled
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 592.68 594.76 <NA> anxiety and fear <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 594.27 604.25 <NA> and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear this goes back to the pavlovian days it 's called pavlovian fear conditioning
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 603.91 604.91 <NA> where a tone
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 604.87 607.8 <NA> <unk> ends with a brief shock the shock isn 't painful but it 's a little annoying <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 607.8 618.08 <NA> and over time in this case a mouse which is a good animal model <unk> commonly used in such experiments the animal learns to fear the tone the animal will react by freezing sort of like a deer in the headlights <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 618.1 624.93 <NA> now the question is what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear <unk> so what we do
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 625 637.26 <NA> we play that tone again after it 's been associated with fear <unk> but we activate targets in the brain different ones using that optical fiber array i told you about in the previous slide in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 637.28 652 <NA> and so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we 're working on now this is an area in the prefrontal cortex a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states <unk> and the animal 's going to hear a tone and a flash of light occurred there there 's no audio on this but you can see the animal 's freezing <unk> this tone
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 651.84 653.95 <NA> used to mean bad news and there 's a little clock in the
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 654.93 663.61 <NA> <unk> see the animal is about two minutes into this <unk> and now this next clip is just eight minutes later <unk> and the same tone is going to play and the light is going to flash again 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 664.68 666.97 <NA> okay there it goes right
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 666.9 674.96 <NA> now and now you can see just ten minutes into the experiment that we 've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 675.04 676.85 <NA> <unk> of this fear memory 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 677.47 686.75 <NA> now over the last couple of years we 've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off <unk> if we could do that this could be extremely powerful <unk> if you can delete <unk>
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 686.7 698.42 <NA> cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they 're embedded <unk> and we 've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life every kingdom of life except for animals we see slightly differently <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 700 708.15 <NA> called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins that respond to green and yellow light and they do the opposite thing of the molecule i told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 708.77 711.78 <NA> let 's give an example of where we think this is going to go 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 711.59 716.88 <NA> consider for example a condition like epilepsy where the brain is overactive 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 716.6 728.26 <NA> now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain but that 's obviously irreversible and there could be side effects what if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time until the seizure dies away
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 730.22 735.61 <NA> the brain to be restored to its initial state sort of like a dynamical system that 's being coaxed down into a stable state 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 735.38 744.38 <NA> so this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light <unk> and we beam light in and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 744.38 749.83 <NA> we 're hoping to be able to turn it off and so we don 't have data to show you on this front <unk> but we 're very excited about this <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 750.09 752.93 <NA> now i want to close on one story which we think
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 752.77 754.79 <NA> is another possibility which is that maybe these
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 754.75 764.66 <NA> <unk> molecules if you can do ultra precise control can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic i already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 764.35 771.62 <NA> seventy five thousand people have parkinson 's deep brain stimulators implanted maybe one hundred thousand people have cochlear implants which allow them to hear 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 771.76 778.89 <NA> there 's another thing which is you 've got to get these genes into cells and new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 779.9 782.7 <NA> <unk> probably most of us around this room have and it doesn 't have any symptoms 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 782.7 790.95 <NA> which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body <unk> and so far there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 790.94 798.24 <NA> there 's one last elephant in the room <unk> the proteins themselves which come from algae and bacteria and fungi and all over the tree of life 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 797.81 804.58 <NA> most of us don 't have fungi or algae in our brains so what is our brain going to do if we put that in are the cells going to tolerate it will the immune system react
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 804.93 816.59 <NA> <unk> its early days these have not been done on humans yet but we 're working on a variety of studies to try and examine this and so far we haven 't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 816.59 821.65 <NA> the illumination of the brain with light so it 's early days to be upfront but we 're excited about it 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 821.4 824.75 <NA> i wanted to close with one story <unk> which we think could potentially
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 828.52 833.31 <NA> <unk> many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors our light sensors that are in the back of our eye 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 833.31 839.09 <NA> are gone <unk> and the retina of course is a complex structure now let 's zoom in on it here so we can see it in more detail <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 838.6 849.9 <NA> the photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom the ganglion cells <unk> relay the information to the
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 850.37 852.42 <NA> <unk> where we see that as perception <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 852.53 860.22 <NA> in many forms of blindness like retinitis pigmentosa <unk> or macular degeneration <unk> the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 860.09 867 <NA> now how could you repair this it 's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because there 's nothing for the drug to bind to on the
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 866.87 875.02 <NA> other hand light can still get into the eye <unk> <unk> the eye is still transparent and you can get light in <unk> so what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 875 884.99 <NA> <unk> molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras <unk> and because there 's so many of these cells in the eye <unk> potentially they could be very <unk> high resolution cameras <unk> so
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 884.99 887.54 <NA> this is some work that we 're doing it 's being
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 887.09 890.74 <NA> led by one of our collaborators alan horsager at usc and being
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 890.74 899.9 <NA> sought to be commercialized by a start up company eos neuroscience which is funded by the nih and what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze it 's a six arm maze and there 's a bit of water in the maze to
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 901.81 907.85 <NA> <unk> and the goal of course of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that 's under the lit top port <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 907.57 917.27 <NA> now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a brute force search he 's swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform so he 's not using vision to do it 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 917.2 925.14 <NA> these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that that affect humans and so we 're being careful in trying to look at these different models
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 929.3 940.2 <NA> <unk> going to solve this we 're going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide we 're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 939.83 946.23 <NA> just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive light is converted to electricity on them <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 946.19 954.91 <NA> so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus <unk> and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 954.99 956.41 <NA> <unk> to this little platform
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 955.92 959.84 <NA> and make cognitive use of its eyes again <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 959.84 970.01 <NA> and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals that have seen their entire lives so this pre clinical study i think bodes hope for the kinds of things we 're hoping to do
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 969.68 971.08 <NA> in the future 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 971.76 979.97 <NA> to close i want to point out that we 're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology <unk> we 're developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 980.01 982.86 <NA> so people can study and try to treat different disorders <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 982.68 989 <NA> and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 989 996.48 <NA> we can take some of these intractable disorders that i told you about earlier <unk> practically none of which are cured <unk> and in the 21st century make them history <unk> thank you
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1011.05 1013.1 <NA> <unk> some of the stuff is a little dense 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1014.86 1022.31 <NA> but the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs <unk> 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1021.91 1025.04 <NA> and being able to target those specifically
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1024.58 1029.97 <NA> is a first step the second thing that i think i heard you say is you
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1029.93 1031.45 <NA> <unk> can now control
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1031.27 1040.05 <NA> the brain in two colors <unk> like an on off switch ed boyden that 's right je which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code eb 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1039.8 1046.33 <NA> right yeah so with blue light we can drive information and it 's in the form of a one and by turning things off it 's more or less a zero so
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1046.17 1054.94 <NA> our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in in people with disabilities je and in theory that means that
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1055.07 1062.17 <NA> as a mouse feels smells <unk> hears touches you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros eb sure 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1061.86 1070.54 <NA> yeah we 're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings <unk> and use that to understand more about the brain je 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1071.16 1074.96 <NA> does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1076.27 1079.61 <NA> <unk> something we 're starting to work on very hard <unk> we 're now working on
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1079.33 1089.18 <NA> some work where we 're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too <unk> so we can record information and then drive information back in sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing je 
EdBoyden_2011 1 EdBoyden_2011 1088.87 1091.02 <NA> well that might change a couple things <unk> thank you
