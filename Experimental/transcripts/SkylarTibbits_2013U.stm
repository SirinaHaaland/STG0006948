SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 12.82 13.92 <NA> <unk> this is me
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 13.74 21.71 <NA> building a prototype for six hours straight this is slave labor to my own project 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 22.15 24.84 <NA> this is what the diy and maker
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 25 26.97 <NA> <unk> movements really look like 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 27.02 34.77 <NA> and this is an analogy for today 's construction and manufacturing world with brute force assembly techniques <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 34.49 41.67 <NA> and this is exactly why i started studying how to program physical materials to build themselves <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 41.21 48.22 <NA> but there is another world today at the micro and nanoscales there 's an unprecedented revolution happening <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 48.22 54.97 <NA> and this is the ability to program physical and biological materials to change shape change properties
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 54.9 58.16 <NA> <unk> and even compute outside of silicon based matter 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 58.16 70.33 <NA> there 's even a software called cadnano that allows us to design three dimensional shapes like nano robots or drug delivery systems and use dna to self assemble those functional structures <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 70.59 79.97 <NA> but if we look at the human scale <unk> there 's massive problems that aren 't being addressed by those nanoscale technologies if we look at construction and manufacturing
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 80.49 84.6 <NA> there 's major inefficiencies energy consumption
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 84.42 90.57 <NA> and excessive labor techniques in infrastructure let 's just take one example take piping 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 90.57 94.65 <NA> in water pipes we have fixed capacity water pipes
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 94.46 99.96 <NA> that have fixed flow rates <unk> except for expensive pumps and valves <unk> we bury them in the
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 100.46 109.89 <NA> <unk> anything changes if the environment changes the ground moves or demand changes we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 109.4 119.61 <NA> so i 'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials and the built environment <unk>
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 119.56 128.89 <NA> and i don 't mean automated machines i don 't just mean smart machines that replace humans <unk> but i mean programmable materials that build themselves <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 129.71 137.38 <NA> self assembly which is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure through only local interaction
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 137.49 142.99 <NA> <unk> so what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale <unk> we need a few simple ingredients 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 142.99 149.87 <NA> the first ingredient is materials and geometry <unk> and that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source and you can use
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 155.71 164.72 <NA> <unk> and then you need smartly designed interactions and those interactions allow for error correction and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 164.62 168.27 <NA> so now i 'm going to show you a number of projects that we 've built from
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 180.02 184 <NA> <unk> is that you take the three dimensional structure of a protein
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 183.76 186.46 <NA> in this case it 's the crambin protein
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 186.25 190.32 <NA> you take the backbone so no cross linking no environmental interactions
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 190.15 193.62 <NA> and you break that down into a series of components <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 193.28 201.45 <NA> and then we embed elastic <unk> and when i throw this up into the air and catch it it has the full three dimensional structure of the protein 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 200.99 204.82 <NA> all of the intricacies and this gives us a tangible model
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 204.8 213.88 <NA> of the <unk> three dimensional protein and how it folds and all of the intricacies of the geometry <unk> so we can study this as a physical intuitive model <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 213.88 217.43 <NA> and we 're also translating that into two dimensional systems
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 217.22 224.99 <NA> so flat sheets that can self fold into three dimensional structures in three dimensions we did a project last year at
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 225 234.11 <NA> <unk> tedglobal with autodesk and arthur olson where we looked at autonomous parts so individual parts not pre connected that can come together on their own <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 233.62 244.04 <NA> and we built five hundred of these glass beakers they had different molecular structures inside and different colors that could be mixed and matched <unk> and we gave them away to all the tedsters 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 243.61 250.02 <NA> and so these became intuitive models to understand how molecular <unk> self assembly works at the human scale <unk> this is the
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 250 258.42 <NA> polio virus you shake it hard and it breaks apart <unk> and then you shake it randomly and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 257.96 263.76 <NA> and this is demonstrating that through random energy we can build non random shapes
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 265.76 274.93 <NA> we even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale last year at ted long beach we built an installation that builds installations the
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 278.52 285.56 <NA> <unk> so we built a large rotating chamber and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower adding energy to the system
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 285.35 295.24 <NA> and getting an intuitive understanding of how <unk> self assembly works and how we could use this as a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 294.81 300.23 <NA> so remember i said 4d so today for the first time we 're unveiling a new project
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 300.22 307.23 <NA> <unk> which is a collaboration with stratasys <unk> and it 's called 4d printing the idea behind 4d printing is that you take
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 308.53 311.31 <NA> <unk> printing so you can deposit multiple materials
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 311.1 321.11 <NA> and you add a new capability which is transformation that right off the bed the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 320.74 328.52 <NA> and this is like robotics without wires or motors so you completely print this part and it can transform into something else <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 328.57 329.91 <NA> we also worked with
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 329.87 339.78 <NA> <unk> autodesk on a software they 're developing called project cyborg <unk> and this allows us to simulate this self assembly behavior and try to optimize which parts are folding when 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 339.58 348.24 <NA> but most importantly we can use this same software for the design of nanoscale <unk> self assembly systems and human scale <unk> self assembly systems 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 348.24 349.99 <NA> these are parts being printed
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 352.08 355.54 <NA> <unk> here 's the first demonstration a single strand dipped in water
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 355.37 360.49 <NA> that completely self folds on its own into the letters m i t 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 361.32 363.07 <NA> i 'm biased 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 363.42 367.24 <NA> this is another part single strand dipped in a bigger tank
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 367.24 373.39 <NA> that self folds into a cube a three dimensional structure on its own so no human interaction <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 373.5 379.97 <NA> and we think this is the first time that a program and transformation has been embedded directly into the materials
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 379.99 387.54 <NA> <unk> themselves <unk> and it also might just be the manufacturing technique that allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 387.54 393.59 <NA> so i know you 're probably thinking okay that 's cool but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 393.22 395.56 <NA> so i 've started a lab at mit <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 395.56 404.43 <NA> and it 's called the self assembly lab <unk> and we 're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials for the built environment <unk> and we think there 's a few key sectors that have fairly
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 404.93 408.26 <NA> <unk> near term applications one of those is in extreme environments 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 408.27 417.16 <NA> these are scenarios where it 's difficult to build our current construction techniques don 't work it 's too large it 's too dangerous it 's expensive too many parts 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 416.98 428.52 <NA> and space is a great example of that we 're trying to design new scenarios for space that have fully reconfigurable and self assembly structures that can go from highly functional systems from one to another <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 428.39 429.61 <NA> let 's go back to
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 429.57 437.45 <NA> <unk> infrastructure in infrastructure we 're working with a company out of boston called geosyntec <unk> and we 're developing a new paradigm for piping <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 437.24 443.63 <NA> imagine if water pipes could expand or contract to change capacity or change flow rate 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 443.42 448.07 <NA> or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 448.07 454.22 <NA> so this isn 't expensive pumps or valves this is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 455.11 457.1 <NA> <unk> so i want to remind you today
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 456.87 466.34 <NA> of the harsh realities of assembly in our world these are complex things built with complex parts that come together in complex ways <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 466.12 469.95 <NA> so i would like to invite you from whatever industry you 're from
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 469.62 477.54 <NA> to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale <unk> 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 477.54 479.94 <NA> so that we can go from a world like this
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 480.19 482.7 <NA> to a world that 's more like this 
SkylarTibbits_2013U 1 SkylarTibbits_2013U 492.65 493.66 <NA> thank you
