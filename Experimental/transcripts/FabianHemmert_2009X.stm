FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 12.97 19.14 <NA> <unk> i am a phd student <unk> and that means i have a question <unk> how can we make
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 19.14 24.99 <NA> digital content graspable <unk> because you see on the one hand there is the digital world and
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 25.46 33.27 <NA> <unk> many things are happening there right now <unk> and for us humans it 's not quite material it 's not really there it 's virtual 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 33.17 40.29 <NA> on the other hand <unk> we 're humans <unk> we live in a in a physical world it 's rich <unk> it tastes good it feels good it smells good <unk> 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 39.86 45.87 <NA> so the question is how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical that 's my question 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 45.77 54.94 <NA> if you look at the iphone with its touch and the wii with its bodily activity you can see the tendency it 's getting physical the question is what 's next
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 55.11 61.42 <NA> <unk> now i have three options that i would like to show you the first one is mass 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 61.05 67.6 <NA> as humans we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy <unk> so could we use that in mobile phones 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 67.41 75.02 <NA> let me show you the weight shifting mobile <unk> it is a mobile phone shaped box that has an iron weight inside which we can move around
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 75.34 80.24 <NA> <unk> can feel where it 's heavy <unk> we shift the gravitational center of it 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 80.05 90.62 <NA> for example we can augment digital content with physical mass <unk> so you move around the content on the display but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 90.97 99.93 <NA> another thing it 's good for is navigation <unk> it can guide you around in a city it can tell you by its weight ok move right walk ahead 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 100 110.25 <NA> <unk> make a left here and the good thing about that is you don 't have to look at the device all the time you have your eyes free to see the city <unk> now mass is the first thing the second thing 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 109.76 114.57 <NA> that 's shape we 're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in our hands <unk> 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 114.57 123.18 <NA> so if i download an e book and it has twenty pages well they could be thin right but if it has five hundred pages i want to feel that harry potter it 's thick 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 123.29 124.75 <NA> so let me show you
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 127.26 130.81 <NA> <unk> it 's a mobile phone shaped box and this one can change its shape 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 133.02 140.38 <NA> we can play with the shape itself for example it can be thin in your pocket <unk> which we of course want it to be but then if you hold it in your hand it can <unk>
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 140.28 147.13 <NA> <unk> lean towards you be thick <unk> it 's like tapered to the downside if you change the grasp it can adjust to that it
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 155.47 165.32 <NA> another thing is <unk> sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone that are bigger than the phone itself <unk> in that case like here there 's an app that 's bigger than the phone 's screen
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 165.01 174.44 <NA> the shape of the phone could tell you ok <unk> off the screen right here <unk> there is more content you can 't see it but it 's there and you can feel it because it 's thicker at that edge the
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 174.25 179.91 <NA> shape is the second thing the third thing operates on a different level
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 179.92 184.92 <NA> as humans we are social we are empathic <unk> and that 's great wouldn
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 184.52 192.96 <NA> 't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive <unk> think of a hamster in the pocket well i can feel it it 's doing all right i don 't have to check it 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 192.59 198.87 <NA> let me show you the living mobile phone <unk> so once again a mobile phone shaped box <unk> 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 198.65 200.08 <NA> but this one
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 215.04 219.74 <NA> <unk> how do we calm it down you give it a pat behind the ears and
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 219.56 224.44 <NA> everything is all right again <unk> that 's very intuitive and that 's what we want 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 224.44 229.94 <NA> so what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us and i think making it physical
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 230.01 231.68 <NA> is a good way to do that 
FabianHemmert_2009X 1 FabianHemmert_2009X 231.68 242.49 <NA> what 's behind that is a postulation namely not that humans should get much more technical in the future <unk> rather than that technology a bit more human
