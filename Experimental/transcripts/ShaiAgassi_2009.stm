ShaiAgassi_2009 1 ShaiAgassi_2009 26.18 33.36 <NA> <unk> original thought i had this must be ethanol so i went out and researched ethanol and found out you need the amazon in your backyard in every country 
ShaiAgassi_2009 1 ShaiAgassi_2009 33.11 41.34 <NA> about six months later i figured out it must be hydrogen <unk> until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth which is you actually
ShaiAgassi_2009 1 ShaiAgassi_2009 40.94 45.01 <NA> use more clean electrons than the ones you get inside

ShaiAgassi_2009 1 ShaiAgassi_2009 54.93 58.72 <NA> <unk> could convert an entire country to electric cars in a way that is
ShaiAgassi_2009 1 ShaiAgassi_2009 58.47 61.87 <NA> convenient and affordable you could

ShaiAgassi_2009 1 ShaiAgassi_2009 98.1 104.4 <NA> so we 're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics and so the thought that
ShaiAgassi_2009 1 ShaiAgassi_2009 105.26 115.5 <NA> <unk> that i started with was how do you do this still within the boundary of the science we know today no time for science fair no time for playing around with things or waiting for the magic battery to show <unk>
ShaiAgassi_2009 1 ShaiAgassi_2009 115.4 122.91 <NA> <unk> up how do you do it within the economics that we have today how do you do it from the power of the consumer up and not from the power of an edict down

ShaiAgassi_2009 1 ShaiAgassi_2009 248.7 254.76 <NA> because it 's an inconvenience then we looked at the question of the affordability we looked at the question what
