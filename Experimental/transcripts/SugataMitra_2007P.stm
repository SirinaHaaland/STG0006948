SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 244.81 251.81 <NA> i would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that i wish i was in some other school

SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 275 284.8 <NA> when you take education and technology then i find in the literature that you know things like websites collaborative environments you 've been listening to all that in the morning

SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 325.43 334.53 <NA> <unk> took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools <unk> where the score was thirty percent and let 's say took that up to forty percent
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 334.28 343.9 <NA> that will be a completely different thing so the the relative change that et educational technology would make would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top but
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 343.9 350.17 <NA> we seem to be doing it the other way about <unk> so i came to this conclusion that et should reach the underprivileged
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 350.97 359.89 <NA> <unk> not the other way about and finally came the question of how do you tackle teacher perception whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology the teacher 's first reaction is 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 359.46 362.36 <NA> you cannot replace a teacher with a machine

SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 391.78 397.55 <NA> anyway <unk> so i 'm proposing that an alternative primary education whatever alternative you want 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 397.18 404.67 <NA> is required where schools don 't exist where schools are not good enough where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough for

SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 875.22 883.27 <NA> <unk> we did this over and over again this sequence is also nice this is a small child a six year old telling his eldest sister what to do <unk> 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 882.78 888.58 <NA> and this happens very often with these computers that the younger children are found teaching the older ones 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 891.51 893.5 <NA> what did we find <unk> 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 893.28 899.83 <NA> we found that six to 13 year olds can self instruct in a connected environment irrespective of
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 899.67 904.97 <NA> anything that we could measure <unk> so if they have access to
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 904.93 910.19 <NA> <unk> the computer they will teach themselves including intelligence i couldn 't find a single correlation with anything 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 911.05 915.17 <NA> but it had to be in groups and that may be of great <unk> 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 914.95 924.21 <NA> you know interest to this group because all of you are talking about groups <unk> so here was the power of what a group of children can do if you lift
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 924.03 928.35 <NA> the adult intervention just a quick idea of the measurements
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 930.47 934.83 <NA> <unk> we took standard statistical techniques so i 'm going to not talk about that 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 934.43 940.62 <NA> but we got a clean learning curve almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school <unk>
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 940.7 945.72 <NA> i 'll leave it at that because <unk> i mean <unk> it sort of says it all doesn 't it 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 945.5 954.79 <NA> what could they learn to do <unk> basic windows functions browsing painting <unk> chatting and email <unk> games and educational material music downloads
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 955.05 964.27 <NA> <unk> video in short what all of us do and over three hundred children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 963.84 965.32 <NA> with one computer 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 965.79 973.63 <NA> so how do they do that if you calculated the actual time of access it would work out to minutes per day <unk> so that 's not how it 's happening 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 973.32 979.94 <NA> what you have actually is there is one child operating the computer and surrounding him are usually three other children
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 979.98 988.28 <NA> who are advising him on what they should do if you test them all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 988.15 992.75 <NA> around these four are usually a group of about sixteen children 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 992.38 998.18 <NA> who are also advising usually wrongly about everything that 's going on on the computer 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 998.56 1001.51 <NA> and all of them also will clear
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1001.02 1004.97 <NA> a test given on that subject so they are learning as much by watching
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1005.16 1009.38 <NA> as they learn by doing it seems counter intuitive to
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1008.95 1015.98 <NA> adult learning but remember eight year olds live in a society where most of the time they are told don 't do this you know 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1016.33 1025.11 <NA> don 't touch the whiskey bottle <unk> so what does the eight year old do he observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched <unk> and if you tested
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1025.07 1029.13 <NA> <unk> he would answer every question correctly on that topic <unk> so they seem to be able to acquire
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1028.93 1030.42 <NA> very quickly
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1032.81 1036.57 <NA> so what was the conclusion over the six years of work it
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1036.23 1042.18 <NA> was that primary education can happen on its own or parts of it can happen on its own 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1042.17 1046.56 <NA> it does not have to be imposed from the top downwards <unk> 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1046.07 1047.28 <NA> it
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1046.79 1049.6 <NA> could perhaps be a <unk> <unk>
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1051.99 1058.51 <NA> <unk> so that was the second bit that i wanted to tell you that children can <unk> <unk> self organize and attain an educational objective <unk> 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1058.29 1060.77 <NA> the third piece was on values 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1060.56 1068.21 <NA> and again to put it very briefly <unk> i conducted a test over five hundred children spread across all over india 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1068.21 1071.45 <NA> and asked them i gave gave them about sixty eight different
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1072.47 1079.94 <NA> questions and simply asked them their opinions we got all sorts of opinions yes no or i don 't know <unk> i simply took
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1080.22 1085.28 <NA> those questions where i got fifty percent yeses and fifty percent noes
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1085.24 1089.6 <NA> so i was able to get a collection of sixteen such statements 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1089.38 1098.96 <NA> these were areas where the children were clearly confused because half said yes and half said no a typical example being sometimes it is necessary to tell lies 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1099.28 1101.96 <NA> they don 't have a way to determine
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1101.83 1104.58 <NA> which way to answer this question perhaps none of us
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1107.48 1113.34 <NA> so i leave you with this third question can technology alter the acquisition of values <unk> 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1113.45 1119.91 <NA> finally self organizing systems about which again <unk> i won 't say too much because you 've been hearing all about it
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1120.62 1129.94 <NA> natural systems are all self organizing galaxies molecules cells organisms societies except for the debate about an intelligent designer but at this point in
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1129.9 1132.89 <NA> <unk> time as far as science goes it 's self organization 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1132.89 1140.05 <NA> but other examples are traffic jams <unk> stock market society and disaster recovery <unk> terrorism and insurgency <unk> 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1141.84 1150.08 <NA> and you know about the internet based self organizing systems <unk> so here are my four sentences then remoteness affects
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1150.19 1154.63 <NA> <unk> the quality of education educational technology
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1154.47 1160.58 <NA> should be introduced into remote areas first and other areas later <unk> 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1161.05 1165.87 <NA> values are acquired <unk> doctrine and dogma
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1165.66 1167.09 <NA> are imposed
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1166.81 1174.99 <NA> the two opposing mechanisms <unk> and learning is most likely a self organizing system if you put all the four
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1176.81 1186.45 <NA> <unk> it gives according to me it gives us a goal a vision for educational technology an educational technology and pedagogy
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1186.14 1195 <NA> that is digital automatic fault tolerant minimally invasive connected and self organized 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1195.29 1199.65 <NA> as educationists we have never asked for technology we keep borrowing it <unk> 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1200 1209.65 <NA> powerpoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology but it was not meant for education it was meant for making boardroom presentations <unk> we borrowed it <unk> video conferencing <unk> 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1209.19 1216.28 <NA> the personal computer itself <unk> i think it 's time that the educationists made their own specs <unk> and i have such a set of specs 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1215.85 1217.16 <NA> this is
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1216.74 1217.74 <NA> a brief
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1217.52 1225.31 <NA> look at that and such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness values and violence <unk> 
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1225 1227.47 <NA> so i thought i 'd give it a name
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1227.37 1229.07 <NA> why don 't we call it
SugataMitra_2007P 1 SugataMitra_2007P 1229.98 1239.25 <NA> and could this be a goal for educational technology in the future so i want to leave that as a thought with you thank
