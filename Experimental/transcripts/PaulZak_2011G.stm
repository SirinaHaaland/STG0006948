PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 29.72 37.5 <NA> <unk> morality it was all due to this woman sister mary marastela also known as my mom 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 38.45 43.36 <NA> as an altar boy i breathed in a lot of incense <unk> and i learned to say phrases in latin <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 43.36 49.2 <NA> but i also had time to think about whether my mother 's top down morality applied to everybody <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 48.8 54.91 <NA> i saw that people who were religious and non religious were equally obsessed with morality i thought
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 54.95 58.39 <NA> maybe there 's some earthly basis for moral decisions <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 58.32 62.71 <NA> but i wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 62.31 69.55 <NA> i want to know if there 's a chemistry of morality i want to know if there was a moral molecule <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 69.66 73.21 <NA> after ten years of experiments i found it
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 73.41 75.08 <NA> <unk> would you like to see it i brought
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 77.95 81.11 <NA> <unk> this little syringe contains the moral molecule it
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 90.82 93.62 <NA> 's called oxytocin <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 93.25 99.96 <NA> so oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in mammals in rodents <unk> it was known to
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 100 106.74 <NA> <unk> make mothers care for their offspring <unk> and in some creatures allowed for toleration of burrowmates <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 106.28 113.73 <NA> but in humans it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women and is released by both sexes during sex <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 113.66 120.69 <NA> so i had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule <unk> i did what most of us do i tried it on some colleagues
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 120.62 124.48 <NA> one of them told me paul that is the world 's stupidist idea
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 130.17 134.26 <NA> <unk> but i countered well men 's brains make this too there must be a reason why 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 134.43 137.44 <NA> but he was right <unk> it was a stupid idea 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 137.22 145.36 <NA> but it was testably stupid in other words i thought i could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 145.8 150.17 <NA> turns out it wasn 't so easy first of all oxytocin is a shy
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 151.33 157.64 <NA> <unk> baseline levels are near zero without some stimulus to cause its release and when it 's produced it has a <unk>
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 158.67 167.69 <NA> and degrades rapidly at room temperature <unk> so this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin have to grab it fast and keep it cold i think i can do that 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 167.41 174.66 <NA> now luckily oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood <unk> so i could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 176.45 184.63 <NA> <unk> then i had to measure morality <unk> so taking on morality with a capital m is a huge project <unk> so i started smaller
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 184.45 187.65 <NA> i studied one single virtue 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 187.58 189.81 <NA> trustworthiness <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 189.47 190.9 <NA> why 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 190.66 197.08 <NA> i had shown in the early 2000s that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 197.08 201.01 <NA> so in these countries more economic transactions occur
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 200.83 204.97 <NA> and more wealth is created alleviating poverty <unk> so poor countries
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 204.99 207.58 <NA> <unk> are by and large low trust countries <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 207.18 216.88 <NA> so if i understood the chemistry of trustworthiness <unk> i might help alleviate poverty but i 'm also a skeptic <unk> i don 't want to just ask people are you trustworthy 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 216.45 224.23 <NA> so instead i use the jerry maguire approach to research if you 're so virtuous show me the money <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 224.19 229.94 <NA> so what we do in my lab is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money <unk> let me show you how we do that
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 229.98 232.52 <NA> we recruit some people for an experiment 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 232.18 240.92 <NA> they all get $ ten if they agree to show up we give them lots of instruction and we never ever deceive them then we match them in pairs by computer and
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 240.64 247.28 <NA> in that pair one person gets a message saying do you want to give up some of your $ ten you earned for being here
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 246.88 254.58 <NA> and ship it to someone else in the lab the trick is you can 't see them you can 't talk to them <unk> you only do it one time
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 255.17 264.18 <NA> <unk> now whatever you give up gets tripled in the other person 's account you 're going to make them a lot wealthier <unk> and they get a message by computer saying
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 264.18 270.96 <NA> person one sent you this amount of money do you want to keep it all or do you want to send some amount back
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 271.46 279.97 <NA> so think about this experiment for minute you 're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle and take four tubes of blood
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 280.16 288.67 <NA> <unk> and now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger <unk> so this was the birth of vampire economics make a decision and give me some blood <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 289.11 295 <NA> so in fact experimental economists had run this test around the world and for much higher stakes 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 294.63 300.17 <NA> and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 300.73 305.54 <NA> <unk> and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 305.26 314.33 <NA> but in fact economists were flummoxed on why the second person would ever return any money they assumed money is good <unk> why not keep it all 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 314.02 323.57 <NA> that 's not what we found we found ninety percent of the first decision makers sent money and of those who received money ninety five percent returned some of it <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 323.56 329.52 <NA> but why <unk> well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 329.87 335.49 <NA> <unk> more their brain produced oxytocin and the more oxytocin on board <unk> the more money they returned <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 335.6 342.18 <NA> so we have a biology of trustworthiness <unk> but wait what 's wrong with this experiment 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 342.17 350.11 <NA> two things <unk> one is that nothing in the body happens in isolation <unk> so we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 350.79 354.04 <NA> <unk> have any effect but the second is
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 353.87 362.74 <NA> that i still only had this indirect relationship between oxytocin and trustworthiness <unk> i didn 't know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 362.52 368.47 <NA> so to make the experiment i knew i 'd have to go into the brain and manipulate oxytocin directly <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 368.34 375.02 <NA> i used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain and i found i could do it
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 375 376.58 <NA> with a nasal inhaler <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 376.57 383.46 <NA> so along with colleagues in zurich <unk> we put two hundred men on oxytocin or placebo had that same trust test with money and
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 383.46 391.19 <NA> we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 391.12 394.58 <NA> all without altering mood or cognition <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 394.96 401.72 <NA> so oxytocin is the trust molecule <unk> but is it the moral molecule 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 402.04 404.97 <NA> using the oxytocin inhaler <unk> we ran
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 404.96 413.76 <NA> <unk> more studies <unk> we showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by eighty percent

PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 429.51 435.61 <NA> and whenever we raise oxytocin people willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 435.54 440.68 <NA> but why do they do this what does it feel like when your brain is flooded with oxytocin 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 441.33 450.14 <NA> to investigate this question we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four <unk> year old son and his son has terminal brain cancer
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 450.94 456.41 <NA> <unk> after they watched the video we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 456.7 461.63 <NA> the change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 461.92 470.79 <NA> so it 's empathy that makes us connect to other people it 's empathy that makes us help other people it 's empathy
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 470.56 474.78 <NA> that makes us moral now this idea is not new 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 479.93 489.51 <NA> <unk> the theory of moral sentiments in this book smith argued that we are moral creatures not because of a top down reason but for a bottom up reason

PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 502.86 510.41 <NA> now this is the same adam smith who seventeen years later would write a little book called the wealth of nations the founding document of economics <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 510.41 513.13 <NA> but he was in fact a moral philosopher <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 512.64 518.41 <NA> and he was right on why we 're moral <unk> i just found the molecule behind it <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 518.64 526.63 <NA> but knowing that molecule is valuable <unk> because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 526.63 529.94 <NA> in particular it tells us why we see immorality
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 531.13 535.19 <NA> to investigate immorality let me bring you back now to one thousand nine hundred and eighty <unk>

PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 556.73 562.38 <NA> put it in the lost and found well this is very valuable <unk> we have to find the owner for this i said yea 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 561.92 568.32 <NA> so we 're trying to decide what to do with this and the phone rings and a man says very excitedly

PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 615.34 625.05 <NA> so the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him it 's that he shows he trusts the victim now we know what
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 625.67 630.18 <NA> <unk> the victim 's brain releases oxytocin and you 're opening up your wallet or purse giving away the money
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 630.92 635.52 <NA> so who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 635.03 643.14 <NA> we found testing thousands of individuals that five percent of the population don 't release oxytocin on stimulus <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 644.06 650.01 <NA> so if you trust them their brains don 't release oxytocin if there 's money on the table they keep it all <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 650.01 653.82 <NA> so there 's a technical word for these people in my lab we call them
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 653.66 654.94 <NA> bastards
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 657.18 662.56 <NA> these are not people you want to have a beer with they have many of the attributes of psychopaths

PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 666.87 674.47 <NA> improper nurturing <unk> so we 've studied sexually abused women <unk> and about half those don 't release oxytocin on stimulus

PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 679.9 689.45 <NA> <unk> inhibits oxytocin <unk> so we all know this when we 're really stressed out we 're not acting our best there 's another way oxytocin is inhibited which is interesting
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 689.11 691.82 <NA> through the action of testosterone <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 692.08 699.87 <NA> so we in experiments have administered testosterone to men and instead of sharing money they become selfish <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 702.11 707.94 <NA> <unk> high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 708.86 714.95 <NA> now think about this it means within our own biology we have the yin and yang of morality <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 714.96 719.46 <NA> we have oxytocin that connects us to others makes us feel what they feel
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 719.81 729.82 <NA> and we have testosterone and men have ten times the testosterone as women so men do this more than women we have testosterone that makes us want to punish people who behave immorally
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 729.9 735.25 <NA> we don 't need god or government telling us what to do it 's all inside of us <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 735.21 743.26 <NA> so you may be wondering these are beautiful laboratory experiments do they really apply to real life yeah i 've been worrying about that too <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 742.8 750.79 <NA> so i 've gone out of the lab to see if this really holds in our daily lives so last summer i attended a wedding in southern england <unk>

PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 769.48 776.39 <NA> guess what weddings cause a release of oxytocin <unk> but they do so in a very particular way 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 776.17 779.82 <NA> who is the center of the wedding solar system the bride
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 780.05 789.27 <NA> <unk> the biggest increase in oxytocin <unk> who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride <unk> her mother that 's right her mother was number two 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 789.47 796.95 <NA> then the groom 's father then the groom then the family then the friends arrayed around the bride like planets around the sun <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 796.88 802.83 <NA> so i think it tells us that we 've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 802.79 804.94 <NA> connect us emotionally why
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 804.98 809.77 <NA> because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species i
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 810.33 817.13 <NA> also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn 't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 817.13 824.08 <NA> so even though i have a fear of heights i recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at twelve thousand ft <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 824.01 828.5 <NA> i took my blood before and after <unk> and i had a huge spike of oxytocin
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 830.13 832.79 <NA> there are so many ways we can connect to people

PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 836.14 843.02 <NA> so we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double digit increase in oxytocin <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 843.04 850.07 <NA> so i ran this experiment recently for the korean broadcasting system <unk> and they had the reporters and their producers participate <unk> 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 852.65 857.44 <NA> <unk> had one hundred and fifty percent spike in oxytocin <unk> i mean astounding no one has this 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 857.44 866.82 <NA> so he was using social media in private <unk> when i wrote my report to the koreans i said look <unk> i don 't know what this guy was doing but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 866.36 870.93 <NA> they checked he was interacting on his girlfriend 's facebook page 
PaulZak_2011G 1 PaulZak_2011G 870.62 879.73 <NA> there you go that 's connection so there 's tons of ways that we can connect to other people and it seems to be universal two weeks ago
