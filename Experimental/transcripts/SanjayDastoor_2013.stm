SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 32.75 35.44 <NA> but when i say the word electric vehicle 
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 35.44 44.5 <NA> people think about vehicles they think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles and the vehicles that you use every day <unk> but if you come about it from a different perspective

SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 46.91 51.61 <NA> <unk> more novel concepts <unk> so we built something
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 51.37 54.97 <NA> i 've got some of the pieces in my pocket here so this is the
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 54.9 56.08 <NA> <unk> motor

SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 76.75 80.63 <NA> <unk> but the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store 
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 80.23 83 <NA> these are from remote control airplanes 
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 82.54 92.87 <NA> and the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently you can really change things so today we 're going to show you one example of how you can use this 
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 93.1 100.17 <NA> pay attention to not only how fun this thing is but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 100.1 102.22 <NA> <unk> the way you interact with a city like san francisco

SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 217.53 221.44 <NA> for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car 
SanjayDastoor_2013 1 SanjayDastoor_2013 221.13 229.7 <NA> which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build <unk> but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use
