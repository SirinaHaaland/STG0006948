DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 27.26 37.62 <NA> <unk> and the reason i 'm saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent <unk> that people have just sort of figured out about it and now with kyoto and the governator and <unk>
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 37.57 43.39 <NA> people beginning to actually do something we may be on the road to a solution the fact is uh uh 
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 54.96 65.11 <NA> <unk> this is the growth rate of co2 in the atmosphere you 've seen this in various forms <unk> but maybe you haven 't seen this one what this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating <unk> and <unk>
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 65.06 79.97 <NA> that it 's accelerating even faster than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back so that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said the environmentalists only put in the projections to make the projections look as bad as possible that emissions would never grow
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 79.99 83.42 <NA> <unk> as fast as that red line but in fact they 're growing faster 
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 83.14 93.35 <NA> here 's some data from actually just ten days ago <unk> which shows this year 's minimum of the arctic sea ice and it 's the lowest by far <unk> and the rate at which the arctic sea ice <unk>
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 93.25 99.93 <NA> <unk> is going away is a lot quicker than models so despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and burning

DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 139.12 150.11 <NA> no this is really important to have this sense of scale <unk> so the problem is soluble and the way we should go about solving solving it is say <unk> dealing with electricity production which causes something like
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 150.37 164.15 <NA> <unk> percent and rising of co2 emissions and we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation <unk> and wind power nuclear power and coal to co2 capture which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment and work

DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 175 185.1 <NA> <unk> about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing <unk> and it 's this stuff in the middle here <unk> which is what you do if you don 't stop the emissions quickly enough and <unk>
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 185 195.12 <NA> <unk> you need to deal somehow break the link between human actions that change climate and the climate change itself <unk> and that 's particularly important because of course while we can adapt to climate change <unk>
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 195.07 204.97 <NA> and it 's important to be honest here there will be some benefits to climate change oh yes i think it 's bad i 've spent my whole life working to stop it but one of the reasons it 's politically hard is there are winners and losers not all losers
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 204.69 213.91 <NA> <unk> losers but of course the natural world polar bears i spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high arctic they will completely lose and there 's no adaption <unk> 
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 213.45 220.66 <NA> so this problem is absolutely soluble this geo engineering idea in it 's simplest form is basically the following you could put

DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 236.14 243.87 <NA> and it was done not by us not by me but by nature here 's mount pinatubo in the early ' 90s that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere

DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 254.9 265.09 <NA> <unk> the upper atmosphere the stratosphere and it heats up after these volcanoes but you 'll notice that in the upper bar which is the lower atmosphere and the surface it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit 
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 265.04 276.31 <NA> <unk> there 's no big mystery about it there 's lots of mystery in the details <unk> and there 's some bad side effects like it partially destroys the ozone layer and i 'll get to that in a minute <unk> but it clearly cools down and one other thing 
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 280.02 290.68 <NA> <unk> much of the other things that we ought to do like slowing emissions are intrinsically slow because it takes takes time to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions and not only that when you cut emissions <unk>
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 290.63 302.83 <NA> you don 't cut concentrations because concentrations the amount of co2 in the air is the sum of emissions over time so you can 't step on the brakes very quickly but if you do this <unk> it 's quick <unk> and there are times you might like to do something quick
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 304.93 315.2 <NA> <unk> does it work can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added co2 and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally and the answer seems to be <unk>
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 315.15 324.96 <NA> yes <unk> so here are the graphs you 've seen lots of times before that 's what the world looks like under one particular climate model 's view with twice the amount of co2 in the air <unk> the lower graph is with twice the amount of
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 325.49 332.62 <NA> <unk> one point eight percent less sunlight and you 're back to the original climate and this graph from ken caldeira <unk> it 's important to say came because ken

DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 356.03 366.34 <NA> that report <unk> in fact which had all the modern climate science the only thing they talked about doing was geo engineering it didn 't even talk about cutting emissions which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem <unk>
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 366.29 374.75 <NA> i 'm not saying we shouldn 't cut emissions we should but it it made exactly this point so in a sense there 's not much new the one new thing is this essay <unk> 
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 384.91 392.21 <NA> <unk> people always talked about this idea not as something that was foolproof but as an idea to think about but when climate became politically 
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 392.02 399.87 <NA> a hot topic if i may make the pun in in the last fifteen years this became so un pc we couldn 't talk about it it just sunk

DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 415.07 428.14 <NA> <unk> deal was he happened to have won the nobel prize for ozone chemistry and so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this <unk> even though there will be some ozone impacts and in fact he had some ideas to make them go away there was all sorts of press coverage all over the world 
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 429.99 439.67 <NA> <unk> earth from the economist <unk> and that got me thinking i 've worked on this topic on and off but not so much technically <unk> and i was actually lying in bed thinking one night and i thought about this child 's toy
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 439.67 449.93 <NA> hence the title of my talk and i wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin ' round in the child 's radiometer to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere and make them stay there
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 450.49 455.33 <NA> <unk> problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly the other problem is they 're right in the ozone layer and i 'd prefer them above the ozone layer

DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 461.45 468.27 <NA> but then i found out that there were all sorts of papers already published that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere 
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 468.09 475.01 <NA> so it seems there are already fine particles that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere about one hundred kilometers up that already have this effect i
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 474.52 479.76 <NA> 'll tell you very quickly how the effect works there are a lot of fun complexities that i 'd love to spend the whole evening on
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 480.59 491.22 <NA> but let 's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it 's unevenly heated <unk> so the side facing the sun is warmer the side away cooler <unk> gas molecules that bounce off the warm side bounce away with some extra velocity <unk>
DavidKeith_2007S 1 DavidKeith_2007S 491.17 497.59 <NA> because it 's warm <unk> and so you see a net force away from the sun that 's called the photophoretic force
