ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 162.83 173.3 <NA> well how about with higher levels of amputation now you 've lost your arm above the elbow <unk> you 're missing not only these muscles but your hand and your elbow too what do you do

ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 250.24 254.97 <NA> when you lose your arm that nervous system still works those nerves can put

ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 257.7 267.24 <NA> the nerve ending on a world war ii vet he 'll still feel his missing hand so you might say let 's go to the brain and put put
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 266.75 274.75 <NA> something in the brain to record signals <unk> or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there <unk> and these are very exciting research
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 276.39 277.73 <NA> <unk> really hard 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 277.73 289.07 <NA> you have to put in hundreds of microscopic wires to record from little tiny individual neurons ordinary fibers that put out tiny signals that are that are microvolts <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 288.83 295.96 <NA> and it 's just too hard to use now and for my patients today so we developed a different approach we
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 296.13 299.81 <NA> 're using a biological amplifier
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 299.62 304.97 <NA> to amplify these nerve signals muscles muscles will amplify the nerve signals
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 306.46 311.13 <NA> <unk> that we can record them from on top of the skin like you saw earlier <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 311.13 320.34 <NA> so our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation <unk> imagine with somebody who 's lost their whole arm <unk> we still have four major nerves
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 320.11 329.88 <NA> that go down your arm <unk> and we take the nerve away from your chest muscle and let these nerves grow into it now you think close hand and a little section of your
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 329.78 339.84 <NA> <unk> chest contracts you think bend elbow a different section contracts <unk> and we can use electrodes or antennae <unk> to pick that up and tell the arm to move 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 339.41 341.31 <NA> that 's the idea <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 341.6 347.79 <NA> so this is the first man that we tried it on his name is jesse sullivan he 's just a saint of a man
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 348.77 354.91 <NA> <unk> lineman who touched the wrong wire and had both of his arms burnt so badly they had to be amputated at the shoulder
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 354.96 369.07 <NA> jesse came to us at the ric to be fit with these state of the art devices and here you see them i 'm still using that old technology with a bicycle cable on his right side and he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 368.61 375.2 <NA> on the left side he 's got a modern motorized prosthesis with those three joints <unk> and he operates
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 375.61 382.55 <NA> <unk> pads in his shoulder that he touches to make the arm go and jesse 's a good crane operator and he did okay by our standards <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 382.15 389.37 <NA> he also required a revision surgery on his chest and that gave us the opportunity to do targeted reinnervation <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 389.37 400.44 <NA> so my colleague dr greg dumanian did the surgery first we cut away the nerve to his own muscle then we took the arm nerves and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 400.23 404.94 <NA> and closed him up and after about three months the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 405.34 410.31 <NA> after six months the nerves grew in well and you could see strong contractions 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 410.08 416.7 <NA> and this is what it looks like this is what happens when jesse thinks open and close his hand 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 416.7 425.17 <NA> or bend or straighten your elbow <unk> you can see the movements on his chest and those little hash marks are where we put our antennae or electrodes
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 425.37 429.01 <NA> <unk> and i challenge anybody in the room to make their chest go like this 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 428.91 438.09 <NA> his brain is thinking about his arm <unk> he has not learned how to do this with the chest there is not a learning process that 's why it 's intuitive 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 437.87 448.69 <NA> so here 's jesse in our first little test with him on the left hand side you see his original prosthesis <unk> and he 's using those switches to move little blocks from one box to the other he 's
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 448.69 450.02 <NA> had that arm for about twenty
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 450.34 451.56 <NA> <unk> 's pretty good with it 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 451.56 461.16 <NA> on the right side <unk> two months after we fit him with his targeted reinnervation prosthesis which by the way is the same physical arm <unk> just programmed a little different
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 460.83 469.31 <NA> you can see that he 's much faster and much smoother as he moves these little blocks and we 're only able to use three of the signals at this time 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 469.15 479.94 <NA> then we had one of those little surprises in science <unk> so we 're all motivated to get motor commands to drive robotic arms <unk> and after a few months
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 480.22 484.98 <NA> <unk> you touch jesse on his chest and he felt his missing hand 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 484.67 494.34 <NA> his hand sensation grew into his chest again probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat so the skin was right down to the muscle and deinnervated if you would his skin <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 494.17 498.6 <NA> so you touch jesse here he feels his thumb you touch it here he feels his pinky <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 498.6 504.73 <NA> he feels light touch down to one gram of force <unk> he feels hot cold sharp
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 504.72 511.84 <NA> <unk> dull all in his missing hand or both his hand and his chest but he can attend to either <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 511.38 521.92 <NA> so this is really exciting for us because now we have a portal a portal or a way to potentially give back sensation <unk> so that he might feel what he touches <unk>
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 521.87 529.88 <NA> with his prosthetic hand imagine sensors in the hand coming up and pressing on this new hand skin so it was very exciting
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 530.2 540.02 <NA> we 've also gone on with what was initially our primary population of people with above the elbow amputations <unk> and here we deinnervate or cut the nerve away <unk>
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 539.97 548.07 <NA> just from little segments of muscle and leave others alone that give us our up down signals and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 555.16 556.93 <NA> it is two months he 's about
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 556.72 561.78 <NA> four or five times as fast with this simple little performance metric all
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 563.81 574.99 <NA> so one of the best parts of my job is working with really great patients who are also our research collaborators and we 're fortunate today to have amanda kitts come and join
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 584.82 595.91 <NA> <unk> so amanda would you please tell us how you lost your arm amanda kitts sure in two thousand and six i had a car accident <unk> and i was driving home from work and a truck was coming the opposite direction 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 595.91 599.87 <NA> came over into my lane ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 602.8 609.2 <NA> <unk> your amputation you healed up and you 've got one of these conventional arms can you tell us how it worked ak 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 608.74 614.12 <NA> well it was a little difficult because all i had to work with was a bicep and a tricep so
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 613.75 621.47 <NA> for the simple little things like picking something up i would have to bend my elbow and then i would have to cocontract
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 621.47 627.47 <NA> to get it to change modes when i did that i had to use my
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 627.01 629.67 <NA> bicep to get the hand to close
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 630.2 636.69 <NA> use my tricep to get it to open cocontract again to get the elbow to work again tk 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 636.53 646.71 <NA> so it was a little slow ak a little slow and it was it was just hard to work you had to concentrate a whole lot tk okay <unk> so i think about nine months later that <unk>
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 646.61 654.97 <NA> <unk> you had the targeted reinnervation surgery <unk> took six more months to have all the reinnervation then we fit her with a prosthesis
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 655.22 661.36 <NA> <unk> and how did that work for you ak it works good <unk> i was able to
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 661.74 666.04 <NA> use my elbow and my hand simultaneously <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 666.04 672.13 <NA> i could work them just by my thoughts <unk> so i didn 't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that tk
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 671.97 675.02 <NA> a little faster ak a little faster and much
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 678.46 687.42 <NA> <unk> this was my goal for twenty years my goal was to let somebody [ be ] able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way and at the same time <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 687.42 696.09 <NA> and we now have over fifty patients around the world who have had this surgery <unk> including over a dozen of our wounded warriors in the u s armed services 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 695.87 704.91 <NA> the success rate of the nerve transfers is very high it 's like ninety six percent because we 're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle and it provides
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 704.93 706.85 <NA> <unk> intuitive control 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 706.86 715.57 <NA> our functional testing those little tests all show that they 're a lot quicker and a lot easier and the most important thing is our patients have appreciated it 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 715.33 718.56 <NA> so that was all very exciting but
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 718.49 720.51 <NA> we want to do better
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 720.08 729.73 <NA> there 's a lot of information in those nerve signals and we wanted to get more you can move each finger you can move your thumb your wrist
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 730.11 732.62 <NA> <unk> we get more out of it so we did some experiments
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 732.44 739.81 <NA> where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 739.35 750.11 <NA> from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm to reaching for something and recorded this data <unk> and then we used some algorithms that are a lot like speech recognition algorithms
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 755.92 766.34 <NA> <unk> here you can see on jesse 's chest when he just tried to do three different things you can see three different patterns <unk> but i can i can 't put in an electrode and say go there <unk>
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 766.29 773.67 <NA> so we collaborated with our colleagues in university of new brunswick came up with this algorithm control which amanda can now demonstrate ak 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 779.63 783.9 <NA> <unk> rotation that goes and it can go all the way around and i have
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 784.19 790.65 <NA> the wrist flexion and extension and i also have the hand closed and open tk 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 790.7 795.27 <NA> thank you amanda now this is a research arm but it 's made out of
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 795.02 799.96 <NA> commercial components from here down and a few that i 've borrowed from around the world
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 800.73 809.65 <NA> <unk> it 's about seven pounds which is probably about what my arm would weigh if i lost it right here <unk> obviously that 's heavy for amanda
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 809.49 816.85 <NA> <unk> and in fact it feels even heavier because it 's not glued on the same she 's carrying all the weight through harnesses <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 816.84 821.99 <NA> so the exciting part isn 't so much the the mechatronics but the control <unk> so we 've
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 821.81 822.83 <NA> developed
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 822.6 829.82 <NA> a small microcomputer that is blinking somewhere behind her back and is operating this all by the way
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 829.78 837.44 <NA> <unk> she trains it to use her individual muscle signals so amanda when you first started using this arm how long did it take to
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 837.24 847.94 <NA> use it ak it took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train i had to hook it up to a computer <unk> so i couldn 't just train it anywhere so if it stopped working 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 847.93 850.05 <NA> i just had to take it off so
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 850.52 853.78 <NA> <unk> it 's able to train with just this little piece on the back 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 853.78 860.82 <NA> i can wear it around if it stops working for some reason i can retrain it <unk> takes about a minute tk so we
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 860.45 868.51 <NA> 're really excited because now we 're getting to a clinically practical device <unk> and that that 's where our goal is to have
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 868.18 877.89 <NA> something clinically pragmatic to wear we 've also had amanda able to use some of our more advanced arms that i showed you earlier 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 877.91 879.97 <NA> here 's amanda using an arm
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 880.02 886.09 <NA> <unk> made by deka research corporation and i believe dean kamen presented it at ted a few years ago <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 885.72 891.54 <NA> so amanda you can see has really good control it 's all the pattern recognition <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 891.54 904.61 <NA> and it now has a hand that can do different grasps what we do is have the patient go all the way open and think what hand grasp pattern do i want it goes into that mode and then you can do up to five or six different hand grasps with this hand
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 904.87 915.26 <NA> <unk> amanda how many were you able to do with the deka arm ak i was able to get four <unk> i had the key grip i had a chuck grip <unk> i had a power grasp and i had a fine <unk>
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 915.16 920.96 <NA> <unk> pinch but my favorite one was just when the hand was open because i work with kids <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 930.81 940.02 <NA> so that 's exciting on on where we may go with the better mechatronics <unk> if we make them good enough to put out on the market and use in a field trial i want
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 939.65 941.19 <NA> you to watch closely <unk>
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 943.49 950.2 <NA> that 's claudia <unk> and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 951.45 964.3 <NA> <unk> had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis that then she rubbed over different surfaces and she could feel different textures of sandpaper different grits ribbon cable as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 964.26 968.95 <NA> <unk> she said that when she just ran it across the table it felt like her finger was rocking <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 968.95 975.29 <NA> so that 's an exciting laboratory experiment on how to give back potentially some skin sensation 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 975.08 979.91 <NA> but here 's another video that shows some of our challenges this is jesse <unk> and he 's squeezing a foam toy
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 979.72 986.57 <NA> <unk> toy and the harder he squeezes you see a little black thing in the middle that 's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 986.57 990.57 <NA> but look at all the electrodes around it i 've got a real estate problem you
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 990.39 999.45 <NA> 're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there <unk> but our little motor 's making all kinds of noise right next to my electrodes <unk> so we 're really challenged on what we 're doing there
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1000.61 1014.66 <NA> <unk> the future is bright we 're excited about where we are and and a lot of things we want to do <unk> so for example one is to get rid of my real estate problem and get better signals we want to develop these little tiny
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1014.44 1024.89 <NA> capsules about the size of a piece of risotto that we can put into the muscles and telemeter out the emg signals <unk> so that it 's not worrying about electrode contact <unk>
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1024.84 1029.76 <NA> <unk> and we can have the real estate open to try more sensation feedback 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1030.02 1036.42 <NA> <unk> to build a better arm <unk> this arm they 're always made for the 50th percentile male which means they 're
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1036.42 1046.14 <NA> too big for five eighths of the world so rather than a super strong or super fast arm <unk> we 're making an arm that is we 're starting with the <unk>
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1047.71 1054.64 <NA> percentile female that will have a hand that wraps around <unk> opens all the way two degrees of freedom
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1055.08 1058.5 <NA> <unk> and an elbow so it 'll be the smallest and lightest
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1058.34 1064.76 <NA> and the smartest arm ever made once we can do it that small it 's a lot easier making them bigger 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1064.76 1068.32 <NA> so those are just some of our goals <unk> and
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1068.37 1075.11 <NA> we really appreciate you all being here today i 'd like to tell you a little bit about the dark side with yesterday 's theme <unk> 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1077.5 1082.85 <NA> <unk> 's using the arm <unk> and everything goes wrong <unk> there was a
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1082.68 1091.4 <NA> computer spook a broken wire a converter that sparked we took out a whole circuit in the hotel and and just about put on the fire alarm 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1091.18 1101.65 <NA> and none of those problems could i have dealt with <unk> but i have a really bright research team and thankfully dr annie simon was with us and worked really hard yesterday to fix it 
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1101.65 1104.88 <NA> that 's science <unk> and fortunately it worked today
ToddKuiken_2011G 1 ToddKuiken_2011G 1104.89 1106.06 <NA> so thank you very
