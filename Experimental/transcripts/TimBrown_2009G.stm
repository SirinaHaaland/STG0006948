TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 42.47 49.08 <NA> this is the second project that i did it 's a fax machine i put an attractive shell around some new technology <unk>

TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 57.36 65.56 <NA> now i 'm a fairly slow learner but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn 't all that important
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 65.91 74.81 <NA> making things more attractive making them a bit easier to use <unk> making them more marketable by focusing on a

TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 79.06 88.77 <NA> and not having much of an impact <unk> but i think this small view of design is a relatively recent phenomenon <unk> and in fact really emerged

TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 91.26 94.43 <NA> as design became a tool of consumerism <unk> 
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 94.24 103.35 <NA> so when we talk about design today and particularly when we read about it in the popular press we 're often talking about products like these amusing yes

TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 107.54 116.61 <NA> but this wasn 't always the way <unk> and i 'd like to suggest that if we take a different view of design and focus less on the object
TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 116.27 122.97 <NA> and more on design thinking as an approach that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact <unk>

TimBrown_2009G 1 TimBrown_2009G 559.75 563.88 <NA> i think the design of participatory systems in which
