JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 14.32 20.54 <NA> <unk> it 's something we spend about a third of our lives doing <unk> but do any of us really understand what it 's all about 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 20.53 25.05 <NA> two thousand years ago galen one of the most prominent medical researchers
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 25.04 34.36 <NA> <unk> of the ancient world proposed that while we 're awake our brain 's motive force its juice would flow out to all the other parts of the body <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 34.36 38.16 <NA> animating them but leaving the brain all dried up 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 37.76 46.03 <NA> and he thought that when we sleep all this moisture that filled the rest of the body would come rushing back rehydrating the brain
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 45.82 54.91 <NA> and refreshing the mind <unk> now that sounds completely ridiculous to us now <unk> but galen was simply trying to explain something about sleep that
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 54.93 62.14 <NA> <unk> we all deal with every day see we all know based on our own experience that when you sleep <unk> it clears your mind 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 61.65 65.68 <NA> and when you don 't sleep <unk> it leaves your mind murky <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 65.7 70.51 <NA> but while we know a great deal more about sleep now than when galen was around <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 70.05 78.43 <NA> we still haven 't understood why it is that sleep of all of our activities has this incredible restorative function for the mind <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 78.24 79.97 <NA> so today i want to tell you
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 79.9 89.76 <NA> <unk> about some recent research that may shed new light on this question we 've found that sleep may actually be a kind of elegant design solution
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 89.58 101.42 <NA> to some of the brain 's most basic needs a unique way that the brain meets the high demands and the narrow margins that set it apart from all the other organs of the body <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 102.28 104.97 <NA> so almost all the biology that we observe
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 105.16 110.19 <NA> can be thought of as a series of problems and their corresponding solutions <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 109.79 117.6 <NA> and the first problem that every organ must solve is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel all those cells of the body <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 117.2 125.11 <NA> in the brain that is especially critical its intense electrical activity uses up a quarter of the body 's entire energy supply 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 125.11 129.34 <NA> even though the brain accounts for only about two percent of the body 's mass
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 130.11 139.9 <NA> <unk> so the circulatory system solves the nutrient delivery problem by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients and oxygen to every corner of our body 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 139.92 142.99 <NA> you can actually see it in this video here <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 142.5 152.36 <NA> here we 're imaging blood vessels in the brain of a living mouse the blood vessels form a complex network that fills the entire brain volume <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 152.36 154.91 <NA> they start at the surface of the brain <unk> and then they
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 154.84 163.94 <NA> <unk> dive down into the tissue itself <unk> and as they spread out they supply nutrients and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 164.86 178.98 <NA> now just as every cell requires nutrients to fuel it every cell also produces waste as a byproduct <unk> and the clearance of that waste is the second basic problem that each organ has to solve
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 179.99 184.67 <NA> <unk> this diagram shows the body 's lymphatic system <unk> which has evolved to meet this need 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 184.45 189.49 <NA> it 's a second parallel network of vessels that extends throughout the body <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 189.49 198.36 <NA> it takes up proteins and other waste from the spaces between the cells <unk> it collects them <unk> and then dumps them into the blood so they can be disposed of <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 198.23 199.96 <NA> but if you look really closely at
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 200.7 209 <NA> <unk> see something that doesn 't make a lot of sense <unk> so if we were to zoom into this guy 's head one of the things that you would see there
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 208.76 212.29 <NA> is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 212.88 216.28 <NA> but that that doesn 't make a lot of sense does it 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 215.88 224.59 <NA> i mean the brain is this intensely active organ that produces a correspondingly large amount of waste that must be efficiently cleared <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 225.49 231.53 <NA> <unk> it lacks lymphatic vessels which means that the approach that the rest of the body takes to clearing away its waste
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 231.33 233.42 <NA> won 't work in the brain <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 233.95 242.09 <NA> so how then does the brain solve its waste clearance problem well that seemingly mundane question
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 241.63 247.22 <NA> is where our group first jumped into this story <unk> and what we found
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 247.09 250.11 <NA> as we dove down into the brain down
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 250 259.29 <NA> down among the neurons and the blood vessels was that the brain 's solution to the problem of waste clearance <unk> it was really unexpected <unk>
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 258.86 261.84 <NA> it was ingenious 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 261.77 264.12 <NA> but it was also beautiful <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 264.65 266.85 <NA> let me tell you about what we found <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 266.6 274.26 <NA> so the brain has this large pool of clean clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid we call it the csf 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 274.26 278.2 <NA> the csf fills the space that surrounds the brain 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 277.99 279.79 <NA> and wastes from inside the brain
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 279.87 288.34 <NA> <unk> make their way out to the csf which gets dumped along with the waste into the blood so in that way it sounds a lot like the lymphatic system doesn 't it 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 288.42 298.12 <NA> but what 's interesting is that the fluid and the waste from inside the brain <unk> they don 't just percolate their way randomly out to these pools of csf <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 297.72 301.85 <NA> instead there is a specialized network of plumbing
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 301.69 304.94 <NA> that organizes and facilitates this process
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 305.26 307.65 <NA> you can see that in these videos <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 307.65 321.84 <NA> here <unk> we 're again imaging into the brain of living mice <unk> the frame on your left shows what 's happening at the brain 's surface and the frame on your right shows what 's happening down below the surface of the brain within the tissue itself we 've
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 321.6 327.35 <NA> labeled the blood vessels in red and the csf that 's surrounding the brain will be in green <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 327.28 329.97 <NA> now what was surprising to us was that the
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 329.96 335.55 <NA> <unk> fluid on the outside of the brain <unk> it didn 't stay on the outside <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 335.18 340.87 <NA> instead the csf was pumped back into and through the brain
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 340.45 343.74 <NA> along the outsides of the blood vessels <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 343.64 348.16 <NA> and as it flushed down into the brain along the outsides of these vessels <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 348.16 354.97 <NA> it was actually helping to clear away to clean the waste from the spaces between the brain 's cells
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 355.1 361.54 <NA> <unk> if you think about it using the outsides of these blood vessels like this
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 361.08 363.88 <NA> is a really clever design solution <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 363.87 376.81 <NA> because the brain is enclosed in a rigid skull and it 's packed full of cells so there is no extra space inside it for a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 376.62 379.91 <NA> yet the blood vessels <unk> they extend from the surface of the
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 379.87 390.89 <NA> <unk> brain down to reach every single cell in the brain <unk> which means that fluid that 's traveling along the outsides of these vessels can gain easy access to the entire brain 's volume <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 390.64 404.7 <NA> so it 's actually this really clever way to repurpose one set of vessels the blood vessels to take over and replace the function of a second set of vessels <unk> the lymphatic vessels to make it so you don 't need them
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 405.53 417 <NA> and what 's amazing is that no other organ takes quite this approach to clearing away the waste from between its cells this is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 417.83 420.48 <NA> <unk> but our most surprising finding
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 420.2 425.02 <NA> was that all of this everything i just told you about with
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 425 431.35 <NA> <unk> all this fluid rushing through the brain it 's only happening in the sleeping brain
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 431.97 439.78 <NA> <unk> here the video on the left shows how much of the csf is moving through the brain of a living mouse while it 's awake 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 439.56 441.58 <NA> it 's almost nothing
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 441.21 449.69 <NA> <unk> yet in the same animal if we wait just a little while until it 's gone to sleep <unk> what we see is that the csf is
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 451.78 456.23 <NA> <unk> and we discovered that at the same time when the brain goes to sleep 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 455.83 465.77 <NA> the brain cells themselves seem to shrink <unk> opening up spaces in between them <unk> allowing fluid to rush through and allowing waste to be cleared out <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 465.46 475.19 <NA> so it seems that galen may actually have been sort of on the right track when he wrote about fluid rushing through the brain when sleep came on 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 474.7 479.94 <NA> our own research now it 's two thousand years later <unk> suggests that what 's
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 479.9 484.96 <NA> <unk> happening is that when the brain is awake and is at its most busy <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 484.96 490.48 <NA> it puts off clearing away the waste from the spaces between its cells until later <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 490.25 500.05 <NA> and then when it goes to sleep and doesn 't have to be as busy <unk> it shifts into a kind of cleaning mode to clear away the waste from the spaces between its
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 500.31 514.9 <NA> <unk> the waste that 's accumulated throughout the day <unk> so it 's actually a little bit like how you or i we put off our household chores during the work week when we don 't have time to get to it and then we play catch up on all the cleaning that we have to do when the weekend rolls around
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 515.79 524.08 <NA> now i 've just talked a lot about waste clearance <unk> but i haven 't been very specific about the kinds of waste that the brain needs to be clearing
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 523.62 529.61 <NA> during sleep in order to stay healthy the waste product that these recent studies focused most on is
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 529.98 537.47 <NA> is amyloid beta which is a protein that 's made in made in the brain all the time <unk> my brain 's making amyloid beta right now and so is yours <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 537.37 547.31 <NA> but in patients with alzheimer 's disease amyloid beta builds up and aggregates in the spaces between the brain 's cells instead of being cleared away like it 's supposed to be 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 547.84 554.4 <NA> and it 's this buildup of amyloid beta that 's thought to be one of the key steps in the development of that terrible disease
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 554.9 561.06 <NA> <unk> we measured how fast amyloid beta is cleared from the brain when it 's awake versus when it 's asleep <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 561.06 568.38 <NA> and we found that indeed the clearance of amyloid beta is much more rapid from the sleeping brain <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 569.03 575.32 <NA> so if sleep then is part of the brain 's solution to the problem of waste clearance
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 575.61 582.94 <NA> <unk> then this may dramatically change how we think about the relationship between sleep amyloid beta and alzheimer 's disease 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 582.84 589.99 <NA> a series of recent clinical studies suggest that among patients who haven 't yet developed alzheimer 's disease <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 589.99 597.61 <NA> worsening sleep quality and sleep duration are associated with a greater amount of amyloid beta building up in the brain <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 597.66 604.97 <NA> and while it 's important to point out that these studies don 't prove that lack of sleep or poor sleep cause alzheimer 's
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 604.93 606.17 <NA> <unk> disease <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 605.77 613.37 <NA> they do suggest that the failure of the brain to keep its house clean by clearing away waste like amyloid beta
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 613.37 617.9 <NA> may contribute to the development of conditions like alzheimer 's 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 618.58 624.68 <NA> so what this new research tells us then is that the one thing that all of you already knew about sleep 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 624.68 629.73 <NA> that even galen understood about sleep that it refreshes and clears the mind
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 629.96 633.99 <NA> may actually be a big part of what sleep is all about 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 633.83 642.34 <NA> see you and i we go to sleep every single night <unk> but our brains <unk> they never rest while our body is still
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 641.98 645.33 <NA> and our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 644.9 653.64 <NA> the elegant machinery of the brain is quietly hard at work cleaning and maintaining this unimaginably complex machine 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 653.66 654.97 <NA> like our housework
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 655.19 664.18 <NA> it 's a dirty and a thankless job <unk> but it 's also important in your house if you stop cleaning your kitchen for a month 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 664.08 668.53 <NA> your home will become completely unlivable very quickly <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 668.31 674.78 <NA> but in the brain <unk> the consequences of falling behind may be much greater than the embarrassment of dirty
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 676.75 684.08 <NA> <unk> when it comes to cleaning the brain it is the very health and function of the mind and the body that 's at stake <unk> 
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 683.77 690.68 <NA> which is why understanding these very basic housekeeping functions of the brain today
JeffIliff_2014P 1 JeffIliff_2014P 690.25 695.79 <NA> may be critical for preventing and treating diseases of the mind tomorrow
