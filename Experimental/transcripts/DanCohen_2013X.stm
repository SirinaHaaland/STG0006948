DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 15.22 24.99 <NA> <unk> as he said and what that means is that i argue it 's an important part of my life <unk> and i like to argue and i 'm not just an academic i 'm a
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 26.09 33.16 <NA> <unk> so i like to think that i 'm actually pretty good at arguing <unk> but i also like to think a lot about arguing <unk> and
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 33.16 41.34 <NA> in thinking about arguing <unk> i 've come across some puzzles and one of the puzzles is that as i 've been thinking about arguing over the years and it 's been decades now
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 41 46.65 <NA> i 've gotten better at arguing <unk> but the more that i argue and the better i get at arguing 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 46.55 54.97 <NA> the more that i lose <unk> and that 's a puzzle and the other puzzle is that i 'm actually okay with that why is it that i 'm okay with
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 54.93 64.33 <NA> <unk> losing and why is it that i think good arguers are actually better at losing <unk> well there are some other puzzles one is why do we argue <unk> who benefits from arguments
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 64.33 66.56 <NA> when i think about arguments <unk> i 'm talking about
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 66.38 74.99 <NA> let 's call them academic arguments or cognitive arguments where something cognitive is at stake is this proposition true is this theory a good theory is
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 75 80.73 <NA> <unk> a viable interpretation of the data or the text <unk> and so on i 'm not interested really in arguments about
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 80.49 82.74 <NA> whose turn it is to do the dishes or who
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 82.56 84.41 <NA> has to take out the garbage <unk> 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 84.01 86.57 <NA> yeah <unk> we have those arguments too 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 86.57 94.37 <NA> i tend to win those arguments because i know the tricks <unk> but those aren 't the important arguments <unk> i 'm interested in academic arguments <unk> and here are the things that puzzle me <unk> 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 93.94 95.57 <NA> first
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 95.59 98.64 <NA> <unk> what do good arguers win
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 98.43 104.97 <NA> when they win an argument <unk> what do i win if i convince you that utilitarianism isn 't really the right framework for thinking about ethical
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 104.96 112.96 <NA> <unk> theories <unk> what do we win when we win an argument <unk> even before that what does it matter to me whether you have this this idea that
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 112.72 118.65 <NA> kant 's theory works or or mill is the right ethicist to follow it 's no skin off my back
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 118.45 121.89 <NA> whether you think functionalism is a viable theory of mind <unk> 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 121.76 128.97 <NA> so why do we even try to argue why do we try to convince other people to believe things they don 't want to believe and
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 128.51 129.97 <NA> is that even a nice thing to
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 129.9 135.28 <NA> <unk> do is that a nice way to treat another human being try and make them think something they don 't want to think 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 134.97 136.48 <NA> well 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 136.02 148.52 <NA> my answer is going to make reference to three models for arguments the first model let 's call it the dialectical model is we think of arguments as war <unk> you know what that 's like a lot of screaming and and shouting and winning and losing 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 148.52 150.11 <NA> that 's not a very helpful model
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 150.52 158.67 <NA> <unk> it 's a pretty common and entrenched model for arguing <unk> but there 's a second model for arguing arguments as proofs think of a mathematician 's argument <unk> 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 158.67 162.99 <NA> here 's my argument <unk> does it work is it any good are the premises
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 162.6 168.68 <NA> warranted are the inferences valid <unk> does the conclusion follow from the premises 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 168.31 174.23 <NA> no opposition no adversariality not necessarily any
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 173.8 179.37 <NA> arguing in the adversarial sense <unk> but there 's a third model to keep in mind that i think is
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 180.16 181.53 <NA> and that is
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 181.4 187.87 <NA> arguments as performances arguments <unk> in front of an audience we can think of a politician trying to
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 187.87 196.92 <NA> present a position trying to convince the audience of something <unk> but there 's another twist on this model that i that i really think is important namely that when we argue
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 196.82 204.94 <NA> before an audience sometimes the audience has a more participatory role in the argument <unk> that is arguments are also
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 205.17 213.68 <NA> in front of juries <unk> who make a judgment and decide the case let 's call this the rhetorical model where you have to tailor your argument
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 213.68 219.61 <NA> to the audience at hand <unk> you know presenting a sound well argued tight argument
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 219.18 228.86 <NA> in english before a francophone audience just isn 't going to work so we have these models argument as war argument as proof and argument as performance
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 229.83 234.26 <NA> of those three the argument as war is the dominant one 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 233.98 236.99 <NA> it dominates how we talk about arguments <unk> 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 236.99 243.96 <NA> it dominates how we think about arguments and because of that it shapes how we argue our actual conduct in arguments <unk> 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 243.77 249.96 <NA> now <unk> when we talk about arguments <unk> we talk in a very militaristic language we want strong arguments arguments that have a
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 250.94 257.04 <NA> <unk> arguments that are right on target we want to have our defenses up and our strategies all in order we want
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 256.55 260.94 <NA> killer arguments that 's the kind of argument we want <unk> 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 260.78 267.93 <NA> it is the dominant way of thinking about arguments when i 'm talking about arguments that 's probably what you thought of the adversarial model 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 267.95 277.02 <NA> but the the war metaphor the war paradigm or model for thinking about arguments has i think deforming effects on how we argue <unk> 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 276.62 279.88 <NA> first it elevates tactics over substance
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 280.14 289.48 <NA> <unk> you can take a class in logic argumentation you learn all about the the subterfuges that people use to try and win arguments the false steps <unk> it magnifies the
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 289.47 295.18 <NA> us versus them aspect of it it makes it adversarial <unk> it 's polarizing and
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 294.75 300.02 <NA> the only foreseeable outcomes are triumph glorious triumph
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 301.69 310.19 <NA> <unk> ignominious defeat i think those are deforming effects and worst of all it seems to prevent things like negotiation or deliberation
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 310.19 312.56 <NA> or compromise or
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 312.13 318.17 <NA> collaboration think about that one have you ever entered an argument thinking let 's see if we can
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 317.92 325.07 <NA> hash something out rather than fight it out <unk> what can we work out together i think the argument as war metaphor
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 324.85 329.76 <NA> inhibits those other kinds of resolutions to argumentation and
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 330.19 331.29 <NA> this is really
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 331.01 338.95 <NA> the worst thing arguments don 't seem to get us anywhere they 're dead ends they are like roundabouts or traffic jams or gridlock in
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 338.71 342.03 <NA> conversation we don 't get anywhere
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 342.32 351 <NA> <unk> and one more thing and as an educator this is the one that that really bothers me if argument is war <unk> then there 's an implicit equation of
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 350.81 354.94 <NA> learning with losing and let me explain what i mean
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 355.59 357.58 <NA> suppose you and i
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 357.21 362.23 <NA> have an argument <unk> you believe a proposition p <unk> and i don 't and i say well
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 362.07 368.05 <NA> why do you believe p and you give me your reasons <unk> and i object and say well what about 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 367.74 372.01 <NA> and you answer my objection <unk> and i have a question well what do you mean 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 371.73 374.78 <NA> how does it apply over here and you answer my
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 382.12 384.05 <NA> <unk> and in every case you 've responded
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 383.82 392.24 <NA> to my satisfaction <unk> and so at the end of the day <unk> i say you know what i guess you 're right p 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 391.96 396.27 <NA> so i have a new belief <unk> and it 's not just any belief <unk> it 's
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 404.98 406.74 <NA> who won that argument <unk> 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 407.09 416.26 <NA> well the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won even though i 'm the only one who made any cognitive gain <unk> what did you gain <unk> cognitively 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 416.26 424.9 <NA> from convincing me <unk> sure you got some pleasure out of it maybe your ego stroked <unk> maybe you get some professional status status in the field this guy 's a good arguer
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 429.87 432.55 <NA> <unk> war metaphor forces us into thinking that
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 432.78 435.85 <NA> you 're the winner and i lost even though
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 435.36 444.34 <NA> i gained <unk> and there 's something wrong with that picture <unk> and that 's the picture i really want to want to change if we can so how can we find
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 444.33 446.65 <NA> ways to make arguments
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 446.55 454.97 <NA> yield something positive <unk> what we need is new exit strategies for arguments <unk> but we 're not going to have new exit
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 455.02 457.74 <NA> <unk> strategies for arguments until we have new
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 457.5 465.72 <NA> entry approaches to arguments <unk> we need to think of new kinds of arguments in order to do that well
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 465.72 473.93 <NA> i don 't know how to do that that 's the bad news the argument as war metaphor is just it 's a monster <unk> it 's just taken up
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 473.5 474.96 <NA> habitation in our mind
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 475.37 485.55 <NA> <unk> there 's no magic bullet that 's going to kill it there 's no magic wand that 's going to make it disappear i don 't have an answer <unk> but i have some suggestions <unk> here <unk> 's my my suggestion <unk> 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 485.24 488.89 <NA> if we want to think of new kinds of arguments <unk> what we need to do
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 488.71 492.84 <NA> is think of new kinds of arguers so
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 492.35 497.55 <NA> try this think of all the roles
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 497.21 501.93 <NA> that people play in arguments <unk> there 's the proponent and the opponent
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 501.74 504.88 <NA> in an adversarial dialectical argument <unk> there 's the

DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 510.3 513.79 <NA> all these different roles now can you imagine an argument
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 513.66 521.38 <NA> in which you are the arguer but you 're also in the audience watching yourself argue <unk> can you imagine yourself
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 520.98 525.02 <NA> watching yourself argue losing the argument <unk> and yet
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 531.31 532.4 <NA> <unk> you do that 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 532 541.64 <NA> i think you can and i think if you can imagine that kind of argument where the loser says to the winner and the audience and the jury can say yeah that was a good argument 
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 541.15 545.31 <NA> then you have imagined a good argument <unk> and more than that i think you 've imagined
DanCohen_2013X 1 DanCohen_2013X 545.15 554.16 <NA> a good arguer an arguer that 's worthy of the kind of arguer you should try to be now i lose a lot of arguments
