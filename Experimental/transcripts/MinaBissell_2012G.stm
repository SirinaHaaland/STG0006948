MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 13.09 20.06 <NA> <unk> i don 't usually like cartoons i don 't think many of them are funny i find them weird <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 19.87 23.4 <NA> but i love this cartoon from the new yorker
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 30.23 32.79 <NA> <unk> think outside the box <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 32.6 42 <NA> well i 'm afraid i used to be the cat i always wanted to be outside the box and it 's partly because
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 41.51 54.37 <NA> i came to this field from a different background chemist and a bacterial geneticist so what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer sources of cancer
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 55.02 64.45 <NA> <unk> for that matter why you are who you are didn 't make sense so let me quickly try and tell you why i thought that and how i went about it 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 64.5 73.82 <NA> so to begin with <unk> however <unk> i have to give you a very very quick lesson in developmental biology 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 73.82 77.9 <NA> with apologies to those of you who know some biology 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 77.66 79.91 <NA> so when your mom and dad met
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 79.93 85.5 <NA> there is a fertilized egg that round thing with that little blip 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 85.5 92.19 <NA> it grows and then it grows and then it makes this handsome man 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 93.22 99.47 <NA> so <unk> this guy with all the cells in his body 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 99.34 104.97 <NA> all have the same genetic information <unk> so how did his nose
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 105.05 113.07 <NA> <unk> become his nose his elbow his elbow and why doesn 't he get up one morning and have his nose turn into his foot <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 113.07 122.31 <NA> it could <unk> it has the genetic information you all remember dolly it came from a single mammary cell so why doesn 't it do it 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 121.97 127.06 <NA> so have a guess of how many cells he has in his body
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 130.31 136.87 <NA> trillion to seventy trillion cells in his body trillion now
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 136.77 144.1 <NA> how did these cells all with the same genetic material make all those tissues <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 143.64 154.61 <NA> and so the question i raised before becomes even more interesting if you thought about the enormity of this in every one of your bodies
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 155.25 164.57 <NA> the dominant cancer theory would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cancer cell and it would make you
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 164.34 166.61 <NA> a cancer victim <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 166.51 174.96 <NA> well this did not make sense to me do you even know how a trillion looks now let 's look at
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 188.9 196.59 <NA> <unk> got cancer you will be a lump of cancer <unk> you will have cancer all over you and you 're not why not <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 196.43 204.97 <NA> so i decided over the years because of a series of experiments that this is because of context
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 205.16 207.46 <NA> and architecture 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 207.15 213.97 <NA> and let me quickly tell you some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 213.54 220.99 <NA> to begin with i came to work with this virus that causes that ugly tumor in the chicken <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 220.68 225.08 <NA> rous discovered this in one thousand nine hundred and eleven it was the first
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 233.08 239.92 <NA> <unk> he made a filtrate he took this filter which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 239.93 244.32 <NA> and he injected it to another chicken <unk> and he got another tumor <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 244.11 249.96 <NA> so scientists were very excited and they said a single oncogene can do it all you need is
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 251.72 262.77 <NA> <unk> put the cells in cultures chicken cells dumped the virus on it and it would pile up and they would say this is malignant and this is normal and again this didn 't make sense to me 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 262.37 268.65 <NA> so for various reasons <unk> we took this oncogene <unk> attached it to a blue marker <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 268.16 275.2 <NA> and we injected it into the embryos now look at that there is that beautiful feather in the embryo
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 275.58 284.17 <NA> <unk> every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell <unk> and they 're part of the feather 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 283.98 297.94 <NA> so when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish <unk> we got a mass of blue cells so in the chicken you get a tumor in the embryo you don 't you dissociate you put it in a dish <unk> you get another tumor <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 297.94 299.72 <NA> what does that mean 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 300 303.2 <NA> <unk> means that microenvironment
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 302.77 307.25 <NA> and the context which surrounds those cells
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 306.82 313.7 <NA> actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 313.39 321.8 <NA> now <unk> let 's take a normal example <unk> the normal example let 's take the human mammary gland i work on breast cancer so
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 321.43 329.97 <NA> here is a lovely human breast and many of you know how it looks except that inside that breast <unk> there are all these pretty
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 329.93 333.18 <NA> <unk> developing tree like structures 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 332.81 343 <NA> so we decided that what we like to do is take just a bit of that mammary gland which is called an acinus where there are all these little things
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 342.95 354.58 <NA> <unk> inside the breast where the milk goes and the end of the nipple comes through that little tube when the baby sucks <unk> and we said wonderful look at this pretty structure
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 355.05 365.38 <NA> <unk> want to make this a structure and ask the question how do the cells do that so we took the red cells you see the red cells are surrounded by blue <unk>
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 365.33 375.14 <NA> other cells that squeeze them and behind it is material that people thought was mainly inert <unk> and it was just having a structure to keep
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 375.81 381.66 <NA> and so we first photographed it with the electron microscope years and years ago <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 381.48 391.73 <NA> and you see this cell is actually quite pretty <unk> it has a bottom it has a top <unk> it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk because it just came from an <unk>
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 391.68 399.09 <NA> early pregnant mouse <unk> you take these cells you put them in a dish <unk> and within three days they look like that 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 401.9 407.13 <NA> <unk> you take them out <unk> you put them in a dish <unk> they don 't make milk <unk> they completely forget 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 406.93 417.21 <NA> for example here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk on the left there is nothing on the right look at the nuclei the nuclei in the <unk>
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 417.11 424.35 <NA> <unk> cell on the left is in the animal <unk> the one on the right is in a dish <unk> they are completely different from each other 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 429.95 437.53 <NA> overrides in different contexts cells do different things but how does context signal <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 437.22 442.33 <NA> so einstein said that for an idea
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 441.93 451.3 <NA> that does not first seem insane there is no hope so you can imagine the amount of
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 450.9 454.94 <NA> skepticism i received couldn 't get money
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 454.87 465.08 <NA> <unk> couldn 't do a whole lot of other things but i 'm so glad it all worked out so we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse <unk> and all those lovely acini are <unk>
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 464.98 475.11 <NA> <unk> there every one of those with the red around them are an acinus and we said okay <unk> we are going to try and make this <unk> and i said
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 475.43 477.13 <NA> <unk> that red stuff
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 476.95 487.18 <NA> around the acinus that people think there 's just a structural scaffold maybe it has information <unk> maybe it tells the cells what to do maybe it tells the
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 487.13 497.43 <NA> <unk> nucleus what to do so i said extracellular matrix which is this stuff called ecm <unk> signals and actually tells the cells what to do 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 504.84 515.52 <NA> <unk> extracellular matrix in it we put the cells in it and lo and behold in about four days they got reorganized and on the right is what we can make in culture 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 515.53 528.94 <NA> on the left is what 's inside the animal we call it in vivo and the one in culture was full of milk the lovely red there is full of milk so we got milk for the american audience 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 528.51 529.88 <NA> all right
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 529.87 538.94 <NA> <unk> and here is this beautiful human cell <unk> and you can imagine that here also <unk> context goes 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 538.48 547.37 <NA> so what do we do now <unk> i made a radical hypothesis <unk> i said if it 's true that
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 546.97 552.47 <NA> architecture is dominant architecture
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 552.19 554.94 <NA> restored to a cancer cell
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 555.19 561.96 <NA> should make the cancer cell think it 's normal could this be done so we tried it 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 561.68 569.43 <NA> in order to do that however <unk> we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 568.94 574.93 <NA> and on the left is the single normal cell human breast put
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 576.09 586.42 <NA> <unk> gooey gel that has extracellular matrix it makes all these beautiful structures <unk> on the right you see it looks very ugly the cells continue to grow the normal ones <unk>
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 586.37 594.37 <NA> stop <unk> and you see here in higher magnification the normal acinus and the ugly tumor 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 604.78 608.93 <NA> <unk> messed up and make them to the level of the normal <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 608.5 616.89 <NA> well <unk> it was wonderful boggles my mind this is what we got we can revert
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 616.71 618.38 <NA> the malignant phenotype 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 621.04 624.9 <NA> and in order to show you that the malignant phenotype i
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 625.1 637.95 <NA> <unk> just choose one here are little movies sort of fuzzy <unk> but you see that on the left are the malignant cells all of them are malignant we add one single inhibitor
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 637.95 649.93 <NA> in the beginning <unk> and look what happens they all look like that we inject them into the mouse the ones on the right <unk> and none of them would make tumors <unk> we inject the other ones in the
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 652.23 661.27 <NA> <unk> new way of thinking about cancer it 's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer <unk> we should be able to be dealing with these things at this level 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 660.78 671.23 <NA> and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and <unk>
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 671.13 676.61 <NA> <unk> that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 680.04 681.68 <NA> and function

MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 729.93 743.65 <NA> <unk> shown that there 's little pieces of dna on the specific genes of the mammary gland that actually respond to extracellular matrix it has taken many years but it has been very rewarding <unk> 
MinaBissell_2012G 1 MinaBissell_2012G 743.25 753.01 <NA> and before i get to the next slide <unk> i have to tell you that there are so many additional discoveries to be made
