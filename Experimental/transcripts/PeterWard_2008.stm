PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 965.85 970.3 <NA> 'm then thrown in an ice pond <unk> i 'm cooled fifteen degrees lower
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 970.17 975.02 <NA> and i could be taken to a critical care hospital <unk> and the reason i could do that
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 975 984.35 <NA> because we mammals have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events and our bodies have adapted <unk> and we can now use this as what i think will be a major medical breakthrough <unk> 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 984.55 994.55 <NA> this is mark roth he was funded by darpa tried to figure out how to save americans after battlefield injuries he bleeds out pigs he puts in eighty parts per <unk>
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 994.45 1000.26 <NA> <unk> million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1000 1001.97 <NA> <unk> mammal into a reptile 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1001.48 1010.34 <NA> i believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s i got this email from him two years ago he said 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1009.88 1013.13 <NA> i think i 've got an answer to some of your questions 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1012.85 1018.42 <NA> so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1018.42 1024.98 <NA> and these are brand new data he sent me on the way over here on the top now <unk> that is a temperature record of a mouse
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1024.7 1029.07 <NA> who has gone through the dotted line the temperatures so the temperature starts at
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1030.05 1033.78 <NA> <unk> and down it goes down it goes six hours later up goes the temperature 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1033.62 1040.44 <NA> now the same mouse is given eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1040.44 1046.95 <NA> and look what happens to its temperature its temperature drops it goes down to fifteen degrees centigrade from <unk>
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1048.2 1054.97 <NA> and comes out of this perfectly fine here is a way we can get people to critical care here 's how we
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1054.96 1059.17 <NA> <unk> can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1059.25 1064.09 <NA> now you 're all thinking <unk> yeah what about the brain tissue <unk> 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1064.02 1075.05 <NA> and so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen you 're in an accident you 've got two choices you 're going to die or you 're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and say seventy five percent of you is saved
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1075.76 1080.12 <NA> <unk> what are you going to do do we all have to have a little button saying let me die <unk> 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1080.29 1086.66 <NA> this is coming towards us and i think this is going to be a revolution we 're going to save lives <unk> but there 's going to be a cost to it 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1086.66 1095.39 <NA> the new view of mass extinctions is yes we were hit and yes we have to think about the long term because we will get hit again <unk> but there 's a far worse danger confronting us 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1094.96 1104.19 <NA> we can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world give us a few millennia and we humans should last those few millennia will it happen again if we continue
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1105.38 1107.7 <NA> how many of us flew here 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1108.02 1116.31 <NA> how many of us have gone through our entire kyoto quota just for flying this year how many of you have exceeded
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1115.82 1125.08 <NA> it yeah i 've certainly exceeded it we have a huge problem facing us as a species we have to beat this i want to be able to go back
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1134.49 1138.05 <NA> <unk> am i understanding you right that what you 're saying here is that we have

PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1141.29 1143.75 <NA> to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1143.57 1148.04 <NA> proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change peter ward yeah
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1148.04 1154.97 <NA> every single cell in us can produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises <unk> this is what roth has found out
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1154.93 1164.51 <NA> <unk> what we 're looking at now <unk> does it leave a signal does it leave a signal in bone or in plant and we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past ca 
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1164.11 1166.17 <NA> it 's simultaneously
PeterWard_2008 1 PeterWard_2008 1165.99 1168.78 <NA> an incredible medical technique but also a terrifying
