IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 155.1 161.5 <NA> by jose saramago called seeing but in my view it very well captures
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 161.51 168.66 <NA> part of the problem that we have with democracy in europe these days on one level nobody 's questioning

IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 260.31 262.5 <NA> so basically i want to ask 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 262.1 265.18 <NA> what went right and what went wrong
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 264.82 273.94 <NA> in these fifty years when we talk about democracy and i 'll start with what went right and the first thing that went right
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 273.94 278.38 <NA> was of course these five revolutions which in my view very much
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 279.99 284.8 <NA> <unk> we 're living and deepened our democratic experience <unk> and the first was the cultural and social revolution <unk>
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 286.34 293.13 <NA> and sixty eight and 1970s which put the individual at the center of politics it was the human rights moment 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 293.13 298.57 <NA> basically this was also a major outbreak a culture of dissent a culture of

IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 302.62 312.32 <NA> so i do believe that even things like that are very much the children of ' sixty eight nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 311.95 319.86 <NA> but after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s and nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it the truth is
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 319.7 325.2 <NA> that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message the government does not know better
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 331.58 337.29 <NA> <unk> the end of communism <unk> the end of the cold war and it was the birth of the global world and you have

IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 352.17 356.65 <NA> <unk> and i 'm going to name one more revolution and this is the revolution in brain sciences 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 356.65 363.17 <NA> which totally changed the way we understand how people are making decisions <unk> so this is
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 362.69 370.63 <NA> what went right <unk> but if we 're going to see what went wrong we 're going to end up with the same five revolutions
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 370.65 374.96 <NA> <unk> because first you have the 1960s and 1970s cultural and social
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 375.7 379.76 <NA> <unk> which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose

IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 391.3 400.14 <NA> under attack <unk> and it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 401.9 403.29 <NA> <unk> and you have
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 403.01 412.12 <NA> the market revolution of the 1980s and the huge increase of inequality in societies <unk> remember
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 413.5 416.98 <NA> the spread of democracy has always been accompanied
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 416.98 424.53 <NA> by the decline of inequality <unk> the more democratic our societies have been the more
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 425.25 433.78 <NA> <unk> they have been becoming now we have the reverse tendency <unk> the spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality <unk> 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 433.68 439.12 <NA> and i find this very much disturbing when we 're talking about

IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 442.79 449.9 <NA> and if you go to one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine something that basically you don 't expect that anybody 's going to criticize but many are going to tell
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 450.58 452.54 <NA> <unk> it was the end of the cold war

IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 468.59 474.87 <NA> 're very mobile you cannot tax them and basically they don 't fear the people <unk> so as a result of it you have this
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 475 476.55 <NA> <unk> very strange situation
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 476.38 482.19 <NA> in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters so this is not by accident
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 482.19 491.92 <NA> that the voters are not interested to vote anymore <unk> and when we talk about the internet <unk> yes it 's true the internet connected all of us but we also know
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 491.74 504.97 <NA> that the internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to and it 's becoming more and more difficult to understand the people who are

IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 517.53 525.35 <NA> this is also partly a result of the internet revolution this is the other side of the things that we like <unk> and when you go to the brain sciences
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 525.85 530.63 <NA> <unk> what political consultants learned from the brain scientists is
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 530.38 537.74 <NA> don 't talk to me about ideas anymore don 't talk to me about policy programs what really matters is
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 537.51 540.89 <NA> basically to manipulate the emotions of the people 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 541.15 549.87 <NA> and you have this very strongly to the extent that even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days these revolutions are not
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 550 551.52 <NA> <unk> named anymore
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 551.12 564.27 <NA> around ideologies or ideas before revolutions used to have ideological names they could be communist they could be liberal they could be fascist or islamic now the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used

IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 569.83 574.81 <NA> the problem is the media i 'm saying this because one of my major points is
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 574.65 576.55 <NA> what went right
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 576.37 579.97 <NA> is also what went wrong <unk> and when we 're now

IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 588.05 594.55 <NA> because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 594.33 596.32 <NA> these days it 's very

IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 611.01 620.39 <NA> trust in politics you believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 619.9 626.63 <NA> it 's going to be more difficult for them to steal and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 626.29 629.97 <NA> this is probably true <unk> but i do believe that we
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 629.93 632.07 <NA> <unk> should be also very clear
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 631.76 635.05 <NA> that now when we put the transparency
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 634.87 640.74 <NA> at the center of politics where the message is it 's transparency stupid 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 640.31 648.48 <NA> transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions <unk> transparency is politics ' management of mistrust 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 648.71 654.97 <NA> we are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust <unk> and by the way mistrust was always
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 654.93 659.99 <NA> <unk> very important for democracy this is why you have checks and balances this is why basically you have
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 659.75 668.09 <NA> all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent <unk> but when politics is only
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 668.09 671.66 <NA> management of mistrust then i 'm very glad that
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 679.96 689.24 <NA> <unk> going to be we being the big brother watching the political class <unk> but is this the idea of a free society for example can you imagine
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 688.96 694.77 <NA> that decent <unk> civic <unk> talented people are going to run for office
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 694.77 699.74 <NA> if they really do believe that politics is also about managing mistrust 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 700.55 703.23 <NA> <unk> are you not afraid with all these technologies
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 703.06 708.96 <NA> that are going to track down any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 708.96 714.43 <NA> are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians to repeat
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 714.27 728.44 <NA> their positions <unk> even the very wrong positions <unk> because consistency is going to be more important than common sense and the americans who are in the room are you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern on the basis of what they said in the primary elections
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 729.96 735.73 <NA> <unk> i find this extremely important because democracy is about people changing their views
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 735.5 742.45 <NA> based on rational arguments and discussions and we can lose this with the very noble idea
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 742.45 749.89 <NA> to keep people accountable for showing the people that we 're not going to tolerate politicians the opportunism in politics <unk> 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 750 753.96 <NA> so for me this is extremely important and i do believe that when we 're discussing
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 753.78 757.5 <NA> politics these days probably it makes sense
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 757.32 760.91 <NA> to look also at this type of a story 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 760.51 764.49 <NA> but also don 't forget any unveiling is also veiling [ regardless of
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 764.28 770.33 <NA> ] how transparent our governments want to be they 're going to be selectively transparent 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 770.33 776.52 <NA> in a small country that could be my country but could be also your country <unk> they took a decision it is a real case story
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 776.29 779.04 <NA> that all of the governmental decisions

IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 790.97 800.13 <NA> so i had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister why he made this decision he said listen <unk> this is the best way to keep the mouths of my ministers closed <unk> 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 801.44 804.97 <NA> because it 's going to be very difficult for them to dissent knowing

IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 808.83 821.56 <NA> and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis so when we talk about transparency when we talk about openness i really do believe that what we should keep in mind is that what went right is what went wrong <unk> 
IvanKrastev_2012G 1 IvanKrastev_2012G 821.56 828.49 <NA> and this is goethe who is neither bulgarian nor a political scientist some centuries ago he said
